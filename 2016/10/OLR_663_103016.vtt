00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, after complete silence, some tweets rock Hello Games

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
And are you ready to wait until 2017 for more info on Nintendo Switch?

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
All this and more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 663

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
For this, October the 30th of 2016, my name is Rob Roberts

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
Joining you live from our studio to talk about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
And with me this week, say hello, as always, to Tech Master Loki

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hello

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Fine

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
So, Halloween's tomorrow

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Are you going to be taking the kids out for trick or treating and all that?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yes, I will be

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
What are you dressing up as?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm not dressing up as anything

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
What? Have you got that? Are you too old for Halloween? Is that what's happened?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
No, I just overdid it last year, so I'm not doing anything this year

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, you overdid it last year?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah, because I stayed up for 24 hours straight to make that Lego Deadpool costume

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
That's right, I remember that, oh yeah, okay, so you earned your year off

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah, so I'm taking the year off

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
But unfortunately, no tingle, 14 years in a row

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
I wanted to get one of those inflatable T-Rex costumes that are the rage on the internet

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I see a lot of those, yeah

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
So that would have been fun

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
I think I saw some picture of an inflatable T-Rex riding a T-Rex at some, like, theme park or something, I don't know

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
That would be funny

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
That would be hilarious

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
You mentioned real quick, I mean, you might be gonna talk about this in your gaming week, I suppose, but I'm gonna bring it up now

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
You mentioned you were at a social gathering last night

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
As, you know, the interesting thing with Halloween being on a Monday this year

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
There was Halloween parties Friday night, Halloween parties Saturday night

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
There's probably some Halloween parties tonight

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And then there's actual Halloween on Monday

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
So, I know you went to a social gathering and you were doing the PlayStation VR

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
How was that received in a party type setting?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
It's alright, I mean, there was some people that wanted to try it

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Mostly the people that have already tried it before

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Xtafur got to try it for the first time

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
So, of course, the first one you had to have him play was Kitchen

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Which is Resident Evil 7, basically

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
I don't know why they call it, I guess Kitchen was the working name before they revealed it

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
The Kitchen demo, but that was funny, watching him jump

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I didn't make it, like, five seconds to that demo

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Like, the very first gory thing that happened, I noped the fuck out of that demo

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I did

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And then I set up Rush of Blood

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Which you've really been raving about that game

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah, I love that game

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
So, we played, or I had

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Was it Flocko Jones play

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
It was one of the levels in there

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
With, like, a witch thing that, like, fires crows at you or something

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
And so there was a few moments, like, there was

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
That's also the one that has, like, kind of the Silent Hill type room

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Where there's these mannequins that will

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
You look away from them, they move

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, that type of thing

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
So, that was funny

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Just watching him, you know, jump at all the jump scares and stuff

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, I don't like jump scares, I don't do it

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, I always find them hilarious

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
It didn't necessarily scare me, I just kind of laugh at them

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
It's kind of fun

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Fair enough

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
But it's a fun game, though

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Alright, well not joining us tonight, of course, Dark Sakura

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
She is still on leave from the show

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
But she will hopefully be, actually, I think we're going to hear from her

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
In a couple of weeks

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I know she's planning on being here for episode 666

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And we're going to be taping 665 in advance

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And I think she's going to be here for that

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
So, yeah, we'll have Dark Sakura back in the studio real soon

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I know she misses you all, but her aim is improving

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
But if you are listening live, of course

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
You should join us in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Even though Bobby was also off tonight

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Halloween is just throwing everything off

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Just throwing off everybody's rhythm

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
But a big hello to those of you that are in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Stoppy, I think, talking about work on Monday

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Saying in chat, I have some co-workers who are going to dress up

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
News to me, I thought they were dressing up as something all year

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, they're trying to find an apartment

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I'm not even that young, but it's a bunch of older people

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
And they always want to like, okay, the whole floor is going to do a theme

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm like, fuck that

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Because it's always some lame ass theme

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Like, you know, the last time, last year it was

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Oh, we're all going to dress up like celebrities

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm like, fuck that, I'm dressing up as Lego Deadpool

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Which is sort of a celebrity

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Sort of a celebrity

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
But this year they're doing like 80s musicians

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm like, no, no

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm not going to do it

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Hey, you can't talk until I introduce you

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Let's say hello

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
We have some other folks in the studio

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
So I should probably introduce them

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Because clearly they have something to say

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So we have a couple other people joining us tonight

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I'll start over here because this guy's here every week

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
So he's nothing special

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Say hello to Shane, everybody

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
He's joining us here

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm not holding up my mic near my mouth

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Shane is protesting but not holding the mic near his mouth

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Well, then I can't ask you about your shiny collection

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And supposedly, what, you got to 100 shinies, right?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah, I got to my 100 shinies

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
What was your 100th shiny that you got on Pokemon?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
What was it?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Hello

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm thinking

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
You don't know?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I would have thought this was a landmark occasion

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
That you would celebrate

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But it was like days ago

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
So, I'm trying to remember, I got that

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
You know the old saying, you never forget your 100th Pokemon

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
It was some sort of fished-up Pokemon

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I know that much

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh, so you did use the fish trick

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, for the last three I did fishing

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I was just like, screw it, I'm going to do that

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Okay, okay

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Alright, so we'll just say Magikarp

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Because you don't know

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
No, it wasn't a Magikarp

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I already had that

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It wouldn't have mattered

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Alright, well congratulations

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Congratulations on a 100 shiny Pokemon

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Thank you

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I'm not sure what else to ask you about

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Solidarity is our guest

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Nope, that's fine

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Alright, so I'm brand new to the show

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Has never been here in studio before

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
But I know it's been listening for a little while

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Say hello everybody, welcome to the show tonight

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
JD?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Hi there

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Hi, how are you?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Pretty good

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Good, welcome to the show

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Thank you

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So, video games, you play them, right?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I sure do

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Good, you're at the right place

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
But you, we were talking a little bit beforehand

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Because I was asking if you'd played like Thumper on PlayStation 4

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
But you don't really own new consoles, right?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
You're still rocking the classics?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, I mean, I keep up with stuff on Steam

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
So when stuff goes on sale, I pick things up

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
But yeah, I mean, my most recent consoles are a Wii and a PS2

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
So, so old school stuff?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
A little bit, at this point it's old school stuff?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I mean, it's weird to me to think of it like that

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
But yeah, it is

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
So do you consider yourself more of a PC gamer then

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
If you're keeping up with stuff mostly on Steam?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah, I mean, I also, I play Guild Wars 2 a lot

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
So that's definitely a current title

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
But yeah, I would say the new stuff coming out, I'm a PC gamer

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay, nice

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Which is pretty much safe at this point

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Because most of the games that come out nowadays that are worth getting are on PC

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
That is really true

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
You know, well, Microsoft has their whole thing with, you know, Xbox One

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And like Windows 10 is like one platform, basically

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
And you buy a game one place, you get them on both

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
So I mean, you know, what, like Forza Horizon 3 you should be able to get on PC, right?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I just, I'm behind, I still haven't picked up that game

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I almost did today, Shane tried

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, there was a lot of like deals trying to be made, but

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Okay, so here's the problem

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm at Target, which is having the whole buy two, get one free video game thing

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
And for some reason, Shane has decided that I need to take advantage of this deal

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I don't know what he gets out of it, but he's just

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I was just bored

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
He's just decided he wants to watch me drop $100 on video games

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
So

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
It'd be like $120 plus tax, because games are $60

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Fine, fine

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
But here's the problem, is I wanted to get, I was like

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Alright, I'll get Forza Horizon 3, that's obvious

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I'll get that one, because I need to get that still

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
I'll get Skyrim Special Edition, why not? I'm curious enough

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, I would be all over that on Xbox One

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm kind of hesitant on PlayStation 4

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Well I do have an Xbox One, and so I'd probably pick it up over there

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Just because of the whole modding situation

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
So okay, fine, those two, but then I couldn't figure out a third game that I want

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Right, that I didn't already have

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Now that's the problem guys, it's the one that I didn't already have

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Because you could say, oh Civ 6 just came out, well I already bought that

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I bought that before the sale happened

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
And usually, you know, I'm pretty good to myself

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
When a new game comes out that I want, I get it

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
So I didn't really have three games in the backlog to get

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
World of Final Fantasy?

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Shane had suggested that, but I'm sorry

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
That demo did not sway me on the game

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
And even when we were watching people play it on Twitch, I wasn't feeling it

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm not feeling World of Final Fantasy, I'm sorry to say

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I'll be all over Final Fantasy 15 when that comes out

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
But that's not part of the sale, so that's an issue isn't it?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Over in chat at live.fognetwork.com, Alan Alchemy says

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Shane, spend money, give me your credit card, Skye

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
No, yeah it sometimes goes like that

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Well actually it was JD that came up with a brilliant idea on how to make this work

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
JD suggested, well why don't you buy the two games

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
And then get that third free game and then sell it to Shane

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
And I was like, okay, I'm liking this idea

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
We'll split the cost

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
And then they had a fight about how to split the cost, so it didn't happen

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Then we had a fight about how to split the cost

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Because Shane was like, hell yeah, I'll take a free game

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And I'm like, wait a minute, it doesn't work like that

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
This is not me buying two games, so you get the free game

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
But then I offered up, I have Forza Horizon 3

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
On a demo, or not a demo, but a code

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
And I haven't used it yet, so I offered that up for the free game

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Yes, but the problem is, when he offered up Forza Horizon 3

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I said, great, now we're back to the same problem

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I'll buy Skyrim, and then what?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I still don't have another game to get

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
So, then we fought in the middle of Target for a good 30 minutes

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And JD had to watch all this, and it was really awkward

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
But, you know, welcome to my life, JD

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
It was funny

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
So, JD, you play the PC stuff and you play some of the classic consoles

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
You could have gotten Paper Mario

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
You know, that was suggested, and that was probably the closest

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Where I was like, I might pick up Paper Mario

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
But for some reason, I didn't see it in the Wii U section, did you?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I don't think I even looked for it

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't even think I saw it

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Isn't it a 3DS game?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
No

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Oh, okay, that's a Wii U game

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Well, I mean, it's very similar to the last 3DS game

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Shut up

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
But you've talked about, now we'll talk about the Switch later on tonight

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And obviously there was a whole lot of Switch talk last week

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
But JD, you're feeling the Switch announcement, right?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah, no, I'm really looking forward to it

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I mean, especially with the handheld capability

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Because I started out, when I started on consoles, I started with the Game Boy

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
So, I mean, I've been playing handhelds for a long time

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
So I'm looking forward to seeing, you know, a more powerful handheld

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
So I know another reason that, you know, you've started listening to OLR

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
And gotten to know us and everything is that you are a big fan of music games, right?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
That's right

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
So tell us, like, how did the music game thing, let's do a throwback episode tonight

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh, wow

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
How did the music game thing start? Like, what was your first music game? Was it DDR?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah, so I started with DDR

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Yeah, which mix?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
It was Fifth Mix

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Fifth Mix

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Which is still one of my favorites

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Uh-huh

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
I mean, they, anyway, there's a lot of Dance Mania songs on there

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
And just all of the licensing that they did in the earlier era of DDR was a lot of fun

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Were you one of those people posting on DDR Freak back in the day, like some of us?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Every so often

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Every so often? Awesome

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
What was your username on there, JD?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I don't even know if it's still there

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
I'm just curious if I was like, did I ever see him when I was, I never asked you this, like what was your name there?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I was Sky, that's why I still

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
I mean, this is ages ago, but I think my username was GameBoyGuy13

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Okay, wow, okay, that's old school

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Right?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Okay, I think I remember you under that name listening to this show

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Oh my god

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I think I do, I think I do, name sounds familiar

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
This really is a throwback episode

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I know, I know

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
So, okay, so you started on DDR Fifth Mix, and then, so what other music games, so do you buy the, like you said you have PlayStation 2

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
So do you buy all the, because they stopped making Mania 2DX during the PlayStation 2 era, do you import all that stuff?

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah, so I have the home version copies of the 2DX titles and the DDR ones

12:41.000 --> 12:50.000
I used to have a PS1 because a lot of the DDR titles were only, the earlier ones up through Fifth Mix were only released on PlayStation in Japan

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
So, when I was in high school I had them, but I don't anymore for various reasons

12:55.000 --> 13:03.000
But, yeah, mostly I just have a 2DX, because I have a US Konami controller for the 2DX

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
And I have, I don't have DDR pads anymore, they didn't survive a cross-country move

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
So, I've been, you know, it's on my to-do list is to pick up a new pad, so, and get it home set up

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
You grew up in Orlando

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
That's right

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And then you, did you live in Kansas?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
No, I went to college in the Central Valley

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Okay, and then you, now you live in San Francisco

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
That's right

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Okay, so that was your cross-country, got it

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yep

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Got it, got it

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
Okay, let's see, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, Fifth is a good place to start, though you miss out on Fourth Plus

13:34.000 --> 13:41.000
There was a Fourth Plus arcade machine, like when I was going out and about in Orlando, and Rocky's Replay was the name of the place

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
And they had Fourth Plus for a long time, so when I would go out, you know, with my friends and go play DDR, that was one of the places I'd go

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
So I got very familiar with Fourth Plus

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
Now one thing I find kind of interesting is that, you know, Loki, myself, DarkSakura, we kind of, I don't want to say we stopped playing DDR

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Oh yep, I'm playing tons of DDR

13:57.000 --> 14:08.000
But we kind of, we kind of, like, we kind of did, like it's one of those things though, but like obviously now with the round one, kind of having these arcade games that I used to be really into in my 20s, kind of making a resurgence again

14:08.000 --> 14:16.000
And like the types of arcades I was into 10 years ago, 15 years ago when the show started, like now that that's making a resurgence, I'm kind of into it again

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
But otherwise, I don't usually like seek out DDR machines, but you do, right? You still like regularly go to arcades and play DDR, right?

14:22.000 --> 14:30.000
Not as regularly as I'd like to, because there aren't really any convenient to me, and I think that's, you know, a sign of there not being as many arcades anymore as there used to be

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
I mean, I have to still use website databases to find them, I'm not just going to randomly run across a machine

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Have you checked out Ace yet in Dave and Busters?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh I forget it's a Dave and Busters, that's another thing in Roseville, JD

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
We were talking earlier about how all of the fun stuff is in Roseville, apparently

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
But then I'm like, but Roseville isn't fun, like Roseville will shut down at 10 o'clock and then, now it sucks

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
So it's just funny, we were like, we could go to Dunkin Donuts, oh it's in Roseville, we go to Golf Land, it's in Roseville, Mongolian Roseville

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Everything's in fucking Roseville

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
They have Krispy Kreme in there open 24 hours

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
That's true, they have pumpkin spice donuts this week too, it was amazing

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
Anyway, I could talk about food all night long, but we should probably take the healthier option and continue talking about DDR

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
We could talk about food gaming

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Food gaming? What's food gaming?

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
Well there's various games about food, I mean there's Cooking Mama, there's Cook Serve Delicious, all sorts of fun stuff

15:18.000 --> 15:26.000
There was one guy I saw a YouTube video of playing Overwatch with a controller made out of bananas through Arduino

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
So that's food gaming

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I guess, I guess that's a type of food gaming

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Or we could just have a 100 second kitchen battle

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I see what you did there

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
Are you one of those guys that drops the names of songs into conversations and goes, get it?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Wasn't that a meme a while ago?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It was a LiveJournal community

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
Oh god, so LiveJournal, you have had your life changed by LiveJournal just like the rest of us

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh yeah

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, oh man, I met Alan on LiveJournal and Orange Lounge Radio probably still has a LiveJournal community

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I don't remember the last time it was updated

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I don't even remember what it was

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
It was either Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
You couldn't get OLR?

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I don't think we got OLR, no I think it was probably Taken or something

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
So yeah, awesome

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
So I'm not sure what else to ask you about

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
So you go to arcades and you play sometimes DDR but not as often as you used to

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Ever since Playland Japan opened in Japantown a couple years ago

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I've gone there and they have a popin music machine

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
In Orlando you couldn't find popin anywhere

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
And now that I'm in the Bay Area it's a lot easier to find

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
And so I've started playing popin a bit

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
But you have yet to, even though you're in the Bay Area, you have yet to go to any of these round ones

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Right, because I live in San Francisco, I don't have a car

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
And all of these round ones are way out on the edges of the area

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
So it's impossible to get to on transit

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
So just so you know, I brought up our LiveJournal community

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Which is at orangelounge.livejournal.com

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
And the last entry we made was Sunday, June 21st, 2009

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh wow

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
And that was, the announcement there was

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
The new URL to find OLR is at radio.allgames.com

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Because that must have been the date that we flipped over to AllGames from Live 365

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
So, which was our home before we were here at VOG Network

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
So, just kind of funny that that's the last time the LiveJournal community was used

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Although that's a pretty important update

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
I should probably make an update that says, just in case you were looking here

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, I think they have another show on now, Sundays at 6

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Which is fine, I'm sure it's a fine show, but we've moved somewhere else

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh, LiveJournal

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
I don't know what's going on on LiveJournal anymore

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh no they didn't, community, right?

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
I think, oh no they didn't, it's probably the only thing going on on LiveJournal right now

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
And Russian chat

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Well, okay, yeah, there's definitely, there's always been a large Russian community on LiveJournal

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
But it's mostly taken over the site because of ownership changes

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Hmm

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Pokemon collectors on LiveJournal, it's really active

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
So I guess there's still the communities, some of the communities still have a presence over there

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
But I kind of, I kind of miss LiveJournal in some ways

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
We were talking about this a little bit, is that

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
You know, I know Facebook I think kind of killed it for a lot of people

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
Because with Facebook it was so easy from your mobile phone to post pictures, to post other things

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
But Facebook, it sucks, like I don't know how else to put it

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Like it's one of those necessary things I have to do

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It's so full of garbage right now

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
It is so full of garbage

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
But it sucks because I feel that honestly, if I didn't check Facebook

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
I would not know that like some of my friends are expecting kids or getting married or things like that

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Like I would miss that if I did not have Facebook now

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Exactly, and I didn't check that and then when I had to help them move

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I was like, oh, you're having a baby, okay

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, right

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
I mean, I even find out about family stuff from Facebook sometimes

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
Like, you know, it's, people use it, but that's all they use

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
But the problem with Facebook is that it's not chronological

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
You can miss things, you know

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Exactly

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Even if you're reading the site

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
You have to have, he can sort it with the top stories

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Or he can do chronological

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Chronological is default

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
And then Facebook's like, fuck you, we want ad revenue

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
We're gonna fuck that sorting shit all up

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And it's just gonna shuffle everything

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And, yeah

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah, it's rough, it's rough

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
And thank you Alex P. Carson in chat says

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
OMG, I love Rob on Facebook

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Well, I don't post, like, I wouldn't dare post

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
I don't know, I feel like maybe I have gotten political

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
political stuff is, like, gay rights stuff

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Which, you know, you're not gonna dare speak up on my Facebook

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
anti that stuff, right?

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
But I think I've tried very hard not to dip my toe into the whole

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
like, presidential race

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Because, like, I just, I fucking can't

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Like, there's enough of it everywhere else on Facebook

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
So instead, I like to post things like

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I think just this past week

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
It was announced that ABBA is doing something in 2017

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
They're not reuniting, but they might be

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
And yes, OMG, I can fucking tie ABBA to gaming this week

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
This is the best week ever since SingStar ABBA came out

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Oh, that's been out for a while

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
I know, right?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But when has ABBA been in games?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
And so, ok, but this week they announced that ABBA's gonna be doing something

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And it sounds like it might be a VR type of experience

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Or it could be, it may be AR

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
And, like, part of, like, they obviously aren't releasing a lot of details

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And they're not going to till next year

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
But one of the things that crossed my mind was this whole hologram thing

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Like, remember when Tupac was at Coachella a couple years ago?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Remember that?

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
Or if Jamie was here, I'm sure she would talk about gorillas when they play live

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Or Hatsune Miku

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
You people, I'm sure you know Hatsune Miku

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Oh man, that VR demo was terrible

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I like the game

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
I like the game

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
But the concept of the concert is so interesting to me

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
It's not bad, just interesting because it's, I don't want to say it's all fake

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
But it kind of is

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Like, I guess the music is played live by musicians

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
But all these projections are fake

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
It's so interesting to me

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
So I don't know if that's the type of thing that ABBA's doing

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
But they could be leveraging gaming technology

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Like a VR headset

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
To bring ABBA current

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
Which would be awesome because the greatest music ever made

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
I mean, as long as they're making new music, I'll be happy

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
They're in their 70s

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Those girls' voices, Agnetha and Anthea

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Cher is that old and she's making new music

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah, I think it always auto-tune the show

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
So when are we going to embrace Vocaloid Tupac?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I don't know

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Why would we do that when he's not dead?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Maybe with Prince

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Because Prince has all this unreleased music

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
So eventually whenever they wiggle out the licenses

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Or David Bowie

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Those are two artists right there

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
This year has fucking sucked

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
There's been so many people that have passed

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And those obviously are two all-time greats

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
But also the thing that those two have in common

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Is that they were always in tune

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
With technological advances and things like that

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Like both of them were

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Like what David Bowie had a game

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Prince had, when he was in his symbol

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
The love symbol phase

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
He had some type of interactive CD-ROM

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Live journal page

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Actually, if I'm not mistaken

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Didn't Prince have the largest internet presence

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Like in the 90s when the internet was first growing

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Like the largest fandom was Prince

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I feel like I read that somewhere

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
But anyway, doesn't matter

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
My point is that

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
You're right, that same type of technology

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I mean we're having a laugh about Tupac

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
And Coachella and all this stuff

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
But that same type of technology

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I could totally see like a Bowie or a Prince type experience

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Especially if they're opening

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Paisley Park

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
To tourists now

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Like imagine if you could actually see

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Prince playing on a

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I don't know how big that place is

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
If it had a stage or anything like that

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
But imagine if you could go in a room and see Prince

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Working or something

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Crazy technology

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
It's very crazy

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster in Chat says

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Bowie was an Omicron

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
One of Quantic Dream's earliest games

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Right, absolutely

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Vidpower at live.vognetwork.com says

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I remember that Letterman Hatsune performance

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Sad that Letterman was so confused

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I can imagine, I mean

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Also, wasn't that the point where Letterman kind of had

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
One foot out the door, like he knew his end date

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
And he knew Colbert was coming into play

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
So he was kind of like, over it

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
He was phoning it in that last year

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Let's see, Rageinator says

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Abba, greatest music ever, Skye, surely you jest

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Metallica

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Can you imagine like

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Queen?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
There's also a SingStar Queen diss

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
There is a SingStar Queen diss, now okay

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
If you're talking about Queen versus Abba

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Okay, now we're having a contest

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
You know, like, fucking Hologram

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Freddie Mercury, I mean that'd be fucking amazing

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Hologram Michael Jackson, I mean if we're gonna

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Exactly, let's just do it all

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
But Rageinator says Metallica and Stone Temple

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Pilots greater than Abba, first of all

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Look

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
First of all, everybody has different tastes

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I could agree with the Stone Temple Pilots one

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
But I want to point this out

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I was at Blizzcon a couple years ago

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Metallica was the headliner

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
So like, we could have got like, seats

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Or, well, nobody sits in a Metallica concert

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
But we could have been right there, like in the front

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Mashing with everybody

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
We chose to go to the bar instead

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
So, I'm sorry

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Cause that probably really angers you to hear that

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
But I would fully expect that if the

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
The roles were reversed

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
And it was an Abba concert, you'd be telling me the same thing

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
You'd be like, you know what Rob, I went to the bar instead

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And, you know, that's fine

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Cause everybody's into what they're into

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
So, and Tigerclaw says they are

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Different styles of music, that's very true

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
That's very, very true

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Alright, anyhow

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Okay, so JD, one question I always ask

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Of guests, and after this we'll move on and talk about

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Our gaming weeks, but one question I always ask

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Of guests is

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
What is your favorite

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Video game of all time

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
You can only pick one

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
All the others will be killed

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Just kidding, no, you can only pick one

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
What is your favorite video game of

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
All time

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Not that I'm putting them on the spot or anything

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Favorite video game

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Favorite video game, that's what we talk about here

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
At OLRP Games

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
If we're just going

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Based on replayability

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
And that, I mean

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
P-Cross can keep me fascinated for hours

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Okay, good choice

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And there's so many varieties of P-Cross as well

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I like the ones where you draw a picture a lot

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Better than the ones that are just, you know

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Use the logic and complete the grid

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Because I like making pretty pictures

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Of course, who doesn't?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
People out there are weird

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, it does, I mean even Nintendo

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Even made Mario P-Cross early on

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Wasn't it like a Game Boy game or something?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And they also

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Recently, yeah, they recently

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Had a Zelda P-Cross

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
As a, you could get it with Miitomo points

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
That was my first exposure to P-Cross

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Because I was playing Miitomo pretty hard

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Those first couple months, I finally fell off

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
But you're still playing Miitomo, right?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Occasionally

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Well, so my sister

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Got a new iPhone and now she has

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
The memory for apps

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
So she's started Miitomo

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And I've kind of picked it up again

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Partly to comment and like her answers

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
To give her coins, because I know how important that is

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
When you're getting started

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
But also it's a good way for us to keep in touch

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Because she's still in Orlando

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
And, you know, we don't talk as much as I'd like to

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
So that's one way for us to keep it

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
That's kind of interesting that of all things it's Miitomo

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
But, you know

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Well, it's not just Miitomo, it's Twitter, it's texting

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It's a lot of things

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I think a lot of people have a story like this

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Like when Alan and I were first dating

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
And Alan was living in San Francisco and I was here

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Playing World of Warcraft together was a way

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
We could quote-unquote hang out

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Even though we weren't necessarily hanging out

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
You know what I mean?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
MMOs and video games lend itself very well

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
In that space to help bridge those distances

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Definitely

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And I mean, I would get her playing Guild Wars

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
If I didn't want her to have

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You know, I want her to do well in school

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Oh, you play Guild Wars?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I mean, I played the original Guild Wars

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Starting in like 2006

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
And when the new one came out

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
All of my friends in my guild moved over as well

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
That's cool

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I have Guild Wars 2, I don't have the expansion

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I have the original Guild Wars 2, but I didn't play it very long

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
It came out at a weird time

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I feel like there was a lot of stuff coming out all at once

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
My computer at the time was struggling with it

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Really?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Yeah, I need to go back and play it now

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Because I got a souped up computer a couple years ago

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
That can play whatever

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
So yeah, I should go back and do

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Guild Wars 2 at some point

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
It'd be fun

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
You can be on any server

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
You're not limited

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
It's limited by region

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
If you're in North America, you can only play with North American servers

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
If you're in EU, you can only play with EU people

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
That's not that bad

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
But that's the only restriction

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
There is one game mode called World v World

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Which is

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
It's a pretty unique mechanic

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Where it's like sieging and stuff

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
So your one server

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Is fighting a one-on-one-on-one battle

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
So there are three different servers at a time

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I remember playing one of those

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
It's like 60 people in there at once

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I think the map cap is something like 200

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Oh my god, yeah, I remember playing that

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
All these people, it was PVP on a massive scale

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Right, so it's PVP

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
But there's a big environmental component to it

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Because you're wearing down forts and such

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Yes

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
It's not just go kill each other

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
It's break down the walls

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
There's catapults and rams and things like that

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
That's the only place where

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Server actually makes a difference

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Because if you're on one server and your friend's on another

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
You can't play together

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
There's no guessing for that

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And wasn't that something where

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
You would level sync too

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Even if you're level 5

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
You get bumped up to max level

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
So everybody can compete on equal ground

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Max level is 80

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And all of the competitive modes

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
World v World and standard PVP

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Which is 5 on 5

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
All of those are at max level

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
So you don't have to worry about

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Oh I'm underleveled for this match

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
That's not a concern for the most part

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
That's cool

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
There's also no monthly fee

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Which makes it a good game for

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Oh I have a copy of this but I don't have to subscribe to it

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I can just pick it up and play it however much I want

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
And then leave it with no cost

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I know that that's made Guild Wars

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Attractive to a lot of people as the model

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And in fact the base game

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Has gone free to play in the past year

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
When they released the new expansion

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Gotcha

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
In fact I think Loki kind of wishes

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Square Enix would pay attention to how well that model

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Has worked for Guild Wars

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And adopt it with things such as Final Fantasy 11

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
They're never going to do it with 11 because they have 14

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
14 makes them too much money but

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Yeah it would be nice

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Probably should check out

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Elder Scrolls Online because they went

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
See I really didn't like Elder Scrolls Online

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
I didn't either

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I just couldn't get into it

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I couldn't get into it either

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
That was the disappointing part because I really liked

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Elder Scrolls Skyrim

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
And Oblivion but

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Online just not

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Not feeling it

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I understand

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Yeah so that whole conversation from

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
P-Cross your favorite game

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Which if you haven't

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Spent your Nintendo points

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Which people are probably collecting by signing

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Into the eShop every week and stuff

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
If you are check out that

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Zelda P-Cross you can get a free one

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
And that will kind of introduce you to what those puzzles are

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
If nothing else

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
That was my gateway drug

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
And I believe our pal

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Bobby Blackwolf is really into those P-Cross games too

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Because I know he says they're

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Kind of cheap they're only like 3 or 4 bucks

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
A pop right?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I think he buys them when they come out

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I play them on my phone and there's any number of apps

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
On the Google store

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I think of P-Cross

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Think of P-Cross as synonymous

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
With Nintendo

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Which is interesting because P-Cross has

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
As like a picture crossword which is what it comes from

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Has been around since pen and paper

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Like you can you know before it was

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
A video game it was just a puzzle

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
So now I'm going to go

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Download 5,000 P-Cross apps on my phone

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Later and I'm going to have you to blame

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I'd give you Rex but you're on iPhone

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
But have you downloaded PolitiCats yet?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I did not download PolitiCats

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I haven't either

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
But we probably should do that first

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
No I guess we'll talk about our gaming

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
And get sucked into yet another clicker game

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I know that's kind of my hesitation

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I don't need another clicker game

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I've finally gotten free though from

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Nonstop Night I've lost interest in it

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah I kind of fell off that too

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So maybe it's time to go

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Time to get into some PolitiCats

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Brad will be very happy

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Pod Culture is back this week

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
After a long break

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
So make Brad happy this week

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Get some PolitiCats action going on

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Alright well let's talk about

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
The games we have been playing this week

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Actually

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah in a segment we call the

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
How was your gaming week?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I'm losing it guys

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Okay look just disclaimer

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
And I warned you this would happen last week

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I was up until 3am last night because we had a rocky show

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Which JD was in town to see

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I hope you had a good time

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I highly recommend it

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
And you kind of got to see the other side of Rob Roberts

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
The Beautifully Unique Sparkle Pony side

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
That's right the Beautifully Unique Sparkle Pony side of me

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Hosting that show

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And my voice today

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Is kind of shot and I'm just like my energy

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Is like drained

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
From last night so

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
If I'm like out of it tonight admittedly

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Yes I am

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Because we talked about that whole Halloween on Friday

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Halloween on Saturday

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
So I am a little drained this week

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
So let's talk a little bit about how was your gaming week

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Well thankfully I've actually played quite a bit this week

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
So I was playing

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I didn't get to play a whole ton of

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
PlayStation VR but I did play

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
A ton of it this weekend

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Just basically the get ready for

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
The party that was on Saturday

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
So I played through Rush of Blood

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Previously I played through like the third level

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And then I just finished it

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
This week so

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
That was fun I really do enjoy that game

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
It's probably my favorite game on

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
PlayStation VR so far

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Along with that I did play some of the other demos

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
On there I got to see the

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Kitchen demo being played which

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Is alright I think it was pretty cool

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Probably would have been a little bit more scary

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Actually wearing the headset for that

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I did pick up

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Rez so I'll probably be playing some of that this week

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
But I haven't actually played any of it yet

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I tried Thumper

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Which I thought was pretty cool

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
So that might be one I pick up later on

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It was pretty difficult

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
So I don't know we'll see

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And then

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I don't know I've been browsing the store a lot

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Because I've been like at my work

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
They do these kind of

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Incentive things where like someone will give you

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
An award for doing something that you're

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Normally not supposed to be in charge of

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
And kind of you know discretionary

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Efforts and so they'll give you like a certificate

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
And then this

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
They call it a Tango card which is basically

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
This universal gift card that you go on a website

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And redeem for something so I've been using it

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
For PlayStation money

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
So I've

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Been getting games with that

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And so

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I've been kind of browsing the store figuring out what I want to buy next

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Because

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
There's not a whole lot of the new stuff

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Coming out that really interests me

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I thought about doing

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I think it was called

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Windlands or something like that

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It's some like parkour

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Grappling hook exploration

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Game but I hear it's kind of boring

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
And I mean it looks neat

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
It's just kind of

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Running low on content

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Oh I did try Battlezone that was the other one

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
That I played the demo for and that was pretty cool

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Once again though 60 bucks for that

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I don't know that's a bit expensive

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And then

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I did play some non VR stuff

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I played more cluster trucks

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Because I was trying to see if the

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Free Halloween update was available

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
But I think that's only on PC

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So I haven't dug into my PC copy yet

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
But I played a little bit more of that

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Passed some more levels

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
And I got to

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
The future land now

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Which is incredibly hard

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Because a lot of them involve jumping down holes

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
To get the things

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
It's frustrating and hard

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
But it's fun

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That would be an awesome VR game

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
And then Ingress

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I did try a little bit of Pokemon Go

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Because of the Halloween update

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I played it for like 5 minutes

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
And already lost interest

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I've been loving the Halloween update

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
But again with the Pogo Plus

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And me just having an interest in general

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
To try to do more walking

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I just feel like Pokemon Go has been a great motivator for me

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And I've been loving this Halloween event

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Because it's not just double candy from catches

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
It's double candy from eggs

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Double candy from the candy factory

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
It's great

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I kind of wish it would just be permanent

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
It is nice that they have

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
New Pokemon

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
That's kind of nice to wander around

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Instead of Rattatas everywhere

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Now it's Cubones and Meowths

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I will say that I noticed a spawn difference

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Here in Sacramento versus San Francisco

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
In San Francisco there were Gasleys

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
All over the place

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Turn around you see a Gasley

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
And I haven't noticed that out here

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It's Meowths and Cubones everywhere

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
It's a drought out here

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
It is, it is

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Anything else for your gaming week Loki?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I did play Jackbox Party Pack 3

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That was something I was introduced to

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Last night

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
So I got to try out a few of the games in there

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Trivia Murder Party which is awesome

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Hosted by Satan from South Park

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It's funny

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I think we all played Jackbox Party Pack 3 at this point

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And that was the game

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I was looking forward to the most

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I love it

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
It's a great party game

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And I think for people that are looking for You Don't Know Jack

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I think this isn't

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
You Don't Know Jack

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
But the setup is extremely similar

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I think people that are missing

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
You Don't Know Jack will be into it

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
But I can't stand the announcer voice

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I can't stand

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
The filtered announcer voice

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I can't do it

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
When Travis Donovan did DJ Satan

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
On his show

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I thought it was a better filter

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
It's hard to hear on the TV

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I thought it was hilarious

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I don't care for it

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I know we have folks at Jackbox that listen to the show

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
And you guys are great

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
The Satan thing

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I couldn't connect with that

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I had never played a Jackbox game before

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Prior to that

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I actually got to try it out

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
My wife actually played two

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
You hadn't played Party Pack 2?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
No, I hadn't played any of them

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I thought it was fantastic

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
With the phone thing

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
They should do that with a ton of more games

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I don't know why no one else is doing it

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Jackbox games does that

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I understand they do that with all their games

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Seriously, this should be something you should be doing with a ton of other games

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Yeah, using a phone as a controller is a great mechanic

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
And everyone needs to do it

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Well, to be fair

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
And maybe this is also interesting

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
They were criticized the first year

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
When You Don't Know Jack was in there

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Because the phone has the delay

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
So when people would buzz in

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
To try to answer on You Don't Know Jack

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
It didn't really work right

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Yeah, I could see that

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
But they switched it now in Trivia Murder Party

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Everybody answers the question

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's different

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
So I wonder

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
If maybe

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That was their work around

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Maybe we're just going to come up with a new trivia game

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Interesting, I'd be curious

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah, we played that

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
We also played Quiplash 2

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Which was fantastic

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
We also played Fake In It

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
But Fake In It honestly was the least favorite

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I think of the whole group

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I didn't like it too much

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
There was no real indicator

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
The questions they were asking

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
It didn't seem like it would be that hard

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
To fake anything

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I don't know

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
It was just kind of dumb

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
We got really bored with it really fast

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
We were like, okay, we're not playing that again

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Which minigames did you get for it? Was it the pointing one?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
We had the pointing one

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
We had the numbers on your fingers

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And then there was

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Raising your hand or not

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
So there's one of them that you can get

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
It's called texting or something

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And everybody but one

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
The faker gets a certain question

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Texted to them

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And the faker gets a different question

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
And then all of the answers go on the screen

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And you can see them together

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Yeah, that was the last one

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And the spoiler, it was Flaco Jones

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Flaco Jones had gone to the bathroom

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
And didn't actually answer the question

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Oh no

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And so the first round of that were like

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Oh, well, I don't know who it is

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
And we were like, it's probably Flaco

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
And we just all voted that

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
And sure enough, it was him

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Because he just didn't answer any of them

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Oh, I didn't know the game was still going

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
He could have taken his phone into the bathroom

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
With him and played from the potty seat

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
See, that's the other advantage

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
To having your phone as a controller

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Is that you don't have to take a break

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Well, and also it's awesome too

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Just like the Twitch support and stuff

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I just think it's

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I know what these games are

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I didn't know what the appeal was

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Or how fun they would be

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And I'm just really surprised

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
How fun it was

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Yeah, some comments in chat

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
It's an innovative idea and I'm loving it

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
We've had great parties with the Party Pack

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
With friends

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I don't like using my phone for stuff

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
It should all be on the console or PC you play on

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Plus, not everyone has smartphones

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Or Wi-Fi slash Bluetooth

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
You know, I kind of see

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
That perspective, but at the same time

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I think this is why not every game

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Uses this in the world

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
But I think, you know, this is Jackbox's niche

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Right now, and they're doing really well with it

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
It works as a party game

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Plus, you can use a laptop or an iPad

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
That's true, you could use a laptop

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
All you need, anything with a web browser

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
You don't even have to be in the same room

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I know some people who play remotely using the room code

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
And the Twitch thing

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I don't remember if it was the first

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Party Pack or whatever they had before that

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Was when they started realizing

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
And we had them on the show for packs 1 and 2

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And I really should have sent them an invite for part 3

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
But, you know, just

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Everything else going on

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
But if you guys are out there listening and want to come talk about part 3

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
You can, just shoot me an email

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
But, so with part 1

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
I think they saw the successes on Twitch

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
So I think in part 2, they actually tried to think

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
More about how can we accommodate

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
The Twitch audience, and they were seeing that

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Now this one feels like

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
All the games can be done over Twitch

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
And there's even thing in the option mode

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
To let the timers be longer

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
To account for the Twitch delay

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Yeah, it's pretty crazy

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
I was impressed by how much specific

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Twitch features there were in each of the games

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I went and looked at the settings

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Because I'm that kind of a gamer sometimes

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And I was impressed, everything had settings for it

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Yeah, so they're kind of refining that

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah, so maybe

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
When they have the Steam sale or something

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I'll pick up all three Party Packs

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah, probably towards

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Black Friday or something, they'll probably have a super bundle

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
That has a ton of stuff, I'm sure they will

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
But, what was I going to say about part 3?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I didn't get to play all of it

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Because it definitely seems like

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
For a lot of people

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Party Pack 3 is trivia murder party

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
And other games

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Everybody goes and plays that one first

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
We didn't do faking it until the end until when people started leaving

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Because we had 8 people

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
So faking it is only up to 6

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
So we're just like, oh we can't play that right now

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
We're just going to play these two

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
We played trivia murder party twice

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And I like how the second time you play it the same people

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
It's the siblings

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
So it's the junior

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And then they even create a part 2

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
With the subtitle

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Unless you were the survivor the first time

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Then you don't get the junior

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Did you play a third game?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
We didn't play the third one

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
There's an achievement for making a trilogy

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Yeah, an achievement for making a trilogy

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
And you get part 3, the never ending gory

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
That's awesome

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I only got to play the trivia murder party

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
And we played Gespionage

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
We played Gespionage quite a bit

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I was going to say one more trivia murder party

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Because basically

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
For anyone that's not familiar with it

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So you answer a trivia question

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
If you get it right

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
You get money, if you get it wrong

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
You have to play a mini game

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And the mini games, if you fail the mini game you die

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
But the one we played

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
But your ghost can still play

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
So you're not out of the game

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
You can still play

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
But the final round

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
If you're a ghost, you're at a huge disadvantage

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Well, it depends

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I've had games where you can

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Take over someone's body and win

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
So there was one

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
This one, you didn't die

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
But you had to pick a finger that cut off

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Yes, I hated that one so much

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I was like

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
What is this? You pick a finger

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Well, I'll pick this finger

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
And come to find out, there's always four answers

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
And then if you happen to cut off that particular finger

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
You can't answer that question correctly

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
That was brilliant

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
We just spoiled it for everybody

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
The first time I saw it was brilliant

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
You cut off a finger, so like you say, you cut off your first finger

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Then you can never answer the first answer

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
All you see is a picture of a finger

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Of a severed finger

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
That was fucking brilliant

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
It reminded me of Heavy Rain

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
It's kind of disturbing

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
It was a fantastic game

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
But then when the answer is that answer

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
You can't guess it

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
So you go right back to the killing room

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
So it's an interesting mechanic because

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
The longer you play, the more likely you are to

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Have severed fingers and fail out

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
It prevents

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Indefinite games

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
My favorite one was the one that Shane got

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
That was like the wheel of death

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
The wheel of

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
The wheel of

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
The wheel of

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Losing

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
It was like these giant

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Squares for death and the teeniest

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Little sliver for you live

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
There was one where you had to make the

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Longest word out of the letters

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I made a pretty long word

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I forgot to hit submit

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Oh my god, that happened to me in the first game

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I had a sixth game, aw crap

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
It happened to me in the first game, alright

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
We've been talking about Jackbox Party back for ten minutes

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
But it's a lot of fun

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Anything else for your game of the week?

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
That's it

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Fair enough, we'll go to our guests next

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
We haven't heard a lot from Shane, how was your game of the week?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
What have you been playing?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Pokemon, oh it was an Octillery by the way

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I looked at my list

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I see, so that was the

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
100th Pokemon then

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
100th shiny unique Pokemon

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
And I went to round one this weekend

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
And I played theater rhythm in the arcade

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
And that was really fun

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
How is theater rhythm in the arcade different from the DS?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Well you don't use the touch screen to play

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
You have two little buttons to hit

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
And these little rounded

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Knobs

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
And so if you've played theater rhythm

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
You've got times when you're tapping the screen

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And times when you're sliding your stylus

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Across the screen

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So the knobs act like the stylus part

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
And the buttons act like the tapping part

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And because there's two

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Knobs, sometimes you have to

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Do both in the same direction, opposite directions

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
It's really interesting

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
It's pretty fun, I wish I had more songs

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
But you can unlock them, I don't know how still

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
But I unlocked one song so I was happy with that

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
And I want to play it again

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Because it was good

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
The end of that story

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
And that's all I've been playing

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Because it's all I ever play is Pokemon

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
So at round one you were just playing the usual stuff

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
DDR Ace?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
No I didn't play any DDR because I was tired

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Because I had just packed up a whole bunch of stuff

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
And moved it to my new house

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
And so I played

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Crossbeats a lot

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Because they had a Halloween event

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
And when you played this specific song

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
And beat it on different difficulties

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
You got new titles

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
For your account

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So I got the title Trick or Treat

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
And the title Happy Halloween

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I was happy about that

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
And I changed my avatar to a ghost and a pumpkin

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Because I also unlocked that

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
And that was cool

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I'm trying to think if they had anything else

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Noteworthy and new there

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
But I think theater rhythm was the only thing

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I saw that was really new

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Okay that's all

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Alright

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
No I'm gonna go get food

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Okay have fun

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
JD how was your gaming week?

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
It was good

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
So like we talked about I played Guild Wars 2

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I picked up Pokemon Go again

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Because I actually lost my battery about a month ago

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
So my phone just didn't have battery to play Pokemon Go

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Because it's a real drainer

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
So I've started on the Halloween event

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
And I like that a bit

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I've been playing Pokemon Shuffle

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
On my phone which is a puzzle game

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
It's sort of third party-ish

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I forgot the name of the developer

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
But it's a match 3

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Pokemon game

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
But it's a more puzzle aspect

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
And they're doing all of their Halloween stuff

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
So lots of ghost Pokemon events

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I picked up Mini Metro

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Or I picked that back up

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I noticed they added a San Francisco map

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
And Mini Metro is a game in which you are developing

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
A subway

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
And it's algorithmically generated

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So stations will pop up

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Of different shapes

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
And you try to draw lines that will match them

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
And you're moving passengers around

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Before they have to wait too long

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
If you have too many unhappy people waiting there

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Your system will close

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Because you've caused a meltdown

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Because they burned the station down

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
They riot

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Exactly

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
There's a bunch of different world cities

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Most of them are famous for having subways

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Like New York and London and Paris

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
And then there's some more exotic ones

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Like Melbourne, Australia

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
And I think the Auckland one

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Is this is a future scenario

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
In the hypothetical Auckland Metro

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
If they ever make one

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
But San Francisco was just added

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
And since I live there and I'm a transit geek

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I was super excited to play that

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
You're basically building your own BART system

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
What is a transit geek?

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I think Misty

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Who listens to this show a lot

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Is also a transit geek

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
She takes trains everywhere across the nation

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
That's definitely part of it

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I'm also interested in where things go

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
And why and how

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I get involved in the city planning process

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Sometimes going to show up

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
At local government stuff

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
It's kind of like

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
You know those government meetings in Parks and Recreation

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
That's basically very accurate

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Even in San Francisco

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Shane is going to be sad he missed a Parks and Rec reference

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
That's his favorite show

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
That's what happens when you leave

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I love it

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I know this is a video game show

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
But I have to ask

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
The high speed rail in California

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Oh my god

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
It's going to happen

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
They're already building it

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
But in Fresno, JP

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
They're building it in Fresno

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
To Bakersfield or something

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
These are cities nobody wants to go to

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
There's already a train

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
That goes from Bakersfield to Oakland

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
And it gets a lot of ridership

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Because people don't necessarily go

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
From one end to the other

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Don't get me wrong

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I love the idea of a high speed rail to connect

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
San Francisco, Sacramento and LA

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
And Oakland and the big places in between

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
But you need to start

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
With San Francisco to Sacramento

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
You don't start it in Fresno

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Well you have to start somewhere

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
To be honest there's less of a fight

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Politically by starting in the Central Valley

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Than there would be trying to figure out

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Which alignment to get to LA

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Which alignment to get to the Bay Area

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Or to get up the Central Valley except the farmers

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Well I mean Hanford has a problem with it

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
But they're the only ones

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
If you compare Hanford raising a fuss

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
To Palo Alto raising a fuss

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
That's why it's starting there

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
You have to start somewhere

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Get something operational and it'll be harder to kill

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Alright so gaming

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
So these are the things you have to consider in mini Metro

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Also on trains I picked up Ticket to Ride

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
They added achievements

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
And new maps and DLC

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
So I played a couple of games

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I played a Steam version of a board game

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Because Days of Wonder is really good about

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Making computerized versions of their games

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And I mean if you've played board games

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Some of the biggest hassle with it

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Is putting all the pieces away

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And it's nice to have a computer do it for you

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
And keep score

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
That is nice, that is awfully convenient

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I don't like to clean

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
You know that now that you've seen the house

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Hey it's not that bad

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Alright anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I think that's about it

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I've been playing more Final Fantasy 14

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Because you all know I love that game

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
So I'm still hitting the ground with that

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
So even though I kind of went off on Fan Fest

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
A couple of weeks ago

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
It really did re-energize my love of that game

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
So I've been playing that a lot

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
But I have been playing other stuff too

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I randomly, this super random purchase

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
But I saw it on the Playstation store and I was like

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Okay I want to get that, I got King of Fighters 94

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
So I played that a little bit

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And I forgot how fucking hard that game is

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Or at least for me

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I can get past the first

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Fight barely

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
But then the second fight I die a lot

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
So it doesn't matter

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I can use Team Europe

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I can use Team Korea

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
It doesn't matter I'm going to get my butt kicked

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
So that was a fun Neo Geo throwback

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
And I remember we were talking about that on the show

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
A couple of weeks ago how those games were going to start showing up

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
In that series that I think a lot of people forget

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Is on Playstation 4

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Because they don't really promote it heavily

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
But it's there

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
There's some real deep cuts in the library there

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
It was right there when you went to go buy Jackbox

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
So it was at least a little promoted

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
It was but I also knew to go sort new by date

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
So I could find Jackbox

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Even Jackbox I don't think it had a splash banner

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Or if it did I totally missed it

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
It's kind of a habit now

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Like on Tuesdays I just go to the Playstation store

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
And I sort new

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
And I just look at what's new and see if there's anything I want

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
And I do the same thing on Xbox One

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
I don't think the store is as well laid out on Xbox One

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
But I will boot up the Xbox One every Thursday

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
To see what's backwards compatible this week

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
What just showed up in my library

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
For the backwards compatibility

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
And I've been getting a lot of surprises there

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
So that's cool

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
So yeah I played a little King of Fighters 94

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
So that was cool that that showed up

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
But I've also been playing a lot of Dragon Quest Builders

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Now I mentioned that I picked up this game

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
While I was out in Vegas

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I never got around to playing it last week

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
But I finally sat down and spent some quality time with it this week

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
And I really do like that game

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I mean I know a lot of people are writing it off

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
It's like a Minecraft clone

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
But it doesn't, like when you were watching me play it

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Does it, I mean I should say

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Does it look like Minecraft? Yes

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
The graphics look like Minecraft

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
But did the interface and the UI look like Minecraft? No

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
I actually haven't played Minecraft so I can't give that comparison

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
It's not Minecraft

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
It honestly

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
To me feels like

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
More like a classic JRPG

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
But it's just that

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
It's in this world

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
That you can break bricks

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
And that's how you find things

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
But it's got like the very rudimentary crafting system

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
That you would saw in a lot of early JRPGs

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
So it's just kind of like honestly

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
It's honestly like a Super Nintendo style

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Dragon Quest game

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
But I don't even know if I can call it that

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Because then you would expect the fights

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
But the fights are more like Zelda

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Like you can charge your sword and do the spins

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
And all that, it's more actiony

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
It's not like the classic battles

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
It definitely looks like there was a collection aspect to the game also

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
So like 3D.Dragon

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Actually

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Actually that's not a bad comparison at all

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I would say this game has a lot more in common

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
With 3D

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
3D.Action Heroes

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
3D.Game Heroes

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
That game on PS3, you all know which one

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
But with a destructive environment

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
That's the big difference there

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
And that 3D

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
3D.Action Hero

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
That was a straight up Zelda rip off

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
No but I say that in the best possible way

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I mean if you're going to rip Zelda off

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Do it good

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
And that game did a very good job of doing it

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
And kind of bringing a Zelda-esque game to the Playstation

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
And I say Dragon Quest Heroes

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Kind of continues that a little bit

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I'm really into it

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I think it's really fun

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
I hear there's only like 4 chapters in the game

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
But I've been playing for like 10 hours

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
And I'm still on the first chapter

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Like there are long chapters

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
So what exactly do you do in that?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Do you build up your town?

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
So you start in a little hole in the ground

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
And you work your way out

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And you find this town

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And there's voices that are talking to you

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Like this world once thrived

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
And then the Dark Lord came

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
The Shadow Lord came and took it all down

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Like every generic JRPG trope

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
But then you start

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
The girl will be like

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
If only we could patch the house back together

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
So and it's very obvious

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Like where you put the bricks

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
So you learn that if you put your bricks

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Like too high

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
And if your room has a bed and a light

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
That'll become a bedroom

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
And that will get your town points

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Because you have a bedroom

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
And so basically you start to learn that if you

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Craft such and such things

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
You'll increase the points of your town

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Or you have to craft food to keep yourself alive

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
You craft weapons and shields to fight the enemies

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Or you craft bigger and better things

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
For your town basically

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
And then the townspeople will start

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Making requests

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
It'll be like hey we need to have a forge

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
So we can make more stuff or whatever

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
So you make this

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
But then some of the requests

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
It's not always about buildings

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Sometimes the request is

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
You need to go into this pyramid

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
That's way out there through the teleporter

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
And you need to go into this pyramid

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
And you need to steal the two idols that are in the pyramid

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
This is a quest that I just did

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
For one to dislodge the idols

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
You have to have the highest weapon

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
So you build the weapon

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Then you go to the pyramids

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
And you find your way through the pyramids

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Where the walls are not destructible

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
And then you find the idols

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
And you tear them down with a hammer

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
But then when you do that all the people that are praying to the idols

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Turn into the magician dudes from Dragon Quest

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
So you have to run the fuck out of there

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
So it's not only building quests

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
It's the typical type of fetch quest

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
You would see in RPGs and things like that

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
It's like all that mixed together

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
And I think that's kind of why I enjoy it

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
It's a little bit of Minecraft and a little bit of

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Zelda and a little bit of Dragon Quest

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Kind of like all together

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
But I can say all that and how much I like this

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
But I think there's some people out there that won't be able to

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
They were not going to be able to stand it

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
They're going to play this for five minutes and go

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
This is dumb

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
But there's a demo out there

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And unlike some other games

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Like World of Final Fantasy and Inokuni

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I think the demo for Dragon Quest Builders

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Is really good

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
The demo for Dragon Quest Builders is like the first

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Five quests of the game

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
All strung together

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
You get to play it up to the point you get your first teleportal

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
And then when you try to go through the teleportal

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
It says, sorry but this area is closed

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
In the demo, hope you enjoyed playing

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
And you can't progress any further in the story

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Because you can't go through the portal

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
So it's a decent demo

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
So if you think this might be up your alley

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Just download the demo

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I think this is a safe one to judge the game off of

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
So there you go

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Let's see, going to the chat

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Let's see

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Dungeon Buster says

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I really like the Japanese demo for Dragon Quest Builders

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Just need to pick it up at one point

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
There you go

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Some folks in the chat room talking about King of Fighters

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
I guess talking about King of Fighters 2014

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Rageinator says, there's a King of Fighters 14

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I thought the 13 was the newest one

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, no 14 came out a little while ago

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
So yeah

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Vidpower says

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
King of Fighters 98 was the centerpiece of our arcade

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
It was the game everyone gathered around

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Good times

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
You know, I guess I'm more of a classic person

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Because my favorite to this day is still

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Fatal Fury Special

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Which is on Xbox 360

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
And I don't know if it's on the backwards compatibility yet

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I don't remember

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
But that was the last time I remember that game was playable

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I hope they bump that one up

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
For the Playstation 4 archives

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
And so forth

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
I just like the classic one a little bit more

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I think too

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Anyway

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Alright that's it for our gaming week

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
So we're going to get into some news

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
But quickly I just want to mention some housekeeping

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
We will not be here live on Sunday November 13th

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
There will be a show that week

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
There should be a taped show

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
It looks like we're going to tape

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Hopefully if it works with Loki schedule on Wednesday of that week

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
And we'll have something new

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
At 6 o'clock on Sunday

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
But we will not actually be here live

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
To interact with

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Just so you know I'm going to Chicago

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
So I won't be here

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
But otherwise we'll be here next week

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
And then on November 20th

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Episode 666 of our show

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
Which I don't think we're doing anything particularly special for it

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
It's just everybody keeps making this big thing about

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
Oh my god you guys are going to get to episode 666

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
And to be fair

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
A lot of shows don't get to episode 666

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Some do

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
If you're more than once a week

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Like Critical Myth

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
They're on 700 something

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
But they do three shows a week

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
So they can get the numbers faster

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
I don't know if there's a lot of weekly shows out there

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
That have hit episode 666

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
So I think we're heading into uncharted territory

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
A little bit

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
So we're going to have to set the tone

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
For how shows celebrate episode 666

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I'm not sure

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
That sounds too ego-y though

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I don't want to say that either

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I don't know what's going to work best for us in our audience

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So be here

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I want Travis to come on

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Do DJ Satan

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I want the Satan voice that I enjoy

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
But my understanding is that he already said no

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
So whatever

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
He wants to retire or whatever it is

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Alright let's get into some gaming news for now

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Loki

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So it's just been a couple weeks

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Since we heard some news about the Switch

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And now we've already got more news

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
On when we're going to hear more news on the Switch

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
So the Nintendo Switch presentation

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
2017

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Is going to be held on January 12

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
It'll be streamed online

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And with that they're going to announce

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
The console's price, the release date

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And the lineup of games in development

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
So

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I don't expect to hear much until then

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But that's kind of cool that we

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Have a date

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
That they're not just keeping us hanging

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Along with that there is

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Comments regarding the 3DS

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Because people are thinking

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Hey the Switch is coming out

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's a portable system, it's a console

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
What's going to happen with the 3DS

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Is this going to be a successor to the 3DS

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Well apparently the 3DS

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Is not going to be replaced by the Switch

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Instead they're going to coexist

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
With each other so

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And I call bullshit

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Now

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Now I will

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Take this back

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
If in the presentation that we're getting on January 12

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
They mention that the Switch and the 3DS

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Can like talk to each other or something

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Or maybe there's some type of environment

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Created between the two systems

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Where it would be helpful to own both

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But otherwise I'm sorry

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I don't buy this line

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I think this is to not cannibalize

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
3DS sales but ultimately

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
This isn't really Nintendo's

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Decision because if all the

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Third parties stop making games

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
For 3DS and go over to Switch

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Then guess what the 3DS is not going to be

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Recorded anymore you might have indies which is cool

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And some of that but I think even in the

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
In the indies if it's as easy to make

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
A game for the Switch as it is 3DS

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I think a lot of indies are going to be looking over there

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It's also going to depend on a lot of factors like

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Battery life and stuff because if the battery life on the Switch

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Is abysmal then you know

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
True how portable is it

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But I just I kind of

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Like sorry I know a lot of

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
People have been throwing this at me when I say

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
That well so much you know this is the 3DS

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Is a successor and I view this as a 3DS

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Or I've been sent a link to this quote

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I don't know how many times and I'm like

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Okay but they do this

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Companies do this like

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
When they came out with a Playstation Vita

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I'm sure they said something about well the PSP is not really

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Going away or is still going to support the PSP

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Like of course companies do that

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Because they don't want to cannibalize

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Sales of the existing system

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Yeah it will replace it

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
But hey

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
You can buy the 3DS for a few months

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
But if for whatever

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
If for whatever reason Nintendo remains

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Super committed to 3DS and I'm wrong

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Then I'm wrong that's fine

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But I would have a hard time believing

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
There's going to be the major tent pole releases

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
To substantiate that

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And that's not being made

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
For the Switch

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
You know what I mean

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
They could do that it would make much sense

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
But they could do that

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
We'll see I guess

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Thank you Raman Chat says Microsoft said the same thing

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
About the 360 look what happened

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
MXC said they said it before with how

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The DS was not going to take over Game Boy Advance

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Oh I remember that

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
So I'm sorry but this is

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
This is a line you hear all the time

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I mean Nintendo could also do the Smash 4

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Treatment where they release it on 3DS and

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
On their console like

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
You know with the Switch

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Or you know what else would be really awesome

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Is that what if like the 3DS

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Can serve as like an

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Extra controller when the Switch is on

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
The dock or something

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Maybe there is still something they could do

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
To add the 3DS into that environment

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But otherwise I just don't believe that

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
There's a place for the 3DS when the Switch comes out

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You're wrong I'm back

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Oh please tell please let me know how I'm wrong

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Because with the example with the

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Game Boy Advance and the DS

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
The DS played Game Boy Advance

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Games the Switch does not play

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Anything as far as

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Nintendo's confirmed except Switch games

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So all your 3DS

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Games they're not coming over to that

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
You can't play them on that so there's still a

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Part for the 3DS

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
But the developers are going to

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Abandon it to make games for the Switch

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Will they? Because I think they will

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Because this is still going to be a more expensive

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Platform the 3DS and the

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
2DS and the new 3DS

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Those are all still more

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I don't want to say aimed at kids but they're more affordable

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And so parents can replace these

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Systems easier for kids

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Versus a Switch I think

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I don't think anything is replacing anything until

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
We see how that thing sells in the first place

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Yeah I'll give you this

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
This whole thing could be to leave

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The door open a crack for the 3DS

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
In case the Switch

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Flops which

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I don't know based on just the buzz

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
It looks good but

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
The buzz for the Switch is already better than it was for the Wii U

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
But I feel like maybe this is to leave the door

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Open in a jar for the 3DS so that way

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
If the Switch does flop Nintendo can

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Still kind of fall back on it

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Yes it's a portable, yes it's a console

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We need to know what the battery life is on that

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So it has to at least match the 3DS

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I feel like if it's even

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Like if it has any potential

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
To push the 3DS out

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
So also there's a frog

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Outside I almost hit it with a car

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
It's adorable

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Don't hit it with a car then

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Then I was going to go catch it I was like no because I'm about to eat

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
It's not a Pokemon

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
But it's still adorable like a Pokemon

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Alright

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So what about the fact that we get no new Switch

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Information until 2017

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Expected in my opinion, totally expected

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Yeah

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I like that they set the date

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah I feel even with this presentation

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
That they had

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
It was more of like people keep bothering

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
You know

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I don't know it's just like

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I apologize if you said it and I missed it

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
But is this a presentation

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Like a Nintendo Direct type of thing

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yeah it's going to be a live stream

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So could that mean that it's an E3

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Style presentation which we haven't seen

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Like a live

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Live demo that's what I assume

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Yeah because that would be a very interesting

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Shift for Nintendo

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
To go back to the big E3

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Style conference which you're allowed to do

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Outside of E3 Sony does their

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Expo they do game developers

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Conference Microsoft did their own event

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
For the Xbox One

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
We all remember the famous unveiling of the Xbox

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
One and how well that went

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So there's no reason why Nintendo can't do

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Their own live event I'd just be very curious

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Because we haven't seen Nintendo live in a while

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
So it would be very interesting if they did that

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
We saw them at E3

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But they didn't know they didn't Nintendo Direct

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
They didn't do an E3 press conference

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
They didn't do a press conference but they did

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
All sorts of live things for E3

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
They did Treehouse you're right

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Pokemon and all that good stuff

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I guess

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I don't associate the Treehouse stuff

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
With the executives

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
But that's a fair point

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I don't think it's gonna be like

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Here's Reggie and Miyamoto playing

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Mario Do you think it's gonna be like an all day

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Twitch event like all day on January 12th

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
No it'll be some hours

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But maybe two hours at the most

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Interesting

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Let's see going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Dark Tetsuya says yeah maybe

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
This is Nintendo's answer to those other events

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The companies are doing

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I just think they have to have the information

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Out there because I would expect

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
It already out by now

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Nintendo could easier than anyone

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Hold their own

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Expo

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Convention

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Nintendo could easier than anyone do it

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Oh yeah I would go to a Nintendo experience

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So many people would go

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Even though Sony experiences in San Francisco I didn't go

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I would go to Nintendo's

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
It was really good

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I'm very tempted to go to the one in Anaheim

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
One of my friends is really trying to talk me into going

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I'm like I am convention out

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I've got to so many conventions

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
But I would go to the Nintendo one in a heartbeat

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I think the Nintendo one

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Would be a ticket mess

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And maybe that's why Nintendo doesn't want to get involved

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Because I think it would be

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
It would be faster than

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
PAX selling out tickets

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I feel like Nintendo gets a lot of really strong

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Focused brand loyalty in ways that Sony

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And Microsoft don't get

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Oh you better believe it for sure

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Loki you were going to say something before I get to another chat comment

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Oh no I was just thinking

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
What would the new

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
PlayStation event have

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
What would they be showing up

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I guess Horizon Zero Dawn

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
It's probably going to be some of the titles from early next year

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
But they do announce a lot of stuff

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
At the PlayStation thing

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
We got the Final Fantasy 7 remake

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
We got the actual gameplay footage

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Finally for that

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
There was Dumne no Kuni 2 that nobody cares about

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
There was Rez

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I want to say

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Was that zombie game there that nobody asked for?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Street Fighter 5 came out of

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
The PlayStation expo

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
No

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Street Fighter 5 was announced

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I thought that was just the characters

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
No it was a huge deal when they announced it

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Wait the last one or the one before that?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I'm only talking last year

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I don't know what happened the year before

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
They announced the exclusiveness on Sony

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And it was a huge deal

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
No man's sky

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Well it looked better than it was

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Anyway

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Let's see

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
It could be the Nintendo Powerfest

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I love it

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I missed the Powerfest

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It was so good

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Let's see

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Akuma JP in chat says

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Here's a thought, we make games for new systems all the time

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
But we're not making a Switch game

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And you know

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I think that's

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
An interesting division

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
That I think it's very obvious

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
To everybody out there that the Switch

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Is not going to be something you can just port

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game over to

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I thought that was the whole rumor

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
That it was so easy that's what's going to make it

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Do better

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Why wouldn't you be able to?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Because the hardware is not going to be up to speed with PlayStation 4

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Yeah but from what I understand

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
It's just a little less powerful

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
From the rumors and these rumors that are saying

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
This are the rumors that have gotten everything else

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Right about it so far

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
We'll have a see

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
That would be great

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
If it can compete on that level

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Yeah we'll have to take a wait and see approach

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Alright

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Let's get to some more news

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Also about the Switch

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And you know what's very important for this

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Is third parties and people being interested in developing

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
For Switch

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Well one of the people who has expressed interest

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
In making games for the Switch

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Is Hajime Tabata

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And if you don't know that name

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Well you probably know the game he's directing

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Final Fantasy XV

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So he's interested in making games for the Switch

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Not necessarily Final Fantasy XV

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
But the quote is

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I'm very interested in this machine

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
As a player but also as a developer

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
The Nintendo Switch that you can transform

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Into a controller that you can put into a dock

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
That you can move around with

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
On which you can replace elements

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
It's been a while that I've told myself I would like to make games

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
On a Nintendo machine

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
So if the Nintendo Switch could be that opportunity

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I'd be delighted

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
That was an interview with Game Blog

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Where Hajime Tabata said that

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
There's definitely, it's catching the attention of people in the industry

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
And we've kind of heard that too

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
In some of the rumors

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Like the rumors were saying

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
That there was a lot of interest out there

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Because people really liked the concept of

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That you could pick it up and go

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And it sounds like this whole fact that it transforms

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
It's like a Transformers machine

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
With the fact that the controllers pop off

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And they can be used one way

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
You're not limited to necessarily one configuration

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I just hope it works in execution

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Like it sounds

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Oh they pop off, poof!

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Alright now here's one other

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Big big rumor about the Switch

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
This will be the last thing we'll talk about

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Again this is rumor but

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
If I were to bring out the wheel of plausibility again this week

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm sure it would rank very highly

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Anyhow this is a tweet from a technology

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Reporter for the Wall Street Journal

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
It's Takashi Mochizuki

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
And is mentioning in this tweet

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Looks like standard capacity

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Of Switch game card at least when

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Console launched

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It was around 16 as in gigabytes

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Enough for one layer

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Blu-ray game so it looks like

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
The Switch game cards are 16

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Gigabyte cartridges however

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
We don't necessarily know if that means

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
It's limited to 16 and can't grow

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Later because even the original

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
NES was

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Limited to what 32

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Kilobytes maybe I could be totally

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Wrong on that but that was expanded

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
By the time

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And that's also why cartridges got more and more expensive

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
But that was expanded by

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
The end of its run so

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I don't see why maybe you have a 16

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Gig cartridge as the original

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Configuration but that's gonna grow

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
To 32

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Maybe even 128 if the technology

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Gets there

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
But I notice a lot of people on blogs and so forth

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Are very negative on this 16

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Gigabyte number because it's less than

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
A 25 gigabyte

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Blu-ray but my

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Question is how

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Like you guys do a lot of

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Digital game downloads right

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
How many games out there are more

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Than 16 gigs to download

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I can't think of a lot

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Maybe the major games are bigger than that

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Dragon Age was bigger? No

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Like a lot of the major games are bigger than that

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
They're like 30, 40 gigs

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But those are like major

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Major games

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I don't know it depends on what that

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Thing outputs at

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I imagine the texture sizes

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I think will probably reduce it quite a bit

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Compression maybe

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Wasn't 16 gigs

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Like the entire capacity of the basic

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Wii U

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
So if this is bigger

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Than that that's good news I think

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Well like you know

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Compression I'm sure has placed some of it

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Because I think a lot of that stuff they had

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Especially on disc I'm not sure about

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Actually downloading it though but like a lot of it

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Had to stay in compressed because the drive wasn't

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
As fast or maybe I'm thinking

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
3 but

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I don't know

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
We'll see I mean

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
They're gonna make it work

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It's not gonna be like ah shit you know

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
The game doesn't work too well

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Or or

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I mean they could pull a fucking Microsoft

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And say oh okay well 16 gigs

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Fits on this and we're gonna download the rest

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I was gonna say it's not

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Necessarily out of character to have

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Some of it on the cartridge

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
But the rest of it will download

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
If the Switch has a large

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Internal capacity

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Still do 32 gigs please

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Well I was gonna say if you downloaded all the high quality

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Stuff for Xenoblade

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
On Wii U

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
That will fill up your entire drive

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Like with all the high

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Stuff but you know maybe the Switch

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Can incorporate something like that I don't know

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So anyway

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Dartitsia pointing out

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
The cards at the start are right in between

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Dual layer DVDs

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
9.4 gigs and Blu-rays

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
25 gigs respectively

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And I'm sure there's a possibility the cards could get bigger

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Down the line yeah if they go to 32

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Gigs which would be the assuming that any

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Of this information is even accurate in the first

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Place that is very true

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Sj100Matt says as long as it's not

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Proprietary memory cards people

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Will just buy larger SD cards

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
They're so cheap now

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
We can hope you know the 3DS

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Allowed you to use a non-proprietary

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Card so there's hope

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
The Wii let you use a non-proprietary SD card

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I have a 256 gig one or whatever it is

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I don't remember but it's huge

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
The Wii kind of struggles to load all of the

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Space because it has to like count all the

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Blocks right but it works

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Yeah the Wii U

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Will allow you to connect an external

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Hard drive if I'm not correct or if I'm not mistaken

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Yeah because their internal storage is

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Yeah stupid but I mean but the

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Good news is you know when we're talking

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
About what's plausible and what's not

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
You kind of look at the track record right

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
So Nintendo has a pretty good track record of not being

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Not constricting memory

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
To its ecosystem so that's

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
That's hopeful that

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
We'll be able to do that with the Switch

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
That's kind of standard nowadays anyways

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I mean it feels like Nintendo has often had expansions to its consoles

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Like the N64 had the expansion pack

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You know there's always been little

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Add-ons that they add on later in the

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Console's life

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Rama says the Switch will use

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Proprietary cards for the games

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
But standard micro SD if you ask me

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And I would agree with that I don't think

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
They would want just anybody making

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Game cartridges they don't want

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
People to circumvent that so

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
No I'm sure it will be circumvented

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Don't you worry

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Well I mean it's so early

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
To know but Loki

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Have you seen anything out there about people

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
That are like planning to hack the

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Switch Oh no I haven't seen anything

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
But it's gonna happen It always happens

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It'll have to happen Yeah that's

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
A given it will happen

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
It just you know how easy is it gonna be

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Is the question Yeah interesting

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Alright let's move on

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
With another story Loki

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Alright so this week

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Hello Games actually finally tweeted

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Something out and their tweet

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Was No Man's Sky was a mistake

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And everyone's like

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Whaaaat

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And it actually ended up being that

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Apparently their Twitter account was hacked

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And someone posted

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
That on there and yeah

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
It was some type of back door through LinkedIn

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Is what they blamed too Yeah they're all

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
100% not hacked anymore obviously

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Those mails and tweets were fake

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Back to work and then you know they were saying

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
That umm

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Which you know

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Sorry real quick by the way

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
There's a little bit of tangent but it's not

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Okay so Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Is where you guys can call us later on the show right

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I don't know if you guys have noticed this

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I've been getting inundated with Skype spam

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Lately and because the Orange Lounge Radio account

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
We've collected you know

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Hundreds of listeners over the years that have called

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Into the show

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
We will get like I just had to clean up

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Like 8 spam messages

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
As we launch for the show tonight

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Do you know what they all were?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
They were links to LinkedIn

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
That said LinkedIn and it had some weird code

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
After it and it wasn't a phish

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
LinkedIn site it was definitely LinkedIn.com

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
But I think it was some type of back door

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Injection or something I don't know

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
The reason why I bring that up

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
If they were hacked through LinkedIn

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I wonder if it wasn't part of this whole Skype thing

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Or something that's going on

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
LinkedIn got hacked a while ago

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Server hacked

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
We were binging Mr. Robot episodes as quickly as we can

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Looking for answers

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
They were saying if anything was a mistake

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
It was using LinkedIn without two factor authentication

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Nothing ever comes from LinkedIn

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
That's not true

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I'm going to stick up for LinkedIn

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
My current job

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I got through LinkedIn

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So it does work

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
So it's kind of like I'm sorry

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I have to jump to LinkedIn's defense

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I realize why a lot of people pick on them

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
But it actually fucking works

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
In some circumstances

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I got to give props for props to do

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
But it is nice to hear

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
From Sean Murray

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Unfortunately it's not anything that has to do with No Man's Sky

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
So that is still in the dark

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
So Sean Murray finally tweeted

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But the tweets were about the hack

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And nothing else

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
But at least it's one of those

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I'm glad to see you're alive

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I don't mean to sound so

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Someone's alive

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I'm glad to see he's alive

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Because I was starting to get worried

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Well it's like when Pokemon Go was radio silent

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
When they were having all their issues at launch

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
It's nice to see something

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Yeah but even Pokemon Go finally figured that out

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
After a week or two

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
The radio silence from Hello Games has been

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Deafening on this

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Because

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Isn't there talk about

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
A possible bundle pack that's going to have No Man's Sky

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
By the end of the year

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
They've still made a lot of promises for what they're going to do

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
They've got

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
It's not just that game

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
They've got a few different three-game pack

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
PlayStation 4s that are coming out

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So they have one that was

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
No Man's Sky, Uncharted 4

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Something else

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
There was another one

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Uncharted 4 and two other games

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
It's a Sony game

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Of course they're going to do some of those bundles

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I don't condone the hacking

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And it's not appropriate

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Or any of that stuff

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
With this radio silence

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I don't want to say they were asking for it

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But they were definitely

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
The longer this goes on

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And they're not saying anything

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
The fan base

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Is doing this type of shit

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Well it's kind of hard

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Especially now after how much

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
That was hyped up by Sony too

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
It's like

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Who are we going to trust anymore

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
When it comes to these big

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Games that look so amazing and stuff

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
What I'm saying is if they need to

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
They need to just rip the band-aid off

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
If they need to make the tweet that says

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
We've ended all development on No Man's Sky

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And we're moving on to our next project

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
As much as that's going to piss people

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
To fuck off

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Drop it on a Friday at 5pm

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
But as much as it's going to piss people off

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You just need to get over with

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Drop it on election day

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Yeah but there are British companies

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
That doesn't mean that they're not affected

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
That's true

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
That's actually kind of a brilliant idea

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
If you're going to drop bad news do it on election day

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Or if there's any number of political events they could bury it under

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
That's the best way to make it go away

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
That's true, that's a good thought

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Yeah, and Sjoan Undermat says

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
You can be pissed at a developer not providing updates

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
But to a point, right

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And I'm not saying, again, I'm not condoning what happened

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Or what have you

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I'm not going to go hack his email, what the hell is that going to do

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
But I've been on the internet long enough to know

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
That's what's going to happen

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Not having communication is the worst thing you can do

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
For yourself for damage control

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Yeah, anyway

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
But you know

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I want to see the best for everybody

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Involved in that situation

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
You know, I enjoyed No Man's Sky for what it is

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Because I didn't buy into the fucking hype

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
In the beginning

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
So, you know

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Although you all were so mad at me in the beginning

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
When I was like, remember when they would show

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
The No Man's Sky stuff at E3 and I'd be like

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Okay, so where's the fucking game

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Right, and people were like

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And I'm like, guess what

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
That attitude's paying off now

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It's not even that, it's just the game wasn't very good

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I mean, just the whole inventory management stuff

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Is retarded

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So that was the whole game

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And a lot of it was thrown in there just to

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Stretch the amount of time it would take to play the game

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And it's just

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Stretching out nothing is what it was

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
There was no game there

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Yeah, but there's no game in Minecraft

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
But add VR support and I'll be all over that shit again

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Alright, well

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Speaking of VR

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Microsoft, I didn't want to get too far into this

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
But Microsoft had a big event where they unveiled a surface

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
That made a lot of people very excited

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
To see that

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
They're also talking about a push

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Into virtual and augmented reality

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
There's going to be a new line

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Of virtual reality headsets

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And they're working with a host of partners for these headsets

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I should note though, this is not for the

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Xbox One, but this is for Windows 10

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Some of the partners for the headsets

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Starting at $299

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
So this was again a Microsoft VR headset

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
But you better believe though

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Ideally what they're saying is

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Running on mid-end machines

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Just regular laptops and stuff

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I'm down with that

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Then if it runs on that, it should run on

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Xbox One I would think

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Now I also do want to point out it's a wired device

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And the tracking is handled by

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Sensors on the headset itself

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
It's a little different from

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
The camera sensors

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So it does something a little bit different

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I think that's similar to the HoloLens

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Yes, most definitely

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Similar to that

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
And this should also be noted

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
That speaking of HoloLens, just because

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
This whole thing is happening, that doesn't mean HoloLens

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Is stopping development or anything

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Like that, but there is a difference

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Between AR and VR, so work

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Continues on the HoloLens

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Which, as you might remember on a previous

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Episode, I got to check out one of those dev kits

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And I thought

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
HoloLens was pretty awesome

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Did you watch the presentation for

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
What Microsoft did? No, but to be fair

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I didn't watch Apple's thing this week either

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I didn't watch Apple's thing I didn't watch any of it

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
It was funny though, after they showed off

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
The nice thing and Apple was like

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Oh, we got a touch bar

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And everyone was like, eh, fuck that shit

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
To be fair

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
It's a neat idea

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
But I got burned the last time I bought an Apple laptop

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
So I'm not doing it again

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
The virtual reality window thing that they were showing

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Was kind of cool, I thought it would be pretty neat

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I definitely still want to get a HoloLens someday

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
When the tech is actually what it's showing

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Once we're there

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Then yeah, I'll be all over that

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I think the virtual reality stuff is pretty cool

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
In that they're kind of embracing that

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
And also the other thing

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
That they showed was the app that they had

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
That you can 3D scan stuff with your phone

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Which I thought was pretty cool

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Of course they said a Windows phone

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I'm like, no, I'm not buying a Windows phone for that

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
But eventually all phones

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
So it's exciting

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That they're getting into that

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
And I think with Microsoft backing virtual reality now

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Too, I mean

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
With Windows and everything

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
It's probably going to be

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Just getting better

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
It's not going to be a fad, I think

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Alright, moving on

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Loki, a follow up to some news from last week, right?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Yes, so apparently

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Several of the video game companies

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Have been affected by this

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Voice actor strike

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
They have issued a statement

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Basically

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I'm not going to read all of this here

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Let's see if we can just cover it a little bit

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
This is a strike that did not have to happen

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
SAG-AFTRA never communicated

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
To its members

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
What was on the table

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
When on October 19th

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
It declined to counter

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
The company's last proposal

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And pushed away from negotiations

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
So obviously, I mean

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I'm guessing the stance by this

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Since I haven't read everything

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
They're kind of defending themselves

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And obviously saying, well

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Come put blame on SAG-AFTRA

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Maybe if they stayed in negotiations a little longer

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
They might be something that they would have

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
You know, been able to resolve on that

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Let's see

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And I guess the offer of a 9% increase

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And additional compensations

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Are meant for bonuses

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
For quick resolution

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
To negotiations expires on

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
December 1st

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
So that's like, it's the last offer that they have

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
This is not good though

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
That this is still going

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
The fact that this wasn't resolved in days

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Now we have to wonder if this is

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Going to be something that's going to take months to resolve

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
How long did that writer's strike go on

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
A few years ago? It was a while

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It was months

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
And so now I worry because this is going to affect

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Video games

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Now will possibly

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Games go to non-union

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I kind of think

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
The rise of a silent protagonist

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Yeah, either the rise of the silent protagonist

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Is going to start happening

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
With non-union voice actors

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I think there's plenty of people

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
That will do it

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
But it's not going to have that same star power

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And I'm not saying that I support that

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I'm just looking at the reality of it

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I think for these games to stay on target

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
They're just going to go, okay fine

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Get a non-union voice actor

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Do an internet contest

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
To find somebody to be the voice of somebody

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Like, they'll find it

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Yeah

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
But, you know

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I understand the voice actor's perspective

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
And some of the things they're asking for

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Make an awful lot of sense

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Especially when we talk about the vocal strain

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Knowing what the projects are

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Having more information on that

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
A little less secrecy for them

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And a lot of that makes sense to me

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I hope they can work it out

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Because the longer this goes on, nobody wins

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Nobody wins

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Anyhow, we'll see

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Going to chat over at

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Live.vognetwork.com

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Great, the alternative might be Chaos Wars

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Level of voice acting

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Yeah, that could

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Mean the voice acting quality is going to dip

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
A bit too

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
S2100Matt says, the Rider Strike ruined Heroes

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
In my opinion

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Oh yeah, not just that show, but several shows

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
The Rider Strike just killed those shows

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It helped some things though

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Yeah, we did get Doctor Horrible out of the Rider Strike

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
So it wasn't all bad

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
We also got a really good season of Power Rangers

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
It was the worst season they ever did a Big Brother

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Yes, how can you tell?

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
It was the winter season of Big Brother

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
It was awful, if you follow that series

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
It was the worst season they ever did

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
But that doesn't make any sense, it's supposed to be non-scripted

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
How would a Rider Strike affect a non-scripted show?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Right, but yet

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Not to get too far into reality TV

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Here's the crazy part

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
So they're doing a bonus Big Brother right now

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
That's only on the online

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And it's like the best cast one they've had in years

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Well it's because they're not using

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
The same casting agency for it

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So yeah, this is the best season of Big Brother

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
It's the one that's not even on TV

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
People who don't follow it

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Probably don't even know about

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
But it's the best season they've had in years

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
All I know about Big Brother is that

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Davon GIF that everyone shows

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
The one that's always on Twitter

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Hi!

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
She knows how to make an entrance

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
She was a great player, but

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
She was not a great player at all

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
She was an entertaining player

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That's what you really need for reality TV

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Best diary rooms of anybody

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Not once in a competition

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Kaijuto in chat says

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Big Brother over the top is the shit

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I'm not gonna lie

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
It is the best season of Big Brother since probably 11

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Don't forget to vote for Chrissy

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
As America's nominee tonight

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Shane obviously has his feelings

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
About what's going on there

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Kaijuto says

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I have the feeds on right now

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
You never know, they might break out in a fight

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Moving on

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Let's talk about Kingdom Hearts

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Because

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
If you missed Kingdom Hearts

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
It pays to wait

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
And 2.5 Remix

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
If you did not pick those up on PlayStation 3

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
You have Kingdom Hearts 4 now

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I did the math

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
You will have the ability to pick them up all over again

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
On PlayStation 4

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
It was announced this week

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Plus 2.5

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Remix

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Meaning there will be 6 games

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Well 4 games and 2 movies

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Involved in this

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Will be coming out March 9th in Japan

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
March 28th in North America

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
So for those keeping track at home

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
That's Kingdom Hearts 1, 2

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Chain of Memories

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Birth by Sleep

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And the movies for 3.58

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And Recoded

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Will not include the 2.8

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Final Chapter Prologue

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
These fucking names

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Will not include that

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Because that is a separate PlayStation 4

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Release

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
That's the one that has Dream Drop Distance

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Which is a 3DS game

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Just wait a bit longer

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Wait a bit longer

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Right before they finally bring out Kingdom Hearts 3

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
1.5, 2.5, 2.8

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And 3

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I actually preordered these

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Because I don't really have a big desire to play Kingdom Hearts

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
But to have them all on one console

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Is pretty tempting

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
And it was enough, I preordered them

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
I have the 1.5 remix on PlayStation 3 obviously

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
But when they announced 2.5

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
This was after Final Fantasy 10

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Was on PS3 and PS4

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
And I was like, uh uh

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I'm not getting those on PS3 because I know they're going to put them on PS4

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Granted, I thought it would happen a little sooner

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
But I'm glad that it's finally happening

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
What, a year later, finally

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Do they change a lot in the HD remakes?

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Because I've been playing through the original PS2

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And off and on

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Well, keep in mind, right off the bat

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
The fact that they're widescreen natively

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Is a huge change

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
These are a little bit HD-er

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Yeah, they're more HD-er

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
But they still play the original games

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
You know, and so forth

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It's interesting because you mentioned that you still use

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
A CRT TV

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
You have a CRT TV

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Right, exactly

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So since all my music games

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
A couple are on the Wii

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And we won't talk about San Bodeo Amigo right now

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
But I have a PS2

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And I tried

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
When I first moved into my place

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And I tried doing it with an HDTV

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And it just was unplayable

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
You know, it's 10 or 15 millisecond lag

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Which doesn't sound like a lot

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
But when your timing window is less than 10 milliseconds

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Then that's a big problem

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Oh, and Akdeft in chat brings up a very good point

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
These games are final mixes

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Which are better and improved versions of the original

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So it's kind of like, you know how Final Fantasy 10

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Was like the international version

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
And now 12 is going to be the Zodiac one

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And 12 is going to be the Zodiac one

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Which I'm really excited about that

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
More than Final Fantasy

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
It's really complex because you can't just make your character

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Wait, how did you play some of it?

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Possibly on an emulator on a computer

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I played a good chunk of the PS2 version

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It's really good

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Oh, the PS2 version

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Yeah, because it came out in Japan as the international

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I was like, wait, you played the remaster?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
What the fuck did you do that?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Basically because I upped all the textures

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
It looked really good

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
That's different

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
So that is the other big difference

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
That you're playing the last international version

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Or whatever

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And Akdeft points out that on PlayStation 4

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
It's all going to be in HD and 60 frames a second

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
So if your non-CRT TV is like mine

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
That has the super good refresh rate

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Where movies don't look real

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
They just look crazy

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
It's one of those smart TV things

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Where the frame rate is so good

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
It's not like it doesn't

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
TV looks different now

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
When you have that fast refresh rate

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
It just doesn't look real

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Or it looks too real

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
The realness

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Shut up

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Moving on with our next story

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
We're almost to the Classic Game of the Week

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But first, Loki

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Skyrim Special Edition

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Was just released on Friday

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And already

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
There's Bethesda bug issues

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
With the game

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
What a shock

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I'm going to die from that surprise

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
So apparently there are some issues

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
With the audio

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And this is only affecting right now

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
The PC and Xbox One versions

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
So it might not win for the PlayStation 4 guys

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Although you don't have mod support

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
So give it a take

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Apparently

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
It's that wonderful audio

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Anyways

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
The special edition features

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Dramatically compressed audio

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Sounding more muddled

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Than the game's original release

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And that I guess is the issue

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
And

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Apparently it says the vanilla game

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Sound assets

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Other than the music and voiceover

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Is in an uncompressed wave format

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
The special edition has the sound assets

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
In a very aggressively compressed

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
XWM format

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Which is compressed sound format

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Designed for games

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
This isn't so bad

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Necessarily it's possible

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
To compress the audio to

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
XWM without significant

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Quality degradation

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Unless you crank the compression

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Way up to insane levels

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
What did Bethesda do?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
They cranked the compression up to

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Insane levels

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
So it sounds like

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
They just need to patch it

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
That's probably going to be a pretty sizable patch

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
They're going to have to download the audio

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
All over again

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Boy oh boy

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
My audio will still be good on the PlayStation 4 version

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Too bad I don't got any fucking

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Good mod support for it

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I still haven't bought the game yet

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Well Alan got it for free

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Technically I have a PC I already have it

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Because I bought Skyrim a long time ago

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Well wait a minute I bought Skyrim on the PC

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
But I didn't get this new one for free

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
It is free

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
No because I don't have all the DLC

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I only have the base game

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I looked at it on the store

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
It still wanted 40 bucks

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
You think I have all the DLC on

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I'm pretty sure I have all the DLC

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I never bought any of the DLC

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Because I didn't play enough Skyrim

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Alan on the other hand played it all

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Seems like a special edition on Skyrim

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
For PCs kind of stupid

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Since there's enough mods out there

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Anyways it would probably make it look even better

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Than the special edition

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
There's way too much bloom in that

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Like the god rays

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I mean yellow tint all over the screen

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I'm hoping to check it out at some point

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
But I've got a million games

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I'm trying to play right now

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
But I did see that they have

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
The Macho Man Randy Savage mod

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Thank god

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Dragon mods all ready for Xbox

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
That's fantastic

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Unfortunately I read some modder comments

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
They're like yeah we're not supporting the Playstation 4

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
With our mods because

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Of this limitation

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
That's gonna suck

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Alright well let's take a trip down memory lane

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Back when you couldn't mod games

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Like this

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
It's a classic game

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Of the week and unfortunately

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
You guys I'm sorry to say that Radio Magic

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Is broken for the second week in a row

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
With the teleporter

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Devices that allow radio magic

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Oh right we get to do Halo again

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Yes we're doing Halo again

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
As I said last time Loki suggested we do Halo

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
And Jamie's not here

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I'm just letting you know chat

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I am your advocate here

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Alright well I thought

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
The nice thing to do since

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
We were unable to make Radio Magic happen this week

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I thought the nice thing to do was to

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Let our guest pick the classic

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Game of the week and I thought

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
This is a very creative pick from JD

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
As well so we're gonna let JD pick tonight

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
The classic game of the week and I kinda think

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Dark Sakura would approve of this

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Pick but there is no music with

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
This pick right? Correct

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And why is there no music?

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Because this is a game about stick figures

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Alright what is the classic game of the week?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
So this is Kingdom of Loathing

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
This came out in 2003 and it is a browser

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Based with lots of frames

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
It's a multiplayer online game

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
So it's an MMO

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
But it's turn based

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So you have a bunch of adventures everyday

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
In which you can go out and do stuff

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
In the world

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
It was like a BBS game on the way

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
It really was

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Black and white aesthetic to it

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
It's very lightweight

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
So the basic story is

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
You're trying to

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
The nasty sorceress is the

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Big boss at the end of the game and you're trying to

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Gain levels so that you can fight her

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
But the bulk of the game you spend

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Just doing all of the side quests

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And there's so much

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
There's a lot of pop culture references

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And puns all over the place

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Which is why it's one of my favorite games

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Like I got

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Lost just reading the wiki about all of the various

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Items in the game

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
You have 40 adventures

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Everyday

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Because there's a daily reset at a certain time of day

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And you go out and

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Just do side quests and main quests

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
You can get more adventures by eating food

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And having alcohol like just in real life

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Hooray! And if you have too much alcohol

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
You get drunk and you have bad adventures

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Or you hurt yourself

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Less hooray! Right

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
There are three

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
There are six different classes that you can be

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And there are

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Three stats

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
There's five elements

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
So like a lot of other games

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
It has elemental rock, paper, scissors

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
But they're not the same elements you may be used to

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
There's hot and cold

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
But then there's spooky stench and sleaze

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And they all fit together in different ways

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Kind of like a Pokemon

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
This is good against that and not against that

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
It's a constantly

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Evolving game

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
They have content every couple of months

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
And they're really good

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
About having in-universe explanations

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
When stuff goes wrong

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Pretty early in the game's life cycle

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
There was a lot of hacking going on

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And the currency in the game is meat

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Which is, you know, slang for money

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
But it's also

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
They really go full hog with that

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
They have meat paste and meat smithing

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Anyway, so

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I played a little bit of Kingdom of Loathing

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And I remember all these very sassy jokes

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
There's a lot at Konami

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
He's working hard, huh?

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I was a disco bandit

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Yeah, that's one of the classes

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
It looks interesting

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I've never seen this game before

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
But it's still going, right?

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Even though it qualifies as a classic game of the week

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Because it's, what, 13 years old

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
It's still going

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Because it's not a finished game either

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
It's in open beta

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Because they never have a 1.0

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Because it's continuously evolving

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
And they add on a couple of new levels

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
At the end

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
The final level used to be 11

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And now it's 13

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
That happened a bunch of years ago

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Yeah, but they continuously add on

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
New areas in the game

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
And it's all very solid

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
There's a great fan community around there

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
And lots of other stuff

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
There's a chat system

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And in order to gain access to chat

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
You have to pass a test from the ghost

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Of the English language

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Because English is just so tortured

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
It's given up the ghost

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And now you have to pass a small typing test

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
In order to get access

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Wow, this really sounds like a game Dark Soccer would approve of

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
In fact, she's probably going to be pissed you took it

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
That's alright

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I mean, there's a bunch of channels

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
There's a haiku channel

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
You get to leave after today, I know

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
The chat is all going

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
So what happens if the guest picks Halo

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Could you get away with it?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
And I'm like, I still don't want that phone call

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I'll take that phone call

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
But I'm not taking the Halo call

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I'm forwarding it to Shane's phone

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
That doesn't make sense

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Alright, anyway

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Yeah

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
There's a lot of

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
There's optional player versus player

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
But it's definitely not a big component of the game

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
It's definitely much more a cooperative aspect

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Even though it's like

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
You're generally all by yourself

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
The fan communities and the forums and such

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Are out there

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
The wiki is extensively documented

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And there's

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
This is also a game in which people love to break on it

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And see how things work

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
And in the game it's called spading

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
To figure out what exactly all the mechanics are

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
That underlie everything

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
And so every time there's a new content release

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
People try to figure it out

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And there's a lot of

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Specific details on that

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
The other thing about this game

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Is they also have a radio channel that they do

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Live 365 channel or something?

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
I don't think it's on Live 365

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Oh no, nothing is

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
They shut down this year

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
But yeah, they've had

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
A radio show going for a while as well

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Oh that's awesome

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
How do we get on that network?

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Have your people call their people

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I guess, do I gotta throw meat at them?

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
It's also a free game

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Although there are paid things you can buy

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
So there are no ads anywhere

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
And that is always really nice

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
In a free content thing

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
That you never actually have to spend real money on

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
For a web game

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
And it's not pay to win

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Like a lot of free to play games end up being

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Alright

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
So this is something that people can play now

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Yeah

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I think it's .com

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Alright

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And Shane, maybe you should go check on your character

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I wouldn't even remember my login

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Well yeah, that's the other thing

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
If you don't log in

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I think it's like two months or something

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Your character will go away

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
As a resource saving thing

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
So you do have to play it pretty often

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
So it's not like Neopets

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
I think I had a Neopet back in 2004

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Which would have been the last time I fed it

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Oh it's probably dead

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I don't think Neopets ever die

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Well I remember I joked with you

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
When you told me you were going to pick this game

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I was like, oh you should pick Neopets

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
They have another game called Word Realms

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Oh interesting

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
So there is, if you do pay

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
There's an item called a Mr. Accessory

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
That if you leave it on your character for a day

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
It'll mark your character

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Undeletable

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
So that is a thing you can do to keep it long term

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
But it means financially supporting the game

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Oh that's smart

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
There's a lot of smart stuff in this game

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Alright

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
There it is, your classic game of the week

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Kingdom of Loathing

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
It's kind of like when Jamie picked World of Warcraft

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
But it's still going strong today

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
So check that out

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Good pick

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I like the fact that it's not your typical

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Console type game

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
It's a web game

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I don't think we've had anything like that

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Cool pick

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
So there it is, your classic game of the week

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Since we did not have Radio Magic though

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
We are going to take a quick in-studio break

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
So when we come back we're going to talk plenty more

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
We're going to get to what's in stores this week

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Do some rapid fire news

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Again we're short so

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
You should send us emails sometime

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
But we will get to your calls

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
At Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Welcome back everybody

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Orange Lounge Radio live in progress

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Episode 663 for this

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
October the 30th of 2016

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
You know an appropriate game for Halloween

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Castlevania I'm sure

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
You know with spooky ghosts and things like that

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
And before the show

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Tigerclaw put a link in our chat room

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And I hadn't seen this yet

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
But I guess somebody was taking on the project

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
To remake Castlevania in Unity

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And we were watching a little bit of that in studio

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
And I was very impressed

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Was it Unreal or was it Unity?

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I thought it was Unity

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
It was one of those engines

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
That it was done on

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Let me check one more time here

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
You know why I'm probably thinking that?

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I think I saw a Zelda thing

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
That was done earlier this week that was in Unity

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
That's probably why my wires are crossing

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And that one looked really good too

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
So it's tough to

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Kind of look at this and realize that like

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
One guy did it and you're like

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
This is the type of reimagining I would like

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
To see of a Castlevania game

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I mean granted it had some flaws

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
It wasn't perfect like you could see some little graphical bugs

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And things but honestly

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I guess you could just go on there and download it

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And check it out and I'm like alright

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Lords of Shadow was a good game that first one

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I liked that reimagining it was pretty good

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Yeah alright fair enough

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
But yeah I just

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
You liked what you saw Loki of that little

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Castlevania remake? Yeah it looked cool

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Same thing so alright I liked it

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
But then let's see

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Oh Dungeon Buster says the guy also put it up

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
On Kickstarter which is not a smart move

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
That's definitely not a smart move

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
That'll draw attention

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Konami will sue

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
That's not a good idea

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
They don't have a lot going for them

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
They're going to shut you down I wouldn't go to Kickstarter with that

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Now if you want to do

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
A different game

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
That's like you know

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Oh wait you can't do that either

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
But you see where I'm going with this

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
You could do a different type of you know

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Ghosty goblin-y

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
You know type of game

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And it would be okay

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
So you might want to think about that my friend

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Alright

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Anyhow let's get into some rapid

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Fire news and talk about quickly

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
A couple other things going on in gaming this week

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Loki so if you like game soundtracks

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
And you happen to like those soundtracks in

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Vinyl well there's some good news for you

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Shovel Knight they're going to be bringing their soundtrack

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Out to Vinyl and CD

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Very soon

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
So it looks like it's going to be

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
It looks like a double LP

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And you can get the CD version for $18

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Vinyl is going to be selling for

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
$35

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
And yeah it looks

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Pretty awesome so

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I'm not sure when that's going to be available

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Looks like the 2 dispersion is on Bandcamp

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
And then the double vinyl

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Double LP is going to be on Big Wax

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
So soon

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Also the last

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Guardian

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Golden going to be coming around the corner here pretty soon

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Also getting it's soundtrack on

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Vinyl as well also going to be a double

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
LP

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
And you can get that through

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Iam8bit

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
And it's going to cost you $35

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
And I'll be coming

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
First quarter of 2017

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
And since we're on the topic of

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Fan games

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
This one thankfully won't get shut down because of

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
You know Sega's wonderful

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Stance hey fan games cool make them

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
So this is going to be one year

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
In fact you can probably do them better than we can at this point

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Yeah exactly and honestly this looks

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Kind of better than

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
No one can touch their Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Nobody will do better than that

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Maybe Arby's they're like neck and neck sometimes

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Arby's and Denny's you know

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Denny's Denny's is really great

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Go right now and look at Denny's

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Sonic Utopia

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
It's a 3D Sonic

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Game and it's

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Supposed to combine all the elements of

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
You know the best elements of

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Different Sonic games so basically

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
They wanted to expand the Sonic

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Gameplay in an intuitive 3D way

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
And also

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
They said the capture best of the Sonic

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Style and stuff the trailer

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Looked pretty cool and actually looks like

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
A lot of fun the controls I mean

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
It seemed like it would control pretty well but hey

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Don't let the trailer just

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Be the judge you can actually check out this

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Game and download it now so if you go check out

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
The trailer

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
You can also download the game

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
There's a link in the description

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I haven't yet played it yet

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
But judging by the trailer it looked like

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
You know this would probably be a

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Pretty good take on a 3D Sonic

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Game so go check it out

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Alright well

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I'm going to bring up this story and I didn't realize

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Shane would be here on tonight's show when I put

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
This in rapid fire news but I have a feeling

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Shane's going to turn this into a long form story

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Because this is about Pokemon Sun

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
and Moon and there was

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
There was a new trailer this week

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
For Pokemon Sun and Moon

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Which well wait no it's not

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
All bad news oh no I know I know what happens

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
At the end alright so

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Here's the deal is that the final

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Evolutions for the starters were

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Unveiled so you get to see the

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Brand new final forms

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Are you going to butcher their names I can't wait

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Okay

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
This is the only one I'm not sure of Decidueye

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Yeah that's good enough

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
That's how I would say it

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
That's Rowlet's final form and I like this

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
A grass ghost type

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Yes for a couple different reasons

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
People are trying to basically say

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Because the owl it's based off

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Of from what people can tell is an

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Extinct owl in Hawaii

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Called the stilt owl

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
It's also well I'll let you finish the other

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Well it also uses ghost moves

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Like spirit shackles

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Well that's because it's ghost

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
What else did you want to say?

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Oh I was going to point out the connection between the

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Secondary types in all three

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Okay alright well then let me move on

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
To Nsign

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
No I

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
I went to purposely mess it up for change

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Incineroar is the second one

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
This and of course I know that one because

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Litten will be the character

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And it's super cool oh my gosh

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
I like the WWF

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Fire belt that it wears

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I love its spinning lariat move it's so cool

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Fire dark type

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
And then the worst thing in the

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
World

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Primarina

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
That's better than what it is

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Primarina and the diamonds

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Primarina it's a real heartbreaker

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
It's not a robot Primarina is the

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Water fairy type

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Of course it's a fairy type

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And it's a mermaid

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Looking Pokemon and Shane

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Is not a fan

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
It's also based on a siren

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
So now they also unveiled

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Some other Pokemon but if you want to hear

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
On that you'll have to tune into the next episode

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Whenever that is

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
But I will bring up Alolan Persian

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Form because

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Alolan Persian looks like

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Garfield to me

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And I can't get over it like how

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Stupid it looks

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
All it did was eat some bees

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
So the other thing on the secondary types for the

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Starters finals is that ghost dark

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Fairy forms a

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Trio kind of the same way that the

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Fire water grass

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Interesting observation

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
And those are

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Like those are newer types too

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
At least dark and fairy

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Dark is gen 2 and fairy is gen 5

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Or gen 6

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
It's one of the later ones

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
And then

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Also apparently

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
You will run into

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Your old pals

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Ghost isn't strong against fairy though

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Right so it's not a complete trio

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
I guess we don't have to talk about

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
No we're just continuing the discussion

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
So red and blue

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
You will run into

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
As part of the game

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
But make sure you knock on their door

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
First before barging in

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
A lot of the stuff I've been seeing on

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Twitter lately and loving

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
But yeah apparently they're all

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Grown up now although they don't look that grown up

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
But also I want to point out

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
That blue is actually

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I can show you some pictures where they look pretty grown up

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Blue is actually wearing green

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Capri shorts and green shoes

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Probably because he's green in Japan

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Yes I know that

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
I'm just beating you to it

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I'm just questioning the choice of wardrobe here

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
That's all I'm saying

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Why are you questioning against green shorts?

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Because he looks like mom in that wardrobe

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
No he doesn't he just looks super gay

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Because that's what he is

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
If you watch the trailer and he throws out his Pokemon

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
And then you see him standing behind it

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Is the flammiest pose I've ever seen

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Any character in Pokemon

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Is flammier than a male Primarina

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
And like

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Go for real

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Load it up while I can continue talking about Pokemon

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
And then Red has a 96

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
On his shirt to you know

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Harken back to the fact that they came out in Japan

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Oh I just thought it was 69 upside down

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
That's all

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
You want me to show you pictures?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
No no my god

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
The things you see

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
On Tumblr you can't unsee

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
You've been tweeting enough

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Yeah I just retweet whenever I see

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
If it's like ugly

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Well to be fair so have I

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
If you just go to Shane and Linko on Twitter

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I was going to say man that Pokestop Podcast

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Feed is going to be very interesting

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Oh god I'm just going to

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I'm just going to leave the room for 30 minutes

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
While Shane just reads

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Tumblr porn about Red and Blue

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Well it's not going to be hard to do

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I think it's just images at this point mostly

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Anyway there you go

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
You didn't even talk about

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Other things that happen in the trailer

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Because I'm making people wait for the next episode of the Pokestop Podcast

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Hey also guys if you have the demo

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
There's a demo event today

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
So you better go do it before your timezone changes

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Now

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
You can check this out if you're in Japan

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Anyway because I don't think it's coming here

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Kunio-kun

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Nekketsu complete Famicom

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Series is coming out December 8th in Japan

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
This is a 3DS game

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
That's coming out for 4,800 yen

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Or you can download it for a little cheaper

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
4,444 yen

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Arc System Works is putting this out

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
And it's going to come with some themes

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
And so forth but you might be wondering

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Well what is this game?

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Well this is a collection of every

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Kunio-kun game that was released

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
For the Famicom

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
This means River City Ransom

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Super Dodge Ball

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Renegade

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Crash and the Boys Street Challenge

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
And other games that never even came out over here

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Featuring those same characters

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
It's a very unique art style of characters

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And I'm sure a lot of you know River City Ransom

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
And Super Dodge Ball

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
So this is a collection of all those games

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
There is all to be said 11 games in the collection

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
So it looks like it's going to be a pretty

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Kickass collection

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Boy it's a bummer the 3DS isn't region free

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Yeah thanks Nintendo

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Just have a Japanese 3DS like what I'm playing right now

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
To be fair they may be switching that

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
With the Switch

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Apparently the Switch is region free

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
If you believe rumors

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I don't

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I believe in disappointment

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Alright let's travel around

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
And look at what's coming out in stores this week

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
So this week since we're getting

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Into November it's going to be pretty busy

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
So we've got Earth's Dawn coming out

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
On PC, PlayStation 4 and

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Xbox One

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
The wonderful indie game Owlboy is coming out on

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
PC definitely check that out because it looks fantastic

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Root Letter

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
On PlayStation 4 and Vita

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Seraph on PlayStation 4

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Super Dungeon

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Brothers on PC

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And no I don't think this has

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Anything to do with Xanadu the movie

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
But Xanadu Next is coming out

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
On PC

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Call of Duty Infinite Warfare on

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
One, Football Man

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Who's going to buy that?

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Some people, it's space

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Couple people, it's a niche title

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Yeah

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Football Manager 17

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
On PC, Mac and Linux

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Mario Party Star Rush on

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
3DS

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Moto Racer 4 on PC, Mac

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
And PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
And that's it

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Alright so Call of Duty probably the

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Big deal game of the week that a lot of people

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Oh and I'm sorry I did miss

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
BlazBlue Central Fiction on

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
How could you miss yet another BlazBlue release?

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
How could you?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I kind of want to check out Call of Duty

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
I like the campaigns, I'm weird like that

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Remember, wasn't that that trailer

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
At E3 that everybody was kind of going

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Oh what's this, this is like a space game

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
This looks like it would be cool, and then it's like

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Call of Duty and everybody's like, oh they just fucking

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
bait and switch to us, that's fucking rude

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Like

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I think a lot of us kind of had that reaction

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I don't know, I may hold off on it because I bought

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Infinite Warfare, or not Infinite Warfare

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Advanced Warfare

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
The last one before Black Ops 3 was

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
And like I bought it and I was like

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Oh season pass, I'm gonna go gung-ho multiplayer

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Have not played a thing on it

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
It's like a waste of money

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Just throwing it up, throwing off that money

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And just a quick FYI from the chatroom

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Loki's Xanadu

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Not a Olivia Newton-John movie

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Dungeon Buster clarifying

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Xanadu next is another of

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Falcom's RPGs, that's the

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
studio behind the Ys series

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Not to be confused with Ys

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
It's Ys, that's how you say it

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
So yeah, it's that

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
same type of game

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
RPG in that fashion

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Based around the Xanadu movie

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Yes, where it's starring a roller rink

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
And cartoon sequences

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
that make no damn sense and so forth

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Alright, anyway

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
That is such a good movie though

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Moving on, oh actually now see

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Rageonator brings up, I remember

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Fushanadu, or in fact

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Xanadu is what a lot of people said

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Pretty good game and I love the title

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Screen theme, that was a great NES game

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I love that game to this day

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Great game, anyway

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Let's travel to Japan, quick, everybody on the plane

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Let's go, whee, alright

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Coming out in Japan on

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
November the 2nd on the PlayStation 4

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
And Atelier Firis

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Fushigi Na Taibo no

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Renken Jutsuji

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
In a regular premium box

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Special collection box with a music

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Combo set for

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
349 bucks

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
That's a lot of money

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
So yeah, that is all stuff to look forward to

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
This week in Japan on the PlayStation 4

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I don't think

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
There's anything of note on the Wii U

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
I think things are very quiet over there

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
So look at the handhelds real quick

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
On the Nintendo 3DS

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Actually there's nothing on the 3DS this week

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
They're getting pumped up for Sun and Moon

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
There's a new, yeah I was gonna say the new

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
3DS XL Sun and Moon edition

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
That's it, there's really nothing

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
It's kinda, kinda quiet on the 3DS

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Well, at least you still have

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
releases on the Vita where that same

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Atelier Firis game is

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
also being released on

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
the 3rd

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
And that seems to be the tent pole for the week

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I'm not familiar with that series

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
But that must be, what is that called

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
over here? Do they have that series here?

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Which one? Atelier

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Yeah they have Atelier

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I just never got into this series then

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
They have a ton of them

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
It was like about once a year

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
So yeah, that's a big release in Japan this week

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
It looks like at least the only one that's releasing over there

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
So that's pretty much it for Japanese releases

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Alright, well

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
PC's not, or I'm sorry

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Europe is not getting much

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Including, well, Football Manager 2017 on PC

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
It doesn't list it but I'm pretty sure

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Call of Duty Infinite Warfare is also coming out

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
the same day there as well

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
That's it

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Alright

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Let's get back into some news

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Because usually we would do the mailbag right now

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
But the mailbag's empty

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
That's the second week in a row

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Is it because you guys miss Jamie?

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I understand. Do you miss Jamie criticizing your emails?

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
If you want, I'll criticize your grammar

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I'll do it

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
I'll make Shane read emails or something

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
He'll love that

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
He'll criticize your name

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
He'll criticize wherever you're emailing us from

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Your opinion is probably garbage

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
So I'll criticize that too

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
It's a show where every gamer has a voice

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
And then Shane yells back at said voice

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Anyway, participate

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
I don't deal with stupidity so if you're going to be stupid

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Just watch out

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
We don't have stupid listeners, Shane

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Well, do you want me to start?

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
And don't worry

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Shane's going to be too lazy to show up to the show next week

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Probably so

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
He will be too busy playing more Pokemon or something

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Alright

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Actually, you could send an email where you rant about Shane

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I would love that

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
And then I'll come over

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
That would be hilarious

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Especially because he moved

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And now he's a little bit closer

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Not too close, far enough away

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
What would happen is I'd read the email

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
This is John Doe

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
And I'm emailing him

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Talking about how much I hate Shane

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
By the time I'd be done reading the email

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Shane wouldn't even knock

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
He'd just barge through the door

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
And he'd just say, hold on a minute

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I got something to say

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I got something to say

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Alright, let's get back into some news

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Aw, strangers with candy

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
You know last night at Rocky Horror

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I made a strangers with candy joke on TV

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I said something about going back to high school

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
And I said, I was a user, a boozer, and a loser

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And I counted

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Two people in the audience laughed

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
See, you're just pointing out all the reasons

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Why that is a stupid thing to go to

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Shut up

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
You should have thrown in, I stole the TV

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I know, I should have

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Did you catch that joke?

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Oh my god, it's only the best

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Okay, is it still on Netflix and Hulu

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
No, it's not on Netflix

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
It might be on Hulu still

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
But it's long gone from Netflix

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Okay, I'm telling you guys, strangers with candy

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Which was a

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Comedy central show in the late 90s

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Late 90s, early 2000s

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
It stars Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Before he had the whole success

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Of the Daily Show

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
And they're on this show

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
And it's about a 40 year old woman

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
That goes back to high school

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
After she was in jail, basically, for so long

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
It's so good

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
It's a parody of those self-help movies

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
From the 70s

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I've seen the movie, it's on YouTube

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
That it's all based on

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I was at my rock bottom

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
It's like one of those scared stiffs

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
It's still on Hulu

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Is that the Hulu Plus or the Hulu Free?

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
There is no Hulu Free anymore

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Get rid of it

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
But if you have Hulu, check out Strangers with Candy

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Because it is Rob Roberts' favorite TV show ever made

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
There is a movie too

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Yeah, I think the movie's not that great

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
The movie's not as good as the show

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
But it's a good cheat

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
It's a good cheat

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Wasn't the movie the one where she stabbed somebody with a fork

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Or something like that?

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I think so, yeah

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
I do have to say, not having seen Strangers with Candy

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Was that episode really confusing?

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Oh yeah, because they did the trivia

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
That's right, no, none of that would have made sense

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
If you've never seen Strangers with Candy

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
So you owe it to yourself to watch this show

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
And you should watch the episode

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
The spelling episode

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
The spelling bean

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
And...

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
That's probably the best episode of the show they ever did

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
That was in the second season

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
I don't know, because there's also the one with the blind guy

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
And that one's really good too

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
What's the name of that episode?

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Wait, is it that one?

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
No, it's the blank page

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
That's it

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
And then it's the fourth episode

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
In the first season

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Who Wants Cake

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
That is great

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
And Stephen Colbert's character

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
In that show

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Is the funniest thing in the world

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
So please do yourself a favor

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
And watch that show

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
There you go

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Kaijuto says

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
It was just the echo of Rob's laugh

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
And the silence

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Oh no, there were definitely people laughing

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
There were people laughing loudly

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Just there weren't very many of them

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
So the people who got it really loved it

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Yeah

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
And I'm not afraid to waste everybody's time

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
With a joke that only two people are gonna get

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And really get

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
I mean, that's kind of the beauty of Rocky

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
A lot of things will just fly over your head if you don't get it

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
But it's funny for the people who are there for it

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
It is, it is

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Alright, see what happens when you don't email us

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
We talk about Hulu

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Alright, let's move on

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
With some more gaming news stories

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
So once again, this was something I didn't actually

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Watch, I was busy watching

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
The Microsoft conference

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
And apparently there was an Apple conference

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Going on at the same time, or near

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
The same time

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Close enough

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I just didn't care

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
But yeah, they were talking

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
A little bit about Apple TV

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
One thing I wanted to mention is

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Hey, Minecraft is coming to Apple TV

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Because Minecraft is coming to everything

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Something that is kind of cool about it

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
You will be able to play your Minecraft worlds

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
With other users that are also on other Apple devices

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Like iPads and iPhones

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
And

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Yeah

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
And that's coming at some point

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
So you like Minecraft

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Do you think this is a good idea for Apple TV?

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Sure, I mean, it's always good to have

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
More things that it can do

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
I mean, I didn't get an Apple

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I looked at

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
I talked someone out of getting an Apple TV

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Because they were looking for streaming devices

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
For their home, and it's like, oh yeah

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
This doesn't have a remote on it

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Your remote is an iPhone

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
It's like, no it's not, you get a remote

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
With Apple TVs, not that one

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
That I looked at, they should all come with them

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
They come with a really garbage one, but yeah

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
They should have a little silver one, yeah

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
But then again, this is a qualified

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Walmart employee, so

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Very possible that he did no shit

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Just saying, no

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Hey, yeah, you

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Know that you need an

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
iPhone to control, and I was like

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Fuck that shit

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Yeah, no, the guy was an idiot, because they

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Definitely come with remotes, I've seen it

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I thought so, but he was very insistent

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
And I was like, well I'm not going to have you buy this

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
When you can just buy Roku for 40 bucks

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
So forget it

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Alright, well I'm kind of surprised

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
That there isn't more gaming on Apple

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
TV, like I know there was like that harmonics

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Game, and there's a few things here and there, but it's just like

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
You feel like

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
How long do you think it is going to be before they get into VR

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Because I have a feeling that Apple will try to

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Do something, you know

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I'm really surprised they haven't, but sometimes

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
They show up to the party late, and they'll put their own

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Little spin on it, they have to figure out how to market it

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Like they market all the other stuff, you know what I mean

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
We're Apple, we're releasing something, go buy it

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Yeah, we'll see

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Anyway, well speaking of the Apple

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Platform, one thing that people are very much

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Looking forward to is Super Mario

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Run, now obviously

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
This isn't restricted to just the Apple

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Platform, although I think it's coming out there first

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Before it comes out on the Android devices

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Just like every game

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Not always, Ingress was on Android

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Before it was on iOS, of course

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
But only because it was developed by Google

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
It was developed by a spin-off Google team, yeah

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Anyway, so apparently

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Nintendo is really determined to make

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
This a huge game

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
This was in an interview with Bloomberg

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Where Tatsume Kimishima

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Who of course is the president

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Of Nintendo right now, said

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
In terms of expectations, we all saw what happened

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
When we delivered Pokemon Go

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
You delivered Pokemon Go?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Hold on

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Nintendo really didn't do anything with Pokemon Go

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Let's get that clear first

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
They provided the intellectual property

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
That's it, but anyway

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
In terms of expectations, we all saw what happened when we

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Delivered Pokemon Go, and honestly I was quite surprised by it

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Myself, there's no doubt that

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
More people are using smartphones to play games

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
And at this time we're using

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
And as this time we're using

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Mario, that's a very important

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Intellectual property for us

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
And that's what Miyamoto's team is working on now

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Making sure it spreads out

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Just as quickly as Pokemon Go

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
More than 20 million people

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Have already registered to receive

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Notifications when the game is available

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Continuing with some comments

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
In terms of the game itself

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
You can download it and play a certain part of it

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
And then pay a fixed price

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
And play it over and over as many times as you want

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Without having to pay anything extra

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
And that should give peace of mind that kids can play it

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
And we're hoping that it will help it become

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
More popular

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
So there's no limited Pokeballs

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Or incubators or any of that stuff

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
So it will be one fee

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
That's going to be the whole game

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
We knew that was coming, they've said that before

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
It was going to be one of those typical iPhone games

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
It's basically now everything's shareware

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Again, you get the first episode free

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
You've got to pay to unlock it

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
That's what Super Mario Run is going to be

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
It's going to be shareware

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
I mean, I like the shareware model

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Those are my first games

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I like that model

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Bigger than Pokemon Go, Loki?

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I would way rather something be shareware for real

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Than to try to be freemium

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
And just nickel and dime you out of everything

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
You know

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
If they're talking about the biggest Pokemon Go at launch

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
No, and I'll tell you why

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Pokemon Go is free, for one

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Pokemon Go was kind of a unique gameplay thing

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Where actually

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
People were never really exposed to this kind of

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Augmented reality thing

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Versus a licensed runner

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
I'm sorry

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Even if it is Mario

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
It'll be popular

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Don't get me wrong, but they're not going to

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Fucking do news stories about it

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
People aren't gathering at fucking parks for it

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
It's not going to be like that

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Because it's not bringing anything that unique

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
To the table

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
It's a Mario game, which people have been waiting for

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
But it's a fucking runner

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
I'm sorry, it's just kind of

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Whatever, cool

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
I think the game will be huge

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
It will be Candy Crush huge

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
It will be, you know, draw something huge

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
It will not be Pokemon Go huge

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Because, and you're kind of hitting the nail on the head

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
It's not going to have that same effect

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Where it's on the news and all this stuff

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Because it's not a social game

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Pokemon Go became a very social thing

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Where you got together with friends

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
And you all downloaded the game

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
And you went out into the real world

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
And there's all the, oh you're walking and exercising

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
There's nothing like this

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Mario Run's not going to have that

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
But that's not to say the game's not going to do extremely well

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
It's going to do very well for Nintendo

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
It's going to be number one in the store

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
For some time

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
It's just not going to be Pokemon Go levels

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
And also if it's a purchase game

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Even if people don't like it, then they buy it

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Because it's Mario, that's going to drive a lot of sales

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
And that actually, that's the thing

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I really hope it's a good game

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
But the fact that they have a part of it that's free

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
If it's not a great game

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
You're not going to get that conversion I think

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
That's true

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
I still think people will download it

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Just because it's Mario

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Well they'll download it, but they might not buy it

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
And Nintendo's only going to report on who downloads it

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
They're not going to report on who buys it

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Anyway, MXC in chat says

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Could it be bigger than Pokemon Go

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Since it will be iOS exclusive to start

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
That's a very good point

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Well Pokemon Go couldn't afford to be only iOS only at start

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Because then it would have locked out these situations

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Like if JD and I wanted to go to Old Town Sack or something to play

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
We couldn't do it because JD's on Android and I'm on iOS

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
So it would have cut that element out of it

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Now with Super Mario Run, again

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Because the social element isn't the same

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
They can get away with doing that

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
But you bring up a darn good point

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
How can they meet those kind of numbers

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000
When it's not even going to be on both platforms at first

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
And I think it also may show Nintendo a little bit though

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
It should really show them

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Because they've kind of missed the boat on a lot of this social gaming stuff for a very long time

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
I mean, yeah, sure, Miiverse

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I know they're very big on parties in the same room and so forth

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
But there's a whole other element to online gaming

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
That Nintendo's just kind of slept on for a long time

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Well, I think they also don't know how to handle it

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Because Nintendo is so focused on their family friendly, all ages audience

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000
And you just can't subject that to the internet without losing some of that

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.000
You know, that's I think one of the reasons why

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.000
All of the chat and the friending and stuff is so locked down on all of the things

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Doing a code exchange handshake thing like with DS and all of that

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
It's designed to make sure you're not just adding random people

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.000
That's why Nintendo is not very good at social

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Because it's not designed to be explosive, viral, social growth

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I'm a little pissed they took away my swap notes so I can't send my friend's dicks anymore

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
On 3DS

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Good thing you have Snapchat for that

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
But that's not Nintendo

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
See, it's a missed opportunity

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
I can't send to Snapchat and have it go

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Nintendo needs to put Mario stickers in Snapchat

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Maybe they will when Super Mario Run comes out, who knows

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Alright, moving on, Loki

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
So there's some more developments in the ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
The two main points from this

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:03.000
One, they are issuing a subpoena to Samsung

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:09.000
To basically get some information related to Samsung's use of the source code and technology

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Provided by Oculus in order to create the Samsung Gear VR

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000
So because of that they have to comply within three weeks

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I guess of this lawsuit

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000
The other thing is that they are issuing

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:35.000
They want Oculus to provide the imaging of the hard drive from John Carmack

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
As part of this discovery right now

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
It's interesting to see they're dragging Samsung into this as well

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000
God, I hope there's no Hillary Clinton emails on that

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Let's not even go there

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
I'm a little late for that now

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
You know, a couple more days

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Sorry, I couldn't help myself

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
People will not just shut the fuck up about it

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Never could the FBI director

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Does she have any porn or emails?

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Because that's really all that I'm interested in

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
She's getting subscriptions from like

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I'm sure that it's not in hers

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Alright, back to

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Then again, if you've been reading about where the emails were found

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Maybe there was porn there, but nobody wants to see it

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Anyway, back to

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Back to the ZeniMax Oculus thing

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
So what, any chance they're going to settle out of court?

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Isn't that how these

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
All these lawsuit stories are

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
And then they settle out of court

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I think ZeniMax has the eye and the prize there

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
They're hoping to get the big payout

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
So I don't think there's going to be any settling

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000
If ZeniMax does end up winning

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Can you use that money to please patch your games?

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Fix that shit?

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Because, I don't know

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Well, if you are a fan of classic games

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Like us here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
You can be

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Confident that GameStop is trying to build up more of the classic gaming

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
In their stores

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Which is ironic because they stopped taking trades of classic games

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Not too long ago

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Yeah, they were kind of like, nah, we're kind of over that

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
But now they're back doing it

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
GameStop is now accepting retro consoles as trade-ins

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
This originally was a pilot thing

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
But it was a success

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
So all stores nationwide

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Will now accept NESes, Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast games

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:26.000
They will also take Sega Saturns, Game Boy Colors in advance, GameCube, and Xbox

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Are they just taking them or are they selling them again?

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I think they are taking them

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
And they're probably either selling them online

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Or I know the way they used to do it

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Is like one store in the area was kind of like the retro store

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
But I don't know what they're doing now

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
As far as the turnaround

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
I don't know if they're selling them online

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
But sell them on eBay

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Yeah, I mean it seems like if all they're going to do is just sell it online

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Like it doesn't make any sense from the consumer's perspective

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
To not just do it at all

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Like if I were to buy a retro console

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
I sure as hell wouldn't buy it from GameStop

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
I'd buy it from eBay

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Or some other online source

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Or from another independent game store that would probably have that stuff

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
I think there's going to be a lot of people though

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
That dig up these cartridges

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
And then they hear that, oh, GameStop's buying these

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
They're going to go unload the games at GameStop

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Because they don't

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Yeah, they're hoping that

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Oh, hey, look at you

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
You got a nice sealed Chrono Trigger there

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
We'll give you two cents for that

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Yeah, exactly, right? We'll give you $2.50

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
In-store credit

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Anyway, I mean

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
I'm a big retro game fan

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
So I guess this is cool

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I like going to flea markets

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
And finding stuff there

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Sometimes you find some gems there

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Although the people who specialize

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
In selling games at flea markets

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
They know what they're doing

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
You're not going to find deals there

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
But sometimes you find games amongst other stuff

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And that's where you find the best stuff

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Yard sales

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Yeah, it's basically yard sales, for sure

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
But I guess that's cool that all the retro stuff

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Is kind of coming back

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I find it very interesting that Genesis

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Is in that list because I think back to

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
We were at Target today

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
And one thing I noticed in the video game area

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
There's an Atari Flashback 7

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
For God's sake, they're up to 7

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
How different new stuff could they

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Possibly have on that now?

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
It's got to be HDMI at this point

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Yeah, I'm sure they've judged

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
HDMI, man, I'm sure the upscaling

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Of that 4-bit graphics

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
But then

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
They also had a Genesis

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
System that had a bunch

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Of the Sonic games, of course

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Altered Beast, which you'd expect

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
And I guess somehow, amongst the

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Midway closure, they picked

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Up the rights to Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
The Genesis versions

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
So those are all on there as well

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
And then I believe the Genesis flashbacks have

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Some homegrown games on them

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
In fact, you notice when you look at the back of the box

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Some of the pictures are big

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Which are all like the Sega games

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
And there's a bunch of small pictures

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I've never heard of any of these games

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I think they're homegrown games that are in there

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
So that's kind of interesting that they do that with Flashback

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Yeah, they did that with the Coleco one

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
These aren't very good

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
But I think the Atari one does that too

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I think some of those games on there are homegrown games

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
But then there also was a Genesis

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Portable system that was like

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
The exact same thing, it was like a Flashback

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
But they actually called it

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
A Game Gear

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Flashback or something

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
It was like the name, it actually had a little

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Tie-in to what the Sega handheld

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Used to be called

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And you could have a handheld

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
One of these, and it was relatively

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Cheap, I think it was only like 30 bucks

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
For the handheld

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
But I still didn't buy one

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Because I'm like, okay, I don't need

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
A Genesis handheld, I'm never going to play it

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
But I thought that was neat that that was

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Out there, but also the reason why I bring that up

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Is that kind of stuff

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Is kind of becoming more and more where it's like

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
You have the consoles with the games built in

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Is there going to be a market of people

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Looking to buy a second-hand Genesis system

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
At GameStop

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Some people there are collectors

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Probably, but I just don't know

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
If you'd really want to do it that route

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Because it would be cheaper probably

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Just to buy a system that has a lot of that stuff

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Built in, or even buy one of those systems

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Buy a flash card, if you're not looking

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
To collect the actual stuff

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
You're just looking for those games

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Buy a flash card, really cheap

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
And then download all the ROMs to it

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Or you can buy

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
The Nintendo Classic system that's coming out in a couple weeks

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Thank you for bringing that up

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Because I was going to say, Nintendo is also getting into this game

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Big time, I'm sure a lot of you

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Are looking at that Nintendo

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Classic thing that's coming out

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
That's coming out in two weeks

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Yeah, next week really

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Well, not next week, but the week after next

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Very, very soon

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Yeah

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Cool

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Alright, so yeah

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Those are some things you can trade in at GameStop

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Who probably also sells

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
The Flashback consoles, I imagine they have to

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Alright

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
In any sense they will

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Well, it might depend on the size of the store too

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
The mall ones that are really small may not have room for them

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
But the one we were at today was a strip mall one

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
That's huge, so some of the GameStops are a lot bigger than others

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Alright, anyway

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Let's move on, Loki, one more story from you

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And then we're going to get calls here soon

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Okay, so this is pretty cool

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I have no interest in going to Blizzcon

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
But

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Now I have slightly more interest

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
If I were going

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Weirdo Yankovic

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
This is going to be the actual

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Music act at Blizzcon

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
This year

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
And that is the best band

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Musician whatever they've ever had

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Closing the show at Blizzcon

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I'm sorry, and by the way

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Remember earlier in the show I said Metallica

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Did it one year

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Blink 182 did it recently

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
And I'm trying to think, they've had a lot of those

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Types of bands

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Right, we were talking about the different types of music

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Well, it's always been kind of like that type of music

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
It's awesome that Weirdo Yankovic is doing it

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
It's a great choice

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
And it kind of makes you go, why haven't they done this before?

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Why didn't they have Weirdo Owl before?

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Maybe this first year it worked out

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
He's just such a geek, you know

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
And there's great overlap there

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Yeah, it's great overlap

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
That almost, almost

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I'm not going to, but it almost makes me want to buy the stream

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
I might

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
He's probably listening

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Maybe I'll buy it for Allen

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
If they have an Overwatch

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Because he plays a lot of Overwatch

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
So I think Allen would really appreciate it

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
They do have a Bastion skin

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Do they? Well, he never plays Bastion

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
So maybe I don't need to get it for him

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
If you're interested in that virtual ticket

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
$40 gets you the concert

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
As well as the panels and the rest of the show

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
I mean, it's cheaper than a concert ticket

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Oh no, that's next weekend, isn't it?

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Yeah, November 4th

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
It's not Veterans Day weekend

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Like it usually is, it's the weekend before

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
So that's pretty cool

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
I'm excited, yay Weird Al

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
And what a great choice there

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
I hope the concert blows the roof off

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
And Blizzard goes, we should do more music like this

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
In the future

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Anyhow, so here we are towards the end of the show

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
And usually the phrase

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Would be something a little different

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
But I think tonight we should best say

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Last and certainly least

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
We have a story

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
About

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Uwe Boll

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Remember him? Do you remember Uwe Boll?

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Isn't he the guy who did the lawsuit over Kadabra?

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Or no, that's Yuri Geller

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
No, no

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
No, you think he's somebody else

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Uwe Boll was the great

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Director

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Of video game movies

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Such as House of the Dead

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Alone in the Dark

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Postal

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
BloodRayne

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Name of the King, a dungeon siege tale

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Well folks, it was announced this week

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
That Uwe Boll

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Is retiring from

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Filmmaking, that's right

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
He's chosen to retire from the film industry

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Because, shock of shocks

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
He was no longer making money from it

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Can't imagine why

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Actually he was saying that he was

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Losing capital financing his movies

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Himself, in a quote he said

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
The market is dead

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
You don't make any money anymore on movies

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Because the DVD and Blu-ray market

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Worldwide has dropped 80%

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
In the last three years

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
That is the real reason I just cannot

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Afford to make movies

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Well

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Yeah, you can't

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Uwe Boll

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
You could sell your movies to Netflix

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Or Amazon or Hulu

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
If they were any fucking good

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
At all

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
But that's the part that's missing

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Is these movies

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Are

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Shit

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
They're really bad

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Unfortunately

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I think there's a Roku app for that

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I kind of want a movie app called Shitflix

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
That's just like really bad movies

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I'm pretty sure there's like

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Gonna be like pornos called that

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Uh oh

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Well no, I like that though

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
No, I like that like really bad B movies

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
There's a lot of interesting

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Apps on the Roku that are

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
You know, have to do with films and stuff

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
There might be just like an equivalent of the Razzie

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
You know like

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Anyway, Uwe Boll

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Continued to rant saying

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
I've been using my money since 2005

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
And if I hadn't made this stupid video game

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Based movies, I would never

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Have amalgamated the capital

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
So I could say, let's make the Darfur movie

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
I don't need a Ferrari, I don't need a yacht

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
I'm invested in my own movies and I

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Lost money

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
By the way, he has one more film coming out

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
It's his final director effort

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
It's called Rampage, President Down

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Please tell me that's not based on

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I hope it isn't, please

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Please

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
That would be an interesting game to turn into a movie

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Well, Uwe Boll

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
I got two words for you

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Bye Felicia

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Now you gotta find out about this

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Rampage

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Rageinator in chat says

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
In fairness, his movies

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
They have a trailer, it looks generic

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
In fairness, his movies have to improve

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Dramatically to qualify as shit

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
You insulted shit movies everywhere

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
I apologize

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I apologize deeply

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
You gotta love the

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Tagline

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
This bill will not be vetoed

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Really?

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
That's just bad

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
For some reason I hear Arnold Schwarzenegger in my mind

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Saying that line

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Not to be vetoed

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Do not veto it

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Who stars in this movie?

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
I use my quote

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Who's starring in this movie?

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Who's featured?

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Yeah, I was trying to read the plot here

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Bill Williamson is back

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Alive and well

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I guess this is a sequel to something

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
So his name is actually William Williamson?

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Hey, wait a minute

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Don't make fun of him

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Don't make fun of him

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Yes, Bill Williamson is back

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
and alive and well

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Doing a recon mission around DC this time

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
This time he wants to cause

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
major population disruption

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
within the USA

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
which will result in a devastating consequence

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
reverberating

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
throughout the world

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
His new mission this time is to bring down

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
the president of the United States

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
and his secret service detail

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Bill brings with him

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
an all freakin'

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
havoc and acidity

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
This is a third

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
of a series of movies?

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
It sounds so generic

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
There's like no plot to it

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Guy goes after president

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Bill Bill Bill goes after president

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
And it's like Sharknado

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
will make more money

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Now that's a good shit movie

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Because it's not a generic movie

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
It's just over the top

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
This isn't over the top

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
This is like, crap

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
If it was like, yes

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
and Bill Williamson is coming back

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
with his, you know

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
cannon or something like that that fires live sharks

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
William Williamson

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
and Rob Roberts

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
You should do like a Saints Row movie

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Just make it, well actually they should just

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
do a Saints Row movie would be fantastic

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
You need to find your third co-star

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
John Johnson

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Right? Right? I do need to

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
But yeah, this is starring

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
and I have no

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
I honestly do not recognize

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
any of the names on this

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
but we've got

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Is there anybody that

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
No

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
There's no names

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Bill Williamson is played by Brendan Fletcher

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
And we've got Bruce

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Blaine, Loretta Walsh

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Zane McG-

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Okay, I don't even fucking know

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
None of these people

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
These are the actors

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Save us from a Nuevo film discussion please

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
If you want to give us a call

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
We can talk about anything that we've discussed so far

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Or perhaps

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
You have something new you'd like to discuss

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Again, it's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
on Skype

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
While we wait for some calls to come in

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Loki, do you have anything, last minute story you want to discuss here?

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Oh goodie, Uwe Boll plays a part in the movie himself

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
He is Rampage Killer number two

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Because he's just like Alfred Hitchcock

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Just like him

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
He's just like M. Night Shyamalan

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Just like him

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Just like him, exactly

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Remember when Lady in the Water was like

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
If that was like watching M. Night Shyamalan

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Blow himself on it

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
It was so bad too

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Because all the other movies were pretty good

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
It's like, oh man, I wonder what this is going to be like

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Oh man, this is so fucking terrible

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Actually, I think, wasn't the village before that?

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
The village was before that

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I thought the village was okay to me

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
I did not hate the village

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I didn't like the village

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Lady in the Water and then The Happening

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
The Happening was so bad

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Oh and The Visit was so bad

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I mean, the village and The Sixth Sense

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Are the only two Shyamalan movies I've seen

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
So maybe that affects my opinion

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
A lot of people liked Signs

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
The ending kind of made people go

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Like literally, fuck you

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Signs could have been so much better than what it was

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Unbreakable was pretty good though

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Oh yeah, Unbreakable was great

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
That was a great movie

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
The ending for that was probably one of the best

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Out of any of his movies, that was a great twist ending

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
So, anyway

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Orange Lawns Radio, all one word on Skype

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
If you want to give us a call

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Any last minute stories here?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
No, slow

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Slow news week

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
It's slow. Alright, well you know

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Things are so slow around here, I think we should

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Probably take a moment

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
To do a little bit of ranting

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
You know, because I think we missed this last week

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
So, I'm going to take an opportunity to do

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
The FUs of the week

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
So with that

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Here is justice

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Here is punishment

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Here is

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
This is fucked up

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Loki

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
My FUs week goes to Microsoft

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
For their wonderful Windows 10 updates

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Because all that happened

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
During the week I was awake

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I was ready to work on my game

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
There was an update that needed to be done

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I was like, damn, I'll just do the update real fast

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
And then be done with it

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
And on top of that it screwed up my touchpad again

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Trying to install some sort of driver's port

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
That don't really work with it

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
And it's still not quite right

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Even after I uninstalled it

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
It's just very twitchy now

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Thanks a lot

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Shane, do you have any FUs you'd like to get out

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Of the system?

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
FU to Walgreens for not having

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
The Power Ranger toys I want

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Same with you, Target

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
But otherwise, no

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
My FU of the week goes to Shane

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
For calling me fat

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
There's a whole story behind it

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
And I didn't do it on the show

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
But I'm going to before it's over

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
And I'll find a way

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Shane called me fat today

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
No, because you implied you were

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
And I was like, I didn't say that

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
And you kept pushing me

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
So I was like, okay then, you're fat

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
JD, do you have an FU of the week?

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
The cost of airfare

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
I found out I need to fly back to Florida

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
And that's the worst time

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
The worst time to go

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
That you need to go

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
FU to that

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
FU to airfare

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
It sucks

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Alright

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Well, we've got one call coming in

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Let's get to it

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio, who's this?

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Hi, this is Ragingator

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Hi Ragingator, what's on your mind tonight?

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Just two questions

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Unfortunately, they're probably going to entail

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
answers

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Well, no

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I know it's a little bit early for this

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
But since

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
it's just a matter of a few weeks away

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Obviously

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Thanksgiving

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
is coming up, which means Black Friday

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
and sales and whatnot

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
And chances are

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
all the major retailers are going to

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
be having their sales

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Plus, obviously, Steam

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
That being said, are there any

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
names that you folks are looking

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
forward to picking up if they

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
go on sale? Anything you have your eyes

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
on during a Black Friday sale

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
You know, since Shane can't

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
find three games for me to buy during

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
a Target sale that's going on right now

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
I don't know about a Black Friday sale I found them, you just didn't want them

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I don't know why Well, you know

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
as far as Steam goes, there's always

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
something that suckers me in on a Steam sale

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
And I gotta say, Valve is pretty genius for

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
building in that wishlist thing

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
I love it when they email me when a wishlist

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
thing goes on sale I love it and I hate it

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
because they'll go, an item on your wishlist is on sale

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
and then I'll be like, oh fuck, it's only

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
99 cents bought, and then I just bought

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
70 games for 99 cents a piece

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
So, I love it

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
and I hate it, but the honest answer is

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
probably some of the stuff that's on my wishlist

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
which oftentimes is stuff

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
I already own on console, but it's like

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I want it on PC as well

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Sometimes you want the best

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
of both worlds, right? I'm hoping

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
3DSs go on sale because I don't have

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
one, and I'd love to pick one up

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Yeah, there'll be a deal

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
if not 2DS, there might be a 2DS sale

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Well, I don't want a 2DS

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
You might luck out, there might be a 3DS sale

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
but I wouldn't expect to get Pokemon Sun and Moon on a discount

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
I'm not expecting a game that came out a week before

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
to be on sale, no

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Well, sometimes they'll do

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
like, buy the game

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
and get a $10 gift card

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
or something, sometimes they do that

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
that's like the little enhanced thing

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I want VR games

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I want more VR games

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
for my PS4, that'd be great

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
to see some of those that I have

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
a pretty solid interest in

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
to drop to even lower

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
That'd be very cool

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Loki, anything you're gonna have your eyes on for Black Friday?

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Not really, because I have so much stuff in my

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
backlog now, it's just

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
I don't know, hopefully they drop some of the prices

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
of those PlayStation VR games

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
but even right now, even looking

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
at what's coming out later on

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
there's not really anything on the horizon

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
except for in December, I think there's some rollercoaster

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
game that's coming out that might be interesting

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
but that's kind of it

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that came out apparently

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
at launch, but

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
It's mostly digital too, though

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
It's just kind of not

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
a lot of stuff I really want to pick up

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
it's kind of a lull right now, I guess

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
AkumaJP has another example

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
of a sale that happens

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
AkumaJP suggests, buy a 3DS and get

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
50% off a new game

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
they do those types of things as well

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
that's when I bought my Xbox One

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
that's what finally broke me, is they did buy an Xbox One

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
get a free game, so I got

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Forza Horizon 2 at the time

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
so that's what finally broke me on an Xbox One

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
so anyway, there you go

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Rage Nator, I think for a lot of us, we kind of have to see

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
what's on the table first, and then we go

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
ooh, that's an attractive idea, we'll see

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
I don't know, what was your other question?

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
You said you had a second question

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Well, since you folks

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
brought up GameStopper

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
and

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
obviously GameStopper is universally

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
hated, pretty much

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
that, I would like

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
to take my question

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
in a different route

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
is there

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
a traditional brick and mortar store

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
that you folks

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
used to, at one point or another

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
really used to love going to

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
for your games and other

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
entertainment?

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Great question, is there a brick and mortar store

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
that maybe is gone, or maybe it's still there

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
but maybe a brick and mortar store

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
that you would go to for your games

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
that was fun, for me

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
it was Software, etc. and then GameStop

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
bought them, was the problem

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I thought that was the other way around

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
was the other way around, yeah, because EB Games got bought

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
by GameStop, I just remember

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
back in the day, when Software, etc. was the place

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
where I got a service

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Software, etc., Babbage's

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
and then I think Electronics Boutique

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
was another, all those stores, but they all

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
got bought by GameStop, even if it is the same

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
company now, like it was

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
different 20 years ago, it was much different

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
20 years ago, that was before the age of pre-ordering

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
or when you would

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
sign up on a list to get a

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
phone call the day it comes out, and they would

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
just hold it for you, I think was the thing

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
I remember that was the thing

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I used to do pre-orders over the phone

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
yeah, it was like much different then

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
so, yeah, I remember certainly for those

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
what about JD? When I was a kid

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I actually looked in the phone book for

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
video game stores, because, I mean

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
yeah, there were chains in malls and stuff, but I found

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
some pretty neat, like small

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
independent used game stores, and I

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
missed those, because they're not really around anymore

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
there was one in Orlando that

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
I liked, and

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
even in San Francisco, I moved there in

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
2009, and there was one on Powell

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
in North Beach, and I think it closed

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
a couple years after I moved, so I

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
missed those

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
and you know, I miss, and

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Shane, I know you're going to like this answer too

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
I miss the retro

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Toys R Us

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
oh, okay, you said retro, I was like, oh where is this going, but Toys R Us

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
the retro Toys R Us, where you would actually have the

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
pull tags, and you'd have to pull the tag

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
and then they'd get it for you up front, and that's

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
where we used to get, like, that's where my family always got

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
conversation, we need to make another trip to the

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Toys R Us set time for God, because the Chico

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Toys R Us still has pull tags

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
and that whole system, I was like, oh my

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
gosh, is Chico stuck in 1993?

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
probably, as somebody

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
who lived there in 1996

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
yes, it probably is still stuck there

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
but anyway, yeah

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
I like Toys R Us back in the day

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
that's where my family got all the Commodore 64 games

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
but a lot of these stores just kind of

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
changed over the years, you know, it's just

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
different now, online also really really

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
changed the game, it really really did

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Loki, any quick memories you want to share

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
real quick?

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
places I used to buy games, it was pretty much like

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
software, etc, I think

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
was the local store I used to go

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
to

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
honestly, back when I was

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
purchasing games from stores like that

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
well, console games

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
console games would pretty much be

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
wherever I'd go to, like Walmarts

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
and stuff like that

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
actual PC games, I used to

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
buy a lot of shareware, and they

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
used to have those kiosks everywhere

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
used to buy dead shareware disks

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
at my local video store

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
and used to pick up demos all the time

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
oh yeah, the old school computer

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
shops, yes

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
I used to get

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
wherever, or you even go to the computer show and sale

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
and stuff like that

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
I don't know if they still do that

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
no, not anymore, like that was the huge one they do at

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Cal Expo, right?

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
all sorts of legitimate things

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
now it's shoes

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
so, Rage Nator, it sounds like you had a

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
quick story before we let you go

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
well, I was

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
going to say that

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
it's kind of hard for you guys to relate

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
because you're out in California

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
you don't know

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
in the Buffalo area

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
but out in

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
one of the local burbs

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
in the Buffalo area

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
which is called

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Amherst

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
there's a plaza

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
they're called the T.G. Max

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Plaza, obviously because

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
T.G. Max is in there

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
but back in the 90's

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I used to love going there

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
because they had Toys R Us

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
there, like what you were

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
mentioning, they had the pull tabs and all that

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
I used to love buying my games there

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
when I started buying games on my own

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
and right

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
within the same plaza

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
I used to love going to media play

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
yeah

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
I mean

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
yeah, they had the video games

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
there, but aside from that they had

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
everything else there that

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
I could possibly want

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
music, movies

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
posters, you name it

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
we had the

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
gathering cards

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
that place was heaven, I swear to god

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
there was times

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
that on the weekend

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
I would be there literally all

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
day to the point where

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
I was there until clearly closing

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
and they had to kick me out

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
sounds like a fun place, but I will say this

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
even though we are all the way

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
in California, we have T.G. Max

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
out here as well, and there's a T.G. Max Plaza

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
here, and that's where the Mongolian barbecue

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
is, so we

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
have our own T.G. Max Plaza that we go

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
to, so there's that

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
I also miss CompUSA, they had

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
a computer lab set up to demo

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
their games, and I played the logical

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
journey of the Zoombinis there a bunch

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
that was the early PC days

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
and my brother and I

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
would sit there on the computers and just play games

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
until they were done, I feel like the first time I ever

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
played the Castle of Dr. Brain was that

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
I love that series, right?

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
oh my god, yes

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
alright, I'm going to let you go

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
but thanks so much for the call

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
thanks for the trip down memory lane

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
later, alright

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Orange Launch Radio, one word on Skype

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
if you want to try to get in, although I didn't see any other calls

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
coming in, so I don't know, it might be a quiet night tonight

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
but I'll give it a couple minutes just in case

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
yeah, trip down memory lane

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
good times, that CompUSA

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
building here in SAC

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
still, still no new tenant

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
it's still just empty

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
I think I finally saw a sign

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
that they were going to turn it into some event center

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
or something, but it's kind of sad

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
that CompUSA building has been empty forever

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I mean, they went out of business a long time ago

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
but nothing will beat

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
the sign that still is up

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
that says Circuit City

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
oh, those things are ghost towns

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
there is still a sign that says Circuit City, which is funny

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
because the store did convert

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
it was, I want to say

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
it was a Good Guys for a short minute

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
when they were still around, then they went under

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
and then it was, it's a wine store now

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
it's nothing but wine

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
yeah, no, it's a great conversion

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
but it's still, for some reason

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
the sign in the front says Total Wine

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
or whatever the name of the store is, but the sign in the back

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
still says Circuit City

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
it's crazy

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
alright, we got one more call coming in, then we'll wrap it up

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
hey, what's going on everybody, it's Ranma

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
hey Ranma buddy, how you doing?

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
nostalgic

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
right, in fact I brought up Circuit City and that was another place we used to go check out

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
like games and stuff at, but anyway, what's on your mind buddy?

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
I want to back up what Rage Nator said

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
because I remember growing up

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
in my small little town

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
it was like this one little store

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
called Weekend Gifts where I would buy all of my

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
video games from, because I wasn't

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
really allowed to travel outside of the town

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
and there were a couple other stores

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
back and forth I'd get my games from

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
and then, what usually

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
sucked because it's a smaller store

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
games were a little bit more expensive

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
yeah

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
when I got into high school and I had a bus pass

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
I traveled from point A to point B

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
I discovered software, etc

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Circuit City

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
and sales

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
and sales

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
yes, I was so excited

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
like it wasn't that long ago, because Alan

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
and I, well I guess Alan and I have been together a while

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
now, but it was probably about five years ago, Alan and I

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
took a road trip to Oregon

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
it was about five years ago, and we stopped

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
at a mall in, I want to

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
say it was Ashland, where we

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
stopped, we stopped at a mall in Ashland

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
to like eat or whatever, and in the mall

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
they had a GameStop, and

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
a software, etc

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
they still had a fucking software, etc

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
and bonus, there's

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
no sales tax in Oregon

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
so I was like, alright, fuck it, I'm gonna go

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
buy a game here, just so I can have

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
say I shopped the software, etc while I was

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
here, and I actually had a receipt

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
I don't know if it's still, it's probably long closed

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
this was a good five, six years ago, but

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
sorry, I just had to bring that up, because that

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
was a nostalgia trip for me, that that was still open

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
like in the year 2010,

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
2011, it was awesome

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
brother, let me tell you

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
if memory serves me correctly

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
I still have friends that live up in my

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
in the towns, in the areas

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
I used to hang out in, the town over

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
where the software, etc it was

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
from my understanding

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
to this day, it's

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
still a software, etc

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
rad, although

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
it's funny that we're reminiscing, because there

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
literally is no difference between software, etc and GameStop

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
now, like it's really just the

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
logo and all the purple, is the only thing

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
that differentiates them at this point, so

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
but, I don't know, there's just something

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
about it, there's something about it

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
true, but you know what

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
my thing was, I just loved

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I just like funko way, and you go

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
in every month, you get like this

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
this newspaper of all the sale

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
prices, and you knew what they had

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
and they had these cool demos up

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
and it was like, they

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
only carried the popular games

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
so, what they didn't have, you had to

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
run over to Toys R Us

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
or software, etc, or at the

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
time, if you really wanted to do it,

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
KB Toys, to get those games

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
because KB was the spot

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
where I used to get my Master System games

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
My Atari 2600 games came

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
from KB Toys, that was old school

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
I think I bought my first Game Boy Color at KB Toys

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Yeah, wow, they didn't

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
last long past

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
the Nintendo 64 era, right?

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
They were, they went

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
under a long time ago, anyway

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
Alright, good times

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
good memories, so

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
yeah, lots of

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
stores that are unfortunately long gone

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Where do you buy your games now?

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Um

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
I actually buy my games from

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
either Micro Center

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
or Best Buy

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
or Nintendo World

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
If I have to go to New York City

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
I kind of bless myself

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
before walking in, so that I

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
don't have a stroke talking to these

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
people about a particular game I'm looking for

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
or something like that

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Since you're in New York City, you can just go straight to the

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
30 Rock Nintendo store and

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
get it from the stores, that's pretty awesome

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Yeah, and then I can go upstairs and play

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Star Fox on the Wii U on a big ass

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
250 inch screen

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
That's the life, the life

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
of New York City, but you pay a premium to live there

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
just kidding

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Sky, you have no idea

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
I have some idea

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Yeah, keep in mind, our buddy

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
JD here is from San Francisco, we get

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
near full from our friends over there, so

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
we have some idea

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
I'm just thankful they didn't hike up my rent

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
this year, because my place

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
is about the size

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
of the old studio

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
of what I came to visit

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
that time

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Which is small

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Does New York have rent control?

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Oh, New York has rent control, but when you're living somewhere

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
and you're paying month to month

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
because you need to rent out the basement

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
it gets a little tricky

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
At least

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Squatter's rights are on my side

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we wrap up

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
the show, thanks for the call and the memories

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Alright, Rob, one more thing

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Stay fabulous, brother

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Always, always, stay black

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
I try

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Work on it, alright, take care

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Bye

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
If you didn't get through, you should email us

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
or participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
That is

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
gonna wrap it up for another episode of

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Hey, Shane, thanks for being here tonight in studio

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
I'm sure you had a great time

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
as always. Did you catch any Pokemon during

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
the show? I'm not catching anything right now

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
I'm working through the story

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Oh, excuse me, excuse me, I'm sorry about that

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
He needs a ditto

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Did you not pay attention earlier?

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Is it because you're too fat?

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Worked it in! Yay!

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Rude and unnecessary

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Uh, JD, thanks for being here

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
I hope you had fun. Was it fun being

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
in the studio? Absolutely

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
What do people out there need to know about the way

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
OLR really works?

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Oh, man

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Um, I don't know if there's anything

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
I can share

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
It's all a secret

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Alright, you'll just have to come find out for yourself

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Alright, anything you're here to plug

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
You don't really have a show or anything

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Do you have a blog, a Twitter

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Or something that people should follow

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Twitter is probably the best place to find me

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
If you want to know more

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
I retweet a lot of stuff

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Sometimes it's politics, sometimes it's ash

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Or not ash, it's red and blue in fan art

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Who knows what, you'll be fine

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
And your Twitter account is?

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
jai underscore d-i-t

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
It's jaydee from French

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
That's how you say it!

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
So it's French for I have said

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
But it's also my name

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Because puns are very central to me

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
I remember the first week I was like

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Is it jaydee? What is it?

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Oh, it's jaydee, it's his name, I get it

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
I'm looking right now for this fan art

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
I'm not seeing it

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Because I have to compare to see if I have any of it

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Alright, uh

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Any final thoughts to leave with our listeners tonight?

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
You know, I don't know if they're still around

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
But For Your Entertainment used to have

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
A DDR machine in the mall

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
One of the malls in Orlando I went to

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
I think a lot of those stores closed, sadly

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
It was all part of the Suncoast

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
That's another fun thing

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
As always, I just want to say

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
A nice five star review wherever you found this show

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Like iTunes or Google Play

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Will go a long way in helping us with discovery

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
We really appreciate each and every

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Five star review

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
And my final thought tonight is

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
I'm glad I got capped for tomes on Final Fantasy 14 already

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
So I don't have to play again tonight

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
I can play more Jackbox Party Pack or something else

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Loki, last but not least my friend

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Your final thought tonight

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
I get pizza tomorrow? I don't know

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Pizza party!

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Fortunately I have to watch a

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
You know

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
I'm gonna call a keynote

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
I'm gonna get a presentation from our CEO

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Well good luck with that

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
But at least I get pizza

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Good luck with that

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Happy Halloween everybody

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Be safe, don't be a fool

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
But I think most of you probably already finished your celebrating

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
I was gonna say it wasn't a Halloween thing

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
And I almost did this too

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
But I totally want to make some of those Borderlands pants

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
That they have

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Have you seen those?

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Where they paint them so they look cel shaded?

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
I would just wear those regularly

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Have a good Halloween, we will see you in 7 days

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
BlizzCon

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
So we know we'll get a lot of PC gaming news

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Happening this coming weekend, so that to look forward to

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
So we'll see you in 7 days to talk all about it

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
And whatever else is going on in the gaming world

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Have a good one everybody, good night!

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:28.000
It's at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
The views and opinions expressed in this program

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Do not necessarily reflect those

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Or VOG Network

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
But you know they were all still true

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
See you next week

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Thanks for watching!
