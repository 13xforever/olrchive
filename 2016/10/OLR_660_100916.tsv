7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	This week, we're back from another round of conventions as we wind down the year, and
17000	20440	how better than to come back to the imminent release of PlayStation VR with a healthy lineup
20440	21440	of launch titles.
21440	24480	We'll give you the wrap-up and the rundown of this and plenty more news, and it all starts
24480	27500	right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27500	31500	Orange Lounge Radio
31500	34740	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34740	36420	where every gamer has a voice.
36420	42820	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 660 for this October the 9th
42820	44700	of 2016.
44700	49420	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live here from Sacramento, California, where we are
49420	53360	headquartered and here with me in studio as he is every week.
53360	55100	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
55100	56100	Hello.
56100	57100	How are you?
57100	58100	I'm good.
58100	59100	Good.
59100	60100	I heard your Twitter got hacked today.
60100	61100	What's up with that?
61100	62100	I don't know.
62100	63100	That was weird.
63100	70420	Yeah, there's some account posted on my thing, and I was notified about it like a few minutes
70420	71420	later.
71420	72420	What were they spamming?
72420	75420	I don't know.
75420	80180	It was like trying to lure someone to click the link with sexy pictures, but honestly,
80180	84060	from my standards, it wasn't sexy enough.
84060	85500	There was no boobies there.
85500	90300	I mean, there is lingerie and that's classy, I guess, but I'm not classy guy.
90300	96420	So you know, if someone's going to hack it, then I better see like full frontal.
96420	97420	Come on.
97420	100440	You wasted all this time to hack the password or something.
100440	102140	And this is what you put up there.
102140	103140	Come on.
103140	104140	Don't waste my time.
104140	106020	I mean, that's just it's stupid.
106020	110020	But you you were on it and you fixed it, but that's you said you had to factor off on your
110020	111020	account, right?
111020	112020	Yeah, I had it.
112020	117060	I turn it on whenever they add stuff like to the social networks, I always turn on like
117060	121540	day one, like or whenever I first hear about it, that that's supposed to make your account
121540	122620	like an iron fortress.
122620	123620	So that right.
123620	128060	And well, it was weird, though, because when I went to go and change the password, it was
128060	129060	off.
129060	130060	Two Factor was off.
130060	132360	So I was like, well, weird.
132360	135120	So they could, you know, most of the time with these Twitter hacks is that these just
135120	139420	social engineering or they even go to the extent of like cloning your phone and logging
139420	143580	in with your mobile, which they didn't do that with mine, because why would you do that
143580	144580	with mine?
144580	145580	Really?
145580	146980	I mean, come on.
146980	147980	That's just stupid.
147980	153500	But yeah, I saw a log in attempt also on the VOG Minecraft one as well, which is also that
153500	157420	would just be absolutely pointless since I don't use it anymore.
157420	158900	So who cares?
158900	159900	All right.
159900	163260	Well, I'm glad you got everything fixed on your account and you took down the not so
163260	165100	sexy pictures that somebody posted.
165100	166100	Yeah.
166100	168100	I, you know, it was disappointing.
168100	169660	I mean, just.
169660	170660	Yeah.
170660	174860	Oh, anyway, not here tonight, of course, still on a break from the show Dark Sakura, but
174860	178220	we will be hearing from her later and during our classic game of the week, thanks to the
178220	180900	magic of radio, Dark Sakura should be joining us.
180900	184680	We're hoping she's going to be able to join us for a tape show in November.
184680	188740	So still a little ways out, but we miss Dark Sakura, but thankful she can still be on the
188740	191920	show, at least in part through the classic game of the week.
191920	193620	Coming up tonight on the show, we have an interview.
193620	198840	Very excited to welcome Ryan from Retro Dreamer Studios, which is making the game Monsters
198840	202160	and Monocles available right now on Steam Greenlight.
202160	205060	Loki and I played this game like for the first time a couple of years ago.
205060	206060	Yeah, a couple of years ago.
206060	207060	Yeah.
207060	208060	One of the SAC Indie arcade events.
208060	211500	But this is, you know, and you might think, oh, Indie game means, you know, I'm not going
211500	215180	to see a lot of it out there, but that's quite not the case with this game.
215180	219340	I mean, not only is it on the Steam early access, but they have announced they're going
219340	220540	to be on PlayStation four as well.
220540	224500	And there's a lovely cut trailer that PlayStation has on the official channel and everything
224500	225500	coverage on it.
225500	226500	Yeah.
226500	227500	The media and stuff.
227500	228500	And so it looks, I mean, it's a good game.
228500	233860	It was good a couple of years ago, so excited to welcome Ryan here live in about 20 minutes
233860	234860	or so.
234860	237100	And if you guys have played the game and have any questions, or if you haven't played the
237100	240380	game, you still have questions, you'll be, you'll be able to ask those live in our chat
240380	244520	room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock
244520	248540	Eastern at the voice of geeks network, vog network.com.
248540	252380	And if you are listening to our show, you can participate live, uh, with our chat room,
252380	254260	live dot vog network.com.
254260	257940	And if you guys could do me a favor tonight, I know there's a lot of stuff going on in
257940	259580	the real world outside this show.
259580	264220	Um, thank you guys for choosing to, uh, listen to OLR live tonight or in podcast form.
264220	267820	You know, I appreciate you every either way, but since I do have to read comments on the
267820	271940	fly, uh, try not to fill up the chat room with talk about politics tonight.
271940	276100	Uh, there's other, you go to Twitter politics, there's politics going on.
276100	277940	Don't worry about it.
277940	281980	Is the orange fair going to say some weird stuff again, because I'm totally down with
281980	282980	that.
282980	283980	Here's, here's the thing.
283980	286500	Next week on, is it next week or the week after I've checked our calendar, but I think
286500	288060	it's next week on OLR.
288060	292420	We actually have cat president developers that game are on the show.
292420	296380	Uh, so, um, and I'll, I'll check the calendar during the break tonight and double check
296380	297380	the week.
297380	301760	Um, but politics will be permissible when we're talking about president cap.
301760	304020	That's the only time you can, uh, break that rule.
304020	305020	So thank you guys.
305060	310220	Uh, but we do have, uh, some on topic comments here in chat, uh, from Bobby Black Wolf saying,
310220	314160	uh, it might've been an authorized app that hacked.
314160	317380	So if you had like something tied to your Twitter, that was the next thing I was gonna
317380	318380	look at.
318380	319380	Right.
319380	320380	Yeah.
320380	322760	I think it's always a good idea to clean that stuff out once in a while too.
322760	327920	And the biggest offenders are those fricking quiz apps like, and I don't know if you even
327920	329100	know I don't do that.
329100	333460	Some people do like the whole, what, which, which one of the mean girls are you?
333900	338660	If it did any of that, that would be Facebook because you know, that's where you're taking
338660	339660	quizzes.
339660	340660	I don't do that on Twitter.
340660	343300	Twitter is pretty lean, but some of that shows up on Twitter.
343300	348020	I know I've used some of those like track who follows and unfollows you on Twitter just
348020	353740	because you know, if a lot of times people follow to inflate their number account or
353740	356260	their, their follower numbers and they immediately unfollow.
356260	360420	So I do use one of those programs to kind of like catch those people cause I'm pretty
360420	362060	good about following people back.
362060	365920	If you're just a spam bot, I'm not interested in following celebrities.
365920	372100	Some celebrities that I like, you know, on TV and stuff, but if they post a lot or repost
372100	376580	or, you know, forward a lot, I kind of have to take them off.
376580	379780	And then going to another real world thing I want to address here real quick before we
379780	380980	get into some games.
380980	385180	Tiger Claw in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah, the whole week with Hurricane
385180	387100	Matthew was uneventful for me.
387100	390980	You put on the hurricane shutters and anticipating the storm only to find out it never touched
390980	391980	down in South Florida.
391980	394300	I'm very thankful that didn't have an effect on you.
394300	400060	I really hope our listeners in Florida have similar stories to what you have.
400060	403660	So you know, I was thinking of y'all this week cause I know we've, we've got a few listeners
403660	408140	in Florida and that were in the area that could have potentially been impacted.
408140	412180	So I'm really, I'm hoping you all have stories like Tiger Claw out there.
412180	415860	So yeah, stay safe you guys.
415860	420020	So anyway, I think, I think we want to start off tonight by getting into some of the news
420060	425060	from last week that we missed, um, with our kickoff topic tonight.
425060	428140	First off though, let me just kind of ask Loki with no, with no show last week.
428140	431300	I mean, I'll talk about gamer X here in a minute, which is where I was at, but how was
431300	434220	your, how was your weekend off with no show last week?
434220	439700	It was never a weekend off, but it was just, um, I just went and played Ingress.
439700	443220	I was going to do something like normally like when I have a night off like that, I'll
443220	446980	try to go see a movie or something, but there wasn't anything good playing at all.
446980	448820	And it was just, no.
448820	453460	Um, so I decided that I was going to probably just play Ingress and I had actually more
453460	456500	than I wanted to do, um, but I just didn't get it done.
456500	460980	So I hung out with some of the people that are around here and, um, played a little bit
460980	463100	Ingress on my way home and that was it.
463100	465780	Surprisingly that went, the time went by really fast, so.
465780	466780	Good deal.
466780	467780	But yeah.
467780	468780	Um, yeah.
468780	473300	Uh, well I was at gamer X, uh, this is the fourth year of gamer X. Dark Soccer was there
473300	474300	with me.
474300	479060	We were staffing the vog table, uh, cause we were a, uh, what do they call the intro
479060	480060	level sponsor?
480060	481060	Like eight, eight bit sponsor.
481060	484340	I think we were, uh, voice East network was, so we were there.
484340	488940	Uh, also our pals, uh, captain spike and first make slide kick from game buoy were there.
488940	490420	X differ from guys on a show is there.
490420	493420	So there was, you know, a few shows on our network were represented there at gamer X.
493420	496740	Uh, and if anybody is listening to OLR for the first time, because they met us at the
496740	497740	table.
497740	498740	Hello.
498740	499740	And thank you for checking it out.
499740	500740	Really appreciate it.
500740	501740	Um, real quick.
501740	503720	Our show was friends that came together.
503720	507520	We all used to play dance, dance revolution and music based games at the arcade.
507520	509960	And there was a real sense of community that was built around that.
509960	514400	So we kind of took that community outside the arcade onto the internet and that that's
514400	518380	the community that's kind of continuing today, even though we don't necessarily focus on
518380	519920	music games per se.
519920	524000	Um, we certainly, you know, still have a great love of video games in general, especially
524000	527040	niche things that other people miss out on.
527040	528500	Sometimes we really love here.
528500	530400	So that's, that's what all ours all about.
530400	534540	But uh, with gamer X, you know, um, gamer X is a smaller convention.
534540	536680	There's a big focus on panels.
536680	541560	They do a lot of panels on things like diversity and visibility and, you know, sometimes it's
541560	546240	about kind of justifying why there needs to be a gamer X sort of thing, which, you know,
546240	550560	I totally understand as a gay gamer myself, representation and all that is important.
550560	554440	It's really great to see people like yourself in video games.
554440	557400	And that's why it's great that we have all these video games to kind of let you, you
557400	559640	know, do, you know, Bioware games are infamous for this.
559640	562280	They kind of let you do the game that you want to do.
562280	566080	Um, so they, they run a lot of panels and they also, it's not just that, but also kind
566080	571400	of encouraging people to develop because one of the great ways to have representation in
571400	576960	gaming is to encourage more minorities to develop, get out there, make a game.
576960	582440	Um, you know, it's, it's, I know I've had struggles of my own and making a game in the
582440	587240	past, but if I had the time to really sit down and do it, I could make a game.
587240	590920	Loki's been trying on and off over years to make it mentally, I've just not been able
590920	592360	to focus on anything.
592360	596200	It's really frustrating, but if Loki can do it, you can do it.
596200	602400	And so I'm trying, I'm, I just, there's, there's a really big theme about just trying to get
602400	607000	more minorities to participate in, uh, the game making process.
607000	613080	I'm not just talking about gays, I'm talking about, you know, non-binary individuals, transgender
613080	617160	individuals, um, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, you know, I'm talking about
617160	622640	like the gamer X is, uh, really speaks to, I think a lot of different minorities out
622640	623640	there.
623640	628280	Um, and you know, again, I hate that this has to be said, but I feel like it does.
628280	633680	The goal is not to eliminate the white man, the straight white man from video games.
633680	634680	That is not the goal.
634680	638760	Uh, the goal is to add more.
638760	639760	That's what it is.
639760	640760	You just, just add more.
640760	645960	So, um, yeah, I, I feel like it's always the first thing I hear when there's a, you know,
645960	649440	talk about gamer X is where's the straight white man game making expo.
649440	652920	And it's like, you're, you, you aren't unwelcome from gamer X.
652920	657760	Um, they, you know, if you bought a ticket, you get in, um, and you, and you agree to
657760	662440	follow the rules about no harassment and all that stuff, which any con would have anyway.
662440	663440	Back to the game.
663440	667680	So there's a lovely expo hall and we were in this hall and they had some bigger companies
667680	671280	where they're like Intel, which was doing this fun little like photo session.
671280	675640	And, uh, they had some indie games, uh, that were running on Intel hardware that you'd
675640	676640	see at their booth.
676640	679960	Oculus was there, which we talked about a little bit on last week's show, which was
679960	684000	in, or last time we did a show, which was interesting because of, you know, Oculus was
684000	687800	going through their own struggles in the news, um, a couple of weeks ago, but they were there
687800	692360	and they were showing off, um, you know, and I don't think any of the personalities with
692360	693600	Oculus were there.
693600	698760	Um, you know, you certainly weren't going to see Palmer lucky or Zuckerberg or anybody,
698760	704300	you know, they have their team that goes out and does these demos.
704300	707480	So they were there and, you know, so a lot of people got to try Oculus for the first
707480	708480	time, which was cool.
708480	712320	Um, let's see who else was like showing a game that was there.
712320	715080	Um, blizzard was doing their job recruitment thing again.
715080	719560	So, um, but there was a lot of indie developers to some of the same people I'd seen the year
719560	723500	before were coming back and they were either showing their game was about to be released
723500	727200	or they were working on a new game now and they were kind of showing that again.
727200	728280	So that was pretty cool.
728280	732160	But um, I had a really good time, you know, it's just, it's just, it's just a fun show
732160	736640	and a great crowd and it's just a very different vibe from a lot of other gaming expos.
736640	741160	Like actually something about gamer X just feels really relaxed and chill to me.
741160	745780	Like there's just something about it where I, it could just like, if I could just kind
745780	750160	of put my finger on why I really like a con like gamer X, they did a thing called the
750160	753440	gamer X slumber party on Friday night.
753440	758680	And all it was was they just took one of their tiny rooms and it was just a chill space.
758680	763560	It was just chill and I loved it because, and it was nothing, it's nothing disgusting
763560	765360	or dirty or awkward or anything like that.
765360	767540	It was just come hang out with nerds.
767540	770800	And some guy was like, I ordered pizza, there's pizza in the back if you want some.
770800	773840	And I actually met like a ton of new people just going to this thing and just chilling
773840	775840	out and everybody was just really cool.
775840	779800	And you know, the, we could instantly bond over nerdy things that we had in common.
779800	782800	And yeah, it was just kind of, I didn't really experience something like that at any of the
782800	785200	other cons I've been to, not to knock the other cons.
785200	789080	There's great things I take from every con, but that was something that felt very unique
789080	790080	to gamer X.
790080	793380	So yeah, it did a lot of great networking with that.
793380	796200	Big thanks to anyone that came out to our panel on Sunday.
796200	800120	We had kind of a smaller room so we couldn't fit a lot of people in there, but I had a
800120	803680	good time and I felt like the panel was well received by the group in there.
803680	807420	And there was a lot of people in there who weren't actually listeners of any of our shows.
807420	811560	They were just kind of curious about podcasting and all that and what it is.
811560	815980	So yeah, hope, hope some folks decided maybe they want to start their own show or, or enjoyed
815980	816980	what they heard here.
816980	818360	Um, so there was that.
818360	823640	And then, uh, gamer X teams up with magfest and they actually had a lot of classic games
823640	824640	there.
824640	827640	They had a whole little arcade with DDR and the star Wars arcade game.
827640	829160	I got to play a little bit.
829160	833320	And um, one night until they closed, cause they had to close convention center space
833320	834320	around midnight.
834320	835760	Um, I was playing super Mario world.
835760	838320	So you want to hear something funny completely off topic here.
838320	842880	Um, so I just realized, or found out the other day that they've opened a classic arcade in
842880	843880	Sutter street.
843880	845440	You're locally in Folsom.
845440	846440	Really?
846440	847440	Yeah.
847440	850840	Like classic, like old school, like a coin op type place, like a coin op type place.
850840	851840	Hmm.
851840	852840	I thought that was weird.
852840	853840	Yes.
853840	855840	It's like the Sutter street arcade or something like that.
855840	856840	Huh?
856840	857840	Check that out.
857840	858840	Yeah.
858840	861240	I just told some friends to go to coin up this, man, retro games are making a comeback,
861240	862240	but that's, that's okay.
862240	863240	Who doesn't love retro games?
863240	867840	I just thought it was interesting to see like an actual arcade opening up.
867840	872840	Um, our pal Bobby Black Wolf is in chat saying, I forget there are people that still have
872840	874360	never heard of a podcast.
874360	877560	Um, yeah, you know, there was a lot of people at gamer X.
877560	878940	I kind of ran into the same thing.
878940	883360	So I know, uh, Bobby was at siege, which was a, like a game developer conference type of
883360	884600	thing in Georgia.
884600	886040	He was there this weekend.
886040	888320	Um, and I was finding the same thing at gamer X.
888320	892660	I was kind of thinking in the back of my mind, like, well with NPR and stuff, everybody's
892660	896580	probably heard of a podcast by now, but no, I found there was a lot of people.
896580	901100	I was kind of having to explain it to like the concept of what it is and why we do it.
901100	906040	Um, for me, I find that a lot of people, and this is what's getting harder and harder.
906040	909860	A lot of people kind of want to know why would they listen to a podcast when they have YouTube
909860	914700	and Twitch these days, which is an interesting issue that our podcasting community is facing
914700	922540	because YouTube has videos that people recorded a while ago that you can watch as well, whereas
922540	925460	we record audio that you can listen to.
925460	926460	Right.
926460	927460	And we're live.
927460	928460	We're fortunate enough to be live.
928460	930220	I mean, there's a lot of podcasts that aren't live that are still worth your time.
930220	935060	Um, but you know, I also kind of tried to solve the thing that sometimes you, you, you
935060	937820	can only have so many of your senses distracted.
937820	940700	Like when you're watching a YouTube or something like that, that's, that's typically all of
940700	942220	your senses being used at once.
942220	948000	But when you're doing a podcast, you can still, and I know I've had people say the weeks that
948000	952240	we don't do OLR, I'm bored Monday at work, which is a huge compliment to me.
952240	955880	Um, but they say, I'm, I listen to you guys at work while I'm doing my data entry job
955880	960920	or my, you know, coding job or whatever it is because they can look and think and type.
960920	963760	You know, it's just the podcast only takes one of their senses.
963760	968020	So that's, that's kind of one way I try to kind of put the podcasting out there is that
968020	974200	sometimes you can't completely devote yourself to entertainment, but you can be entertained
974200	975200	while you're doing other things.
975200	978360	That's like saying, why listen to the radio when you can watch videos on YouTube?
978360	979360	Yeah, I know.
979360	980360	I know.
980360	981360	Right.
981360	982360	But it was interesting.
982360	987560	But, um, I, I, you know, these are, it's, it's one of those things where like, these
987560	990360	are things that I wouldn't hear from our audience.
990360	994840	If I was only to listen to the feedback from the, from the, from our audience, none of
994840	997280	them are going to say, why should I listen to a podcast?
997280	998280	Or what?
998280	999280	Cause they're already listening to a podcast.
999280	1000280	Right.
1000280	1001280	So these are the things that I get to hear.
1001280	1004440	Cause you'll crash your car if you're watching a podcast.
1005440	1010920	So, uh, anyway, um, so yeah, uh, that was, that was gamer X.
1010920	1014240	Uh, it was a good time, but really chill three days.
1014240	1017700	The only kind of downside was that the last day, and they know this and there was really
1017700	1022480	nothing they could have done about it because they announced their expo long before the
1022480	1029860	NFL announced their schedule and the hotel where gamer X was at, was at the Hyatt, literally
1029860	1033800	across the street from Levi's stadium where they had the super bowl this year.
1034160	1037840	Uh, so now the 49ers play there and they were having their, I think it was their first game
1037840	1039320	there against the Cowboys.
1039320	1042880	Um, and I wouldn't have known that normally, but it was everywhere.
1042880	1047720	Uh, so, uh, they were playing their game there and I didn't realize how many people come
1047720	1052140	to the hotel across the street from the stadium to watch the game.
1052140	1054720	And so their bar was completely taken over by football people.
1054720	1055720	Yeah.
1055720	1056960	I thought that was weird too.
1056960	1057960	You're almost there.
1057960	1058960	Keep going.
1058960	1059960	I don't know.
1059960	1063080	So I don't know, but it's like, I'm almost like I'm right there.
1063360	1064360	Maybe so they can go home.
1064360	1067440	Maybe they can go join in the tailgate parties or something with the Niners loss.
1067440	1070360	So I don't know what parties tailgating would be nice.
1070360	1071360	Yeah.
1071360	1077080	But anyway, uh, it was, unfortunately it caused some conflict and uh, I heard that a slur
1077080	1080280	got hurled at somebody, uh, which isn't very nice.
1080280	1084880	Um, but I did think it was kind of interesting because, um, when the football fans on the
1084880	1089000	lower level would cheer and they would go, yeah, well, you know, whenever the, uh, things
1089000	1092300	would score the tabletop gamers were on the mezzanine.
1092300	1093680	So like the second floor.
1093680	1098800	So somebody that, and this all happened while the OLR or the VOG network panel was happening
1098800	1099800	in the room.
1099800	1104860	Um, so we didn't see any of this like happening until we walked out and it was already going
1104860	1105860	on.
1105860	1109760	So what would happen is that the, the dude bros would cheer on the first level whenever
1109760	1112340	something happened in the football game and they go, yeah.
1112340	1117460	And then everybody up on the second floor, yes, they started, everybody just started
1117460	1119740	going yes.
1119740	1122820	And it was like, I died laughing the first time I heard that.
1122820	1126900	So that became the, it was like the, the dueling cheers that would go back and forth.
1126900	1131100	And I just, I, I like cried from laughing so hard when that was going on.
1131100	1137840	So, um, you know, it's unfortunate that the safe space that gamer X tries to create got
1137840	1142920	punctured a little bit with a very angry drunken individual that said something that they really
1142920	1146220	should not say at a convention dedicated to this.
1146220	1151620	Um, but you know, I felt otherwise they did the, the gamer X folks did the best job they
1151620	1154300	could making lemonade out of lemons, so to speak.
1154300	1158520	So anyway, uh, so that was, uh, yeah, that was, that was gamer X.
1158520	1159780	I had a really good time.
1159780	1163660	Uh, anyway, uh, we're just a few minutes out from my getting Ryan here to talk about monsters
1163660	1164660	and monocles.
1164660	1167980	So, um, I'll do the last week's news here in a minute, perhaps.
1167980	1172100	Um, uh, let me get to some comments from chat here as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
1172100	1177220	Uh, Alan alchemy and chat says it was totally out of gamer X's control too.
1177220	1179620	They can only police their own people in area.
1179620	1180620	Yeah.
1180620	1185340	And I think most people realize that I think everybody that attended gamer X realizes that
1185340	1188500	nobody faults the staff for that, but it's just one of those.
1188500	1190820	It still sucks kind of situations.
1190820	1195940	And we, as soon as our panel was done and as soon as the expo hall closed, we realized
1195940	1197980	the game would be over in about 30 minutes.
1197980	1200980	So we hightailed it the fuck out of Santa Clara and drove home because we didn't want
1201060	1202060	to be stuck in that traffic.
1202060	1203060	Oh God.
1203060	1204060	No.
1204060	1205060	Uh, and it was already getting pretty bad.
1205060	1208820	So, you know, cause they, for some stupid reason, they narrow it down to one lane.
1208820	1211600	I think it's because that way they can keep the light green the entire time.
1211600	1213580	I don't know, but it was just, Oh my God.
1213580	1216660	So I couldn't imagine trying to leave there at like four 35 o'clock when it was going
1216660	1217660	to get really ugly.
1217660	1221100	So I felt bad that I couldn't really see gamer X through till the bitter end.
1221100	1223940	So that wasn't really fair to them, but I did have to work on Monday.
1223940	1228660	So anyway, um, let me quickly ask Loki, how was your gaming week before we give Ryan a
1228660	1229660	call here?
1229660	1230660	Well, it was brief.
1231340	1235580	I played basically ingress and um, but I did actually play console game.
1235580	1239820	I played cluster trucks, which I've been looking for this game coming out for quite a while
1239820	1240820	now.
1240820	1243660	Uh, it's from a new developer named Landfall games.
1243660	1248900	And the premise of the game is basically that you're hopping on the back of trucks to the
1248900	1252020	finish line and there's a lot of obstacles in the way.
1252020	1256980	So trucks can be, you know, they're just kind of on their own AI, but there's like, you
1256980	1262540	know, giant hammers, lasers, moving platforms, jumps, all sorts of crazy shit.
1262540	1266500	And it's just kind of jumping from one to the other and it gets really hard and it's
1266500	1268700	really fun cause you can get going pretty fast.
1268700	1271460	It's a very speed run centric games.
1271460	1272460	Yeah.
1272460	1275020	You were recommending this to me before the show saying if I like super meat boy, I probably
1275020	1276020	get it right.
1276020	1277020	Yeah.
1277020	1281380	I mean, maybe it's not as hard as super meat boy, but it's definitely, you know, challenging
1281380	1285820	and fun because you die a lot, but it's like, you know, there's some cool stuff that happens
1285820	1286820	too.
1286820	1289020	Um, and you get power ups and stuff like that.
1289020	1290020	So I'd highly recommend that.
1290020	1291540	It's on PlayStation four and PC right now.
1291540	1296340	I bought both because I was going to play the PlayStation four version and my wife wanted
1296340	1298500	to watch TV and I was like, dammit.
1298500	1305180	So I'll buy the steam version and then ended up watching TV because I'm weak.
1305180	1307140	It's just that Grey's Anatomy is just so addictive.
1307140	1308340	I've played through quite a bit of it.
1308340	1313900	I'm in like the seventh stage or seventh world, I guess, and each world has like 10 levels.
1313900	1318980	So that's seven out of 10 or seven out of eight levels that worlds that they've got.
1318980	1321240	So it gets really challenging though.
1321240	1325900	Like my least favorite, but most challenging was laser world because there's one level
1325900	1329500	like literally in the beginning you're like, ah, fuck.
1329500	1333620	Cause it's just all you see when you first start is all these lasers in the sky and they're
1333620	1334620	all swooped down.
1334620	1336620	You're like, ah, shit.
1336620	1338300	Just dodging lasers like crazy.
1338300	1339820	Sounds like that scene in resident evil.
1339820	1341020	That doesn't sound pretty at all.
1341020	1342020	So yikes.
1342020	1343020	All right, cool.
1343140	1346300	All right, well, uh, I'll tell you about my gaming week a little bit later, but, uh,
1346300	1351100	we want to make sure we get, uh, Ryan here on the show who's, uh, from retro dreamer
1351100	1355980	and is, uh, one half of the team making the game monsters and monocles.
1355980	1357740	And I believe we have Ryan on the line now.
1357740	1358740	You there, Ryan?
1358740	1359740	I'm here.
1359740	1360740	How are you doing?
1360740	1361740	Hey, good.
1361740	1362740	Welcome to orange on radio.
1362740	1363740	Thanks for having me.
1363740	1364740	Hey, no problem.
1364740	1365740	It's always nice to support.
1365740	1366740	You know, we're an indie podcast.
1366740	1370100	We like to support indie developers and it's even sweeter when the indie developer happens
1370100	1374300	to be pretty much your neighbor because you're, no, it's great.
1374300	1376420	And it was great to meet you guys out at indie arcade.
1376420	1377420	Oh, was that like two years ago?
1377420	1378420	Yeah, it was two years ago.
1378420	1380900	That was a, that was the first time we got to play monsters and monocles.
1380900	1383580	I've been making this game too long.
1383580	1387540	Okay, well, first off, before we get into the history of the game, let's talk a little
1387540	1389060	bit about what the game is.
1389060	1392500	So for those that don't know what monsters and monocles is, what's the pitch?
1392500	1395140	What's what's, what's the game in a nutshell?
1395140	1396140	Sure.
1396180	1401540	So a very kind of classical, like frantic top down twin stick shooter very much inspired
1401540	1403020	by like old arcade games.
1403020	1409860	You've got your gauntlet, you've got a smash TV is four player co-op, both local and online.
1409860	1411820	And it's a procedural game.
1411820	1416580	So the levels, the objectives, the loot and stuff is different each time you play.
1416580	1419460	It's kind of, kind of the, the core of the game right there.
1419460	1423540	And we just launched an early access about two months ago and we're working on trying
1423540	1425380	to do monthly content updates.
1425380	1429620	And I think we probably about six to nine months of content update planned before we're
1429620	1430620	done.
1430620	1431620	Oh, wow.
1431620	1432620	That's a, that's pretty impressive.
1432620	1433620	Yeah.
1433620	1434620	We got a long way to go.
1434620	1437740	Um, you know, it's a, it's a, we're at a great point.
1437740	1441060	Like we're, like we're, we're so happy to see that people are enjoying the game and
1441060	1444940	where it is now, but like knowing where we want to take it versus where it is now, like
1444940	1447980	I can't wait to start getting more and more of the content and then people getting to
1447980	1449100	see that stuff.
1449100	1452500	So, and if you guys want to check out monsters and monocles for yourself, it is available
1452500	1454020	on Steam early access right now.
1454020	1459420	You can also check out the website monstersandmonocles.com and at least like, you know, it's a radio
1459420	1462580	show so I can't show you a game play, but at least check out, there's like a bunch of
1462580	1467340	YouTubers that have been doing the, the preview on the Steam early access that are showing
1467340	1468340	off the game.
1468340	1471500	So at least check it out cause it's got a, it's got a pretty cool little art style to
1471500	1472500	it.
1472500	1473500	Yeah.
1473500	1474500	Yeah.
1474500	1475500	I know.
1475500	1476500	And we're a two man team working on the game.
1476500	1479620	I do all the programming and Craig does all the art and I absolutely, I adore Craig's
1479620	1480620	art.
1480620	1483620	It's one of the reasons we ended up working together is like, I've always loved the work
1483660	1486860	that he's done and I jumped at the chance to get to do a game with him.
1486860	1491300	So yeah, you guys are kind of like a retro look, like a, like a 16 bit kind of to me
1491300	1492780	is kind of the look of the game.
1492780	1495860	But you, you, it's like a steampunk theme game, right?
1495860	1496860	Yeah.
1496860	1497860	Yeah.
1497860	1503180	Victorian steampunk instead of a rope, like we've been calling it a gentleman mic and
1503180	1507300	you know, it's like, it's, it's very much a silly kind of lighthearted game.
1507300	1509940	Like there are no serious overtones or themes to it.
1509940	1512060	It's very like fast paced fun.
1512060	1518460	Like we have a crumpet cannon and we have a dog in a smoking jacket and Baron Von Dogface
1518460	1521500	that you can play as, as a character.
1521500	1523900	It's very much just kind of like a lighthearted, like jokey game.
1523900	1526940	Like if you could have told 12 year old me, like make your ultimate arcade game, it would
1526940	1528340	ended up a lot like this.
1528340	1529340	That's awesome.
1529340	1530860	So where, where, and well, that kind of leads into my question.
1530860	1534540	So, so how long has this big game been in development and where, where the heck did
1534540	1535640	this idea come from?
1535640	1537300	How was this game born?
1537300	1543080	So we started development in January of 2014.
1543080	1546700	So it's a little over two and a half years now.
1546700	1551980	And Craig and I had been wanting to make a game together for ages and it just had never
1551980	1552980	really worked out time-wise.
1552980	1557460	Like I was doing a job, he was, he was working on another project and it never lined up until
1557460	1558460	then.
1558460	1562060	And so we sat down and said, what's a, what's a short game that we can make in like six
1562060	1564120	to nine months?
1564120	1567600	And two and a half years later, here we are.
1567600	1573240	You know, and for us, the genesis of it was we loved the arcade growing up and like going
1573240	1576460	to the arcade with your friends, like with a stack of quarters, playing a game together
1576460	1578200	and just having a blast.
1578200	1582080	And it was that kind of gaming experience we really wanted to recapture with Monsters
1582080	1583080	and Monocles.
1583080	1584880	But times have changed and technology has changed.
1584880	1586640	Like we don't live near each other.
1586640	1587640	Craig lives down in LA.
1587640	1589640	I live up in Davis.
1589640	1596280	And it was, you know, how can we recreate those experiences with what we have available?
1596280	1599600	Even though we, you know, we're at a different stage in our lives, we both have kids now,
1599600	1601000	we don't live near each other.
1601000	1605680	And so, you know, kind of focusing on fast gameplay that you can jump in and out of,
1605680	1611520	you know, that, that kind of quick, like, like focused, focused missions and stuff instead
1611520	1616760	of these long, like kind of more narrative, narrative structured games, you know.
1616760	1620600	If I'm playing online, you know, long term, our goal is to be, he could jump into the
1620600	1622960	game and play with me for as long as he can manage.
1622960	1627520	And then if he has to go, he has to go and I can keep playing, you know, and, and we
1627520	1630600	can enjoy the time that we have together when, when we can play.
1630600	1634000	And, you know, when I want to play, want to play solo, I can do that too.
1634000	1636320	That's pretty cool that you can kind of drop in and out like that.
1636320	1639460	That's, and that's, that, that does remind me a lot as well of like, like you compared
1639460	1642040	to Gauntlet earlier and Gauntlet was a lot like that.
1642040	1645840	You could just kind of walk up, join in and then, you know, when you inevitably die, because
1645840	1647800	Gauntlet was designed to go through your quarters.
1647800	1648800	I'm sorry.
1648800	1649800	That game was...
1649800	1650800	It was.
1650800	1651800	Player, player needs food badly.
1651800	1652800	Yeah.
1652800	1654920	There was like the built in mechanism that you would die after a certain amount of time.
1654920	1655920	So yeah.
1655920	1656920	No.
1656920	1659160	And I mean, that was, I mean, that was arcade designed in a nutshell, right?
1659160	1663440	Like it was, it was designed to take your money at a constant rate.
1663440	1664440	So we don't do that.
1664440	1665440	That's good.
1665440	1666440	It's just the one price.
1666440	1669440	You give us 15 bucks, the game is yours forever.
1669440	1670440	Awesome.
1670440	1672360	And that includes these content updates, right?
1672360	1676860	Are you, are you planning DLC or is all this stuff that you're doing like free add-ons?
1676860	1678480	We're not talking about any DLC at this point.
1678480	1681320	I mean, we're still in early access, like all the stuff that we're doing now, we still
1681320	1683880	consider a base part of the game.
1683880	1690520	And you know, we're also working on allowing people to mod the game as they see fit.
1690520	1695040	So you know, I'd love to get to the point where people can add new guns, new enemies,
1695040	1701000	new maps, if they want to be really ambitious, you know, and how much people kind of want
1701000	1704740	to get involved with that, you know, it's going to scale, like adding a new character
1704740	1709120	would just be basically drawing the art for the character and editing a data file or two.
1709120	1711720	And then, hey, all of a sudden, you've got a new character that you can send to other
1711720	1714920	people or put up on Steam Workshop.
1714920	1718960	Okay, that's going to be awesome that you open it up to modders, I mean, there's going
1718960	1719960	to be awesome stuff.
1719960	1723320	And then there's going to be, you know, CD, humor, weird stuff, too.
1723320	1729160	But yeah, I mean, you know, I assume that the first thing that's made is a gun that
1729160	1730160	shoots a penis.
1730160	1733200	I'm just expecting that to happen.
1733200	1735360	It seems to happen whenever you open up mod support.
1735360	1738040	I might just do it as the example to get it out of the way.
1738040	1741120	Yeah, you might as well just do the dildo gun.
1741120	1742120	Just get it out of the way.
1742120	1743120	This is true.
1743120	1746000	What is that they have in Saints Row, the giant purple dildo bat or whatever?
1746000	1747000	Yeah, the dildo bat.
1747000	1748000	Yeah.
1748000	1749000	I mean, it is true.
1749000	1753120	Yeah, we always talk about the TTP of a game or the time to penis.
1753120	1754120	Yeah.
1754120	1759800	No, it's, but you know what, I mean, I grew up as a PC gamer and I loved like kind of
1759840	1760840	getting into the data files.
1760840	1765480	Like I got my start in making video games by going and messing with the games that I
1765480	1766480	had purchased.
1766480	1770160	You know, I couldn't afford developer tools and this was before the days of like Linux
1770160	1771800	and free compilers and all that stuff.
1771800	1776320	So I got my start by like finding these files and like mucking with them and seeing how
1776320	1777880	it changed the game.
1777880	1779080	And that's really important for me.
1779080	1784840	Like if I can get one kid into video games by he mucked with my game and said, hey, maybe
1784840	1785840	I can do this too.
1785840	1787960	Like that would be like mission accomplished for me.
1787960	1789480	That would be the best thing ever.
1789480	1791720	Are there other games on your resume that you've done?
1791720	1795680	I saw that Retro Dreamer had done some like mobile development, but are there?
1795680	1798400	So this is my first game with Retro Dreamer.
1798400	1803400	I've been making games professionally for 12 years now.
1803400	1808760	And I started in mobile and did mobile for a long time, like even before the iPhone and
1808760	1811480	stuff.
1811480	1816480	And then from there, the iPhone took off and all of my work was basically on the iPhone.
1816520	1824200	So I worked for companies like N.G. Moco, which is now DNA, Electronic Arts, and some
1824200	1829000	other big companies too, doing contract work and making games for them.
1829000	1832620	After a while I ran away screaming and said, maybe I'll be an indie developer.
1832620	1833620	And now here we are.
1833620	1834620	You know what's interesting?
1834620	1837820	We hear that story a lot from indie developers here on this show is that like half the indie
1837820	1842440	developers kind of were starting on like as indie and then the other half are like, well,
1842440	1846200	I used to do the big studio development and I ran away screaming and wanted to do my own
1846200	1847200	thing.
1847200	1848200	Yeah.
1848200	1853760	I mean, it's studio work, it's really rewarding in some way because you're usually working
1853760	1857520	with an amazing group of people and they really are amazing because they're all like you.
1857520	1861120	They got into games because they wanted to make them and they know a ton of stuff and
1861120	1865560	it's super inspiring, but it's definitely a grind, especially when it's not your idea
1865560	1867280	that you're making.
1867280	1871500	So indie is a great alternative for some folks.
1871500	1876860	Tell me a little more about how this creating a game across a great distance works because
1876860	1879420	that's kind of fascinating to me is that, you know, you guys have been working on this
1879420	1883820	game for a while and you do it across this great distance of, you know, you being in
1883820	1887460	Northern California and your other developer being in Southern California, and that's,
1887460	1888960	you know, that's a good eight hour drive.
1888960	1892880	You guys can't just meet up for lunch to toss around ideas.
1892880	1896420	But I think that's pretty cool because for people out there that might be thinking about,
1896420	1899340	I want to make an indie game, but I need a little extra help.
1899380	1902300	That help doesn't necessarily need to be in your own hometown.
1902300	1904340	You're developing kind of across these great distances.
1904340	1905340	How does that work?
1905340	1906340	Yeah.
1906340	1908880	I mean, we use tools that, you know, just everybody else uses.
1908880	1911640	We use Slack for day to day chatting.
1911640	1916500	We used to use Skype, but Skype wasn't reliable for us, so we stopped using that.
1916500	1917500	And Slack has been great.
1917500	1919560	We just have a chat room up 24 seven.
1919560	1923220	If Craig's working on a new enemy or a new monster, he'll just drop images in and I can
1923220	1925380	see them being comment back and forth.
1925380	1928980	And it's, you know, it's kind of like a persistent conversation, you know.
1928980	1930780	It doesn't matter the time of day.
1930780	1932500	If I have an idea, I can paste it in there.
1932500	1935060	I can tell him that I've pushed a new build up to Dropbox.
1935060	1936060	Well, now Steam.
1936060	1937780	We don't use Dropbox anymore.
1937780	1939100	And he can check it out.
1939100	1943480	And you know, if he's working on new art or a new map or something, he can drop in there.
1943480	1945100	And that's just kind of our back and forth.
1945100	1946100	That's pretty cool.
1946100	1947100	Yeah.
1947100	1952020	And then, you know, besides that, once you're greenlit on Steam, you can push builds of
1952020	1953060	your game whenever you want.
1953060	1957740	So that's been great for us for kind of staying in sync on what's in the game and what's not.
1957740	1961060	And yeah, besides that, you know, Craig does all the art.
1961060	1962060	He gives it to me.
1962060	1963060	I integrate it with the game.
1963060	1965020	And then design is an iterative process.
1965020	1966820	We've had multiplayer in from day one.
1966820	1971420	So we can play the game together and hop on Skype or some other voice chatting thing and
1971420	1975860	talk about what we like, what we don't like, and take notes and kind of go from there.
1975860	1977820	So one thing I've been very curious about.
1977820	1983660	So Loki and I first got to play your game at the Sac Indie Arcade event in 2015, right?
1983660	1984660	Not this year, but last year.
1984660	1987000	So we got to play the game at that event.
1987000	1990500	And at the time we played it, we thought, oh, this is going to be out real soon.
1990500	1994440	This looks like a finished product, but you're still kind of working on it.
1994440	1997760	And I think, and the reason why I ask is I think a lot of games kind of go through this
1997760	2002120	is that you might play it, I mean, you might even play a big AAA game or something at E3,
2002120	2004940	and it still doesn't come out for, you know, a good year and a half or whatever.
2004940	2010240	So what have you been doing to your game since it felt so playable to now?
2010240	2011240	I don't know.
2011240	2015120	No, we've been doing a lot.
2015120	2018760	So there have been a few big things that kind of slowed us down.
2018760	2025880	First I had a new baby, so that definitely took some of my time.
2025880	2032760	And on the game side of things, we've had networking in from day one, but the game engine
2032760	2036400	that we use, Unity, they added a whole new one.
2036400	2041120	But as part of adding the new networking stack, they completely deprecated the old one, which
2041120	2045360	means we've marked this for removal at some point in the future.
2045360	2048320	We haven't announced when we're going to remove it, but we're going to remove it, and of course
2048320	2052140	that's what we had used to build it all up at that point.
2052140	2053920	And so we had to make the call, well, what do we do?
2053920	2054920	Do we move to this new system?
2054920	2056360	Do we move to our own system?
2056360	2060400	And so there was a lot of testing there, and we eventually made the call to write our own
2060400	2065640	networking stack directly on top of Steam's feature list, and that was probably a good
2065640	2069400	four months of work right there.
2069400	2073880	And then besides that, we've been polishing the game.
2073880	2077720	We really spent a lot of time changing the core mechanics.
2077720	2079440	We weren't happy with the core game feel.
2079440	2084360	And in a game like this, where it's an arcade-y thing, there's nothing to hide the gameplay
2084360	2085360	behind.
2085360	2088600	If there's something in the gameplay that's not working, it's going to stand out like
2088600	2091840	a sore thumb from the very first moment, and it's going to keep annoying you the whole
2091840	2093700	time you play.
2093700	2097040	So we stripped the game back to core principles.
2097040	2102800	I think we cut it down to like two guns in one map and three enemies for about, I'd say
2102800	2104480	about five months.
2104480	2111240	And we tweaked how much damage do guns do, how fast do they fire, how do they affect
2111240	2117000	player movement, how fast does the player move, how fast do enemies move, and just fine-tuning
2117000	2120840	each and every little piece and how they interact with each other until we were at a point where
2120840	2123400	we thought, yes, this works.
2123400	2127600	And to be honest, that's something we probably should have done to begin with, but it's tough
2127600	2130680	when you have these shows that you're going to, because you want to promote the game and
2130680	2132160	kind of build awareness.
2132160	2135840	You polish to the point where you say, this is something we can take to a demo and people
2135840	2137440	are going to have a good time with it.
2137440	2141160	But that doesn't necessarily mean that those underpinnings of your game are solid enough
2141160	2143240	to build the entire game around.
2143240	2145600	And that's kind of where we got stuck.
2145600	2149400	That's a very interesting thing to think about, I think, for a lot of people, is just how
2149400	2152200	much has to go into balance with the game.
2152200	2160800	Because if, like you say, a gun is too overpowered or something, that core mechanic is broken,
2160800	2163960	people aren't going to bother to play to the fourth or fifth level to see all the cool
2163960	2165720	art that you have later in the game.
2165720	2166720	Yeah.
2166720	2172900	And weapon balance in particular is a minefield because our launch is a great example of that.
2172900	2179160	We had a gun, the auto-stake launcher, which is basically like a crossbow that shoots vampire
2179160	2185280	killing stakes, but the auto is the upgraded version of it and it shoots it super rapidly.
2185280	2188080	And it cooled down.
2188080	2192120	We have this overheat mechanic where, for more powerful guns, since we don't have ammo
2192120	2195360	in the game because we don't want people dealing about ammo and like, can I shoot, can I not
2195360	2197880	shoot, we wanted people to shoot as much as they want.
2197880	2202240	So instead of doing ammo, we have this overheat thing where a powerful gun will eventually
2202240	2208040	overheat and you have to flip to your other gun for a little bit while it cools down.
2208040	2212280	And the auto-stake launcher was set to cool down a little too quickly, and so people realized
2212280	2215280	that they could basically just spam it and it trivialized the game for a lot of people
2215280	2219120	who realized that, and they could just fly through the content.
2219120	2226520	And that was one gun out of 25, I think, and we just missed that one value and it trivialized
2226520	2229080	the game for a lot of people.
2229080	2235640	So that's getting fixed, actually that's been fixed, that was fixed in the last update.
2236400	2241800	But yeah, it's so easy to just make one wrong change that kind of throws everything out of whack.
2241800	2248040	Wow, okay, that's so important, I think, too, to look at that balance and everything.
2248040	2252800	And I think when, you know, you and your co-developer might play this game over and over and over
2252800	2256280	and over again, and even these internal, you know, these companies that have war developers
2256280	2259080	might play it internally over and over and over again, and they're still not going to
2259080	2262680	come up with that scenario that your users might come up with.
2263240	2268960	And it's funny because you mentioned how much time we play, some of the people in our Discord
2268960	2274680	server for the game give me trouble because I'm now at about 1400 hours of time played.
2274680	2278400	I played the game a lot, but it's so easy to miss stuff, especially when you play a
2278400	2282440	game as much as we do, you just end up building these assumptions into your mind and you miss
2282440	2283960	stuff that other people see.
2283960	2288000	Right, I bet that's dangerous is that you start to assume because you just kind of know
2288000	2289600	the inner workings of the game.
2289600	2293560	You know, I think that it's so important to get new people to play the game and see
2293560	2294560	their reactions.
2294560	2299200	So that's part of the reason why you do different expos and things, right?
2299200	2302840	Like you did the Sac and the Arcade event where we saw you, but you were recently at
2302840	2303840	PAX, right?
2303840	2304840	Yeah, absolutely.
2304840	2305840	And PAX was amazing.
2305840	2310600	PAX is, I love small shows, local shows, because it's a great chance to kind of connect with
2310600	2313600	people more than you can at a big show.
2313600	2317000	But the big shows are so amazing, too, because people come from all over.
2317040	2321280	And this show was really special to me because it was the first time we'd had a show since
2321280	2325440	the game had launched, and I was actually meeting people who bought the game and enjoyed
2325440	2329320	the game and came up to tell me about it, and that just meant the world to me.
2329320	2334040	As a small developer, if I can give players any advice, if you really like a game, reach
2334040	2337920	out to the developer and tell them if they're an indie developer, because it means the world
2337920	2338920	to us.
2338920	2343420	We don't hear it very often, but when we do, it makes our day.
2343420	2349100	So having that show and having people come up to me, I was on cloud nine all four days.
2349100	2351340	It was fantastic.
2351340	2356380	So they could send that love digitally via Twitter at MonsterMonocles, right?
2356380	2360300	Yeah, or my personal one is at rje.
2360300	2363940	I will see either of those pretty much 24-7.
2363940	2367140	You must have got on the Twitter bandwagon early, like me, because you have a three-letter
2367140	2369140	name and I have a four-letter name.
2369140	2373380	Yeah, one of my friends mentioned it to me, and I made an account and then just let it
2373380	2377620	sit there for probably three years, and then I was like, oh, maybe I should actually check
2377620	2379260	Twitter out.
2379260	2380780	Convenient.
2380780	2385160	We actually have a live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, and people of course
2385160	2386160	can ask questions.
2386160	2389980	We have a good question here from RageNator in our chat room I want to ask you here.
2389980	2394460	Are there any games that you look to as being inspirational, or to put it another way, is
2394460	2399180	there a game or games that in your mind are the epitome of how a game within a genre should
2399180	2400180	be made?
2400180	2401180	Wow, that's a tough question.
2401180	2405700	Yeah, those are almost two separate questions, too.
2405700	2408300	Are there games that have really inspired you with Monsters & Monocles?
2408300	2411580	I guess you talked a little bit about the retro arcade stuff, right?
2411580	2412580	Gauntlet?
2412580	2418740	Yeah, specifically within the context of Monsters & Monocles, I would say shooters and co-op
2418740	2421260	games from the arcade.
2421260	2425700	The most direct comparison, like I said earlier, were Gauntlet and Smash TV, just in terms
2425700	2429700	of pace and style and thematics and stuff like that.
2429700	2434580	But I mean, you could look at other arcade games, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-op
2434580	2442140	was one of my all-time favorite gaming experiences in the arcade.
2442140	2447220	I think it's hard for the second part of that question to talk about the epitome of a game
2447220	2451980	within a genre, because I feel like that's going to be a very personal thing.
2451980	2457580	For me, I think I'd have a really tough time picking a game.
2457580	2463260	Maybe open-world games, like I adore the Yakuza series from SEGA, but that's a very
2463260	2467940	specific niche thing that I apparently love and nobody else in America does.
2467940	2474780	No, well, he's in Canada, but one of the guys that helped with our website, or helped, back
2474780	2479060	when we first had done it a long, long time ago, loves Yakuza and always keeps me updated
2479060	2480340	on what's going on with that series.
2480340	2481340	So you're not alone.
2481340	2482900	Oh, it's the best.
2482900	2491220	It's such an interesting series to me, and I could talk for hours about it, but I won't.
2491220	2492220	Look at this.
2492220	2493340	You're winning tons of points in our chat room.
2493340	2496780	Tigerclaw says, big points for mentioning Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Dungeon
2496780	2500460	Buster said, holy shit, a fellow Yakuza fan, yeah, it's really the best.
2500460	2502420	Hey, there's three of us, all right.
2502420	2505620	You guys should start a club.
2505620	2509420	The first one on the PlayStation 4 that's coming out is coming out in the States in,
2509420	2512180	I think, January, and I'm clearing my calendar.
2512460	2513460	I'm going to play it to death.
2513460	2514460	I can't wait.
2514460	2518460	I just want to point out, he threatened to do this in a tweet before the show, too, that
2518460	2520300	he was going to derail this with the Yakuza chat.
2520300	2521300	Look what happened.
2521300	2526100	Hey, it's not nearly as bad as it could be.
2526100	2530260	I haven't gotten to any of my theories about how that game is put together, but it really
2530260	2533380	is a fascinating series that I think more people should check out.
2533380	2538060	All right, fair enough, and it's one of those things where it's like, there's so many games
2538060	2539420	and just not enough time.
2539420	2540420	Oh, geez, yeah.
2540660	2545780	I mean, just this week, I think I bought four games and I played one of them.
2545780	2549260	I don't know how I'm going to, like, this is my Steam backlog problem in a nutshell.
2549260	2551140	I have so many games I want to play.
2551140	2554460	And I don't know if you're as big of a fan as I am, but can you imagine that right now
2554460	2557460	is the time we were supposed to be playing Final Fantasy XV as well?
2557460	2558460	Oh, my God.
2558460	2563620	Well, yeah, and then the World of Warcraft expansion came out of nowhere, and I had completely
2563620	2569140	forgotten I had pre-ordered it, and then I lost about 60 hours of my life to that.
2569340	2570980	It's fantastic, by the way.
2570980	2571980	I agree.
2571980	2572980	I agree.
2572980	2579460	Yeah, and God, yeah, and there's just so many, like, you know, when we talked about launching
2579460	2584460	the game, we tried to find an empty week on the calendar where there wasn't a ton of great
2584460	2586600	stuff coming out, and that week doesn't exist anymore.
2586600	2591060	There's amazing stuff coming out every week of the year, and it's mind-blowing to me.
2591060	2593840	There's never a better time to be a video game fan.
2593840	2595700	There's just an embarrassment of riches.
2595700	2598620	Yeah, and this week especially, we're going to talk about it a little later in the show,
2598620	2604340	but PlayStation VR this week, I mean, that is going to blow up PlayStation with, I think,
2604340	2606180	there's something like 40 new releases this week.
2606180	2609740	Yeah, and I'm so sad I didn't get a pre-order in on time.
2609740	2610740	I missed it.
2610740	2614980	Oh, no, we're going to talk about that a little later in the show, about where we're standing
2614980	2618660	on the VR right now, but let me go back to Monsters & Monocles a little bit.
2618660	2622700	Funny enough, since we brought up PlayStation, I just kind of want to ask you, like, I noticed
2622700	2627220	that there is, it's out there that you guys are working on a PlayStation 4 version.
2627220	2630740	I know I've seen the trailer on the official PlayStation account.
2630740	2634500	Are you guys talking at all, any type of time frame for when that's going to happen?
2634500	2638900	So it's definitely a ways off, it'll be next year sometime.
2638900	2643340	We need to finish the Steam version before we can bring it over to PlayStation.
2643340	2648420	We can't do early access on the PS4 like we are with Steam, so we need to get all the
2648420	2653900	content in and kind of have that blessed 1.0 version and be out of early access on Steam,
2653900	2657060	and then that's the version that will come over to PlayStation.
2657060	2661780	I'm hoping it'll be very close to the time that we do the 1.0 on Steam.
2661780	2666140	The game is up and running on the PlayStation already and has been since, god, for over
2666140	2672420	a year now, and Sony let us show it at PlayStation Experience last year, which was another fantastic
2672420	2673820	show that we got to do.
2673820	2674820	Oh, cool.
2674820	2679900	So yeah, no, we're really excited about the PlayStation version, especially for the local
2679900	2680900	co-op mode.
2680900	2685460	We've had local in from day one for people who prefer to play that way.
2685460	2692860	But PC gamers, we've noticed local co-op doesn't get a ton of use, it's much more online.
2692860	2698020	But I feel like with friends and family, local on a console is kind of where the heart and
2698020	2699020	soul of local is.
2699020	2701700	So I'm really excited to have a console release too.
2701700	2704940	And was that hard to get involved with PlayStation?
2704940	2709820	Because for an indie developer, the fact that you guys are a two-man team, getting invited
2709820	2712180	to PlayStation Experience, that's a pretty big deal.
2712180	2718420	Yeah, PlayStation Experience was amazing and definitely a bit out of the blue.
2718420	2721180	But Sony has been an amazing partner.
2721180	2724660	And the amount of outreach they've done over the last few years to indie developers has
2724660	2725660	really been amazing.
2725660	2731900	And again, especially if I kind of look back at where things were when I started 10 to
2731900	2737700	12 years ago, if you wanted to get into console development, you needed to have an official
2737700	2743620	company that had its own building, you needed to have a security setup for dev kits and
2743620	2744620	stuff.
2744620	2751220	And then dev kits, you were talking $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 just to get started.
2751220	2758180	And then if you wanted to ship anything, there was no digital, so you had to find a publisher.
2758180	2761460	Consoles, just like everything else, has gotten easier and easier, and I think we're better
2761460	2762460	off for it.
2762460	2766500	I think we've seen a wider variety of games than we've ever seen before, and that can
2766500	2772460	very much be attributed to the walls being lowered and them being more accepting of smaller
2772460	2773460	teams.
2773460	2779340	Well, Ryan, I'm going to wrap things up here because we've taken plenty of your time tonight.
2779340	2782100	I really appreciate you joining us here on the program, though, but I really want to
2782100	2786060	wish you continued luck with the continued development of Monsters & Monocles and the
2786060	2789220	monthly content things you guys are planning over on Steam.
2789220	2793740	And again, if you guys are interested at all, if this sounds like this kind of old-school
2793740	2800180	arcade game, Smash TV meets procedural generation meets steampunk jokes and stuff, if that sounds
2800180	2803820	up your alley, I really encourage you guys to check it out on Steam Early Access right
2803820	2804820	now.
2804820	2806980	Somebody posted the link in the chatroom earlier, so there you go, and those of you listening
2806980	2811220	on the podcast feed can find it with one easy search, I'm sure.
2811220	2814540	It would be very hard to forget a name like Monsters & Monocles.
2814540	2818740	Ryan, anything else you want to plug here real quick before we let you go?
2818740	2821580	No, you know what, that's it.
2821580	2825660	And just thanks so much for having me on, let me chat about the game a bit.
2825660	2829540	If anybody has any other questions about the game and didn't get them in tonight, feel
2829540	2833620	free to hit me up on Twitter at R-J-E.
2833620	2836580	And yeah, if you check out the game, I hope you have a blast.
2836580	2837580	Is that a pun?
2837580	2838580	It is now.
2838580	2839580	All right, excellent.
2839580	2844380	Ryan, thank you so much for taking the time out to join us here at Orange On Radio.
2844380	2847740	Best of luck with the game, really look forward to the continued patches and the eventual
2847740	2848740	PS4 release.
2848740	2849740	Thanks guys, have a good one.
2849740	2850740	All right, take care, buddy.
2850900	2851900	All right, bye-bye.
2851900	2852900	Bye-bye.
2852900	2857740	So Ryan with Retro Dreamer, talking about Monsters & Monocles, thanks to him for taking
2857740	2858740	the time out.
2858740	2859740	That's great.
2859740	2861300	You can tell he's just a gaming fan, too.
2861300	2864860	And obviously he has his things he's passionate about, which might not even necessarily be
2864860	2867140	the same genre he's developing in right now.
2867140	2873940	Like I don't think I see a lot of Yakuza necessarily in Monsters & Monocles, although Dungeon Buster
2873940	2878020	says in our chat, says a great interview and good luck.
2878020	2880500	Also please put in a Yakuza themed Easter egg.
2881260	2882260	You never know.
2882260	2883260	You never know what might happen with that.
2883260	2884260	There you go.
2884260	2888540	All right, well, moving on, getting back into some news, well, let me talk about my gaming
2888540	2889540	week real quick.
2889540	2892120	So I already talked a little bit about GamerX, but I want to talk about some of the video
2892120	2895940	games I was playing this past week, which, like Ryan, I was also playing that new World
2895940	2901100	of Warcraft expansion, but Final Fantasy XIV got a patch this past week, so I was checking
2901100	2903100	that out as well.
2903100	2906680	Actually it feels like it was this past week because I was gone and GamerX was actually
2906680	2909340	two weeks ago, so I was checking that out as well.
2909340	2911460	So here's something else I've been playing.
2911460	2916300	So do you remember how we kept telling the listeners, we said if they actually announce
2916300	2918740	the NX, we'll do a show, right?
2918740	2923060	Obviously that didn't happen because we didn't do a show, but I would say the number two
2923060	2926060	thing on the list happened last week.
2926060	2927760	What was the number two thing?
2927760	2930220	Lost Odyssey became backwards compatible on Xbox One.
2930220	2931700	Oh yeah, that's right.
2931700	2938180	So you know I was excited about that, so I've been playing some Lost Odyssey on Xbox One,
2938180	2941300	and I've got to say that game has aged pretty well.
2941300	2944500	For as old of a game as it is, it holds up really well.
2944500	2947460	Looks great on Xbox One.
2947460	2951580	I remember one place that that game got razzed in the early days, especially in the review,
2951580	2953260	was the loading times.
2953260	2954940	Well think about this now.
2954940	2957340	It's now on your hard drive.
2957340	2961540	And I guess you could install games back during Lost Odyssey, but I want to say there was
2961540	2964980	something like, it wasn't recommended for the multi-disc games or something.
2964980	2968220	I seem to remember that being a thing back in the day.
2968220	2971800	But anyway, you can install it to the Xbox One drive, and I feel like some of the loading
2971800	2975420	times for battles and stuff aren't as bad as they were.
2975420	2980660	So interesting, maybe some of that stuff has even been improved upon a little bit.
2980660	2984560	So I've been able to play very far into the game, but yes, thank you to everybody who
2984560	2988860	tweeted me the day that that was announced, which was conveniently the day that I was
2988860	2989860	leaving to go to GamerX.
2989860	2994960	I didn't get to check it out until I got back, but yes, I definitely got in on Lost Odyssey
2994960	2997080	and was playing that and checking that out.
2997080	2999600	So very, very, very, very happy about that.
2999600	3002960	And there's also other backwards compatible stuff that popped in this week.
3002960	3006920	Puzzle Quest 2, which was cool, Bejeweled 3, like just some random...
3006920	3010080	Yeah, there was some PopCap stuff that was actually on there for free.
3010080	3017720	I'm not sure if that was a glitch or something, but like Bejeweled 2, 3, I want to say, was
3017720	3023720	it Feeding Frenzy 1 and 2, and then something else.
3023720	3025840	Oh no, I didn't catch any of that when it was...
3025840	3028600	Well, I'd also bought all those games on 360, so...
3028600	3033440	Right, yeah, I think I owned quite a few of those as well, and I don't have an Xbox One
3033440	3035960	yet, so who knows.
3035960	3039320	But anyway, it was really cool to be able to revisit Lost Odyssey, and yes, I was very
3039320	3043020	excited when they announced that and getting to go visit that.
3043020	3046120	So yeah, if you haven't played it yet, now's a great time to go visit it.
3046120	3047120	Although, I had heard...
3047120	3050800	I don't know if this was changed, but I had heard you actually still can't buy it digitally,
3050800	3051800	which kind of surprises me.
3051800	3052920	I don't think you can.
3052920	3053920	It's weird.
3053920	3056920	So you gotta go find a used copy somewhere, which you can find them, but I think they
3056920	3059680	got smart and they started jacking up the prices.
3059680	3060960	I was at a local store.
3060960	3061960	I was at the local...
3061960	3062960	I was at Dimple.
3062960	3067080	They were charging $19.99 for it, and I was like, dang, this thing must be scarcer than
3067080	3068080	I thought.
3068080	3071360	I don't think they're that savvy, but yeah.
3071360	3076200	Anyway, so yeah, that was pretty much my gaming week.
3076200	3082280	I think that was between being at a convention and everything, that was a lot in my week.
3082320	3087400	So let's talk about some of the news that we missed last week, since we never got around
3087400	3089240	to that particular kickoff topic.
3089240	3094720	So some of the things that we had missed last week, the Japanese NES Classic was announced.
3094720	3096000	Did you hear about that?
3096000	3097280	Yeah, the Famicom one.
3097280	3098280	The Famicom one.
3098280	3100880	So they are getting some different games.
3100880	3103840	So they are not getting some of the things that we're getting, and I don't have the list
3103840	3110240	of what they don't get, but they are getting Yie Ar Kung Fu, Solomon's Key.
3110280	3115200	They are getting the Japanese version of River City Ransom on theirs, which is pretty cool.
3115200	3117760	So yeah, NES Open Tournament Golf.
3117760	3120080	So they're getting their own cool little...
3120080	3121560	It's almost worth the import, maybe.
3121560	3122560	I know, right?
3122560	3123560	I wonder if that would work on...
3123560	3124560	I don't see why not.
3124560	3125560	It's HDMI.
3125560	3126560	HDMI, yeah.
3126560	3127600	Yeah, that's a good point.
3127600	3129280	Those might be fun to import.
3129280	3130280	Hmm.
3130280	3132360	You bring up a good thought there.
3132360	3134400	So that was big news.
3134400	3139480	I guess the Lost Odyssey news, of course, that I already touched on, was a pretty big deal.
3139480	3142640	Neo Geo titles are coming to the PlayStation 4 Arcade Archives.
3142640	3146360	I don't know if you guys are following that series on PlayStation 4, but that's where
3146360	3150040	you can get Bubble Bobble, Gradius II, Mighty Bomb Jack.
3150040	3152600	They have some old-school 80s classics in here.
3152600	3154280	Well, now they're going to get Neo Geo games.
3154280	3158640	They've announced Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown, going to be coming to PlayStation 4.
3158640	3163800	If only they had that wrapped into some sort of classic arcade-type thing, you know.
3163800	3165840	Let's see.
3165880	3171560	Also, uh, Bit.Trip Runner 3 was announced, so that series is going to be continuing.
3171560	3176200	Is it so hard, like, I know this is like something that, they've done different games like this,
3176200	3181360	but can we get, like, a remaster of, like, the old San Francisco Rush or something like
3181360	3182360	that?
3182360	3188040	Or, like, because those games look like dog shit on, you know, everything, because at
3188040	3189920	the time, that's all it could do.
3189920	3194200	But nowadays, like, I don't necessarily want them, like, to make new stuff because the
3194200	3198080	new Rush games aren't that great, but the old ones are great, so let's just, I'm sure
3198080	3200040	they can update everything and just keep the same tracks.
3200040	3201640	What the hell does that have to do with Bit.Trip Runner?
3201640	3203640	I don't know, we were talking about classic arcades.
3203640	3208520	Alright, well, I'm excited about Bit.Trip Runner 3 because I love the first two.
3208520	3211400	The second was a huge, like, step up from the first two, and the first was pretty good
3211400	3215000	as it was, so that will be very, very interesting.
3215000	3219000	And for those of you that are playing Stardew Valley, you're going to be able to get divorced
3219000	3222040	in Stardew Valley now, so if you don't like your spouse, you can fix that.
3222040	3223040	That's new in Stardew Valley.
3223080	3226680	Well, that's a lot better than the previous way, which was throwing her into a combine,
3226680	3227680	but, you know.
3227680	3232960	Do you remember Firewatch, that indie game that had come out on PlayStation 4 not that
3232960	3235880	long ago, and I think they just released on Xbox One recently?
3235880	3236880	Yes.
3236880	3238680	Firewatch has sold one million copies.
3238680	3241320	They're going to make a movie out of it, apparently.
3241320	3246680	That's kind of random, but I could, I can kind of see it, like, you know, it was a game
3246680	3248720	that was very driven by story.
3248720	3251560	I don't, I mean, it's going to be interesting.
3251560	3252880	Is it going to be a scary movie?
3252920	3254320	Like, what are they going to do with it?
3254320	3256520	I haven't played the game, so I don't know what the story is.
3256520	3258320	I'm curious about that.
3258320	3259920	That'll be interesting.
3259920	3263120	So that is some of what you missed last week.
3263120	3265920	Obviously, we can't fit everything in, but those are some of the things that caught my
3265920	3266920	eye.
3266920	3272040	Before we get into this week's gaming news, I want to mention we will be here live next
3272040	3273040	week.
3273040	3274240	We will have an OLR live next week.
3274240	3279880	However, I'm going to be running in really late, as I'm going to be gone this weekend.
3279880	3282160	This is convention time of year, Loki.
3282160	3284160	I'm going to be gone this weekend as well.
3284160	3287000	I'm going to be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest in Las Vegas.
3287000	3290160	So I will be there for the convention Friday, Saturday.
3290160	3291720	So I fly back on Sunday.
3291720	3293920	Thankfully, Vegas is only like an hour and 15 minute flight.
3293920	3295920	So it's really short flight.
3295920	3299960	But I fly back and I get home at like one o'clock.
3299960	3303440	So I'm going to be cutting it, which I know it sounds like a lot of time, but it's really
3303440	3306840	not when you consider that I have to drive back from the airport and you know, all that
3306840	3307840	stuff.
3307840	3309840	So Loki is going to take care of producing the show next week.
3309840	3312960	So I'm not as worried about that, but it's, it's, you know, we're going to be cutting
3312960	3314160	it a little close next week.
3314160	3317760	So I just, you know, kind of, kind of letting you guys know that we may get a late start
3317760	3320200	if anything weird happens with the flights.
3320200	3323200	But hopefully that won't happen.
3323200	3329560	We will also not have a live show, Veterans Day weekend, which is going to be November
3329560	3330760	13th.
3330760	3333120	There will not be a live show.
3333120	3339480	However, as a lot of you are highly anticipating the 666th episode on the show scheduled to
3339520	3345120	take place the next week on 20 November, we will be doing something that we can actually
3345120	3346120	number as a show.
3346120	3347720	So we'll probably tape earlier in the week.
3347720	3348720	We've done this before.
3348720	3350880	We'll tape on like a Tuesday or Wednesday night.
3350880	3354480	And then that'll be our show for the week so that we don't lose the numbering.
3354480	3357600	And we can still bring you episode 666 on 20 November, which by the way, I still have
3357600	3359640	no idea what we're doing or how I get.
3359640	3360880	Now it's just a thing.
3360880	3364120	Now it's just a thing that we have to do to do episode 666 on 20 November.
3364120	3367880	So we'll, we'll be figuring that out in the next month.
3367880	3370920	I am going to Chicago.
3370920	3375240	Just the planets and stars aligned in just the right way.
3375240	3377360	They're doing a big Ingress thing in Chicago.
3377360	3381520	And usually I would not spend all this money to fly out just to play a stupid cell phone
3381520	3382520	game.
3382520	3386040	But it's like, I haven't really spent quality time in Chicago.
3386040	3390000	I went to, I went to anime, oh shit, I forget the name.
3390000	3391760	I'm going to get such shit for that.
3391760	3394480	Anime Midwest something happens there.
3394480	3397640	I forgot the name because it's been like 10 years since I was there.
3397640	3401560	I didn't see anything but like the hotel and like a little piece of downtown when I
3401560	3402560	was there.
3402560	3405120	So I get to spend some proper time in Chicago and I have some friends that live there.
3405120	3409880	So thanks to my buddies that used to do the show Koopa Club and I know some more people
3409880	3411680	just from the internet that live there.
3411680	3414640	So it's kind of one of those things where it all lines up where I get to visit all those
3414640	3419560	folks and then also see, get to play some Ingress out of it at the event.
3419560	3423200	So but because of that, we will not be here live that weekend.
3423200	3424720	So just so you guys know.
3425280	3429080	Yes, and Wardle King says 666 still on November 20th.
3429080	3432920	Yes, we will do whatever we have to do to make sure that that happens, even if we have
3432920	3437160	to put out something really short as episode 665.
3437160	3438160	You know what?
3438160	3442200	After 600 plus episodes, we've earned it if we want to call a 20 minute show a show.
3442200	3444800	All right.
3444800	3446040	That's our housekeeping stuff.
3446040	3449120	Don't forget to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3449120	3451880	We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
3451920	3454640	Let's get into what's been going on in the news this week.
3454640	3455640	Loki.
3455640	3456640	All right.
3456640	3462920	So apparently the Washington State Gambling Commission has issued a warning to Valve to
3462920	3468640	basically telling them, hey, you guys have to stop users from using Steam to, you know,
3468640	3476680	gamble Counter Strike Go skins or else, you know, basically.
3476680	3482760	I want to say there was a lawsuit against them for that, but somehow they it got dropped.
3482760	3488880	But yeah, apparently, you know, it's there's quite a bit of money in it.
3488880	3494560	It says that and I hardly I don't believe this number real quick.
3494560	3500040	I mean, they basically according to, I guess, estimates from some e-sports betting report,
3500040	3504960	they're seeing that Counter Strike Go Lounge has made approximately one billion dollars
3504960	3511320	in skin gambling since January 1st and August 1st death.
3511320	3513080	That's not there's no way.
3513080	3514640	I'm sorry.
3514640	3520680	There's maybe one million in magic money that doesn't fucking exist, but I'd one billion
3520680	3522000	dollars in real money.
3522000	3528520	No, no, I'm sorry that that's there's no fucking way.
3528520	3529520	I mean, I don't know.
3529520	3533600	I don't really know if Valve is necessarily responsible for that, because, I mean, they
3533600	3542560	do facilitate you buying stuff and, you know, you can trade it and sell it on their store.
3542560	3546560	It's just mainly a third party site that's kind of exploiting them to do gambling and
3546560	3547560	stuff.
3547560	3550560	So I don't really know how much control they have over other than, you know, banning those
3550560	3552060	sites.
3552060	3558800	But I mean, I mean, as long as they don't make the situation worse by, I don't know,
3558800	3562760	say introducing something else that could be sold and gambled for.
3562760	3564800	Oh, wait, but they just did.
3564800	3571880	So yes, they're actually bringing monetized limited use sprays to Counter Strike Go.
3571880	3573280	That's right, graffiti.
3573280	3576680	So you can earn them in your weekly drops.
3576680	3582600	You can buy them on the Steam Marketplace or purchase a community made graffiti box
3582600	3585720	with the proceeds of the sale being shared among community artists.
3585720	3592580	All right, I don't know if you can trade the, I assume if you're buying them in the marketplace
3592580	3594260	you can probably trade them.
3594260	3596180	Yeah, most of that stuff you can trade.
3596180	3599620	I mean, there's parameters around when you can trade and what kinds of accounts can do
3599620	3601500	it, because that's been exploited an awful lot.
3601500	3606180	But you know, for the average user like you and me who are playing games, you know, the
3606180	3610020	way they're intended and so forth, yeah, you can probably trade that stuff.
3610020	3614460	I don't know who'd want to use it, but people will buy stuff like that.
3614460	3615460	They will.
3615460	3619660	Well, and so with that, you know, that just means that's one more thing that could be
3619660	3621180	possibly thrown on that market.
3622140	3626620	I don't know, it's like, I don't, I think the whole gambling thing is stupid.
3626620	3632260	Yeah, I mean, that seems like that could be a pretty big deal that could have some big
3632260	3636540	fallout if that, you know, if Valve is found to be facilitating this type of thing, because
3636540	3638540	I guess I just never thought of the gambling.
3638540	3642180	The reason they're saying they're facilitating is because they have the, I guess, the APIs
3642180	3646560	in place where you can, you know, read Steam, you know, information about Steam accounts
3646560	3649300	and stuff like that through a website.
3649300	3652900	And then also they facilitate, you know, the trading and stuff.
3652900	3654780	They have that back end for it.
3654780	3660860	But I mean, it's websites using like a creative way to kind of, you know, game the system,
3660860	3661860	I guess.
3661860	3665140	And this is like that YouTube guy who is running the company on the side.
3665140	3670220	Yeah, it's basically, so the way they kind of have it, from what I understand, they have
3670220	3676060	basically like an escrow account that, you know, takes the skin in and then you would
3676060	3681340	gamble, you know, takes the skin from everybody that's participating or gun or whatever.
3681340	3687220	And then you're gambling, basically you pay money or pay using that skin to gamble in
3687220	3693240	a raffle to win something else that's more valuable, I guess.
3693240	3696740	And so that's how they're supposed to be gambling.
3696740	3701940	I mean, it's, it is gambling, but it's just kind of, I don't know, I mean, who's it really
3701940	3702940	hurting?
3702940	3704060	That's what I want to know.
3704060	3707300	Like kids, are kids doing this because kids don't have any fucking money.
3707300	3708300	I mean, and...
3708300	3711580	Well, they have mommy and daddy's wallet and they know how to find numbers.
3711580	3714900	Mommy and daddy are fucking dumb if they're, you know, basically saying, okay, spend whatever
3714900	3715900	you want.
3715900	3722300	I mean, and like, is it, you know, is it like people that are, you know, have an income
3722300	3724140	that are just dumb and betting on this stuff?
3724140	3727340	I mean, like, who's this really hurting is what I want to know.
3727340	3730780	I mean, I just can't see that there's that much money in that.
3730780	3735820	I mean, if a gambling site is making a billion dollars off this, allegedly, and then how
3735820	3739300	much money, then Valve should be just fucking rolling, no wonder there's no fucking Half
3739300	3742380	Life 3, they're rolling in fucking money.
3742380	3744540	I just don't, I don't believe those numbers.
3744540	3749020	Does that, does that, could that billion count when money goes in and out and back in type
3749020	3750020	of thing?
3750020	3755520	Like how when people win a $50 jackpot in Vegas, but they put the money right back in,
3755520	3756520	you know, that type of thing.
3756520	3759700	It's kind of like the money counts multiple times because it's going out and in the machines.
3759740	3765860	I just, I mean, I don't believe those numbers.
3765860	3770180	Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Raginator says some people will gamble on
3770180	3774980	virtually anything, including when or where a farm animal shits, sadly enough.
3774980	3779540	Yes, but that's usually for charity.
3779540	3781980	People will bet on Mugen, right?
3781980	3783420	The I guess it's all fake currency.
3783420	3785540	Yeah, that's all the bet and that's just fake.
3785540	3787260	I mean, that's just fake.
3787260	3788260	It's not money.
3788780	3790820	Somebody's probably made it money.
3790820	3793300	No, it's just, it's, it's for fun.
3793300	3796580	You just go on there and you try to guess which character is going to win and then you
3796580	3797580	never get it right.
3797580	3798580	At least in my case.
3798580	3800580	All right, well, we'll shift topics.
3800580	3802460	Back to the salt mines.
3802460	3806060	We're going to shift topics here and talk about a big change that's happening in gaming
3806060	3807060	this week.
3807060	3810740	Um, and uh, you know, I don't know if people will be betting on this or what have you.
3810740	3813980	I bet people are going to be betting on, is it going to be successful or not?
3813980	3820020	But the only one that stands to win or lose money would be Sony, the makers of PlayStation
3820020	3821020	VR.
3821020	3822020	That's right.
3822020	3826460	I say gaming's changing this week because it's going to be the first console VR that
3826460	3827460	is being released.
3827460	3832380	And that is happening this week is what the, the Thursday, the 13th is when this is happening,
3832380	3833380	right?
3833380	3837500	Um, what's pretty impressive about this is that there are a ton of games that are going
3837500	3840820	to be released, uh, the same day as the PlayStation VR.
3840820	3847540	A partial list, Batman Arkham VR, Battlezone, Eve Gunjack and Eve Valkyrie, Harmonics Music,
3847540	3853860	Harmonics Music's VR game, Hatsune Miku Project Diva X, uh, Job Simulator, Super Stardust
3853860	3860260	Ultra VR, PlayStation VR Worlds, Rez Infinite, Rise of the Tomb Raider Blood Ties, Playroom
3860260	3863620	VR, Thumper, Until Dawn Rush of Blood.
3863620	3865300	Um, so that's just a partial list.
3865300	3870300	I mean, there is a ton of games, uh, that are being released this week with the PlayStation
3870300	3871300	VR.
3871300	3875180	Now, some of these will require the PlayStation VR, but not all of them do.
3875180	3878860	For example, Rez Infinite doesn't require the PlayStation VR.
3878860	3880980	It's just, you know, it's going to be a totally different experience.
3880980	3881980	Yeah.
3881980	3882980	With the VR.
3882980	3886900	So we've been talking, Loki and I, about the PlayStation VR and that we have both, uh, pre-ordered
3886900	3887900	the device.
3887900	3888900	Yeah.
3888900	3891220	I pre-ordered it, was it, I want to say almost a year ago at this point.
3891220	3892220	Yeah.
3892220	3893220	I feel like...
3893220	3894220	No, no, no.
3894220	3895220	It wasn't a year.
3895220	3896220	It was in March.
3896220	3897220	Yeah.
3897220	3898220	It was in March.
3898220	3899220	It was the day.
3899220	3900220	It was like GDC or something around there is when they kind of did their big announcement.
3901140	3902140	Yeah.
3902140	3903140	And that's when I first went up on Amazon and that's when I pre-ordered my PlayStation
3903140	3904420	VR as well.
3904420	3909380	So, um, are you looking forward to Thursday and the arrival of your PlayStation VR?
3909380	3911420	No, cause I've already canceled my pre-order.
3911420	3912420	Oh.
3912420	3913420	So you canceled your pre-order.
3913420	3914420	Why?
3914420	3915420	Why'd you do that?
3915420	3919220	I canceled my pre-order because one, it was expensive and I, it would really strap me
3919220	3920900	as far as money's concerned.
3920900	3925580	Two, I didn't think I would get a lot of use out of it, seeing as I have a Gear VR for
3925580	3931380	my phone and I have an Oculus Rift DK2 that I don't really use.
3931380	3936940	I kind of wanted a nice consumer headset because that would have been, you know, a lot nicer.
3936940	3942660	But also I was kind of worried with all this, you know, PlayStation Plus stuff or not PlayStation
3942660	3948820	Plus, PlayStation Pro stuff that, you know, are these games going to actually play well
3948820	3949820	on this system?
3949820	3953740	I mean, I guess it's supposed to, but what exactly is that going to, you know, mix in
3953740	3954740	with it?
3954740	3955740	And it's just, I don't know.
3955740	3960300	And I just was kind of worried that that wasn't going to be, it wasn't going to, it's going
3960300	3966540	to be just kind of an okay system, but really is it worth me dropping $400 plus money for
3966540	3967540	games?
3967540	3968540	And that's a lot of money.
3968540	3970540	I could buy an Xbox One and games for that.
3970540	3972540	I mean, seriously, why, why would I do that?
3972540	3974540	And what would I get more value out of?
3974540	3977900	Probably another game console versus PlayStation VR.
3977900	3983740	And on top of that, then after I canceled it, the, you know, the embargo came up for
3983740	3987580	people talking about the system and I got to watch the live streams from Giant Bomb
3987580	3988580	and stuff.
3988580	3992300	And it only confirmed what my worries were that it's a hot mess.
3992300	3993300	Really?
3993300	3994300	Yeah.
3994300	3998700	Like the move controllers work about as good as the move controllers used to.
3998700	4001860	I mean, they're just not very good at tracking.
4001860	4008040	The graphics themselves are okay, but you know, it was caught, there was serious issues
4008040	4010940	with the camera tracking where your head was.
4010940	4016940	It was just like, it literally was bouncing around like crazy and it was just, the controls
4016940	4020300	weren't as good as like, if you're playing on a Vive or something like that, it wasn't
4020300	4021300	as accurate.
4021300	4027060	And just, you know, if I'm going to drop that kind of money on a headset, I'm going to pick
4027060	4028060	up something.
4028060	4029060	I want something that's going to be good.
4029060	4030060	And come on.
4030060	4032500	And knowing what this trend, what they're doing nowadays with stuff, this is going to
4032500	4033500	release now.
4033500	4036820	And in a year or two later, there's going to be a better one.
4036820	4039900	So why am I going to waste my time being an early adopter?
4040420	4043620	Haven't I learned anything from the Kinect, the move, the blah, blah, blah.
4043620	4046580	I mean, I know I've learned my lesson.
4046580	4047580	I'm not going to do it.
4047580	4052660	I still want to play some of that stuff because it looks fun, but is it worth five hundred
4052660	4053660	dollars? No.
4054860	4061260	Well, I'd love to tell you what I think of my PlayStation VR that I had preordered, but
4061260	4065860	I independently came to the same conclusion you did this week and I canceled my PlayStation
4065860	4068020	VR preorder a few days ago.
4069020	4073300	And I think what it is, I think you kind of hit the nail on that.
4073300	4079380	Well, it was money is a huge component and it's the fact that, you know, I can use this
4079380	4081500	money to do a last minute trip to Chicago.
4082220	4086860	And so it's kind of one of those things where do I necessarily need to be an early adopter
4086860	4090580	on this? And I think that's what it kind of came down to for me is do I need to be the
4090580	4095180	person that has this first at this price level when I'm kind of unsure of what the future
4095180	4099220	holds. And I think something you said hits the nail on the head, which, you know, I'm
4099220	4101900	sure Sony diehards would tell me I'm wrong on.
4102260	4108020	But I, I do have extreme reservations about them releasing this and the pro in the same
4108020	4113940	year. It's an extreme amount of mixed signals with, you know, what is this thing going to
4113940	4116060	do that the pro can or cannot do?
4116100	4122780	I just I honestly, as a consumer, as a gamer fan who, you know, I'm fortunate enough to
4122820	4125820	have money that I can spend on games, but I don't have all the money in the world.
4126220	4130940	I just I can't justify this and the pro, not that I don't want, you know, VR to be
4130940	4133220	successful. I think it's going to be successful.
4133220	4139380	I hope it is. I'm not sure if I hope Sony's platform is successful, but I want it to I
4139380	4143580	don't want it to fail at all. I feel almost bad canceling it, but I shouldn't.
4143580	4146300	I've got always hundreds of dollars.
4146300	4151260	Right. And I'm always wary, though, of third party or third party like of accessories
4151260	4156860	release after the fact, because look at like the support that even like move in 3D
4156860	4163140	more when they're pushing 3D, like all their games are supporting 3D and like the move
4163140	4166940	controller and stuff. And they even have a stupid looking gun thing that you could get
4166940	4169140	for it. It was supposed to be the better way to play these games.
4169380	4173140	And that just fucking fell off the table like, oh, no, we're not supporting it anymore.
4173260	4176460	And then they bring back the move controllers to use with this because, oh, it's easy.
4176460	4177740	We don't have to develop anything else.
4177980	4181460	It's just it's old tech and it just it worked OK.
4181460	4186260	I like the move controllers, but I'm worried that it's not going to be up to snuff for,
4186260	4188180	you know, playing a VR game like this.
4188180	4193220	And it's just. I don't know, I just can't see in all these games that are coming out or
4193220	4197700	just seems like they're experiences, they're like shorter games.
4197700	4203620	I mean, I don't really want to play like this tech demo of something, you know, for Final
4203660	4210540	Fantasy and for, you know, Tomb Raider and for Batman and all in like was it, you know,
4210940	4212020	Battlefront or something like that.
4212020	4213380	It's not going to be a Battlefront game.
4213380	4214900	It's going to be kind of something different.
4215460	4218060	No, I don't want to play all these little experiences.
4218460	4220380	Five hundred dollars is not worth tech demos.
4220700	4225060	If I want to play that kind of tech demo shit, I will get a fucking better computer and a
4225060	4229140	Vive or something, because then I could download tech demos for free and I can buy
4229140	4233260	shit on Steam, which is probably way cheaper than the shit that they're selling.
4233340	4236700	Forty, you know, the sixty dollars per game.
4237540	4239740	No, I am not paying that kind of money.
4240180	4243740	Yeah, and I think I started to see the dollars add up with especially when you start to
4243740	4245900	see how many games are coming out and so forth.
4245900	4249820	It's kind of like, whoa, I'm going to be paying for the PlayStation VR and then pay for
4249820	4253140	this and this. And it's interesting because probably what even a month ago and I
4253140	4256940	probably even said it on the show in my mind, I think when they announced the pro, I was
4256940	4259820	kind of in my mind, I was like, OK, I'm going to keep the VR and I'm going to cancel the
4259860	4265940	pro. But now, like, I don't know, I can't really pinpoint where the switch in my mind
4265940	4268060	happened, but I think the opposite is going to hold true.
4268060	4271420	I think I will end up keeping the pro and I think I am going to end up getting that
4271420	4276020	system. But I'm not I kind of want to wait, wait and see where the VR is in a year.
4276220	4280300	I want to see if this really does kind of become like the next must have thing in
4280300	4284780	gaming or if it is kind of more like the even with the pro, I would just hold off on
4284780	4286260	that because, like, I think that.
4287660	4292820	I need to see what exactly what enhancements I mean, they're talking stuff, but like, I
4292820	4294980	don't know what the enhancements are going to be.
4294980	4298300	I feel like especially considering what I might be able to get selling my current
4298300	4303580	PlayStation 4 to kind of upgrade it, I feel like it's a it's it's a smaller investment.
4303580	4307260	It's only probably a couple hundred dollars at the end of the day, as opposed to five
4307260	4308740	hundred plus dollars for the VR.
4308740	4311940	Does that make sense? I guess so.
4312260	4313460	That's that's kind of where I'm at.
4313820	4317740	Dungeon Buster in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says nothing wrong with a
4317740	4318860	wait and see approach.
4319100	4323820	Act Def says PlayStation VR will be worth it, but right now you probably don't need it.
4324100	4327180	Yeah, I mean, I went gung ho when Kinect came out.
4327180	4331260	I went gung ho when like all these systems came out and it was fine.
4331260	4335020	I had fun with them. But like in the in the end, it's just like, why did I waste all
4335020	4337740	that money on it? Why did I spend so much money on this stuff?
4337740	4344700	Like, I don't know, like I just I still feel that compulsion to buy it.
4344700	4348940	Yeah. Yeah. No, I even though like even though I've seen is kind of shit and even the
4348940	4352980	reviews have been just kind of like I want to say Game Informer, give it like a C minus
4353140	4355900	and like people are just like, oh, my God, you know, this is a mess.
4355900	4357860	And they even like just watch the giant bomb stream.
4358020	4360220	They have like four hours where they're playing around with it.
4360300	4364140	Just watch it. I mean, you just seem like, holy shit, this is what they're fucking
4364140	4366380	releasing in this state.
4366380	4369340	It's just. I don't know.
4369380	4373020	I mean, yeah, it's interesting, because I hadn't even seen or heard any of that when I
4373020	4374020	finally made the decision.
4374260	4379660	Well, and in the interest of disclosing something else that I kind of ultimately
4379660	4384140	helped me be at peace with my decision, my pal Shane is keeping his preorder.
4384940	4389220	So when you know that your good buddy who's over at your house at least once, if not
4389220	4392780	twice a week, ended up buying it, you're like, you'll bring it over and I'll get to
4392780	4394300	play it at some point.
4394420	4400340	It looks nice. I may end up instead, you know, I saw that they announced a new the one
4400340	4403380	of the first phones that's going to support that dream thing.
4403380	4410900	The so the new VR, it's not really a headset, it's like lenses and stuff for.
4411220	4412420	So there's the Google Pixel.
4412500	4418180	I may upgrade my phone and do that instead, because none of that necessarily need new
4418180	4420500	phone. But I mean, the payments aren't that expensive.
4420820	4424740	And a nice new phone would be nice, I guess.
4425500	4428300	And then I can see what VR looks like on that.
4428300	4430460	I think the screen was at 4K or something.
4430460	4432220	I mean, that'd be pretty sweet, you know, on a phone.
4432220	4435180	But yeah, yeah, I don't know.
4435180	4436940	Maybe that might be the route to go or nothing.
4436980	4443140	I mean, my phone's fine. The other thought I was like, I should rebuild my DDR pads.
4443140	4446020	I've been wanting to do that for a long time now.
4446020	4449660	In fact, I'm actually in the point where I'm gathering all my notes because I had it
4450060	4453900	before fucking Windows decided, hey, we're going to crash and erase everything.
4454620	4460260	I had actually sketched out a new pad design I was going to make and then it went away.
4460340	4463860	But I have all my notes on paper, so I'm going to put that digital again.
4464060	4467340	All right. So, you know, it's it's it's a weird place.
4467340	4471580	I wish the PlayStation VR a lot of success, but I just kind of want to take a wait and see
4471580	4472860	approach where it's going to be any year.
4472860	4478220	And I really feel like, unfortunately, the throwing the pro into it really muddled a lot
4478260	4483020	of and it caused all these questions about is it going to be the best here or am I going
4483020	4486260	to end up having to buy both, which is a lot to ask in a year?
4486460	4489660	I just I think the reality is that muddled the message way too much.
4490140	4493300	Like, here's the thing, even like with the pro and stuff like that, it's like, am I going
4493300	4497220	to drop money on another console and what are my gains really on that?
4497220	4499220	Or could I buy a new PC?
4499220	4503660	Because like like even like games and stuff, we're going to talk about a little bit later,
4503660	4506220	just like dealing with, you know, issues.
4506220	4509020	I mean, PCs have their issues, too, with like some of these ported games.
4509020	4514460	But like, am I going to just I can buy a lot of these console games, like even like No Man's
4514460	4516420	Sky was like, oh, I got to get PS4 for that.
4516580	4522220	They had on Steam. And then in the end, it's like, OK, I was anticipating that.
4522220	4526620	I mean, it's like there's not a whole lot that you like, especially like PCs sounding
4526620	4532340	really good because now I can get my No Man's Sky and I can get my Forza Horizon three.
4534100	4535780	Why do I need two consoles?
4535820	4538900	I can just have a PC, which funny enough, you would have thought that I would have been
4538900	4540780	all over Forza Horizon three this week.
4540780	4544380	But I just, you know, with with the traveling and with having other stuff to play right
4544380	4546820	now, I just I haven't jumped on that bandwagon right away.
4546820	4548220	I thought I would have been all about that.
4548420	4553340	I probably won't end up buying Forza Horizon three until after I'm back from Vegas, honestly.
4553660	4556340	So I have a month break between weekend trips.
4556340	4563100	So but anyway, yeah, so I I'm going to I will probably end up holding onto the pro.
4563100	4564300	I'm going to pick that up this year.
4564300	4567340	And then next holiday, I'll evaluate VR.
4567500	4569660	I want to see if it's still supported in a year.
4569860	4571420	I want to see kind of what they're talking about.
4571420	4573860	Microsoft does, because they're going to have their system.
4573860	4575740	And who knows? By then, VR support.
4577100	4579220	Yeah, because we don't know if Microsoft's going to win.
4579220	4581620	We know they have AR, but we don't know if they're going to do VR.
4581620	4582460	So it'll be interesting.
4582460	4584860	Well, they talked about like their system would support VR.
4584860	4588780	So. Let's see what they do.
4588780	4592260	I mean, let's see. Oh, and maybe we'll see what the annex is by then.
4592260	4594220	Maybe they'll have an announcement by that.
4594340	4597140	We were going to do so good and not even bring up an X tonight.
4597140	4598900	And there you go. There you go. You be quiet.
4598900	4601140	All right. Well, I'm just let me put it this way.
4601140	4603820	Here's here's my my parallel with the annex.
4603820	4607660	And this is because like look at like we didn't know.
4608820	4611740	Yeah, I had more about this, but like it's like we didn't really know too much about
4611740	4613300	like PlayStation VR until now.
4613620	4619780	And and I just think we're just going to be disappointed because we're making up in
4619780	4621020	our head what it's going to be.
4621380	4625980	And what they have is probably not as exciting as what we're imagining it to be.
4626780	4630580	This all being said, I will be buying and playing the ever living shit out of the
4630580	4632780	Rez Infinite just just so we're clear.
4633340	4637460	Some of these games that don't require the VR, I will still be buying and playing the
4637460	4639420	crap out of and starting with Rez.
4639620	4643380	So just to be clear, this doesn't change my love of Rez whatsoever.
4644300	4647260	All right. Let's let's move on to some more news.
4647260	4648780	Loki. All right.
4650500	4653340	So Fallout 4 and Skyrim.
4653500	4657380	Guess what? There's still going to get mods on PlayStation 4.
4658900	4663620	But there's a little bit of a catch with that.
4663740	4665500	So mods are going to be coming.
4665860	4671980	So first, the mods, I believe, are coming to Skyrim, ironically, first.
4672380	4675620	And then later on, they're going to be coming to Fallout 4.
4676180	4683180	The main issue, though, that's going to differ between the what's available on PC and
4683180	4688740	Xbox versus PlayStation 4 is PlayStation 4, you will not be able to use external assets.
4689180	4694580	So you're only going to be able to use the assets that are on the disk or digital copy
4694580	4699300	or whatever. So you're not going to have like, you know, reskins or, you know, new
4699300	4704860	models, you know, lightsabers, that type of stuff that's not going to be available to
4704860	4708900	you. But, you know, all the other stuff that tweaks and, you know, other tweaks that
4708900	4711580	they have available, those could be something that you'll see.
4712100	4714100	Is this to try to prevent nudie mods?
4714820	4719180	No, this is I think to get around their weird compression and formats that they have to
4719180	4720660	have their external stuff in.
4721340	4723580	It's still disappointing, but I'll take it.
4724660	4727940	Does that mean I'm going to buy Skyrim on PlayStation 4?
4729380	4733780	Probably not. If I get an Xbox one, I'm fucking buying it on that.
4733780	4737620	I'm just excited.
4737620	4741180	At least they're getting some type of mods on PlayStation 4, because we were looking at
4741180	4743220	exactly something's better than nothing.
4743220	4747060	I'll take something. I don't really need the reskins and stuff like that.
4747340	4752820	I mean, honestly, from what I had on PC, I didn't have a lot of things that changed the
4752820	4755940	model. So I think some of the stuff was kind of cool, like the dubstep gun and stuff like
4755940	4758460	that. And of course, you got to put the nudie mods in there, too.
4758460	4761420	I mean, because because we're all children.
4762420	4764700	So, I mean, that's fine.
4764700	4768100	And, you know, I am a little disappointed that we're not going to have the Macho Man and
4768100	4771740	Randy Savage dragons in Skyrim on console.
4771740	4777580	But, you know what? Once again, this is where PC fucking this excels versus the goddamn
4777580	4779180	consoles. All right.
4779180	4784900	Well, then how about some really, you know, highly anticipated games being released on PC
4784900	4789420	such as Final Fantasy 15, Final Fantasy 15?
4789580	4792660	Some folks have been asking, is this going to come out on the PC?
4792780	4796940	And in fact, the co-director of the game, Hajime Tabata, has said that if they are to
4796940	4802980	develop a PC version of the game, it's going to take at least a year, probably more than a
4802980	4808500	year. And this is in an interview with a Spanish website called Vida Extra, which, you
4808500	4813540	know, is floating around out there and being translated and so forth, saying that on that
4813540	4818060	hypothesis, not talking about something real, just an idea, something like this would take
4818100	4819180	us more than a year.
4819380	4823860	We should work to adapt the engine, which is very laborious, and from there develop its
4823860	4828980	course. And this is a little bit of a changing course from what was said back in April
4829140	4832860	where they were saying they were going to take a good, hard look at bringing Final Fantasy
4832860	4835420	15 to PC after it was launched on consoles.
4835420	4838220	But, you know, now that's going to be a huge amount of development time.
4838500	4842500	But imagine the ways people would just mod Final Fantasy 15, you know?
4842620	4844980	Well, I don't think it's necessarily a worry of modding.
4845020	4848740	I'm just surprised it's going to take them so long, being that these platforms are now
4848740	4851820	kind of very similar to the PC in the first place.
4851820	4855740	I'm just surprised. I thought development time would have been shortened because of
4855740	4857460	that. But I don't know.
4859900	4863580	Yeah, you would think it would have been a shortened development time, but apparently,
4863940	4866340	yeah, they say it's going to take a year to do that.
4866340	4867940	So whatever. Got time.
4869180	4873980	You still got to wonder if maybe it will depend on how well Final Fantasy 15 sells on
4873980	4878060	consoles if they want to invest those resources to develop for PC or not.
4880140	4883100	I think it's going to sell fine, but I think it'll sell fine, too.
4883100	4885380	We'll see. But anyway, Loki.
4886380	4891980	All right, so there's going to be some Pokemon Go updates, actually, I think.
4892860	4895420	I'm not sure when these are going to be happening and if they've happened.
4895420	4898820	No, not yet. So they're going to be doing some tweaks.
4899020	4900260	They're going to be improving the gyms.
4901140	4906100	So now when you're going to train your Pokemon on gyms, you can actually take up to six
4906100	4910740	Pokemon because before, you know, when you battle a gym, you choose six, and when you
4910740	4912580	train, you only choose one, which is kind of odd.
4913500	4917940	Then also what's going to be nice is the medals that you earn right now, which are
4917940	4920260	pretty just kind of pointless.
4920700	4922580	They're actually going to have a point pretty soon.
4922580	4927940	So any medals you earn for, like, say, catching the same type Pokemon or walking a
4927940	4933100	certain distance and stuff, they'll give you perks to basically improve stats to
4933100	4938580	catching Pokemon, make it a little bit easier to capture Pokemon or increasing the
4938580	4943300	odds of capturing the same type or rare ones or whatever the case may be.
4945460	4949700	And they were saying that the medals you get for catching a certain amount of Pokemon
4949900	4951860	will affect the capture rates of their type.
4952140	4956620	So like, you know, if you get poison type or something, it'll make it easier to catch
4956620	4958100	poison type Pokemon or something like that.
4958140	4961420	Well, that'll be good for folks who feel like it's too hard to capture things right
4961420	4961700	now.
4962020	4965500	Well, dude, yeah, I think some of the stuff that happened, like some of these
4965500	4967380	Pokemon, it's just really silly.
4967380	4970660	Like, you know, I've gotten Pikachus or whatever.
4970660	4973540	That'll be like CP 31 or something like that.
4973540	4977300	And I throw I mean, it's bright green on the ring.
4977300	4979460	It's like, OK, this should be an easy capture.
4979580	4985340	I do a spin balls, you know, it's a perfect throw and it's like, fuck you, I'm escaping
4985340	4985980	and I ran away.
4985980	4988260	It's like, what the hell is that?
4988660	4992420	It's like I'm not going to waste a more powerful ball to catch this weak ass Pokemon.
4992500	4996540	I got to admit, though, ever since I got the accessory, I've been playing more.
4996540	5001500	I finally hit level 20 and I'm damn near level 21 in Pokemon Go because I evolved a
5001500	5004940	bunch of shit today because I've been getting so much Pidgey candy and Rotata candy from
5004940	5009500	just catching the shitty mon with the little app that I have or I'm sorry, the little
5009900	5011100	physical device that I have.
5011100	5015340	So I've been playing more of Pokemon Go thanks to that thing, I got to say.
5016140	5019940	And the crappy thing about it, though, is that I run out of pokeballs, the regular ones
5019940	5025180	so fast that actually I do only use great and ultra balls to capture Pokemon on the
5025180	5028420	phone now because I need all my regular stuff to use my device.
5028780	5032820	Otherwise, I end up in the shitty position that I was in when I was at gamer X and I
5032820	5035740	actually have to buy more pokeballs, which sucks.
5035740	5037940	Yeah, exactly what they would want you to do.
5040380	5042260	Yeah, I know, I know I won't do that again.
5042260	5043460	I promise I won't have to stick again.
5043700	5046860	I just have to do a quick note for the live listeners while I'm showing that we are
5046860	5047660	streaming right now.
5048180	5051500	We're going up and down with the live stream and unfortunately is completely out of my
5051500	5052100	control.
5052580	5057020	It's some type of error I've not seen before on Winamp where it's saying it's hanging on
5057020	5059060	the receiving authorization response.
5059700	5063020	So unfortunately, this is on our server host side, which, you know, things have been
5063020	5064700	running pretty smooth for the past few months.
5064740	5069900	I wonder if the inclement weather out there is fucking things up or something, but it's
5069900	5070700	unfortunate.
5071020	5074380	You mean the hurricane doesn't push those packets even faster?
5075460	5076620	That's not how it works?
5076620	5077300	Shush.
5077660	5079980	But yeah, unfortunately, that is happening live.
5080100	5083340	But we're still recording everything for the sake of the podcast, folks.
5083660	5086180	So, you know, we've been talking a few stories here.
5086700	5089020	So we're just going to keep recording it for nothing else to say a podcast.
5089020	5090340	I apologize to live listeners.
5090580	5094260	But again, like a lot of live things, there are just some situations that are out of my
5094260	5095420	control. And this is one of them.
5095420	5097940	It's not our Internet's working fine here in the house.
5097940	5101420	And, you know, there's no weird anomalies on our websites or anything.
5101420	5104020	And I show it just went down again and then reconnected there.
5104020	5106060	So it's that sucks.
5106780	5110900	What can you do? I may be during the Classic Game of the Week, if this is still happening,
5110900	5114940	I'll go do a quick recycle of our Internet, see if that helps.
5114940	5116340	But unfortunately, I kind of doubt it.
5116340	5118500	I really think this is on our server side right now.
5118500	5120100	So there you go.
5120580	5124540	All right. For now, though, before we get to the Classic Game of the Week, we still have
5124540	5128620	some more news. And I want to talk about Bloodstained, right?
5128620	5133820	This is the highly anticipated Kickstarter that, you know, it's not Castlevania, but
5134060	5136900	wink, wink, it's going to pretty much be Castlevania.
5137100	5140540	Well, in more of a sense than Mighty No. 9, it's not Mega Man.
5140820	5146180	But anyway, so Bloodstained was pushed back to 2018.
5146180	5150060	That was some news that came out is that they're pushing Bloodstained back to 2018, which
5150060	5151420	is anyone surprised?
5151780	5152900	Nope, didn't think so.
5153300	5158580	But what does this mean for the Wii U and the Vita ports of the game?
5158580	5163980	Because by 2018, is the Wii U really going to be a thing anymore?
5163980	5167100	I mean, if they keep pushing back this NX thing, maybe it will be.
5167100	5171420	But, you know, this brings up a very interesting question is that at the time they did
5171420	5175100	this Kickstarter, they probably figured that the Wii U and the Vita versions were very
5175100	5177540	important, but now not so much.
5177860	5180260	Right. So, yeah.
5180380	5186740	So there was some questions posed to Koji Igarashi about the Wii U port and so forth.
5187180	5189140	And he said, yes, it's a complicated problem.
5189660	5192940	As timelines move on, certain pieces of hardware become irrelevant.
5193220	5197140	However, this was a game that was backed by people and we made promises to listen to
5197140	5199540	them. They're the people that gave us life, so to speak.
5199660	5203700	Any sort of change that we do or are considering that goes outside the scope of the
5203700	5208300	promises we've made must be done with lots of explanation, care and done with lots of
5208300	5210300	back and forth with them to see what options we have.
5210540	5213980	So in other words, he's kind of saying that, you know, we kind of promised it on the Wii
5213980	5216020	U, so we have to deliver it on the Wii U.
5216220	5221060	But if we hear from our backers that this again, my interpretation is if we hear from
5221060	5224820	our backers that they would be OK with us moving that to Nintendo NX or, you know,
5224820	5226860	whatever that system ends up being, then we'll do it.
5227420	5230540	So it'll be interesting to see what develops with that.
5230660	5234580	I think a lot of people may have backed this because it was going to Wii U.
5234580	5239140	You know, there's been a lot of Nintendo fans that want to see more software on Wii U.
5239140	5242820	So I know there's a lot of people that backed Shovel Knight, that backed, you know, some
5242820	5246460	of these other games to get the Wii U ports to happen.
5246460	5251460	So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out if they choose to
5251460	5255580	cancel the Wii U release, although I would think if they promise it for NX, then it's
5255580	5261700	going to be OK. Or even better, if NX is straight up backwards compatible with Wii U's
5261700	5265940	digital library. I know, I know, it's a stretch.
5265940	5267780	However, who knows? Who knows?
5268140	5272220	But if that could be a thing that maybe, you know, it would work on both.
5272220	5273500	I hope that's a thing.
5273500	5274780	That would be awesome.
5274780	5276540	I purchased all digital on the Wii U.
5276740	5279500	Yeah, of course, I'm very much expecting.
5279500	5281740	We don't know how fucking networking works.
5281740	5284780	And so we can't tie our stores together.
5285260	5286900	We'll see. We'll see. We'll give them a chance.
5287420	5293020	No offense, and that's not even necessarily a Nintendo thing, because, you know, there's
5293020	5297260	been a lot of, no, actually, no, I think there's only a Nintendo thing now that I think
5297260	5298860	of it. Yeah, fuck them.
5299220	5302540	All right. Moving on, a few more stories here before we get to the classic game of the
5302540	5303140	week. Loki.
5303140	5311420	Speaking of fucking them, Digital Homicide, the wonderful shovelware developer who was
5311620	5317580	suing Steam users for negative reviews or comments left about their games, they have
5317580	5324340	decided to drop their suit, probably because they basically said that they are requesting
5324340	5330940	to dismiss the matter since, I guess, it's a function of financial inability, even
5330940	5333140	though they said that they believe their case was strong.
5333140	5342060	Yeah, as Alan Alchemy in chat says over at live.vognetwork.com, what a shock.
5343140	5344300	Yes, I'm so surprised.
5344940	5346100	We're going to die from that surprise.
5346460	5351340	Yeah, so good for them, I guess.
5353060	5358420	Well, let's move from talking about that studio to an awesome studio, and that is Jackbox
5358420	5360540	Games, who's been on this show a couple of times.
5360780	5362980	They were here for Jackbox Party Pack 1.
5363220	5364580	Jackbox Party Pack 2.
5364700	5366380	And guess what's coming out real soon?
5366660	5368540	Jackbox Party Pack 3.
5368540	5371580	And there is a release date that has been announced for that.
5371740	5376940	October 18th is when the Jackbox Party Pack will be out on all of the different platforms
5376940	5381580	that it's scheduled to come out on, except Xbox One, which comes out on the 21st of
5381580	5385220	October. That's probably because the whole staggered kind of Xbox One stuff happens,
5385220	5386540	usually happens on like Thursdays.
5386540	5390780	So anyway, it's just a few days late on Xbox One that probably won't matter in the big
5390780	5391620	scope of things.
5392140	5396500	Jackbox Party Pack, again, several party games that you'll be able to play with smart
5396500	5401860	phones, things that are designed for streaming as well, which is a thing that they've
5401860	5404220	embraced. And they talked about that on some of their previous interviews.
5404740	5408780	The games that will be included in the Jackbox Party Pack, Quiplash 2.
5409100	5410460	So the sequel to that game.
5410580	5412020	But that's the only sequel.
5412500	5413780	The other games are going to be all new.
5414180	5418100	Trivia Murder Party is the next game that they're doing.
5418100	5418700	That's awesome.
5418940	5422740	That's a deadly quiz show where you match wits with a trivia obsessed killer.
5422740	5423660	So that'll be fun.
5424140	5425020	I love that.
5425020	5425740	I love that.
5425980	5431300	There's also one called Gespionage, which they're saying is the data mining guessing
5431300	5433620	game. That looks like it'll be fun based on the previews.
5434180	5435860	T-K-O.
5435860	5438020	That's T-E-E-K-O.
5438020	5443380	It is a T-shirt game where you battle your custom T-shirts to the death.
5443620	5447460	So it sounds like you make custom T-shirts and then they battle each other, like probably
5447460	5450820	a voting type thing that a lot of the Jackbox Party Pack games do.
5451300	5457380	And then lastly is a game called Fakin' It, where one of your friends is hiding something
5457620	5459100	in this game for tricksters.
5459100	5461900	I'm assuming it's probably like one of those like two truths and a lie type of games.
5462300	5465340	So that will be in the Party Pack as well.
5465860	5468500	Only one controller required for navigating menus.
5468540	5471420	Otherwise, everything is played on mobile devices and tablets and so forth.
5472060	5476340	There's an audience mode for streamers, allowing 10,000 people to participate with some
5476340	5477300	of the games as well.
5477420	5478860	Yeah, I know.
5478860	5480180	I love Trivia Murder Party.
5480180	5481740	That's the best name out of all those.
5482340	5486260	So that'll be a lot of fun. So good luck to our buddies over at a Jackbox game with the
5486260	5487140	release of that.
5487140	5490980	I mean, I understand with broadcasting stuff live and stuff like that, it's too bad they
5490980	5495340	don't have like TV shows like that where you can play like 10,000 people at once, like
5495340	5496340	actually live.
5496860	5499980	Oh, you mean like one versus 100 like they used to have on Xbox 360?
5500020	5504260	Yeah, I'm talking about like, you know, like a TV show on TV.
5504260	5505180	Not necessarily.
5506780	5507100	You know.
5507940	5509300	Oh, like something.
5509300	5511140	Oh, didn't they try to do it?
5511140	5514460	Wasn't there that Seacrest hosted thing on NBC, the million dollar...
5515060	5516060	What the hell was it?
5516060	5517660	Oh, I've already lost interest.
5520540	5523660	All right, but you'll be picking up the Jackbox Party Pack, right, Loki?
5523780	5525140	I haven't picked up the other ones.
5525140	5525580	Probably not.
5525580	5525900	What?
5526100	5529020	I don't play with a lot of people, so yeah.
5529620	5531060	You'll probably play it at somebody else's house.
5531060	5533180	It's like I'll play the PlayStation VR through Shane.
5533580	5534540	Because he'll bring it over here.
5534580	5535140	So you'll play...
5535140	5536780	I'll try the VR when he brings it over.
5538300	5538660	All right.
5539300	5542860	Anyway, let's travel back to a simpler time when we weren't...
5542860	5543260	We didn't...
5543420	5545740	We couldn't play games on our mobile phones.
5545740	5548220	In fact, we probably didn't even have mobile phones at all.
5548380	5551220	Our phones were still stuck on the wall and you had to have a cord.
5551540	5554020	We're going to take a trip to memory lane with our...
5554020	5554420	What are you talking about?
5554420	5556580	I play games over my phone all the time.
5556660	5559820	Oh, is that like calling the weather or the...
5559820	5560780	No, it's a modem.
5561180	5561980	Oh, yeah.
5561980	5562380	All right.
5562740	5563260	Tricky trick.
5563260	5563580	All right.
5563820	5565220	Modems were the only way to do it.
5565220	5567540	It's the classic game of the week.
5570580	5573020	And thanks to the magic of radio.
5573020	5574540	Here she is, everybody.
5574540	5575660	Dark Sakura.
5576140	5576780	Hi.
5576900	5577660	How are you?
5578380	5579660	Full of orange chicken.
5580500	5580780	Yes.
5580780	5582420	Thank you for going to Panda Express.
5582420	5583260	I appreciate that.
5583300	5584180	That's what I do.
5584380	5584780	That's right.
5584780	5587380	So I'm going to take a moment to enjoy the fried panda.
5587580	5589580	The Dark Sakura got me from Panda Express.
5590140	5593340	And you're all going to check out this week's classic game of the week.
5593500	5594260	Yay.
5594260	5594860	Dark Sakura.
5594860	5597020	What did you pick for the kids, boys and girls?
5597140	5600700	I picked a game that I wanted to buy at gamer X.
5600980	5602620	It was 176 bucks.
5602620	5603700	176 bucks.
5603740	5605020	And I think I already have a copy.
5607260	5611780	Lords of Thunder, specifically the really awesome version that
5611780	5614380	came on the PC Engine duo.
5614780	5615580	Listen to this music.
5617140	5617860	I want to rock.
5618500	5619260	Isn't that great?
5619420	5620100	It's pretty great.
5620100	5621740	It's totally a product of its time.
5622780	5626780	Um, in Japan, it was known as Winds of Thunder and it was a shoot
5626780	5629740	them up by Hudson's Loft and Red Entertainment.
5629820	5631780	Lords is so much more metal.
5631940	5632460	Right.
5633980	5641220	At any rate, um, it came out for the Turbo Graphics, uh, duo, um, in 1993.
5641500	5644580	And it also was ported to the Sega CD in 1995.
5645180	5652260	Um, the Turbo CD version came out on virtual console, um, in February, 2008.
5652820	5657620	And the game itself is an unofficial followup to Gate of Thunder.
5658340	5662660	And as you can tell, it's got a pretty bad-ass rocking soundtrack.
5662980	5664260	It's metal as fuck.
5664540	5666220	We don't talk about Gates on this show.
5667740	5668820	Oh, Gates of Thunder.
5668820	5669380	Oh, that's fine.
5669420	5669780	That's fine.
5670620	5670980	Okay.
5670980	5671380	That's fine.
5672540	5672940	Girl.
5674620	5680940	Anyway, the game is, uh, about an evil God and his dark generals that get
5680980	5688740	woken up and fuck shit up in the world and inherit this armor from your ancestor
5688740	5694580	Drack, the legendary knight Duran, goes off to defeat the army, not want a grandpa
5694580	5695100	Drack.
5697020	5698140	It's the ancestor.
5698140	5703820	Might not be his grandfather, but anyway, you select, uh, this, uh, the stage.
5703820	5707180	You actually get the first six stages and you can select them kind of like how it
5707180	5708580	happened in Thunder Force Three.
5709140	5713420	Um, and then you pick one of four armors to use that gives you different
5713420	5714580	shots and different bombs.
5715100	5721460	Um, the game itself is great, especially the Turbo version.
5721460	5725220	The Sega CD version was kind of considered a bit of a weak sauce
5725260	5731860	translation, um, even though, uh, it was fairly close to it.
5731860	5738380	It's basically the Sega CD really needed shooters and, uh, Lords of Thunder was
5738380	5740940	a really, really good shooter to have on it.
5741420	5743540	It just was dated by the time it came out.
5743540	5745060	I think it came out like two years later.
5746860	5752220	Um, but if you've got the virtual console version, you'll have the
5752260	5756420	Turbo graphics version and it is far superior of the two.
5756740	5758060	It's just such a good game.
5758100	5761940	And really it's just standard shooter fair.
5762220	5762580	Wow.
5762580	5766900	I don't know why all of a sudden in the middle of the video, do they do that on
5766900	5770380	YouTube now, they just play ads for other stuff right in the middle of the video.
5770740	5772820	I don't know because I have ad block.
5772860	5773820	That's ridiculous.
5773820	5775260	I thought this computer had it too.
5775340	5775900	It's red.
5775980	5777700	There's a particular ad block for Google.
5777700	5778820	Well, that's embarrassing.
5779300	5779980	Or for YouTube.
5780020	5781060	Yeah, it's embarrassing.
5781060	5781780	Bring back the metal.
5782580	5782940	Thank you.
5782980	5783940	We want our butt rock.
5784940	5790100	Uh, anyway, well, since I've been completely derailed, my bad.
5790140	5792220	And there's only the two versions of this.
5792660	5796300	We'll go ahead and put the nail in the coffin for Lords of thunder.
5797020	5797580	Get it.
5797740	5798140	Yeah.
5798140	5798860	Coffin.
5805420	5805780	Okay.
5806020	5806260	All right.
5806260	5806820	There it is.
5807060	5812020	Your classic game of the week, Lords of thunder, but only on the Turbo.
5812500	5814100	Well, the Sega version's okay.
5814140	5816460	Not the Sega, not the Sega CD.
5816500	5817500	Fuck Sega CD.
5818060	5818940	Throw it in the garbage.
5819140	5820220	I have one.
5820380	5820900	Burn it.
5821300	5821860	I have two of them.
5821900	5822740	I have three of them.
5822740	5823340	Technically.
5823460	5824500	You know what would be metal?
5824620	5825220	I have a CDX.
5825220	5826260	Destroy one of them.
5827940	5829340	But they're expensive now.
5830220	5832060	I'm not so metal that I'm not frugal.
5832980	5833460	All right.
5834060	5837260	Lords of thunder is your classic game of the week.
5837300	5838660	Thank you, dark Sakura.
5838780	5839740	Have a rocking day.
5839980	5840580	You're welcome.
5840620	5841300	And I will.
5842020	5860260	So while we were out last week, some other news that they announced was that they're going to be bringing over a game to America that has been out in Japan since like 2011.
5860580	5863980	It's been out in Japan for five years and we're finally getting it.
5864340	5865700	It's not a video game though.
5865740	5867540	It's a trading card game.
5867780	5874540	The Final Fantasy trading card game will be coming out here in the States on October 28th, 2016.
5874580	5875420	So that's pretty exciting.
5875460	5878220	The first set coming out called Opus One.
5878260	5880260	It has 216 cards with it.
5880780	5887980	Apparently there's also going to be some other decks available at launch, including Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy 10 and Final Fantasy 13 starter sets.
5888340	5892260	And of course there will be booster sets because that's how trading card games work.
5893020	5904420	So all the cards feature designs by Yoshitaka Amano, Tetsuya Nomura, Akihiko Yoshida, there will be standard and premium foil versions of it.
5904580	5909260	So if you want to see how this game works, there's already some YouTubes that are going out there.
5909940	5913260	Square Enix is putting some stuff up on the YouTube about how to play the game.
5913580	5918020	And I got to admit as a Final Fantasy fan boy, this sounds like something I might want to learn how to play.
5918060	5918980	It looks pretty cool.
5919980	5925860	Do you know of any other games you can think of that would translate well to a trading card game, Loki?
5925900	5929140	Do you think there's any other series you'd like to see become a trading card game?
5933380	5935100	No, I can't really think of anything.
5935300	5936780	Surprisingly, there's not really...
5936820	5941420	I actually know it would be kind of fun or kind of cute, but I don't know how they would play.
5941460	5945340	But Enter the Gungeon, I'd like to just because the art style is pretty awesome.
5945380	5946140	I'd love to see that.
5946180	5946580	Yeah.
5946620	5946980	Yeah.
5947020	5947380	All right.
5948380	5949780	Yeah, I don't really know.
5949820	5952260	I like this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5952300	5954540	Act Def says, I use STAB on Aerith.
5956500	5958900	Maybe that'll be a move you can actually do in the trading card game.
5958940	5959340	I don't know.
5959620	5962540	I like retro stuff, so it would always be cool to see.
5962580	5964700	I want to see the Guardian Legend become a trading card game.
5964980	5965580	All right, that might...
5965620	5966980	That may not work so well.
5967020	5967700	How does that work?
5968220	5968940	I don't know.
5968980	5970100	How does the game work?
5970580	5972660	Two phases, shoot and explore.
5973500	5975900	Doesn't necessarily have to be a complex card game.
5976300	5977980	No Man's Sky, the collectible card game.
5978020	5979020	Oh, there you go.
5979940	5982980	You're on a planet and there's stuff there.
5984540	5985180	You leave the planet.
5985220	5986540	And some of the cards are just blank.
5988140	5990100	This planet looks exactly like the other planet.
5990420	5994620	Or there was a card here that we've removed from the deck.
5995140	5997940	Every week that you play, you have to remove two cards from your deck
5997980	5999740	permanently because some features got eliminated.
6001820	6002380	I like that.
6002420	6005700	You've now achieved the worst score possible on Steam.
6006420	6008820	All right, I'm just kidding.
6008860	6010940	Dungeon Buster is quoting me there saying,
6010980	6013380	wow, I'm just throwing a little unnecessary shade.
6013420	6013620	Come on.
6013660	6016620	Actually, the concept of No Man's Sky and exploring play...
6016660	6018460	Actually, that would, I mean, all seriousness,
6018500	6020500	actually kind of make a cool trading card game, I think.
6020900	6022340	You know, I'm sure, please.
6022380	6025380	I'm sure there's got to be other space exploration card games
6025420	6026860	that are out there and plenty.
6027180	6030220	I'm just not as well versed in the tabletop side of things,
6030260	6032020	but I'm sure I've seen something like that before.
6032060	6034140	So, you know, but something that, you know,
6034700	6036700	kind of branded with that No Man's Sky stuff.
6036740	6038340	Or how about we do Day of the Tentacle?
6038380	6040940	You can have the three different timelines
6040980	6043820	and then you do stuff and it affects the other timelines.
6044300	6045740	Well, anyway, regardless,
6045780	6047620	I'm looking forward to the Final Fantasy trading card game.
6047660	6049980	I don't usually get super into trading card games.
6050740	6053060	You know, I used to play Magic back in the day,
6053100	6054980	but not so much anymore.
6055020	6057860	But Final Fantasy, you know, I got a weak spot for that series.
6057900	6059060	So I'll check that out.
6059620	6061660	Anyhow, let's do some rapid fire news
6061700	6063980	and quickly touch on a few other things that happened through the week.
6064860	6066740	OK, so I remember correctly,
6066780	6069380	I think, wasn't TwitchCon going on at the same time as GamerX
6069420	6070060	or something like that?
6070100	6073380	TwitchCon was the exact same weekend as GamerX in a different city.
6073420	6075260	It was in SoCal in San Diego this year.
6075300	6077420	Right, so one of the things that was announced
6077460	6082180	shortly around there was that Twitch Prime is going to be a new thing.
6082220	6086860	It's a premium experience that is included with Amazon Prime.
6087500	6091500	And so with that, you get a free game or a free game loot every month.
6092460	6095500	So, cool, I guess.
6096180	6098380	I mean, since you are paying for Amazon Prime,
6098420	6101180	it's nice to get more and more things with it.
6102740	6105460	Along with, it looks like with Twitch Prime,
6106980	6109700	you can also, let's see here,
6111140	6112740	get ad-free viewing.
6113340	6114900	So that's kind of nice.
6116340	6119740	And exclusive emotes and chat badge.
6120500	6123300	And one free channel subscription every 30 days.
6123340	6128220	That alone is going to be huge for the economy on Twitch,
6128260	6132860	because there's a lot of streamers that make a secondary income off,
6132900	6135020	or even maybe primary income for some people,
6135060	6136580	off those subscriptions.
6136620	6141500	So the fact that many people like myself already have Amazon Prime.
6141540	6144900	So for me, this is really a something for nothing for me,
6144940	6146620	even though, yes, I know it's not nothing
6146660	6149460	because I'm paying yearly for Amazon Prime.
6149500	6152260	And this is going to be an excuse for them to jack up the price again.
6152300	6155940	However, I enjoy Amazon Prime enough
6155980	6159340	that I would have renewed it with or without this.
6159380	6162660	So the fact that this is going to be a part of it too is cool.
6162700	6166660	And so this will allow me to throw free money every month at a streamer.
6166700	6170940	And maybe someday if I stop doing so many podcasts in a week
6170980	6174300	and do more streaming, it's something that could be benefit me too,
6174340	6176860	is that some folks could subscribe to my stream
6176900	6178460	and kick money back that way.
6178460	6179940	So that's huge.
6181460	6184460	Yeah, so I was really happy to hear this news.
6184500	6187060	I think a lot of us were waiting to hear,
6187100	6189660	you know, what's going to come of this Amazon marriage.
6189700	6191100	Is there going to be a Twitch Prime?
6191140	6193500	People were asking that the very first day this was announced.
6193540	6194780	So that's pretty cool.
6195500	6199180	So Oculus, during their Oculus Connect keynote,
6199220	6203260	they had revealed that the Oculus Touch controllers
6203300	6205180	are going to be coming out this year.
6205260	6208780	Looks like December 6th, and they're going to cost $199.
6209820	6211700	Along with that, they're include two games,
6211740	6214580	including VR Sports Challenge and The Unspoken.
6216540	6218620	You know, and I remember that like Oculus,
6218660	6221620	one of the things that they were touting is that they were cheaper than the Vive,
6221660	6223900	but not anymore.
6223940	6225300	Not with this.
6225340	6229580	I mean, you kind of need this for the experience, and that's expensive.
6231020	6232740	I mean, I guess that is an advantage
6232740	6235540	that PlayStation VR has, too bad their controllers are shit.
6235580	6236580	So they need to come up.
6236620	6239460	No, seriously, all they need to do is fix the camera issues
6239500	6240940	where it can't track you very well.
6240980	6242740	That can be done with a firmware update,
6242780	6246100	and come up with a new controller, new motion controller,
6246140	6247340	and then I'll be on board.
6248780	6251980	All right, well, moving on to free games.
6252020	6254580	Maybe you don't want to pay that type of money for your gaming rig,
6254620	6256020	but if you want something free,
6256060	6259180	you can get Beyond Good and Evil free on the PC,
6259220	6262140	but you do have to have a Uplay account.
6262180	6263780	But I think most people have that anyway,
6263820	6265980	because they probably got convinced to sign up for one
6266020	6267740	through one of the other Ubisoft games.
6267780	6270980	But you will be able to get Beyond Good and Evil free on PC.
6271020	6274460	That is free from October 12th, so that's going to be this week.
6274500	6277740	Yeah, so they're one game free a month thing that they've been doing.
6277780	6279860	Yeah, so that's pretty cool.
6279900	6281140	So some other games that were released,
6281180	6285500	Prince of Persia, Sands of Time, Splinter Cell, Rayman Origins, The Crew,
6285540	6287700	Beyond Good and Evil is this upcoming month.
6287740	6291100	And some people, this is like one of their favorite games ever made,
6291100	6293020	and there's always those rumors about a sequel.
6293060	6296380	So I think some folks will be excited to check that out,
6296420	6299420	and maybe some folks that missed that the first time around.
6299460	6302980	Also, Street Fighter V is chugging along.
6303020	6304740	Now the people have calmed down a little bit.
6304780	6306580	Now they have story mode in the game.
6306620	6308860	But some other extras are going to be coming to Street Fighter V,
6308900	6313380	including Halloween costumes and stage updates
6313420	6315860	to go for the month of October.
6315900	6318220	The costumes will be available for $4.
6318260	6319780	That will be 10 different colors there,
6319780	6322980	and the special Halloween stage can be purchased for $2
6323020	6327380	or 40,000 fight money, which I'm assuming is the in-game currency.
6327420	6330020	I haven't played a lot of Street Fighter V, admittedly.
6330060	6333140	So they were able to do that at New York Comic-Con,
6333180	6334340	which I think happened this past weekend.
6334380	6336100	They were able to try that out.
6336140	6338540	And then the exclusive content is going to be available
6338580	6342380	from October 11th this week through November 29th.
6342420	6343700	And then that's it.
6343740	6345380	It is limited time stuff.
6345420	6349220	So if you are wanting to get your Halloween on, check that out.
6349220	6354180	That is a Ghostly Ryu, a Franken-Nash, and a Wolfman Nakali
6354220	6358140	are the different costumes that you can check out.
6358180	6360420	Supposedly, though, Street Fighter V not the only game
6360460	6361940	that's getting Halloween costumes.
6361980	6366300	Overwatch also going to be getting some spooky loot boxes.
6366340	6369620	I'm assuming this is going to be very similar to their...
6369660	6372340	They didn't call it the Olympic event, but it was the Olympic event,
6372380	6375380	the Summer Games event or whatever they're doing.
6375420	6377980	This was leaked from the Xbox store.
6377980	6380980	There's a screen that got snapped that's floating around the internet
6381020	6384300	that shows that you can purchase Halloween loot boxes.
6384340	6388780	So, yeah, probably something that is going to come out
6388820	6391420	with some new Halloween skins for the characters
6391460	6394820	and probably some poses and things like that as well.
6394860	6399820	Also, something that has been noted is that the box art
6399860	6403140	contains the skull logo, a purple skull logo,
6403180	6405700	that is often associated with Sombra,
6405860	6408380	who's supposed to be the next rumored hero in the game.
6408420	6411700	It was actually rumored to be the first hero announced for the game,
6411740	6414100	even though they did Anna instead.
6414140	6416820	And Blizzard has also been said somewhere else
6416860	6420220	that the next character for Overwatch is coming sooner rather than later.
6420260	6422820	So it could all be lining up,
6422860	6426020	or it could just be a typical Blizzard misnomer.
6426060	6428100	But who knows? That could be coming very soon.
6428140	6431540	It should be noted, though, that BlizzCon is not too far away.
6431580	6433940	I think it's the first weekend in November.
6433980	6436340	So I don't think they would hold off the Halloween stuff
6436380	6438300	till early November. That doesn't make sense.
6438340	6440700	But wouldn't it be great if they would come out at BlizzCon
6440740	6443860	and say, there's a new character in Overwatch today?
6443900	6446460	That might be a big thing. So who knows?
6446500	6449420	We'll see. Halloween events in different games.
6449460	6450460	Enjoy them.
6451220	6452820	Meanwhile, let's take a look at the new things
6452860	6454860	that will be arriving in stores this week.
6454900	6456700	Loki, what about in the US? What's in stores this week?
6456740	6458500	There's a lot of things coming out of this week.
6458540	6461220	So let's start off with 100-foot robot golf.
6461260	6463700	That's coming out in PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.
6463700	6465580	Oh, God, it's all the PlayStation VR games.
6465620	6467340	Oh, here we go. Get a book.
6467380	6470060	Criminal Girls 2 Party Favors on Vita.
6470100	6473500	Dragon Quest Builders on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
6473540	6475620	That was that kind of Minecraft-type game.

6478980	6481860	on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

6485260	6491260	Gears of War 4 on Windows 10 and Xbox One.
6491740	6496300	Looks like Roost on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6496340	6498900	Rise of the Tomb Raider 20-year Celebration
6498940	6501260	on PlayStation 4.
6501300	6503260	I guess that's the PS4 version of it,
6503300	6505340	because didn't we not get that?
6505380	6506940	Wasn't that...
6506980	6509060	Because Rise of the Tomb Raider never came out on PlayStation 4.
6509100	6511140	Yeah, it's going to be, though, now with the...
6511180	6512220	Yeah, this week.
6512260	6514820	And then Valkyrie Drive Bikuni.
6514860	6517100	That's on PlayStation Vita.
6517100	6522980	WWE 2K17 on PS3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6523020	6525940	Goner on PC, Mac, and Linux.
6525980	6531460	Manus Burn Racing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6531500	6533180	And then your VR games.
6533220	6536060	Ace Banana, Batman Arkham VR,
6536100	6538340	Battlezone VR, Drive Club VR,
6538380	6540220	Eve Gunjack, Eve Valkyrie,
6540260	6543500	Harmonix Music VR, Here They Lie,
6543540	6545660	Hustle King's VR, Job Simulator,
6545660	6548180	Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,
6548220	6550700	Loading Human, PlayStation VR Worlds,
6550740	6554580	Rigs Mechanicized, Combat League.
6554620	6558500	And then, of course, Sports Bar VR,
6558540	6561820	Super Hypercube, Super Stardust Ultra VR,
6561860	6565020	The Assembly, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood,
6565060	6568140	Wayward Sky, and World War Tunes.
6568180	6569940	Those are all PlayStation VR.
6569980	6572060	On PlayStation VR and PlayStation 4,
6572100	6574500	we have Resident Infinite, Roller Coaster Dreams,
6574500	6577260	and it looks like Thumper.
6577300	6579340	That's also on PC as well.
6579380	6582060	And then Shadow Warrior 2 on PC.
6584900	6587540	Dun Dun Patchy Resurrection on PC.
6587580	6590980	Disney Magical World 2 on 3DS.
6591020	6593900	Farah Bell on PC, Mac, and Linux.
6593940	6598020	Also, Manuel Samuel is going to be coming out on Xbox One.
6598060	6602660	And then yet another toys game
6602660	6604620	that's going to be coming out one week from today,
6604660	6608140	and that's Skylanders Imaginators.
6608180	6610460	That's on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,
6610500	6615780	Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.
6615820	6617140	Busy.
6617180	6619860	Yeah, it is very, very busy.
6619900	6621140	Did you get through it all? Is that it?
6621180	6621860	That is it.
6621900	6623300	All right, let's go over to Japan.
6623340	6627060	And Japan is also getting the PlayStation VR this week,
6627100	6629100	so it's causing a few things to come out with that.
6629140	6631700	Although my list is not as extensive as the one Loki has,
6631780	6633620	but I know there's a lot of digital releases,
6633660	6636140	and my list doesn't capture all the digital stuff.
6636180	6637940	But what we do have coming out in Japan this week,
6637980	6639460	of course, PlayStation VR.
6639500	6641860	Also, there are some games as well on PlayStation 4.
6641900	6644340	Rigs Machine Combat League is out.
6644380	6646620	We also have PlayStation VR Worlds.
6646660	6649460	Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens randomly in there,
6649500	6652260	even though, of course, that's not necessarily a VR game.
6652300	6654780	Rise of the Tomb Raider is also out in Japan this week,
6654820	6657300	and that's kind of the highlights from the list that I have here,
6657340	6660380	but those are all things that you can expect in a physical form.
6660460	6663380	Again, this list is not going to capture anything that is digital.
6664140	6666940	In Japan, Paper Mario Color Splash is out this week,
6666980	6669700	as well as Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens.
6669740	6671820	So we got the color splash here in the US,
6671860	6674340	looks like a little early, compared to Japan.
6674380	6675900	So that is out this week in Japan.
6675940	6677860	On the PlayStation Vita,
6677900	6680140	the Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens is out there as well.
6680180	6682740	A game called Plastic Memories in regular and limited edition,
6682780	6687100	and Kangoku-to Mary Skelter in regular and limited edition.
6687140	6689980	And lastly, on the 3DS this week,
6690020	6692260	Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens.
6692300	6695380	Otherwise, a slow week on the 3DS, a very, very busy week.
6695420	6698780	Next week, however, was some new amiibo coming out
6698820	6700500	and a Mario Party game.
6700540	6703220	So Mario Party Star Rush, specifically.
6703260	6706180	So that is the Japanese in stores.
6706220	6707220	How about UK?
6707260	6710700	So there's Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary World Tour
6710740	6713020	on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
6713060	6716420	Gears of War 4 on Xbox One and Windows 10.
6716460	6719300	And then here they lie on PlayStation 4,
6719340	6721340	even though this is a mobile game,
6721380	6724180	I just thought that the name that they have listed on here is hilarious.
6724220	6725820	Really Bad Chess.
6725860	6728860	That's on iPad and iPhone.
6728900	6731700	A Resident on PlayStation 4.
6731740	6738180	Let's Sing 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Wii.
6738220	6739900	That's kind of surprising.
6739940	6743500	And finally, Emergency 2016.
6744900	6746460	All right.
6746500	6748820	Busy week releases all across the globe,
6748820	6751780	but especially with the PlayStation VR, certainly.
6751820	6753140	Let's get to the mailbag.
6753180	6755180	["The Orange Lounge Radio"]
6759900	6761660	Every week, you guys send us emails.
6761700	6763860	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
6763900	6767140	is the place to send us an email if you are so inclined.
6767180	6769420	And we read emails on this show.
6769460	6772340	Usually after a break, we come back to an empty mailbox
6772380	6773300	because people go...
6773340	6775300	They don't email us because they know there's no show that week,
6775340	6778380	and then they don't email us because there was no show during the week.
6778380	6781860	But we did get one email this week, so we will read that email now.
6781900	6784140	And it's from our pal, Ragenator, who says,
6784180	6787100	Hi, guys, it's Ragenator yet again with a last-second email.
6787140	6788180	What time did he send this?
6788220	6791220	Oh, my God, he sent this during the show at 6.30.
6791260	6792620	Well, lucky you.
6792660	6795620	All right, anyway, I can't think of a timely subject for this email,
6795660	6797740	so instead, I will pose this question.
6797780	6800940	Suppose that for whatever reason, you're filthy, filthy, filthy rich
6800980	6803820	to the point where even Bill Gates would say, damn.
6803860	6806460	Now, with that being said, if you could create your idea,
6806460	6809140	a geeked-themed man cave...
6809180	6810980	Why has it got to be a man cave?
6811020	6811900	I get what you're saying.
6811940	6815100	Where space and money are no object, what would you do?
6815140	6816940	For me, I'd do the following.
6816980	6819620	The man cave would be in the basement, and to get down to the man cave,
6819660	6822580	you would go down a slide and land in a ball pit.
6822620	6825300	One area would have a custom-made, one-of-a-kind,
6825340	6828060	thousand-inch 32K 3D TV...
6828100	6829380	Dude, those don't exist.
6829420	6830820	With a 7.1 sound system...
6830860	6832260	That's why it's custom.
6832300	6834300	And every console hooked up to it,
6834380	6838540	plus a top-of-the-line PC that would even make NASA's computers jealous.
6838580	6842020	I'd also have one of those speaker systems that look like retro jukeboxes
6842060	6845180	with built-in lights set up to play all my music.
6845220	6847980	In another area, I'd have two of every arcade game
6848020	6850260	and pinball table ever made set up.
6850300	6852140	How big is your basement, dude?
6852180	6854940	Plus stuff like skeeball and other arcade favorites.
6854980	6858460	In a third area, I'd have an actual in-home pizzeria.
6858500	6861860	Throughout the basement, I'd have tons of gaming posters,
6861940	6864220	80s and 90s pop culture posters,
6864260	6868500	for example, Beavis and Butthead, Nick cartoon posters, etc., on the walls.
6868540	6870900	Plus, I'd have enough decorative lighting around
6870940	6873220	to make Spencer's gifts jealous.
6873260	6876180	That email there from our pal, Raginator.
6876220	6878940	So, what would you do with a limitless budget?
6878980	6881540	What would be in your man cave?
6881580	6884620	Or will man cave, Loki?
6884660	6886860	I don't know. I mean, it's just...
6886900	6888940	What's the point of having a man cave at that point?
6888940	6892900	Just buy, like, make your own family fun center
6892940	6895420	or something like that, or just a theme park.
6895460	6896380	I mean, like, I guess...
6896420	6897740	I'm gonna answer this for Loki.
6897780	6900780	Loki's dream man cave would have a passcode
6900820	6902900	that his wife and kids don't know.
6902940	6906220	No, that's not true at all.
6906260	6907260	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6907300	6908140	I wouldn't need to lock my wife out.
6908180	6910180	She just wouldn't want to come down there.
6910220	6911220	That's fine.
6911260	6913180	And, you know, she can have whatever she wants.
6913220	6914220	That's fine.
6914260	6915820	My kids is just...
6915860	6918140	Yeah, it wouldn't matter.
6918180	6920700	I always drive by, like, on my way to work and stuff.
6920740	6923260	I see these, like, somewhat, not high-rise buildings,
6923300	6925900	but, like, you know, just several stories, tall buildings.
6925940	6930260	I'm like, wouldn't it be fun just to fill that full of, like, game stuff?
6930300	6931180	So, something like that.
6931220	6933540	I'd just buy a building and fill it full of game stuff.
6933580	6936580	Or open up, or, hey, if I want to make some of that money back,
6936620	6939500	even though I have a limitless amount of money,
6939540	6942740	it would be nice to open up a really kick-ass, like,
6942780	6945740	arcade fun center thing with, like, ridiculous shit
6945780	6947060	that you only see in, like, Japan.
6947060	6950900	You know, like, those indoor ski slopes and fucking, you know,
6950940	6954020	beach and all sorts of crazy stuff.
6954060	6956420	But mainly arcade games.
6956460	6960180	Yeah, I feel like if I had that type of budget, I would want...
6960220	6963900	I'd make the most kick-ass laser tag game on the face of the goddamn earth.
6963940	6966340	There you go. You're gonna bring back Qsar.
6966380	6967380	I would buy that shit.
6967420	6970620	You're gonna combine every old Qsar that went into...
6970660	6973060	out of business into one super Qsar that you're gonna run.
6973100	6974220	It would be a super Qsar.
6974260	6975260	I love that.
6975260	6977060	Committed reality super Qsar.
6977100	6979100	Ah, there you go. Now that's a low-key idea.
6979140	6980140	I like that.
6980180	6981180	That is a low-key idea.
6981220	6984140	Let's see, for me, yeah, I'm kind of in that whole part of...
6984180	6986820	I don't know if I would want that all in my house,
6986860	6987900	because that would be...
6987940	6990140	I mean, admittedly, to have all that stuff in your house
6990180	6992260	would kind of be a little lonely.
6992300	6993900	You know, I mean, not to sound like all depressing,
6993940	6997300	but it's like, you know, okay, so I could enjoy all this,
6997340	6999740	but it would be really boring to not be able to enjoy it with other people.
6999780	7002900	I mean, obviously, Alan lives here. He'd be able to enjoy it too.
7002900	7005540	And obviously, I would have friends over now and then,
7005580	7008580	but maybe this is like the super cheesy side of me or something.
7008620	7009620	But I would want...
7009660	7011940	Like, if I had that time of space and set up and so forth
7011980	7015060	to set up this arcade that's like fun all the time,
7015100	7018500	I would want kids who can't have fun all the time
7018540	7020020	to be able to experience that as well.
7020060	7023860	So I would want a space where responsible,
7023900	7027180	well-behaved and parented children...
7027220	7030380	When I say parented, I mean, you know, disciplined,
7030420	7031940	you know, that type of thing.
7031980	7036420	Kids that have good fucking manners could come and play machines
7036460	7038580	and aren't going to wreck them and be ridiculous.
7038620	7041660	Even if they wreck them, you can have a fleet of people to repair shit.
7041700	7042700	It wouldn't fucking matter.
7042740	7046500	I want a place where kids are not going to bully other kids.
7046540	7047940	That's why I don't want those kids there.
7047980	7049180	I'm not so worried about the machine.
7049220	7052540	Somebody's going to spill a soda on a machine and it's going to suck,
7052580	7054980	but I don't want those kids that are going to bully the other kids.
7055020	7060180	I want it to be a place where people can have fun and that type of thing.
7060220	7061380	Is that cheesy?
7061420	7063460	But I swear to God, it's my honest thing.
7063500	7068860	It's like I would be so bored if I had all that in my house alone.
7068900	7071140	It's like, you know, you hear about the crazy rich people
7071180	7072580	that live in a castle up in the...
7072620	7074740	Like Enya, right?
7074780	7080180	Enya lives in a fucking castle in the middle of God knows where
7080220	7083340	and then the United Kingdom somewhere, if even that.
7083380	7086380	She lives in a castle with, what, cats?
7086420	7089460	And her giant quill pen that I'm sure she uses to write her songs.
7089460	7091300	Like, you know, she's...
7091340	7093980	Wouldn't it be a little boring eventually?
7094020	7094820	I don't know.
7094860	7096540	So is that a cat-soul?
7098980	7102020	Maybe I just opened a cat cafe.
7102060	7102740	Cat cafe.
7102780	7105140	That would be enough for me.
7105180	7106900	All right, so anyway, there you go.
7106940	7111700	Sorry if that's cheesy, but those are the answers to the questions that we got.
7111740	7114580	So if you want to send us cheesy questions, you sure can.
7114620	7117420	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
7117460	7120140	is the place where you can send your emails.
7120180	7121660	So we got a few more stories for you guys
7121700	7125260	before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
7125300	7126740	But first, Loki.
7126780	7131220	All right, so, you know, you may remember a few years ago,
7131260	7133100	there was...
7133140	7137060	Was it Lizard Squad was like a little hacking click or whatever
7137100	7139140	that would just do your ass shit.
7139180	7141260	And they would not be allowed in my arcade.
7141300	7143860	Yeah, they were responsible for, I guess,
7143860	7146340	or they claimed responsibility for DDoS attacks
7146380	7150740	against Xbox Live and PlayStation Network in 2014.
7150780	7153460	Well, apparently, they have been convicted
7153500	7157140	for over 50,000 counts of cybercrime,
7157180	7160260	including harassment, fraud, and data breaches.
7160300	7164980	So apparently, they were two 19-year-olds.
7165020	7167220	And yeah, they were charged,
7167260	7172500	and I guess the charges carry a 10-year maximum sentence in prison.
7174860	7177740	Well, bye.
7177780	7179540	Somebody's got to get punished for this.
7179580	7181780	You can't... These are crimes that you're committing,
7181820	7183660	and you don't get to just get away with them scot-free.
7183700	7187540	So have fun in the slamma.
7187580	7192340	Yeah, so apparently, they were both under Lizard Squad and Poodle Corp.
7192380	7197380	And I guess they even had hacked Taylor Swift's Twitter account.
7197420	7200740	And what else?
7200940	7204780	They had conspired with other members of Lizard Squad
7204820	7207460	to run cyber attacks for higher websites,
7207500	7211500	trafficking stolen payment card accounts.
7211540	7216980	Well, it's probably they're being made an example of a little bit,
7217020	7219860	but that's what has to happen to deter other people from doing it,
7219900	7222980	because it shows that, yes, they will do something about it.
7223020	7228500	So I hope they can catch a few more of these folks that do this shit,
7228540	7230420	and show that you can't get away with it.
7230460	7232380	Anyhow, shifting gears here a little bit,
7232420	7236900	let's talk about something that Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox,
7236940	7238940	was talking about bad reviews this week.
7238980	7242420	And he kind of dropped a truth bomb on some people.
7242460	7244980	And this was in an interview that he was doing this week,
7245020	7247900	where he was discussing about the ReCore,
7247940	7249700	because ReCore was a game that came out recently.
7249740	7253460	And now ReCore has an average score of 63% on Metacritic.
7253500	7255900	And here's a quote from his interview.
7255940	7259940	I think there are certain reviews that are written more to get clicked on
7259980	7263820	than they are to actually accurately reflect the quality of the game,
7263860	7266220	and that kind of bums me out.
7266260	7269140	On the reviews, honestly, I thought some of the reviews were a little harsh
7269180	7271300	in their terms of the view of the game.
7271340	7274300	I didn't try to tell anybody that it was a 10, speaking about ReCore.
7274340	7277140	I think we knew, as with any games, that there are certain things,
7277180	7279500	if we started from the beginning and we knew what do we get,
7279540	7282060	there's a couple things we would have done slightly differently.
7282100	7285140	But then he goes on to talk about Forza Horizon 3,
7285180	7287740	where, you know, he was talking about Forza Horizon 3
7287740	7290020	and the scores that that's getting, saying,
7290060	7292020	we're very proud of how the game ended up,
7292060	7295420	and I think 7, 8, 9, like anywhere in there, is fine.
7295460	7299660	3 or 4, I mean, somebody gave Forza Horizon 3 a 4,
7299700	7301900	and that's when he said, I think there are certain reviews
7301940	7303500	that are written more to get clicked on
7303540	7306460	than they are to actually accurately reflect the quality of the game,
7306500	7307860	and that kind of bums me out.
7307900	7311820	And I thought that was a pretty darn good truth bomb
7311860	7314100	he kind of dropped on people, is that, you know,
7314140	7316980	there's people that write some click-baity shit out there,
7317060	7321100	and we've certainly accused certain journalistic websites out there
7321140	7324860	of this in the past, and I'm sure that this is still going on, right, Logie?
7324900	7327740	Yeah, absolutely. I think there's a lot of these sites
7327780	7330780	that are a little harsh or whatever, especially if you read the reviews
7330820	7333180	and the reasons that they give for it, sometimes they're a little,
7333220	7337860	like, political, you know, it's just, it's silly stuff.
7337900	7341100	But to be a fair counterpoint, I mean, you know,
7341140	7344060	if a group of 100 people play a game,
7344100	7346420	there's gonna be somebody that doesn't like it,
7346420	7348180	for whatever weird reason, right?
7348220	7352660	I mean, like, even Rotten Tomato movie reviews and stuff, you know?
7352700	7354980	I mean, there's gonna be people that love it,
7355020	7358660	but there's always gonna be that one in a crowd who doesn't like it.
7358700	7360860	Like, I'm sure this has happened to all of you.
7360900	7363860	Haven't you seen a movie that you hated,
7363900	7366140	that everybody else, like, lost their shit over,
7366180	7368180	and you're like, why is this movie that good?
7368220	7371460	That's why you just find reviewers, like, that you kind of align with
7371500	7374740	as far as what their tastes are versus what your tastes are,
7374820	7379060	and then kind of go off of that, or go off of, you know,
7379100	7382100	just even, like, some of these playthroughs and stuff
7382140	7383820	when they do previews and stuff, and just judge it
7383860	7385540	based off of what you're seeing on there, and...
7385580	7388260	Are you saying you have to review reviewers?
7388300	7390180	Not necessarily.
7390220	7393460	Just don't, like, if, I mean, obviously, if you're reading the reviews,
7393500	7398260	don't just go by the score, find out what made them come to that conclusion.
7398300	7400580	And if their reasoning is kind of ridiculous,
7400620	7403540	then you can, you know, make that judgment based on that,
7403540	7407260	because some people don't like certain types of games,
7407300	7410660	and for whatever reason, those people, they have them review those games,
7410700	7413460	and I don't know.
7413500	7415820	I can only assume that because that would have been
7415860	7417860	such a dumb decision in the first place,
7417900	7420660	you know, to have somebody that hates a genre review that genre,
7420700	7422860	that they're really doing it just to clickbait,
7422900	7426700	but, or they're just that dumb, editorially.
7426740	7428940	Going to Tigerclaw in our chat room, saying,
7428980	7431620	you can't take Rotten Tomatoes seriously, though.
7431660	7434260	Even if movies get bad reviews, and you end up loving it,
7434300	7437340	it's just a critic's opinion, but your own opinion matters more.
7437380	7438900	You know, and I think he's bringing up a point,
7438940	7442100	and this happens a lot with movies, is that there's movies that critics hate,
7442140	7443700	and it's usually comedies, right?
7443740	7446020	The critics usually hate them, but, like, you know,
7446060	7450980	the Joe average movie viewer might like it a lot more,
7451020	7453700	and especially, like, genre movies, too, right?
7453740	7456500	Right, and, well, and I think also, a lot of these reviews,
7456540	7458500	especially when it comes to games, it's not necessarily,
7458540	7461380	you kind of have a preconceived notion of whether you're gonna like a game or not.
7461380	7464540	It's more of, like, is it functional?
7464580	7466460	You know, if the game is glitchy as shit,
7466500	7471300	or if it runs poorly, or it's just, you know, controls terribly,
7471340	7476100	I mean, that's gonna play into it a lot, versus, you know,
7476140	7479340	oh, this game, I didn't like the graphics in it, or something like that.
7479380	7482340	You know, well, you'll know based off of watching, you know, the trailers,
7482380	7484900	and the, I mean, I don't know, you're gonna have an idea
7484940	7487540	of whether you like it or not, and, you know,
7487540	7490780	also maybe wait and see how it is,
7490820	7493900	or if you don't want to purchase something, rent it,
7493940	7494900	and try it that way.
7494940	7498380	Oh, my God, the way, we've always fucking done it back in the days
7498420	7500660	when there's actually rental places.
7500700	7503780	I mean, there's Redbox now in the US,
7503820	7506820	but I'm sure there's some place you can rent something,
7506860	7511740	maybe even Gamefly, to try a game out before you want to buy it.
7511780	7513060	ActDeft in chat says,
7513100	7515820	you don't judge something solely based on reviews.
7515820	7517580	Yeah, and that's, I think that's really important.
7517620	7520180	Kind of the gamers have to take some onus for this, too,
7520220	7523340	is that you can't do 100% of your judgment on reviews,
7523380	7526300	but this is where live streaming, I think, has really stepped in a lot,
7526340	7529740	is that I think there is a lot of people to kind of watch other people play games,
7529780	7531300	and make a decision based off that.
7531340	7533780	It's just an extension of what we probably did as kids,
7533820	7535260	where you would want to buy a video game
7535300	7536460	because you went over to your friend's house,
7536500	7539340	and you played it over there, and you won it at your house.
7539380	7542540	Akayjudo in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7542540	7545660	Movies, music, games, books are all subjective.
7545700	7547900	I never listen to critics or gamers.
7547940	7550100	I know what I like and what I don't.
7550140	7554700	So, good feedback on this topic there.
7554740	7557180	But, you know, I just thought that was very interesting
7557220	7559300	that, you know, the head of Xbox went so far
7559340	7561900	as to kind of call out clickbait in that regard.
7561940	7563180	Thought that was very interesting.
7563220	7564340	Anyway, a few more stories for you.
7564380	7565460	Loki.
7565500	7566780	All right, so this is kind of interesting.
7566820	7568100	I'm not sure what's gonna come of this,
7568140	7572100	but I do like the developers, so...
7572260	7577260	PewDiePie and also the developer,
7577540	7580020	or one of the designers of Goat Simulator,
7580060	7583420	Armin, I'm gonna try to pronounce his last name here,
7583460	7586140	Ibris, I butchered that.
7586180	7589340	Anyways, Armin, we'll just go by his first name,
7589380	7592780	one of the designers there, and I follow him on Twitter.
7592820	7596740	So they're actually collaborating to develop some games.
7596780	7598020	So the first game they're gonna release
7598020	7602340	is a mobile game called the PewDiePie Tuber Simulator,
7602380	7606140	where you actually play as a YouTuber.
7606180	7607620	And I know they have similar games like this
7607660	7610700	on Steam already, so I'm kinda curious to see what it is.
7610740	7614100	But basically, you know, they're saying that,
7614140	7616980	you know, as far as a partnership,
7617020	7618860	there's comedy's huge entertainment,
7618900	7621780	but it still fills in its infancy in the game industry.
7621820	7624300	Felix and I would like to work on changing that.
7624340	7625860	So they're looking to make funny games,
7625860	7629740	and Goat Simulator's pretty funny.
7629780	7632500	Yeah, I'd be curious to see what happens.
7632540	7635060	Yeah, it's a weird partnership, but I'm with you.
7635100	7637140	It's like, well, the developers of Goat Simulator are really,
7637180	7639980	you know, that was a hilarious game, so, you know.
7640020	7644500	Yeah, it's silly. I mean, I don't know.
7644540	7646100	Can't be that bad.
7646140	7649140	How bad can it be? Famous last words.
7649180	7652380	All right, anyway, last tonight before we open up the Skyplines
7652420	7655420	at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, some more Twitch news.
7655420	7657660	This actually, I think this came out after TwitchCon.
7657700	7660540	I don't think this was something they actually unveiled at TwitchCon,
7660580	7664940	but this is, you know, we've seen this develop before.
7664980	7667100	You remember that whole bit system that they had
7667140	7670940	where you could actually tip live streamers in bits,
7670980	7673620	which would turn into real-world money, basically?
7673660	7676140	I think it was like, I don't know, it was 10 cents or 1 cent per bit
7676180	7677180	or something like that.
7677220	7680100	Well, it was announced this week that you will be able to,
7680140	7683260	if you don't wanna actually spend money on Twitch,
7683260	7688420	even though now with Twitch Prime, Twitch can be ad-free for you,
7688460	7694460	if you want, you can watch ads on Twitch to earn bits.
7694500	7696540	Kind of similar to, like, mobile games, right?
7696580	7697580	Yeah, mobile games do that a lot.
7697620	7699940	Yeah, you watch an ad and you earn some of the in-game currency.
7699980	7700980	And I'm fine with that.
7701020	7703700	Yeah, that's kind of interesting. It's not mandatory, I suppose, right?
7703740	7706220	So if you sit through a 30-second interactive ad,
7706260	7709380	you can earn some bits, and they're slowly rolling this out.
7709420	7712740	You can still choose to purchase 100 bits for $1.40.
7712780	7715980	So I think it must be 1 cent for each bit that you do there.
7716020	7718980	But now you can earn the bits by watching a sponsored video
7719020	7720780	or perhaps doing a survey.
7720820	7724500	They say that this will typically reward users with 5 bits,
7724540	7726420	but some offers will be worth up to 100.
7726460	7729300	I imagine the more interactive ones that are surveys and stuff
7729340	7731260	will probably reward you more.
7731300	7733780	Or sign up for such-and-such website and all this.
7733820	7735180	It'd be very interesting to see.
7735220	7737300	I hate any of those apps.
7737340	7739580	It's not mandatory, so it's interesting.
7739580	7742060	Yeah, it's not mandatory, but, like, for example,
7742100	7745700	Tap My Katamari, or not Tap My Katamari,
7745740	7749020	the Katamari, oh, it was Tap My Katamari.
7749060	7750060	That's what you're thinking of.
7750100	7752500	Yeah, OK. Tap My Katamari, that was the...
7752540	7754180	OK, yeah, Tap My Katamari, they tried...
7754220	7755220	Cookie Clicker Katamari.
7755260	7756980	Cookie Clicker Krem... Yes, thank you.
7757020	7762020	So that game, they added that right before I saw playing it,
7762060	7766780	all these offers you could do to earn in-game currency and stuff,
7766820	7768660	and none of them fucking worked.
7768660	7771220	Like, you go to a website and answer some survey questions
7771260	7772780	and shit like that, and it's like,
7772820	7775140	yeah, there'll be a short delay before when that says
7775180	7776900	credit to your account.
7776940	7779220	Two weeks later, still fucking nothing.
7779260	7781180	So that kind of shit, I don't like.
7781220	7785460	Watching the video's fine, because that shit at least works.
7785500	7786180	I mean, that's kind of cool.
7786220	7788020	But every time I hear about this tip system,
7788060	7792140	it just, it reminds me of, like, those fucking adult chat rooms
7792180	7794700	where you're, like, tipping the people that have sex on camera
7794740	7795660	and shit like that.
7795700	7799540	It's just, like, that's where they should have the ads.
7801180	7802340	Get free money for that shit.
7802380	7805340	But, like, tipping people, like, pennies, you know,
7805380	7806380	it's kind of silly.
7807700	7810620	And it makes me wonder, though, if we stream this show on Twitch,
7810660	7812740	not that we would ever leave VOG or whatever,
7812780	7815260	but if we were to, like, stream this show on Twitch,
7815300	7818580	could we actually get people throwing their bits at us
7818620	7820580	and use that money to buy new mics?
7820620	7821820	Show us your bits.
7823460	7824820	Show me them bitties!
7826300	7828140	Show me your naughty bits.
7828180	7829900	Oh, man, there's so many puns.
7829940	7831460	So many puns with this.
7831500	7835460	Anyway, this is, I guess, is opening up in the U.S.,
7835500	7838340	so it's something that you can participate in here in the U.S.,
7838380	7839860	where our show is based.
7839900	7842540	But you can use the bits in any chat channel
7842580	7844180	that has the cheering enabled,
7844220	7846740	which I don't think cheering is enabled for everybody yet,
7846780	7849740	but they are looking at expanding that to more users in the future.
7849780	7852620	So, yeah, very interesting how this is developing,
7852660	7854940	and probably more and more people are going to get in
7854940	7856700	on streaming this video game stuff.
7856740	7860260	So, very curious to see how that unfolds.
7860300	7863180	Anyhow, it is time to open up the Skype line
7863220	7866060	at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7866100	7868740	Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio.
7868780	7869900	Kaijuto in chat says,
7869940	7872780	Fuck those bits, but if peeps want to use them, that's cool.
7872820	7874700	Yeah, I guess the cool thing is,
7874740	7877660	at the end of the day, this really doesn't affect
7877700	7880260	the, you know, content itself or whatever.
7880300	7881860	None of it's mandatory.
7881940	7886580	Although, you got to worry that there might be some streamers out there
7886620	7888900	that are going to be like, they're going to hold their streams hostage,
7888940	7892540	where it's like, I'm not going to do anything unless I get a thousand bits.
7892580	7894420	So, exactly like those adult chat rooms.
7894460	7897060	Yeah, but yeah, I'm not going to show my boobies
7897100	7899500	until I get so much, you know, money or whatever.
7899540	7900660	But then I would think,
7900700	7902540	but see, I think there would be a trade-off for that,
7902580	7904100	because if you do that,
7904140	7908420	it's very easy to just go find something else on Twitch.
7908460	7909860	You know what I mean?
7909900	7911260	But sometimes they have a nice rack,
7911260	7912740	and so you stay there.
7914380	7918540	Anyway, again, it's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7918580	7920140	If you want to give us a call,
7920180	7923540	and we can talk about anything we've discussed in our show.
7923580	7925980	No, but it's silly to hold your channel hostage
7926020	7927980	for what is literally pennies.
7928020	7929460	Yeah, literally pennies. Yeah.
7930460	7933220	And does the streamer get that full penny,
7933260	7934500	or do they get like a fraction of the penny?
7934540	7938940	Well, because it costs $1.40 to get 100 bits,
7938980	7940940	that's where Twitch is getting their money.
7940980	7944180	Because you're buying $1 in currency for $1.40.
7944220	7945180	Yeah, that's where it's coming from.
7945220	7946340	Anyway, our phone is going off,
7946380	7948540	so I do want to get to some of the calls.
7948580	7950660	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7950700	7951820	Hey, this is Marcus.
7951860	7953300	Hey, Marcus, how you doing?
7953340	7954940	I'm doing fine, thanks.
7954980	7956420	Saw you at GamerX, actually.
7956460	7958180	I remember running into you there.
7958220	7960060	Thank you for coming to the panel. I appreciate that.
7960100	7960780	Yeah, it was great.
7960820	7962620	Hope you had... And thank you for the ribbon.
7962660	7963980	Oh, yeah, you're welcome.
7964020	7965540	So, how many ribbons did you get?
7965580	7967780	A ton. They're all in the backseat of my car still,
7967820	7968860	because I had to...
7968900	7970460	It was... I had it on the gear shift,
7970500	7971420	and it was getting in the way.
7971460	7972340	But there's a ton.
7972380	7973700	I walked out of there with a ton of ribbons.
7973740	7977580	I actually... I ended up getting a special guest ribbon,
7977620	7979420	and I can't tell you how,
7979460	7980620	but I got a special guest.
7980660	7982860	It was like my coup de grace at the very end,
7982900	7985020	was I was actually a special guest of GamerX
7985060	7987020	for the last two minutes of the show.
7987060	7988700	So, that was exciting.
7988740	7989460	Yeah, if you didn't see that,
7989500	7991260	if you're not following me on Twitter,
7991300	7993220	there was, like, people had these ribbons,
7993260	7994180	was like the big thing this year,
7994220	7996060	and it wasn't just the con itself,
7996100	7999100	but, like, you know, certain booths had ribbons,
7999140	8000980	certain cosplayers had ribbons,
8001020	8002540	and I was like, nobody told me
8002580	8004020	this was gonna be a fucking ribbon party.
8004060	8005580	I would have had some VOG ribbons made.
8005620	8006660	Why didn't I know this?
8006700	8009060	So, that is the lesson learned.
8009100	8011500	Between Dragon Con and GamerX,
8011540	8014340	I am fucking getting some podcasting ribbons made.
8014380	8016020	That's the lesson I'm learning from these,
8016060	8017700	because I like ribbons.
8017740	8019540	But anyway, my goal was to collect them all.
8019580	8022540	And even some of the organizers for GamerX
8022580	8024420	saw my lanyard and were like,
8024460	8025660	you have a lot of ribbons.
8025700	8027340	And I was like, gotta catch them all.
8027380	8028060	It'll make them laugh.
8028060	8029260	So, anyway.
8029300	8030300	Anyway, sorry, Marcus.
8030340	8032540	What did you call in to talk about tonight?
8032580	8035660	Well, I actually wanted to call to talk about PlayStation VR.
8035700	8036940	Yeah.
8036980	8039980	So, I also am one of those people, you know, pre-ordered it
8040020	8042060	the minute it went up.
8042100	8045580	Been wondering about that pre-order ever since.
8045620	8049540	It's really tough right now.
8049580	8052540	I mean, the text reviews I've read,
8052580	8055820	from what I saw, they looked really positive.
8055860	8057940	At least the scores were pretty high.
8058940	8061660	But I know Loki mentioned that Giant Bomb streamed
8061700	8064060	for like a bunch of hours, PlayStation VR.
8064100	8065740	And it was like a mess.
8065780	8068140	And I watched that stream too.
8068180	8071180	And I almost, you know, tipped it over for me.
8071220	8072540	It's just, it's like,
8074260	8078180	what was happening was, it was beyond anything.
8078220	8080940	I have a Oculus Rift.
8080980	8082540	I also have a Gear VR.
8082580	8084060	Those are fine.
8084100	8086820	But what I saw on that stream was just like,
8086980	8091980	extreme nausea, just like, it would be so bad.
8092740	8096660	But so many reviews never mentioned anything like this.
8096700	8099540	So it was like, what was happening with Giant Bomb?
8099580	8102020	Some people have suggested, oh, they just set it up wrong.
8102060	8105300	But I mean, they had other games there before,
8105340	8107820	previously, Super Hypercube, et cetera.
8107860	8109540	I don't see how you really set that up wrong.
8109580	8111940	Yeah, I know, I think they set it up fine,
8111980	8113660	because they had people there before
8113700	8117540	with Super Hypercube, et cetera, on PSVR in the same setup.
8117580	8118860	And it ran just fine for them.
8118900	8121020	But it was just this stream now
8121060	8125140	with their new review units in, it was a nightmare.
8125180	8127740	But I have seen some other negative feedback out there,
8127780	8129180	not just Giant Bomb, but you know,
8129220	8130940	after I canceled the VR already,
8130980	8132820	I saw like another review on it
8132860	8134540	that was kind of negative in nature.
8134580	8135940	But you know, what's interesting, Marcus,
8135980	8138780	we just had this conversation here in studio about reviews
8138820	8141260	and how much can you trust reviews, right?
8141300	8143980	So, yeah, I think most of what I've been seeing
8144020	8147140	has been kind of just average to kind of like,
8147180	8150100	eh, you know, maybe it's not the best thing.
8150140	8152220	Like, I know Game Informers was kind of,
8152260	8154540	it was the sea mines that they gave it.
8154580	8156700	I'm trying to think of what other reviews I read.
8156740	8159620	But yeah, I mean, I just kind of go by
8159660	8160900	what we're seeing in the stream,
8160940	8162740	because I think the Giant Bomb one,
8162780	8165460	I wouldn't, I think that they're pretty competent
8165500	8167260	as far as setting something up.
8167300	8169500	If they are having trouble setting it up accurately,
8169540	8170980	then I would assume that the end user
8171020	8172300	is going to have trouble setting it up,
8172340	8174300	then if that's going to be the case.
8174340	8177980	So I would take what their experience was during that.
8178020	8179620	It's not necessarily even a setup.
8179660	8183780	It was just, even the tracking on it is very obvious
8183820	8185860	that it's not tracking that very well.
8185900	8187220	Well, let me ask you this, Marcus,
8187260	8190260	because you sound like a VR enthusiast, you know,
8190300	8193020	because you already have what, Gear VR and Oculus.
8193060	8195540	So you've already kind of put your feet in the water,
8195580	8197900	so to speak, so I think that already puts you
8197940	8199380	on a different perspective, necessarily,
8199420	8200780	than where Loki and I are.
8200820	8203540	But have you actually played PlayStation VR?
8203580	8205540	Have you gone to one of these Best Buy things
8205580	8207980	or some type of event where you can try it?
8208020	8210540	Yes, I've played it.
8210580	8213700	I got to play it at E3.
8213740	8216340	You know, pretty nice setup there.
8216380	8220140	But I had, you know, previously I've had no problems with it.
8220180	8223940	It's been fine. It's a really comfortable headset.
8223980	8225300	I can't say, you know, the quality of the games
8225380	8229620	are what I was looking for, but I thought it was just fine.
8229660	8233100	So I don't know, could something have happened,
8233140	8236860	like, between the development units and these retail units?
8236900	8239060	Because it's like, I don't,
8239100	8241060	I never experienced anything like that.
8241100	8243100	And it's kind of wild.
8243140	8245220	I'm not sure I would let one stream
8245260	8246580	have such an impact either.
8246620	8248380	I mean, you know, with as much as people
8248420	8249620	enjoy Giant Bomb or whatever,
8249660	8251100	I'm not sure I would let one stream
8251140	8252300	sway my decision with that.
8252340	8253940	Yeah, that's true. I'm just scared.
8253940	8257180	Like, you know, it does require really good setup or whatever.
8257220	8261860	And what it is, it's a $600 decision, right?
8261900	8262380	Yes.
8262420	8264500	I mean, that's ultimately what's making all of us nervous.
8264540	8265860	And what made myself nervous is, like,
8265900	8269420	this is a $600-plus decision.
8269460	8271980	I mean, okay, you could argue, well, I don't have the move.
8272020	8274900	So it would be a $600 decision, basically.
8274940	8277660	You know, and on top of that, the price of games.
8277700	8279620	And so, yeah, that's, you know,
8279660	8283340	am I wanting to pay $600 to be an early adopter on this?
8283340	8286140	And I think I finally came to the conclusion that,
8286180	8290100	no, I want to spend $600 to go to Chicago and see my friends.
8290140	8293500	And I will wait and maybe get the VR next time.
8293540	8294620	Yeah.
8294660	8298220	I mean, I guess I'm fortunate enough to be able to, you know,
8298260	8300660	not make this decision be like a make or break.
8300700	8303500	Like, I need, you know, this money for rent or something.
8303540	8306540	I can afford it, even though it'd be kind of gross
8306580	8308340	if it's like a crap product.
8308380	8313260	But I think at this point, I'm still going to get it.
8313260	8319900	Um, so I don't know, I'll probably call in after I've played it, you know.
8319940	8322100	Oh, totally. I totally wouldn't care for our listeners.
8322140	8324420	How wonderful or awful it ends up being.
8324460	8326860	You know what, I mean, if I had the disposable income,
8326900	8330700	you know, if it, like, if that kind of money wasn't such a big deal,
8330740	8334780	yeah, I probably would still pick it up anyway just to try it.
8334820	8337820	But because I figure a lot of that stuff's going to be patched out eventually,
8337860	8338940	I would hope.
8338980	8341220	But I just don't.
8341540	8344860	But at the same time, don't necessarily prepare for disappointment either.
8344900	8346740	Although, I guess if you put the bar low,
8346780	8349300	then you're only going to get your expectations exceeded.
8349340	8351820	But look at the, you know what, you're going to need to play ResVR.
8351860	8353060	That's going to be fucking rad.
8353100	8356100	Like, you know, but, you know, I finally had to answer that question
8356140	8357980	that a lot of people have been asking me.
8358020	8360860	Is ResVR worth $600, Rob?
8360900	8363900	And for me, it's like,
8363940	8367740	yes, but just not today.
8367780	8371060	So that's where I ultimately ended up.
8371060	8373300	Yeah, you know, I'm going to get it.
8373340	8374980	We'll see how it goes.
8375020	8378220	All right. Well, I look forward to hearing from you again next week
8378260	8382260	or the week after to tell me all about what I'm missing out on.
8382300	8383180	Yeah, sure.
8383220	8386220	All right. Marcus, anything else before we let you go?
8386260	8387180	No, that was really it.
8387220	8390020	You know, just wanted to share my stress, I guess.
8390060	8391740	No, I hear you. We're all feeling it right now.
8391780	8393020	This is the time.
8393060	8395380	All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
8395420	8399860	But again, great to see you at GamerX, and we'll see you next time.
8399900	8400500	Sure thing.
8400500	8401700	All right. Take care, buddy.
8401740	8402020	Bye.
8402060	8403060	Bye.
8403100	8406180	All right. Wow, we have a surprising number of calls lighting up the line tonight.
8406220	8408020	I figured all the politics out in the world
8408060	8411860	and just the fact we have a lower turnout than usual tonight would have scared people off.
8411900	8413540	But that is apparently not the fact.
8413580	8415740	So hello, you're on Orange Noms Radio. Who's this?
8415780	8417180	Hey, it's Brad from Pod Culture.
8417220	8419940	Hey, Brad from Pod Culture. How are you?
8419980	8421380	I'm Peachy Keen.
8421420	8423700	Good to hear from you. What's on your mind, buddy?
8423740	8426180	Well, everybody likes cats, right?
8426220	8428060	Of course. Who doesn't?
8428100	8430180	And y'all like clicker games?
8430180	8431620	Yes.
8431660	8432980	Cat clicker game for you.
8433020	8435300	Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
8435340	8436740	On Android and iOS.
8436780	8439780	This is the one you texted me about earlier in the week, isn't it?
8439820	8440780	Oh, yeah.
8440820	8446540	Luckily, I've been so distracted, I haven't had time to fall down this kiddie hole.
8446580	8448100	Yeah, it's a rabbit hole. I did kiddie hole.
8448140	8452700	I haven't had time to do that yet, so I'm a little scared of this.
8452740	8454620	But what is this, Brad?
8454660	8457700	It's pretty appropriate. It's PolitiCats.
8457740	8460140	PolitiCats. What are you doing, PolitiCats?
8460180	8466900	You're a cat, and you campaign, and your tapping is your votes.
8466940	8469900	And the more you tap, the more votes you get.
8469940	8473020	And it's just frickin' ridiculous.
8473060	8478260	Oh, my God, there's these power-ups, and you go from, like, being town treasurer
8478300	8482100	to county commissioner all the way up the ranks.
8482140	8485500	So I guess you can get president, but eventually it ramps up.
8485540	8488780	So you can go all the way from a mayor in a small town in Alaska
8488780	8490740	all the way to the vice presidency?
8490780	8496460	Pretty much, yeah. And you can see rest from the litter box.
8496500	8499100	Do they put tongue-in-cheek jokes like that in the game?
8499140	8500620	I would hope so.
8500660	8504860	There are power-ups, there are endorsements that you can get,
8504900	8510740	and one of them is catty-purry.
8510780	8513900	Yeah, so you can get these different cat pun celebrity endorsements.
8513940	8515620	Okay, I like that.
8515620	8518700	Is this a free game, or where's the money made in this game?
8518740	8522260	There are some in-app purchases you can get, typical gems and stuff,
8522300	8527060	but I've been playing it for about a week now and haven't had to put in a cent.
8527100	8529580	Gotcha. Are you still playing that nonstop night tour?
8529620	8531140	Did you finally give up on that?
8531180	8533540	In theory, I'm still playing it,
8533580	8537940	but I've been distracted with this damn political cats game.
8537980	8542140	It's tough when they put cats in it. It makes it very hard to resist, isn't it?
8542180	8546700	Oh, yeah, there's all kinds of different cats that you can choose from,
8546740	8551180	starting out, and if you want to pay an extra three bucks, you can unlock Garfield.
8551220	8553260	Really? They have licensed cats?
8553300	8555020	They have one licensed cat.
8555060	8559700	Garfield, that's awesome, and you too can hate Mondays and enjoy lasagna.
8559740	8562060	And there's little crap that you can unlock for the cat,
8562100	8567180	like glasses and hats and stupid little furry wings and bubbles and all that kind of crap.
8567220	8569700	Can you get nurble, though?
8569700	8573140	Not yet, but there is a little gray, heavy type cat.
8573180	8574180	Okay. All right.
8574220	8576060	You have to pay money to get rid of nurble.
8578420	8579860	I'm waiting for Simon's cat.
8579900	8583020	If that shows up, I'll pay a couple of bucks for Simon's cat.
8583060	8585380	No love for a fucking Heathcliff, unfortunately.
8585420	8588020	Oh, that's just a Garfield ripoff.
8588060	8591220	Oh, hey, but it had a way better theme song.
8592260	8593260	Maybe so.
8593300	8595780	All right, so PolitiCats, I will definitely check that out.
8595820	8600220	Hey, before I let you go, I know you're a big fan of the Forza Horizon series,
8600260	8604060	and I've been very slow to pick that up just because it's been a crazy past couple months,
8604100	8606380	but are you enjoying Forza Horizon 3?
8606420	8608700	I am. I am a lot.
8608740	8613940	I was lucky enough to be gifted a copy by someone who will remain aimless.
8613980	8617380	But yeah, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.
8617420	8623420	It's actually the first digital game, full digital game that I've got.
8623460	8626460	And fortunately, it's one of the Xbox Anywhere's,
8626500	8630300	and that's how I found out that my video card isn't compatible.
8630340	8631340	Don't.
8632100	8634460	Well, yeah, I need a DX12 compatible,
8634500	8638460	but who needs it when you can stream from the Xbox app?
8638500	8641260	That's true, when the Xbox app works, right?
8641300	8643900	Yeah, the latest update broke it.
8643940	8647020	I haven't had that problem yet, but then again, I don't do that streaming a lot,
8647060	8651900	but I was going to try streaming some Lost Odyssey to my PC so I could play it over there.
8651900	8655060	So I'll have to see if that will still work or what's going to happen.
8655100	8661180	Unless you're on the insider preview program stuff, probably not.
8661220	8664580	But because I'm stupid, like being on the cutting edge of stuff,
8664620	8669340	yeah, I think it's just the latest insider preview up there that broke it.
8669380	8671020	I don't think I'm on that insider preview.
8671060	8674380	And I've played, like when Dungeon Siege 3 came out on Games with Gold,
8674420	8678380	I played a lot of that on my PC through the streaming.
8678420	8680300	So that's cool, yeah.
8680300	8684340	I actually do a lot of streaming, even though it's just me and the cats.
8684380	8688620	But I actually, because I'm in here in the studio so much,
8688660	8691820	do most of my gaming streaming from the Xbox to the PC.
8691860	8695340	Yeah, same thing. It's weird because Alan and I don't usually end up in our living room together,
8695380	8697260	but like we're in the office together all the time.
8697300	8700500	So sometimes if like, you know, I want to hang out and, you know, we're kind of doing it,
8700540	8705180	I'll play on my PC streaming from the Xbox sometimes, just a little easier.
8705220	8708700	Plus the multi-monitor setup goes a long way because I can stream on one monitor
8708700	8711580	and still kind of keep an eye on emails or whatever on the other.
8711620	8718140	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, well, I was going to try and play for so while I was listening to the show.
8718180	8720380	But it broke.
8720420	8722540	I'm like, okay, fine, I'll listen to O.R.
8722580	8726060	All right. All right. Well, Brad, my friend, I'm going to let you go.
8726100	8726540	All righty.
8726580	8731020	But thank you for calling into the show and check out Pod Culture here on the networks
8731060	8734540	Monday at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.
8734580	8735820	All right. Later on, guys.
8735860	8737020	All right. Take care, buddy.
8737060	8737420	Bye.
8737500	8738700	Bye.
8738740	8741940	All right. We'll try to squeeze in maybe one more call here before we wrap up tonight.
8741980	8742780	Let's get to it.
8742820	8744740	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8744780	8745940	Hey, what's up, man? It's Kaijuto.
8745980	8747860	Hey, Kaijuto, my friend. How are you?
8747900	8748420	I'm all right.
8748460	8752140	I just want to say that first caller, what was his name again?
8752180	8753180	Marcus.
8753220	8755620	Yeah, him and I do sound exactly like each other.
8755660	8757700	I've been going back and forth with them in the chat room.
8757740	8760180	I don't know if you guys agree, but I think they sound a lot alike.
8760220	8761860	I think you should have them on at the same time.
8761900	8765660	I hear some similarity, but I don't think it's as...
8765660	8768340	I mean, especially because of the quality of their connections.
8768380	8770500	I don't know how it comes out over them, but they have very different...
8770540	8774260	I'm not saying one's bad or the other, but they just have a very different sound through the connection.
8774300	8776900	But maybe that isn't as apparent on the internet radio.
8777740	8778420	Yeah, I don't know.
8778460	8783180	But anyway, I'm just calling to say I am absolutely excited about PlayStation VR.
8784860	8789900	I haven't been really paying too much attention to the reviews and who hated it, who liked it.
8790180	8797140	I saw some people, like regular people, not anyone affiliated with Sony or anything like that.
8797180	8799620	And I mean, people have been falling in love with this thing.
8800460	8802140	I didn't even know I wanted PlayStation VR.
8802180	8803940	Like, I wasn't like that in the VR.
8804460	8807380	And I started watching these people experience it on YouTube.
8807420	8810660	And I'm like, all right, I got to go into a best spot and I got to try this out.
8811140	8813540	And man, I was I was floored by this thing.
8813580	8817220	This thing was so much fun, so amazing.
8817660	8818620	I definitely want to get one.
8818660	8819340	I was disappointed.
8819380	8822700	I called my local GameStop and they were already sold out.
8822740	8824980	But I'm in good with the people there.
8825020	8832380	So they were like, you know, they have a 48 hour policy that if somebody doesn't pick up their preorder in 48 hours, then it goes up on the shelf.
8832420	8837500	So they were like, you know, if somebody doesn't happen to pick up theirs, they'll inform me.
8837860	8839660	But I'm pretty much set for VR.
8839700	8842260	Like, all I really need are those motion controls.
8842700	8843620	I already have the camera.
8843660	8845140	Of course, I got the PlayStation 4.
8845580	8847020	So I'm all set, man.
8847020	8850540	Whenever I could get a hold of one of those, I definitely want to get into it.
8850580	8851540	I don't care about the wires.
8851580	8857100	I never I've always been a wire person, so it doesn't bother me having all the wires around it.
8857140	8859900	I mean, it's it's a great it's a great headset.
8859940	8860860	It's a great feel.
8861140	8866940	I haven't tried Oculus or Vibe or anything like that, but I didn't even notice this thing was really on my head.
8866980	8870860	Like, you feel a little bit in the center of your head, but it's very relaxing.
8870900	8874740	Like, I know people are talking about, well, not with the PlayStation VR, but with other stuff.
8874780	8876780	They're like, you know, you get neck cramps up and stuff like that.
8877100	8882060	Like, I can see myself playing this thing for at least I don't play games for that long anyway.
8882100	8888020	I could see myself playing for like maybe the length of a movie, like an hour and some change, and then I'm done.
8888060	8892780	You know, like, I don't feel like my neck is going to get tired or I'm going to get dizzy or sick or anything like that.
8893500	8902780	Very interesting that you were really sold on is funny because I was I was telling the first caller, Marcus, you know, I was asking if he'd actually tried it in person.
8902820	8907060	And it's very interesting that you were really sold, it sounds like, on that experience.
8907100	8912300	Like, it sounds like you kind of didn't know how you felt, but once you tried it, you were like, yep, I'm jumping in day one.
8912860	8915220	Yeah, they didn't have the move controllers.
8915260	8917500	I just played with the PlayStation.
8917500	8918500	I tried out the demos.
8918740	8919820	I did the shark thing.
8920380	8924740	I actually knew there was a shark in it, but still didn't think I was going to react the way that reacted to the shark.
8924740	8927020	Like, it still scared me, like, whoa.
8927220	8929940	Because for me, it was the whole scale of it.
8929940	8936260	It's like, you know, I fooled around with the, you know, with the phone, VR, porn, VR, all that stuff.
8939980	8943580	To me, to me, it felt like a view master, like I look at the view, you know, it's cool.
8943580	8947900	I can look around, I can see stuff, but it's like a panoramic view master for me.
8947900	8954260	But this thing, like, I feel like I'm small in this world, like whatever is supposed to be big, I'm smaller than that thing.
8954620	8959660	Whatever is supposed to be small and that, you know, like I was literally the size of those things, which that totally like blew my mind.
8959660	8965100	Like, it totally tricks your brain into thinking that you're really in these places, you know, and it's weird.
8965100	8966980	Like, when you take it off, it's completely weird.
8966980	8969980	Like, when I took it off, it was like, I literally felt like I came out of the matrix.
8970420	8973260	Like, yeah, it's crazy.
8973580	8983740	Alright, well, that's, I would also be curious to hear from you in a couple weeks and see if you felt it was worth what you put down for it and, you know, what you kind of walk away with from the experience.
8984500	8985180	Yeah, I can't wait.
8985180	8997260	Like, I definitely, another reason I want to get on it quick is because I'm a little worried that maybe after two years, like when they bring the price down, they might give you like more of a gimped version of the headset and I want that particular headset.
8997260	9003620	You know, I don't want like a watered down gimped version with, you know, you know, lesser whatever the hell they always do with those types of things.
9003620	9007780	So, I think this is the type of thing that you want to be an early adopter of.
9008300	9010380	Alright, fair enough, fair enough.
9010780	9013820	Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call and your insight.
9014380	9014660	Yep.
9014780	9015860	Alright, bye bye.
9016940	9019820	Alright, that's gonna do it for our calls tonight.
9019820	9021060	We're gonna go ahead and wrap it up there.
9021060	9025180	But if you didn't get through, please consider sending us an email because you heard how empty the mailbag was.
9025340	9028860	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.
9029220	9031540	Loki, I didn't catch, is there any last minute stories tonight?
9031780	9032300	No.
9032300	9040420	Yeah, there wasn't really, I mean, to be fair, it was kind of a slower news week than usual, probably with the looming releases ahead and everything like that.
9040420	9041740	So, a little bit quiet.
9042100	9047020	But we'll probably pick up again as we start to get into the very, very, very busy month of November.
9047940	9054940	Next week, I'll be coming fresh from Vegas, and we'll be able to talk about Final Fantasy XIV a little bit and how that was, seeing that firsthand.
9055140	9055780	Who knows?
9056060	9064420	You know, last year, one thing I was critical of about the event was that they could have used it as an excuse to show off some of the other Final Fantasy stuff.
9064620	9065220	So, who knows?
9065220	9067420	Maybe they'll show off a little Final Fantasy XV on the side.
9067420	9067820	We don't know.
9067820	9068260	We'll see.
9069260	9070620	But I'll be coming fresh from that event.
9070860	9073340	We'll talk about that and whatever else happens in the news next week.
9074060	9080540	Before we wrap things up here in studio tonight, I do want to thank everybody for downloading OLR or listening to us live, however you checked out the show.
9080700	9083420	Please remember to help us spread the word about the show.
9083420	9086220	A little word of mouth goes a long way in getting the word out.
9086420	9089860	And yeah, we really appreciate all you guys.
9090620	9096700	If you want to leave us a five-star review somewhere on a site like iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show, that goes a long way as well.
9096700	9101620	But, you know, telling a friend or two about the show is definitely, definitely the best thing for us.
9102540	9105220	So, with that being said, final thought time.
9106020	9107860	Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9107940	9112780	Um, no, I just, I don't know.
9112980	9115300	We forgot to do FUs of the Week, but that's not a big deal.
9115500	9116260	Oh, oops.
9116260	9118220	Yeah, I totally did forget to do FUs of the Week, didn't I?
9118220	9118740	That's all right.
9118860	9121940	Um, I guess I'm having a pretty good week, all things considered.
9121940	9123540	So, I'm eating FUs of the Week.
9123940	9128980	Um, yeah, I guess I'm, I'm still going to try to work on my game.
9128980	9133740	At the same time, I'm working on designing DDR pads because I really want to build some new ones.
9134100	9137140	Um, this week's been basically just cleaning out the house.
9137140	9141940	So, I've cleaned up a lot of my cord messes that I've had that my wife has been annoyed by.
9142020	9143380	So, I did that.
9143700	9147100	Um, yeah, I really am just trying to work on it.
9147100	9158260	Just, like, I literally get home after putting the kids to bed and it's just, it takes an immense amount of focus to be able to work on my laptop while the TV's on.
9158460	9163260	And then after my wife goes to bed, just an immense amount of focus to stay awake.
9163300	9167060	And that's just not, I'm not winning that battle.
9168660	9169140	All right.
9169180	9174780	Uh, well, my final thought tonight is I'm really excited to go to Vegas next week, see some friends I haven't seen in a long time.
9174780	9177260	And, uh, geek out over Final Fantasy 14.
9177660	9183940	Uh, excited for other conventions coming up as well, including MagFest, uh, in, uh, January in DC.
9183940	9185060	Looking forward to heading to that.
9185300	9188460	In the meantime, um, a shameless plug for my Twitter.
9188460	9190860	Follow me on Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E.
9190940	9192740	I've met a lot of really rad people on Twitter.
9192980	9196820	So, uh, as long as I figure out that you're human, I'll usually follow you back.
9197100	9199620	Uh, so yeah, uh, appreciate all those follows.
9199900	9201340	And I guess, I guess that's it.
9201420	9202060	We're done.
