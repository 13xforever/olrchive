7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	Tonight, after complete silence, some tweets rock Hello Games
18000	22000	And are you ready to wait until 2017 for more info on Nintendo Switch?
22000	27000	All this and more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	41000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 663
41000	47000	For this, October the 30th of 2016, my name is Rob Roberts
47000	53000	Joining you live from our studio to talk about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
53000	58000	And with me this week, say hello, as always, to Tech Master Loki
58000	59000	Hello
59000	60000	Hi Loki, how are you?
60000	61000	Fine
61000	63000	So, Halloween's tomorrow
63000	64000	Yeah
64000	66000	Are you going to be taking the kids out for trick or treating and all that?
66000	67000	Yes, I will be
67000	68000	What are you dressing up as?
68000	69000	I'm not dressing up as anything
69000	73000	What? Have you got that? Are you too old for Halloween? Is that what's happened?
73000	75000	No, I just overdid it last year, so I'm not doing anything this year
75000	76000	Oh, you overdid it last year?
76000	79000	Yeah, because I stayed up for 24 hours straight to make that Lego Deadpool costume
79000	84000	That's right, I remember that, oh yeah, okay, so you earned your year off
84000	85000	Yeah, so I'm taking the year off
85000	88000	But unfortunately, no tingle, 14 years in a row
88000	93000	I wanted to get one of those inflatable T-Rex costumes that are the rage on the internet
93000	94000	I see a lot of those, yeah
94000	95000	So that would have been fun
95000	101000	I think I saw some picture of an inflatable T-Rex riding a T-Rex at some, like, theme park or something, I don't know
101000	102000	That would be funny
102000	104000	That would be hilarious
104000	110000	You mentioned real quick, I mean, you might be gonna talk about this in your gaming week, I suppose, but I'm gonna bring it up now
110000	112000	You mentioned you were at a social gathering last night
112000	116000	As, you know, the interesting thing with Halloween being on a Monday this year
116000	120000	There was Halloween parties Friday night, Halloween parties Saturday night
120000	122000	There's probably some Halloween parties tonight
122000	125000	And then there's actual Halloween on Monday
125000	129000	So, I know you went to a social gathering and you were doing the PlayStation VR
129000	132000	How was that received in a party type setting?
133000	136000	It's alright, I mean, there was some people that wanted to try it
136000	138000	Mostly the people that have already tried it before
138000	140000	Xtafur got to try it for the first time
140000	144000	So, of course, the first one you had to have him play was Kitchen
144000	146000	Which is Resident Evil 7, basically
146000	150000	I don't know why they call it, I guess Kitchen was the working name before they revealed it
150000	153000	The Kitchen demo, but that was funny, watching him jump
153000	156000	I didn't make it, like, five seconds to that demo
156000	159000	Like, the very first gory thing that happened, I noped the fuck out of that demo
159000	160000	I did
161000	164000	And then I set up Rush of Blood
165000	167000	Which you've really been raving about that game
167000	169000	Yeah, I love that game
169000	172000	So, we played, or I had
173000	175000	Was it Flocko Jones play
177000	179000	It was one of the levels in there
179000	184000	With, like, a witch thing that, like, fires crows at you or something
184000	187000	And so there was a few moments, like, there was
187000	192000	That's also the one that has, like, kind of the Silent Hill type room
192000	194000	Where there's these mannequins that will
194000	196000	You look away from them, they move
196000	198000	Yeah, that type of thing
198000	200000	So, that was funny
200000	203000	Just watching him, you know, jump at all the jump scares and stuff
203000	205000	Yeah, I don't like jump scares, I don't do it
205000	207000	Well, I always find them hilarious
207000	210000	It didn't necessarily scare me, I just kind of laugh at them
210000	211000	It's kind of fun
211000	212000	Fair enough
212000	214000	But it's a fun game, though
214000	216000	Alright, well not joining us tonight, of course, Dark Sakura
216000	218000	She is still on leave from the show
218000	221000	But she will hopefully be, actually, I think we're going to hear from her
221000	223000	In a couple of weeks
223000	225000	I know she's planning on being here for episode 666
225000	227000	And we're going to be taping 665 in advance
227000	229000	And I think she's going to be here for that
229000	232000	So, yeah, we'll have Dark Sakura back in the studio real soon
232000	235000	I know she misses you all, but her aim is improving
235000	237000	But if you are listening live, of course
237000	240000	You should join us in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
240000	242000	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night
242000	244000	At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
244000	246000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
246000	248000	Even though Bobby was also off tonight
248000	250000	Halloween is just throwing everything off
250000	253000	Just throwing off everybody's rhythm
253000	257000	But a big hello to those of you that are in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
257000	261000	Stoppy, I think, talking about work on Monday
261000	264000	Saying in chat, I have some co-workers who are going to dress up
264000	267000	News to me, I thought they were dressing up as something all year
267000	270000	Yeah, they're trying to find an apartment
271000	274000	I'm not even that young, but it's a bunch of older people
274000	279000	And they always want to like, okay, the whole floor is going to do a theme
279000	281000	I'm like, fuck that
281000	283000	Because it's always some lame ass theme
283000	287000	Like, you know, the last time, last year it was
287000	289000	Oh, we're all going to dress up like celebrities
289000	292000	I'm like, fuck that, I'm dressing up as Lego Deadpool
292000	294000	Which is sort of a celebrity
294000	295000	Sort of a celebrity
295000	300000	But this year they're doing like 80s musicians
300000	302000	I'm like, no, no
302000	304000	I'm not going to do it
304000	306000	Hey, you can't talk until I introduce you
306000	308000	Let's say hello
308000	310000	We have some other folks in the studio
310000	311000	So I should probably introduce them
311000	313000	Because clearly they have something to say
313000	315000	So we have a couple other people joining us tonight
315000	317000	I'll start over here because this guy's here every week
317000	318000	So he's nothing special
318000	320000	Say hello to Shane, everybody
320000	321000	He's joining us here
321000	323000	I'm not holding up my mic near my mouth
323000	325000	Shane is protesting but not holding the mic near his mouth
325000	328000	Well, then I can't ask you about your shiny collection
328000	330000	And supposedly, what, you got to 100 shinies, right?
330000	332000	Yeah, I got to my 100 shinies
332000	335000	What was your 100th shiny that you got on Pokemon?
337000	338000	What was it?
338000	339000	Hello
339000	341000	I'm thinking
341000	342000	You don't know?
342000	344000	I would have thought this was a landmark occasion
344000	345000	That you would celebrate
345000	347000	But it was like days ago
347000	350000	So, I'm trying to remember, I got that
350000	352000	You know the old saying, you never forget your 100th Pokemon
353000	356000	It was some sort of fished-up Pokemon
356000	357000	I know that much
357000	359000	Oh, so you did use the fish trick
359000	360000	Yeah, for the last three I did fishing
360000	362000	I was just like, screw it, I'm going to do that
362000	363000	Okay, okay
363000	365000	Alright, so we'll just say Magikarp
365000	366000	Because you don't know
366000	367000	No, it wasn't a Magikarp
367000	369000	I already had that
369000	371000	It wouldn't have mattered
371000	373000	Alright, well congratulations
373000	375000	Congratulations on a 100 shiny Pokemon
375000	376000	Thank you
376000	377000	I'm not sure what else to ask you about
377000	378000	Solidarity is our guest
378000	379000	Nope, that's fine
379000	381000	Alright, so I'm brand new to the show
381000	383000	Has never been here in studio before
383000	385000	But I know it's been listening for a little while
385000	387000	Say hello everybody, welcome to the show tonight
387000	388000	JD?
388000	389000	Hi there
389000	390000	Hi, how are you?
390000	391000	Pretty good
391000	392000	Good, welcome to the show
392000	393000	Thank you
393000	395000	So, video games, you play them, right?
395000	396000	I sure do
396000	397000	Good, you're at the right place
397000	399000	But you, we were talking a little bit beforehand
399000	401000	Because I was asking if you'd played like Thumper on PlayStation 4
401000	403000	But you don't really own new consoles, right?
403000	405000	You're still rocking the classics?
405000	407000	Yeah, I mean, I keep up with stuff on Steam
407000	409000	So when stuff goes on sale, I pick things up
409000	413000	But yeah, I mean, my most recent consoles are a Wii and a PS2
413000	415000	So, so old school stuff?
415000	416000	Yeah
416000	417000	A little bit, at this point it's old school stuff?
417000	419000	I mean, it's weird to me to think of it like that
419000	420000	But yeah, it is
420000	422000	So do you consider yourself more of a PC gamer then
422000	424000	If you're keeping up with stuff mostly on Steam?
424000	426000	Yeah, I mean, I also, I play Guild Wars 2 a lot
426000	429000	So that's definitely a current title
429000	433000	But yeah, I would say the new stuff coming out, I'm a PC gamer
433000	434000	Okay, nice
434000	437000	Which is pretty much safe at this point
437000	441000	Because most of the games that come out nowadays that are worth getting are on PC
441000	442000	That is really true
442000	446000	You know, well, Microsoft has their whole thing with, you know, Xbox One
446000	450000	And like Windows 10 is like one platform, basically
450000	453000	And you buy a game one place, you get them on both
453000	457000	So I mean, you know, what, like Forza Horizon 3 you should be able to get on PC, right?
457000	460000	I just, I'm behind, I still haven't picked up that game
460000	462000	I almost did today, Shane tried
462000	465000	Yeah, there was a lot of like deals trying to be made, but
465000	466000	Okay, so here's the problem
466000	471000	I'm at Target, which is having the whole buy two, get one free video game thing
471000	476000	And for some reason, Shane has decided that I need to take advantage of this deal
476000	478000	I don't know what he gets out of it, but he's just
478000	479000	I was just bored
479000	482000	He's just decided he wants to watch me drop $100 on video games
482000	483000	So
483000	486000	It'd be like $120 plus tax, because games are $60
486000	487000	Fine, fine
487000	490000	But here's the problem, is I wanted to get, I was like
490000	492000	Alright, I'll get Forza Horizon 3, that's obvious
492000	494000	I'll get that one, because I need to get that still
494000	498000	I'll get Skyrim Special Edition, why not? I'm curious enough
498000	501000	Yeah, I would be all over that on Xbox One
501000	503000	I'm kind of hesitant on PlayStation 4
503000	507000	Well I do have an Xbox One, and so I'd probably pick it up over there
507000	509000	Just because of the whole modding situation
509000	514000	So okay, fine, those two, but then I couldn't figure out a third game that I want
514000	516000	Right, that I didn't already have
516000	519000	Now that's the problem guys, it's the one that I didn't already have
519000	522000	Because you could say, oh Civ 6 just came out, well I already bought that
522000	524000	I bought that before the sale happened
524000	527000	And usually, you know, I'm pretty good to myself
527000	530000	When a new game comes out that I want, I get it
530000	534000	So I didn't really have three games in the backlog to get
534000	537000	World of Final Fantasy?
537000	540000	Shane had suggested that, but I'm sorry
540000	543000	That demo did not sway me on the game
543000	546000	And even when we were watching people play it on Twitch, I wasn't feeling it
546000	549000	I'm not feeling World of Final Fantasy, I'm sorry to say
549000	552000	I'll be all over Final Fantasy 15 when that comes out
552000	555000	But that's not part of the sale, so that's an issue isn't it?
558000	561000	Over in chat at live.fognetwork.com, Alan Alchemy says
561000	565000	Shane, spend money, give me your credit card, Skye
565000	568000	No, yeah it sometimes goes like that
568000	573000	Well actually it was JD that came up with a brilliant idea on how to make this work
573000	576000	JD suggested, well why don't you buy the two games
576000	580000	And then get that third free game and then sell it to Shane
580000	585000	And I was like, okay, I'm liking this idea
585000	587000	We'll split the cost
587000	589000	And then they had a fight about how to split the cost, so it didn't happen
589000	591000	Then we had a fight about how to split the cost
591000	593000	Because Shane was like, hell yeah, I'll take a free game
593000	595000	And I'm like, wait a minute, it doesn't work like that
595000	597000	This is not me buying two games, so you get the free game
597000	600000	But then I offered up, I have Forza Horizon 3
600000	603000	On a demo, or not a demo, but a code
603000	605000	And I haven't used it yet, so I offered that up for the free game
605000	608000	Yes, but the problem is, when he offered up Forza Horizon 3
608000	610000	I said, great, now we're back to the same problem
610000	612000	I'll buy Skyrim, and then what?
612000	614000	I still don't have another game to get
614000	617000	So, then we fought in the middle of Target for a good 30 minutes
617000	620000	And JD had to watch all this, and it was really awkward
620000	622000	But, you know, welcome to my life, JD
622000	624000	It was funny
624000	630000	So, JD, you play the PC stuff and you play some of the classic consoles
630000	632000	You could have gotten Paper Mario
632000	634000	You know, that was suggested, and that was probably the closest
634000	636000	Where I was like, I might pick up Paper Mario
636000	639000	But for some reason, I didn't see it in the Wii U section, did you?
639000	641000	I don't think I even looked for it
641000	642000	I don't even think I saw it
642000	643000	Isn't it a 3DS game?
643000	644000	No
644000	645000	Oh, okay, that's a Wii U game
645000	648000	Well, I mean, it's very similar to the last 3DS game
648000	649000	Shut up
649000	652000	But you've talked about, now we'll talk about the Switch later on tonight
652000	654000	And obviously there was a whole lot of Switch talk last week
654000	657000	But JD, you're feeling the Switch announcement, right?
657000	659000	Yeah, no, I'm really looking forward to it
659000	662000	I mean, especially with the handheld capability
662000	666000	Because I started out, when I started on consoles, I started with the Game Boy
666000	669000	So, I mean, I've been playing handhelds for a long time
669000	672000	So I'm looking forward to seeing, you know, a more powerful handheld
672000	673000	Yeah
673000	677000	So I know another reason that, you know, you've started listening to OLR
677000	681000	And gotten to know us and everything is that you are a big fan of music games, right?
681000	682000	That's right
682000	686000	So tell us, like, how did the music game thing, let's do a throwback episode tonight
686000	687000	Oh, wow
687000	690000	How did the music game thing start? Like, what was your first music game? Was it DDR?
690000	692000	Yeah, so I started with DDR
692000	694000	Yeah, which mix?
694000	695000	It was Fifth Mix
695000	696000	Fifth Mix
696000	698000	Which is still one of my favorites
698000	699000	Uh-huh
699000	703000	I mean, they, anyway, there's a lot of Dance Mania songs on there
703000	708000	And just all of the licensing that they did in the earlier era of DDR was a lot of fun
708000	711000	Were you one of those people posting on DDR Freak back in the day, like some of us?
711000	712000	Every so often
712000	714000	Every so often? Awesome
714000	716000	What was your username on there, JD?
717000	719000	I don't even know if it's still there
719000	724000	I'm just curious if I was like, did I ever see him when I was, I never asked you this, like what was your name there?
724000	725000	I was Sky, that's why I still
725000	729000	I mean, this is ages ago, but I think my username was GameBoyGuy13
729000	731000	Okay, wow, okay, that's old school
731000	732000	Right?
732000	735000	Okay, I think I remember you under that name listening to this show
735000	736000	Oh my god
736000	738000	I think I do, I think I do, name sounds familiar
738000	739000	This really is a throwback episode
739000	741000	I know, I know
741000	749000	So, okay, so you started on DDR Fifth Mix, and then, so what other music games, so do you buy the, like you said you have PlayStation 2
749000	755000	So do you buy all the, because they stopped making Mania 2DX during the PlayStation 2 era, do you import all that stuff?
755000	761000	Yeah, so I have the home version copies of the 2DX titles and the DDR ones
761000	770000	I used to have a PS1 because a lot of the DDR titles were only, the earlier ones up through Fifth Mix were only released on PlayStation in Japan
770000	775000	So, when I was in high school I had them, but I don't anymore for various reasons
775000	783000	But, yeah, mostly I just have a 2DX, because I have a US Konami controller for the 2DX
783000	789000	And I have, I don't have DDR pads anymore, they didn't survive a cross-country move
789000	795000	So, I've been, you know, it's on my to-do list is to pick up a new pad, so, and get it home set up
795000	796000	You grew up in Orlando
796000	797000	That's right
797000	799000	And then you, did you live in Kansas?
799000	801000	No, I went to college in the Central Valley
801000	803000	Okay, and then you, now you live in San Francisco
803000	804000	That's right
804000	805000	Okay, so that was your cross-country, got it
805000	806000	Yep
806000	807000	Got it, got it
807000	814000	Okay, let's see, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, Fifth is a good place to start, though you miss out on Fourth Plus
814000	821000	There was a Fourth Plus arcade machine, like when I was going out and about in Orlando, and Rocky's Replay was the name of the place
821000	827000	And they had Fourth Plus for a long time, so when I would go out, you know, with my friends and go play DDR, that was one of the places I'd go
827000	828000	So I got very familiar with Fourth Plus
828000	835000	Now one thing I find kind of interesting is that, you know, Loki, myself, DarkSakura, we kind of, I don't want to say we stopped playing DDR
835000	837000	Oh yep, I'm playing tons of DDR
837000	848000	But we kind of, we kind of, like, we kind of did, like it's one of those things though, but like obviously now with the round one, kind of having these arcade games that I used to be really into in my 20s, kind of making a resurgence again
848000	856000	And like the types of arcades I was into 10 years ago, 15 years ago when the show started, like now that that's making a resurgence, I'm kind of into it again
856000	862000	But otherwise, I don't usually like seek out DDR machines, but you do, right? You still like regularly go to arcades and play DDR, right?
862000	870000	Not as regularly as I'd like to, because there aren't really any convenient to me, and I think that's, you know, a sign of there not being as many arcades anymore as there used to be
870000	875000	I mean, I have to still use website databases to find them, I'm not just going to randomly run across a machine
875000	879000	Have you checked out Ace yet in Dave and Busters?
879000	882000	Oh I forget it's a Dave and Busters, that's another thing in Roseville, JD
883000	886000	We were talking earlier about how all of the fun stuff is in Roseville, apparently
886000	892000	But then I'm like, but Roseville isn't fun, like Roseville will shut down at 10 o'clock and then, now it sucks
892000	898000	So it's just funny, we were like, we could go to Dunkin Donuts, oh it's in Roseville, we go to Golf Land, it's in Roseville, Mongolian Roseville
898000	899000	Everything's in fucking Roseville
899000	901000	They have Krispy Kreme in there open 24 hours
901000	904000	That's true, they have pumpkin spice donuts this week too, it was amazing
904000	909000	Anyway, I could talk about food all night long, but we should probably take the healthier option and continue talking about DDR
909000	910000	We could talk about food gaming
911000	913000	Food gaming? What's food gaming?
913000	918000	Well there's various games about food, I mean there's Cooking Mama, there's Cook Serve Delicious, all sorts of fun stuff
918000	926000	There was one guy I saw a YouTube video of playing Overwatch with a controller made out of bananas through Arduino
926000	928000	So that's food gaming
928000	931000	I guess, I guess that's a type of food gaming
931000	933000	Or we could just have a 100 second kitchen battle
934000	936000	I see what you did there
936000	942000	Are you one of those guys that drops the names of songs into conversations and goes, get it?
942000	944000	Wasn't that a meme a while ago?
944000	946000	It was a LiveJournal community
946000	951000	Oh god, so LiveJournal, you have had your life changed by LiveJournal just like the rest of us
951000	952000	Oh yeah
952000	958000	Yeah, oh man, I met Alan on LiveJournal and Orange Lounge Radio probably still has a LiveJournal community
958000	960000	I don't remember the last time it was updated
960000	962000	I don't even remember what it was
962000	964000	It was either Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio
964000	966000	You couldn't get OLR?
966000	969000	I don't think we got OLR, no I think it was probably Taken or something
969000	972000	So yeah, awesome
972000	974000	So I'm not sure what else to ask you about
974000	978000	So you go to arcades and you play sometimes DDR but not as often as you used to
978000	982000	Ever since Playland Japan opened in Japantown a couple years ago
982000	984000	I've gone there and they have a popin music machine
985000	988000	In Orlando you couldn't find popin anywhere
988000	992000	And now that I'm in the Bay Area it's a lot easier to find
992000	995000	And so I've started playing popin a bit
995000	1000000	But you have yet to, even though you're in the Bay Area, you have yet to go to any of these round ones
1000000	1003000	Right, because I live in San Francisco, I don't have a car
1003000	1007000	And all of these round ones are way out on the edges of the area
1007000	1009000	So it's impossible to get to on transit
1010000	1014000	So just so you know, I brought up our LiveJournal community
1014000	1017000	Which is at orangelounge.livejournal.com
1017000	1021000	And the last entry we made was Sunday, June 21st, 2009
1021000	1022000	Oh wow
1022000	1025000	And that was, the announcement there was
1025000	1030000	The new URL to find OLR is at radio.allgames.com
1030000	1034000	Because that must have been the date that we flipped over to AllGames from Live 365
1034000	1037000	So, which was our home before we were here at VOG Network
1037000	1041000	So, just kind of funny that that's the last time the LiveJournal community was used
1041000	1043000	Although that's a pretty important update
1043000	1044000	Yeah
1044000	1048000	I should probably make an update that says, just in case you were looking here
1048000	1052000	Yeah, I think they have another show on now, Sundays at 6
1052000	1057000	Which is fine, I'm sure it's a fine show, but we've moved somewhere else
1057000	1059000	Oh, LiveJournal
1059000	1062000	I don't know what's going on on LiveJournal anymore
1062000	1064000	Oh no they didn't, community, right?
1064000	1067000	I think, oh no they didn't, it's probably the only thing going on on LiveJournal right now
1067000	1068000	And Russian chat
1068000	1072000	Well, okay, yeah, there's definitely, there's always been a large Russian community on LiveJournal
1072000	1075000	But it's mostly taken over the site because of ownership changes
1075000	1076000	Hmm
1076000	1081000	ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Pokemon collectors on LiveJournal, it's really active
1081000	1086000	So I guess there's still the communities, some of the communities still have a presence over there
1086000	1089000	But I kind of, I kind of miss LiveJournal in some ways
1089000	1091000	We were talking about this a little bit, is that
1091000	1097000	You know, I know Facebook I think kind of killed it for a lot of people
1097000	1102000	Because with Facebook it was so easy from your mobile phone to post pictures, to post other things
1102000	1107000	But Facebook, it sucks, like I don't know how else to put it
1107000	1109000	Like it's one of those necessary things I have to do
1109000	1111000	It's so full of garbage right now
1111000	1112000	It is so full of garbage
1112000	1116000	But it sucks because I feel that honestly, if I didn't check Facebook
1116000	1122000	I would not know that like some of my friends are expecting kids or getting married or things like that
1122000	1124000	Like I would miss that if I did not have Facebook now
1124000	1127000	Exactly, and I didn't check that and then when I had to help them move
1127000	1130000	I was like, oh, you're having a baby, okay
1130000	1131000	Yeah, right
1131000	1135000	I mean, I even find out about family stuff from Facebook sometimes
1135000	1139000	Like, you know, it's, people use it, but that's all they use
1139000	1141000	But the problem with Facebook is that it's not chronological
1141000	1143000	You can miss things, you know
1143000	1144000	Exactly
1144000	1145000	Even if you're reading the site
1145000	1148000	You have to have, he can sort it with the top stories
1148000	1149000	Or he can do chronological
1149000	1151000	Chronological is default
1151000	1154000	And then Facebook's like, fuck you, we want ad revenue
1154000	1156000	We're gonna fuck that sorting shit all up
1156000	1158000	And it's just gonna shuffle everything
1158000	1160000	And, yeah
1160000	1161000	Yeah, it's rough, it's rough
1161000	1164000	And thank you Alex P. Carson in chat says
1164000	1166000	OMG, I love Rob on Facebook
1166000	1169000	Well, I don't post, like, I wouldn't dare post
1169000	1172000	I don't know, I feel like maybe I have gotten political
1172000	1174000	political stuff is, like, gay rights stuff
1174000	1178000	Which, you know, you're not gonna dare speak up on my Facebook
1178000	1180000	anti that stuff, right?
1180000	1184000	But I think I've tried very hard not to dip my toe into the whole
1184000	1186000	like, presidential race
1186000	1188000	Because, like, I just, I fucking can't
1188000	1190000	Like, there's enough of it everywhere else on Facebook
1190000	1193000	So instead, I like to post things like
1193000	1195000	I think just this past week
1195000	1199000	It was announced that ABBA is doing something in 2017
1200000	1202000	They're not reuniting, but they might be
1202000	1205000	And yes, OMG, I can fucking tie ABBA to gaming this week
1205000	1208000	This is the best week ever since SingStar ABBA came out
1208000	1209000	Oh, that's been out for a while
1209000	1210000	I know, right?
1210000	1212000	But when has ABBA been in games?
1212000	1215000	And so, ok, but this week they announced that ABBA's gonna be doing something
1215000	1219000	And it sounds like it might be a VR type of experience
1219000	1221000	Or it could be, it may be AR
1221000	1224000	And, like, part of, like, they obviously aren't releasing a lot of details
1224000	1226000	And they're not going to till next year
1226000	1230000	But one of the things that crossed my mind was this whole hologram thing
1230000	1234000	Like, remember when Tupac was at Coachella a couple years ago?
1234000	1235000	Remember that?
1235000	1238000	Or if Jamie was here, I'm sure she would talk about gorillas when they play live
1238000	1240000	Or Hatsune Miku
1240000	1243000	You people, I'm sure you know Hatsune Miku
1243000	1246000	Oh man, that VR demo was terrible
1246000	1248000	I like the game
1248000	1249000	I like the game
1249000	1253000	But the concept of the concert is so interesting to me
1253000	1258000	It's not bad, just interesting because it's, I don't want to say it's all fake
1258000	1259000	But it kind of is
1259000	1261000	Like, I guess the music is played live by musicians
1261000	1263000	But all these projections are fake
1263000	1265000	It's so interesting to me
1265000	1267000	So I don't know if that's the type of thing that ABBA's doing
1267000	1270000	But they could be leveraging gaming technology
1270000	1271000	Like a VR headset
1271000	1274000	To bring ABBA current
1274000	1278000	Which would be awesome because the greatest music ever made
1278000	1281000	I mean, as long as they're making new music, I'll be happy
1282000	1283000	They're in their 70s
1283000	1285000	Those girls' voices, Agnetha and Anthea
1285000	1287000	Cher is that old and she's making new music
1287000	1289000	Yeah, I think it always auto-tune the show
1289000	1291000	So when are we going to embrace Vocaloid Tupac?
1291000	1293000	I don't know
1293000	1295000	Why would we do that when he's not dead?
1297000	1298000	Maybe with Prince
1298000	1300000	Because Prince has all this unreleased music
1300000	1302000	So eventually whenever they wiggle out the licenses
1302000	1304000	Or David Bowie
1304000	1306000	Those are two artists right there
1306000	1308000	This year has fucking sucked
1308000	1310000	There's been so many people that have passed
1310000	1312000	And those obviously are two all-time greats
1312000	1314000	But also the thing that those two have in common
1314000	1316000	Is that they were always in tune
1316000	1318000	With technological advances and things like that
1318000	1320000	Like both of them were
1320000	1322000	Like what David Bowie had a game
1322000	1324000	Prince had, when he was in his symbol
1324000	1326000	The love symbol phase
1326000	1330000	He had some type of interactive CD-ROM
1330000	1332000	Live journal page
1332000	1334000	Actually, if I'm not mistaken
1334000	1337000	Didn't Prince have the largest internet presence
1337000	1339000	Like in the 90s when the internet was first growing
1339000	1341000	Like the largest fandom was Prince
1341000	1343000	I feel like I read that somewhere
1343000	1345000	But anyway, doesn't matter
1345000	1347000	My point is that
1347000	1349000	You're right, that same type of technology
1349000	1351000	I mean we're having a laugh about Tupac
1351000	1353000	And Coachella and all this stuff
1353000	1355000	But that same type of technology
1355000	1357000	I could totally see like a Bowie or a Prince type experience
1357000	1359000	Especially if they're opening
1359000	1361000	Paisley Park
1361000	1363000	To tourists now
1363000	1365000	Like imagine if you could actually see
1365000	1367000	Prince playing on a
1367000	1369000	I don't know how big that place is
1369000	1371000	If it had a stage or anything like that
1371000	1373000	But imagine if you could go in a room and see Prince
1373000	1375000	Working or something
1375000	1377000	Crazy technology
1377000	1379000	It's very crazy
1379000	1381000	Let's see, Dungeon Buster in Chat says
1381000	1383000	Bowie was an Omicron
1383000	1385000	One of Quantic Dream's earliest games
1385000	1387000	Right, absolutely
1387000	1389000	Vidpower at live.vognetwork.com says
1389000	1391000	I remember that Letterman Hatsune performance
1391000	1393000	Sad that Letterman was so confused
1393000	1395000	I can imagine, I mean
1395000	1397000	Also, wasn't that the point where Letterman kind of had
1397000	1399000	One foot out the door, like he knew his end date
1399000	1401000	And he knew Colbert was coming into play
1401000	1403000	So he was kind of like, over it
1403000	1405000	He was phoning it in that last year
1405000	1407000	Let's see, Rageinator says
1407000	1409000	Abba, greatest music ever, Skye, surely you jest
1409000	1411000	Metallica
1411000	1413000	Can you imagine like
1413000	1415000	Queen?
1415000	1417000	There's also a SingStar Queen diss
1417000	1419000	There is a SingStar Queen diss, now okay
1419000	1421000	If you're talking about Queen versus Abba
1421000	1423000	Okay, now we're having a contest
1423000	1425000	You know, like, fucking Hologram
1425000	1427000	Freddie Mercury, I mean that'd be fucking amazing
1427000	1429000	Hologram Michael Jackson, I mean if we're gonna
1429000	1431000	Exactly, let's just do it all
1431000	1433000	But Rageinator says Metallica and Stone Temple
1433000	1435000	Pilots greater than Abba, first of all
1435000	1437000	Look
1437000	1439000	First of all, everybody has different tastes
1439000	1441000	I could agree with the Stone Temple Pilots one
1441000	1443000	But I want to point this out
1443000	1445000	I was at Blizzcon a couple years ago
1445000	1447000	Metallica was the headliner
1447000	1449000	So like, we could have got like, seats
1449000	1451000	Or, well, nobody sits in a Metallica concert
1451000	1453000	But we could have been right there, like in the front
1453000	1455000	Mashing with everybody
1455000	1457000	We chose to go to the bar instead
1457000	1459000	So, I'm sorry
1459000	1461000	Cause that probably really angers you to hear that
1461000	1463000	But I would fully expect that if the
1463000	1465000	The roles were reversed
1465000	1467000	And it was an Abba concert, you'd be telling me the same thing
1467000	1469000	You'd be like, you know what Rob, I went to the bar instead
1469000	1471000	And, you know, that's fine
1471000	1473000	Cause everybody's into what they're into
1473000	1475000	So, and Tigerclaw says they are
1475000	1477000	Different styles of music, that's very true
1477000	1479000	That's very, very true
1479000	1481000	Alright, anyhow
1481000	1483000	Okay, so JD, one question I always ask
1483000	1485000	Of guests, and after this we'll move on and talk about
1485000	1487000	Our gaming weeks, but one question I always ask
1487000	1489000	Of guests is
1489000	1491000	What is your favorite
1491000	1493000	Video game of all time
1493000	1495000	You can only pick one
1495000	1497000	All the others will be killed
1497000	1499000	Just kidding, no, you can only pick one
1499000	1501000	What is your favorite video game of
1501000	1503000	All time
1503000	1505000	Not that I'm putting them on the spot or anything
1505000	1507000	Favorite video game
1507000	1509000	Favorite video game, that's what we talk about here
1509000	1511000	At OLRP Games
1511000	1513000	If we're just going
1513000	1515000	Based on replayability
1515000	1517000	And that, I mean
1517000	1519000	P-Cross can keep me fascinated for hours
1519000	1521000	Okay, good choice
1521000	1523000	And there's so many varieties of P-Cross as well
1523000	1525000	I like the ones where you draw a picture a lot
1525000	1527000	Better than the ones that are just, you know
1527000	1529000	Use the logic and complete the grid
1529000	1531000	Because I like making pretty pictures
1531000	1533000	Of course, who doesn't?
1533000	1535000	People out there are weird
1536000	1538000	Yeah, it does, I mean even Nintendo
1538000	1540000	Even made Mario P-Cross early on
1540000	1542000	Wasn't it like a Game Boy game or something?
1542000	1544000	And they also
1544000	1546000	Recently, yeah, they recently
1546000	1548000	Had a Zelda P-Cross
1548000	1550000	As a, you could get it with Miitomo points
1550000	1552000	That was my first exposure to P-Cross
1552000	1554000	Because I was playing Miitomo pretty hard
1554000	1556000	Those first couple months, I finally fell off
1556000	1558000	But you're still playing Miitomo, right?
1558000	1560000	Occasionally
1560000	1562000	Well, so my sister
1562000	1564000	Got a new iPhone and now she has
1564000	1566000	The memory for apps
1566000	1568000	So she's started Miitomo
1568000	1570000	And I've kind of picked it up again
1570000	1572000	Partly to comment and like her answers
1572000	1574000	To give her coins, because I know how important that is
1574000	1576000	When you're getting started
1576000	1578000	But also it's a good way for us to keep in touch
1578000	1580000	Because she's still in Orlando
1580000	1582000	And, you know, we don't talk as much as I'd like to
1582000	1584000	So that's one way for us to keep it
1584000	1586000	That's kind of interesting that of all things it's Miitomo
1586000	1588000	But, you know
1588000	1590000	Well, it's not just Miitomo, it's Twitter, it's texting
1590000	1592000	It's a lot of things
1592000	1594000	I think a lot of people have a story like this
1594000	1596000	Like when Alan and I were first dating
1596000	1598000	And Alan was living in San Francisco and I was here
1598000	1600000	Playing World of Warcraft together was a way
1600000	1602000	We could quote-unquote hang out
1602000	1604000	Even though we weren't necessarily hanging out
1604000	1606000	You know what I mean?
1606000	1608000	MMOs and video games lend itself very well
1608000	1610000	In that space to help bridge those distances
1610000	1612000	Definitely
1612000	1614000	And I mean, I would get her playing Guild Wars
1614000	1616000	If I didn't want her to have
1616000	1618000	You know, I want her to do well in school
1618000	1620000	Oh, you play Guild Wars?
1621000	1623000	I mean, I played the original Guild Wars
1623000	1625000	Starting in like 2006
1625000	1627000	And when the new one came out
1627000	1629000	All of my friends in my guild moved over as well
1629000	1631000	That's cool
1631000	1633000	I have Guild Wars 2, I don't have the expansion
1633000	1635000	I have the original Guild Wars 2, but I didn't play it very long
1635000	1637000	It came out at a weird time
1637000	1639000	I feel like there was a lot of stuff coming out all at once
1639000	1641000	My computer at the time was struggling with it
1641000	1643000	Really?
1643000	1645000	Yeah, I need to go back and play it now
1645000	1647000	Because I got a souped up computer a couple years ago
1647000	1649000	That can play whatever
1649000	1651000	So yeah, I should go back and do
1651000	1653000	Guild Wars 2 at some point
1653000	1655000	It'd be fun
1655000	1657000	You can be on any server
1657000	1659000	You're not limited
1659000	1661000	It's limited by region
1661000	1663000	If you're in North America, you can only play with North American servers
1663000	1665000	If you're in EU, you can only play with EU people
1665000	1667000	That's not that bad
1667000	1669000	But that's the only restriction
1669000	1671000	There is one game mode called World v World
1671000	1673000	Which is
1673000	1675000	It's a pretty unique mechanic
1675000	1677000	Where it's like sieging and stuff
1677000	1679000	So your one server
1679000	1681000	Is fighting a one-on-one-on-one battle
1681000	1683000	So there are three different servers at a time
1683000	1685000	I remember playing one of those
1685000	1687000	It's like 60 people in there at once
1687000	1689000	I think the map cap is something like 200
1689000	1691000	Oh my god, yeah, I remember playing that
1691000	1693000	All these people, it was PVP on a massive scale
1693000	1695000	Right, so it's PVP
1695000	1697000	But there's a big environmental component to it
1697000	1699000	Because you're wearing down forts and such
1699000	1701000	Yes
1701000	1703000	It's not just go kill each other
1703000	1705000	It's break down the walls
1705000	1707000	There's catapults and rams and things like that
1707000	1709000	That's the only place where
1709000	1711000	Server actually makes a difference
1711000	1713000	Because if you're on one server and your friend's on another
1713000	1715000	You can't play together
1715000	1717000	There's no guessing for that
1717000	1719000	And wasn't that something where
1719000	1721000	You would level sync too
1721000	1723000	Even if you're level 5
1723000	1725000	You get bumped up to max level
1725000	1727000	So everybody can compete on equal ground
1727000	1729000	Max level is 80
1729000	1731000	And all of the competitive modes
1731000	1733000	World v World and standard PVP
1733000	1735000	Which is 5 on 5
1735000	1737000	All of those are at max level
1737000	1739000	So you don't have to worry about
1739000	1741000	Oh I'm underleveled for this match
1741000	1743000	That's not a concern for the most part
1743000	1745000	That's cool
1745000	1747000	There's also no monthly fee
1747000	1749000	Which makes it a good game for
1749000	1751000	Oh I have a copy of this but I don't have to subscribe to it
1751000	1753000	I can just pick it up and play it however much I want
1753000	1755000	And then leave it with no cost
1755000	1757000	I know that that's made Guild Wars
1757000	1759000	Attractive to a lot of people as the model
1759000	1761000	And in fact the base game
1761000	1763000	Has gone free to play in the past year
1763000	1765000	When they released the new expansion
1765000	1767000	Gotcha
1767000	1769000	In fact I think Loki kind of wishes
1769000	1771000	Square Enix would pay attention to how well that model
1771000	1773000	Has worked for Guild Wars
1773000	1775000	And adopt it with things such as Final Fantasy 11
1775000	1777000	They're never going to do it with 11 because they have 14
1777000	1779000	14 makes them too much money but
1779000	1781000	Yeah it would be nice
1781000	1783000	Probably should check out
1783000	1785000	Elder Scrolls Online because they went
1785000	1787000	See I really didn't like Elder Scrolls Online
1787000	1789000	I didn't either
1789000	1791000	I just couldn't get into it
1791000	1793000	I couldn't get into it either
1793000	1795000	That was the disappointing part because I really liked
1795000	1797000	Elder Scrolls Skyrim
1797000	1799000	And Oblivion but
1799000	1801000	Online just not
1801000	1803000	Not feeling it
1803000	1805000	I understand
1805000	1807000	Yeah so that whole conversation from
1807000	1809000	P-Cross your favorite game
1809000	1811000	Which if you haven't
1811000	1813000	Spent your Nintendo points
1813000	1815000	Which people are probably collecting by signing
1815000	1817000	Into the eShop every week and stuff
1817000	1819000	If you are check out that
1819000	1821000	Zelda P-Cross you can get a free one
1821000	1823000	And that will kind of introduce you to what those puzzles are
1823000	1825000	If nothing else
1825000	1827000	That was my gateway drug
1827000	1829000	And I believe our pal
1829000	1831000	Bobby Blackwolf is really into those P-Cross games too
1831000	1833000	Because I know he says they're
1833000	1835000	Kind of cheap they're only like 3 or 4 bucks
1835000	1837000	A pop right?
1837000	1839000	I think he buys them when they come out
1839000	1841000	I play them on my phone and there's any number of apps
1841000	1843000	On the Google store
1843000	1845000	I think of P-Cross
1845000	1847000	Think of P-Cross as synonymous
1847000	1849000	With Nintendo
1849000	1851000	Which is interesting because P-Cross has
1851000	1853000	As like a picture crossword which is what it comes from
1853000	1855000	Has been around since pen and paper
1855000	1857000	Like you can you know before it was
1857000	1859000	A video game it was just a puzzle
1859000	1861000	So now I'm going to go
1861000	1863000	Download 5,000 P-Cross apps on my phone
1863000	1865000	Later and I'm going to have you to blame
1865000	1867000	I'd give you Rex but you're on iPhone
1867000	1869000	But have you downloaded PolitiCats yet?
1869000	1871000	I did not download PolitiCats
1871000	1873000	I haven't either
1873000	1875000	But we probably should do that first
1875000	1877000	No I guess we'll talk about our gaming
1877000	1879000	And get sucked into yet another clicker game
1879000	1881000	I know that's kind of my hesitation
1881000	1883000	I don't need another clicker game
1883000	1885000	I've finally gotten free though from
1885000	1887000	Nonstop Night I've lost interest in it
1887000	1889000	Yeah I kind of fell off that too
1889000	1891000	So maybe it's time to go
1891000	1893000	Time to get into some PolitiCats
1893000	1895000	Brad will be very happy
1895000	1897000	Pod Culture is back this week
1897000	1899000	After a long break
1899000	1901000	So make Brad happy this week
1901000	1903000	Get some PolitiCats action going on
1903000	1905000	Alright well let's talk about
1905000	1907000	The games we have been playing this week
1907000	1909000	Actually
1909000	1911000	Yeah in a segment we call the
1911000	1913000	How was your gaming week?
1913000	1915000	I'm losing it guys
1915000	1917000	Okay look just disclaimer
1917000	1919000	And I warned you this would happen last week
1919000	1921000	I was up until 3am last night because we had a rocky show
1921000	1923000	Which JD was in town to see
1923000	1925000	I hope you had a good time
1925000	1927000	I highly recommend it
1927000	1929000	And you kind of got to see the other side of Rob Roberts
1929000	1931000	The Beautifully Unique Sparkle Pony side
1931000	1933000	That's right the Beautifully Unique Sparkle Pony side of me
1933000	1935000	Hosting that show
1935000	1937000	And my voice today
1937000	1939000	Is kind of shot and I'm just like my energy
1939000	1941000	Is like drained
1941000	1943000	From last night so
1943000	1945000	If I'm like out of it tonight admittedly
1945000	1947000	Yes I am
1947000	1949000	Because we talked about that whole Halloween on Friday
1949000	1951000	Halloween on Saturday
1951000	1953000	So I am a little drained this week
1953000	1955000	So let's talk a little bit about how was your gaming week
1955000	1957000	What types of video games have you been playing this week
1957000	1959000	Well thankfully I've actually played quite a bit this week
1959000	1961000	So I was playing
1961000	1963000	I didn't get to play a whole ton of
1963000	1965000	PlayStation VR but I did play
1965000	1967000	A ton of it this weekend
1967000	1969000	Just basically the get ready for
1969000	1971000	The party that was on Saturday
1971000	1973000	So I played through Rush of Blood
1973000	1975000	Previously I played through like the third level
1975000	1977000	And then I just finished it
1977000	1979000	This week so
1979000	1981000	That was fun I really do enjoy that game
1981000	1983000	It's probably my favorite game on
1983000	1985000	PlayStation VR so far
1986000	1988000	Along with that I did play some of the other demos
1988000	1990000	On there I got to see the
1990000	1992000	Kitchen demo being played which
1992000	1994000	Is alright I think it was pretty cool
1994000	1996000	Probably would have been a little bit more scary
1996000	1998000	Actually wearing the headset for that
1998000	2000000	I did pick up
2000000	2002000	Rez so I'll probably be playing some of that this week
2002000	2004000	But I haven't actually played any of it yet
2004000	2006000	I tried Thumper
2006000	2008000	Which I thought was pretty cool
2008000	2010000	So that might be one I pick up later on
2010000	2012000	It was pretty difficult
2012000	2014000	So I don't know we'll see
2014000	2016000	And then
2016000	2018000	I don't know I've been browsing the store a lot
2018000	2020000	Because I've been like at my work
2020000	2022000	They do these kind of
2022000	2024000	Incentive things where like someone will give you
2024000	2026000	An award for doing something that you're
2026000	2028000	Normally not supposed to be in charge of
2028000	2030000	And kind of you know discretionary
2030000	2032000	Efforts and so they'll give you like a certificate
2032000	2034000	And then this
2034000	2036000	They call it a Tango card which is basically
2036000	2038000	This universal gift card that you go on a website
2038000	2040000	And redeem for something so I've been using it
2040000	2042000	For PlayStation money
2042000	2044000	So I've
2044000	2046000	Been getting games with that
2046000	2048000	And so
2048000	2050000	I've been kind of browsing the store figuring out what I want to buy next
2050000	2052000	Because
2052000	2054000	There's not a whole lot of the new stuff
2054000	2056000	Coming out that really interests me
2056000	2058000	I thought about doing
2058000	2060000	I think it was called
2060000	2062000	Windlands or something like that
2062000	2064000	It's some like parkour
2064000	2066000	Grappling hook exploration
2066000	2068000	Game but I hear it's kind of boring
2068000	2070000	And I mean it looks neat
2070000	2072000	It's just kind of
2072000	2074000	Running low on content
2074000	2076000	Oh I did try Battlezone that was the other one
2076000	2078000	That I played the demo for and that was pretty cool
2078000	2080000	Once again though 60 bucks for that
2080000	2082000	I don't know that's a bit expensive
2082000	2084000	And then
2084000	2086000	I did play some non VR stuff
2086000	2088000	I played more cluster trucks
2088000	2090000	Because I was trying to see if the
2090000	2092000	Free Halloween update was available
2092000	2094000	But I think that's only on PC
2094000	2096000	So I haven't dug into my PC copy yet
2096000	2098000	But I played a little bit more of that
2098000	2100000	Passed some more levels
2100000	2102000	And I got to
2102000	2104000	The future land now
2104000	2106000	Which is incredibly hard
2106000	2108000	Because a lot of them involve jumping down holes
2108000	2110000	To get the things
2110000	2112000	It's frustrating and hard
2112000	2114000	But it's fun
2114000	2116000	That would be an awesome VR game
2116000	2118000	And then Ingress
2118000	2120000	I did try a little bit of Pokemon Go
2120000	2122000	Because of the Halloween update
2122000	2124000	I played it for like 5 minutes
2124000	2126000	And already lost interest
2126000	2128000	I've been loving the Halloween update
2128000	2130000	But again with the Pogo Plus
2130000	2132000	And me just having an interest in general
2132000	2134000	To try to do more walking
2134000	2136000	I just feel like Pokemon Go has been a great motivator for me
2136000	2138000	And I've been loving this Halloween event
2138000	2140000	Because it's not just double candy from catches
2140000	2142000	It's double candy from eggs
2142000	2144000	Double candy from the candy factory
2144000	2146000	It's great
2146000	2148000	I kind of wish it would just be permanent
2148000	2150000	It is nice that they have
2150000	2152000	New Pokemon
2152000	2154000	That's kind of nice to wander around
2154000	2156000	Instead of Rattatas everywhere
2156000	2158000	Now it's Cubones and Meowths
2158000	2160000	I will say that I noticed a spawn difference
2160000	2162000	Here in Sacramento versus San Francisco
2162000	2164000	In San Francisco there were Gasleys
2164000	2166000	All over the place
2166000	2168000	Turn around you see a Gasley
2168000	2170000	And I haven't noticed that out here
2170000	2172000	It's Meowths and Cubones everywhere
2172000	2174000	It's a drought out here
2174000	2176000	It is, it is
2176000	2178000	Anything else for your gaming week Loki?
2178000	2180000	I did play Jackbox Party Pack 3
2180000	2182000	That was something I was introduced to
2182000	2184000	Last night
2184000	2186000	So I got to try out a few of the games in there
2186000	2188000	Trivia Murder Party which is awesome
2188000	2190000	Hosted by Satan from South Park
2190000	2192000	It's funny
2192000	2194000	I think we all played Jackbox Party Pack 3 at this point
2194000	2196000	And that was the game
2196000	2198000	I was looking forward to the most
2198000	2200000	I love it
2200000	2202000	It's a great party game
2202000	2204000	And I think for people that are looking for You Don't Know Jack
2204000	2206000	I think this isn't
2206000	2208000	You Don't Know Jack
2208000	2210000	But the setup is extremely similar
2210000	2212000	I think people that are missing
2212000	2214000	You Don't Know Jack will be into it
2214000	2216000	But I can't stand the announcer voice
2216000	2218000	I can't stand
2218000	2220000	The filtered announcer voice
2220000	2222000	I can't do it
2222000	2224000	When Travis Donovan did DJ Satan
2224000	2226000	On his show
2226000	2228000	I thought it was a better filter
2228000	2230000	It's hard to hear on the TV
2230000	2232000	I thought it was hilarious
2232000	2234000	I don't care for it
2234000	2236000	I know we have folks at Jackbox that listen to the show
2236000	2238000	And you guys are great
2238000	2240000	The Satan thing
2240000	2242000	I couldn't connect with that
2242000	2244000	I had never played a Jackbox game before
2244000	2246000	Prior to that
2246000	2248000	I actually got to try it out
2248000	2250000	My wife actually played two
2250000	2252000	You hadn't played Party Pack 2?
2252000	2254000	No, I hadn't played any of them
2254000	2256000	I thought it was fantastic
2256000	2258000	With the phone thing
2258000	2260000	They should do that with a ton of more games
2260000	2262000	I don't know why no one else is doing it
2262000	2264000	Jackbox games does that
2264000	2266000	I understand they do that with all their games
2266000	2270000	Seriously, this should be something you should be doing with a ton of other games
2270000	2272000	Yeah, using a phone as a controller is a great mechanic
2272000	2274000	And everyone needs to do it
2274000	2276000	Well, to be fair
2276000	2278000	And maybe this is also interesting
2278000	2280000	They were criticized the first year
2280000	2282000	When You Don't Know Jack was in there
2282000	2284000	Because the phone has the delay
2284000	2286000	So when people would buzz in
2286000	2288000	To try to answer on You Don't Know Jack
2288000	2290000	It didn't really work right
2290000	2292000	Yeah, I could see that
2292000	2294000	But they switched it now in Trivia Murder Party
2294000	2296000	Everybody answers the question
2296000	2298000	It's different
2298000	2300000	So I wonder
2300000	2302000	If maybe
2302000	2304000	That was their work around
2304000	2306000	Maybe we're just going to come up with a new trivia game
2306000	2308000	Interesting, I'd be curious
2308000	2310000	Yeah, we played that
2310000	2312000	We also played Quiplash 2
2312000	2314000	Which was fantastic
2314000	2316000	We also played Fake In It
2316000	2318000	But Fake In It honestly was the least favorite
2318000	2320000	I think of the whole group
2320000	2322000	I didn't like it too much
2322000	2324000	There was no real indicator
2324000	2326000	The questions they were asking
2326000	2328000	It didn't seem like it would be that hard
2328000	2330000	To fake anything
2330000	2332000	I don't know
2332000	2334000	It was just kind of dumb
2334000	2336000	We got really bored with it really fast
2336000	2338000	We were like, okay, we're not playing that again
2338000	2340000	Which minigames did you get for it? Was it the pointing one?
2340000	2342000	We had the pointing one
2342000	2344000	We had the numbers on your fingers
2344000	2346000	And then there was
2346000	2348000	Raising your hand or not
2348000	2350000	So there's one of them that you can get
2350000	2352000	It's called texting or something
2352000	2354000	And everybody but one
2354000	2356000	The faker gets a certain question
2356000	2358000	Texted to them
2358000	2360000	And the faker gets a different question
2360000	2362000	And then all of the answers go on the screen
2362000	2364000	And you can see them together
2364000	2366000	Yeah, that was the last one
2366000	2368000	And the spoiler, it was Flaco Jones
2368000	2370000	Flaco Jones had gone to the bathroom
2370000	2372000	And didn't actually answer the question
2372000	2374000	Oh no
2374000	2376000	And so the first round of that were like
2376000	2378000	Oh, well, I don't know who it is
2378000	2380000	And we were like, it's probably Flaco
2380000	2382000	And we just all voted that
2382000	2384000	And sure enough, it was him
2384000	2386000	Because he just didn't answer any of them
2386000	2388000	Oh, I didn't know the game was still going
2388000	2390000	He could have taken his phone into the bathroom
2390000	2392000	With him and played from the potty seat
2392000	2394000	See, that's the other advantage
2394000	2396000	To having your phone as a controller
2396000	2398000	Is that you don't have to take a break
2398000	2400000	Well, and also it's awesome too
2400000	2402000	Just like the Twitch support and stuff
2402000	2404000	I just think it's
2404000	2406000	I know what these games are
2406000	2408000	I didn't know what the appeal was
2408000	2410000	Or how fun they would be
2410000	2412000	And I'm just really surprised
2412000	2414000	How fun it was
2414000	2416000	Yeah, some comments in chat
2416000	2418000	It's an innovative idea and I'm loving it
2418000	2420000	We've had great parties with the Party Pack
2420000	2422000	With friends
2422000	2424000	I don't like using my phone for stuff
2424000	2426000	It should all be on the console or PC you play on
2426000	2428000	Plus, not everyone has smartphones
2428000	2430000	Or Wi-Fi slash Bluetooth
2430000	2432000	You know, I kind of see
2432000	2434000	That perspective, but at the same time
2434000	2436000	I think this is why not every game
2436000	2438000	Uses this in the world
2438000	2440000	But I think, you know, this is Jackbox's niche
2440000	2442000	Right now, and they're doing really well with it
2442000	2444000	It works as a party game
2444000	2446000	Plus, you can use a laptop or an iPad
2446000	2448000	That's true, you could use a laptop
2448000	2450000	All you need, anything with a web browser
2450000	2452000	You don't even have to be in the same room
2452000	2454000	I know some people who play remotely using the room code
2454000	2456000	And the Twitch thing
2456000	2458000	I don't remember if it was the first
2458000	2460000	Party Pack or whatever they had before that
2460000	2462000	Was when they started realizing
2463000	2465000	And we had them on the show for packs 1 and 2
2465000	2467000	And I really should have sent them an invite for part 3
2467000	2469000	But, you know, just
2469000	2471000	Everything else going on
2471000	2473000	But if you guys are out there listening and want to come talk about part 3
2473000	2475000	You can, just shoot me an email
2475000	2477000	But, so with part 1
2477000	2480000	I think they saw the successes on Twitch
2480000	2482000	So I think in part 2, they actually tried to think
2482000	2484000	More about how can we accommodate
2484000	2486000	The Twitch audience, and they were seeing that
2486000	2488000	Now this one feels like
2488000	2490000	All the games can be done over Twitch
2490000	2492000	And there's even thing in the option mode
2492000	2494000	To let the timers be longer
2494000	2496000	To account for the Twitch delay
2496000	2498000	Yeah, it's pretty crazy
2498000	2500000	I was impressed by how much specific
2500000	2502000	Twitch features there were in each of the games
2502000	2504000	I went and looked at the settings
2504000	2506000	Because I'm that kind of a gamer sometimes
2506000	2508000	And I was impressed, everything had settings for it
2508000	2510000	Yeah, so they're kind of refining that
2510000	2512000	Yeah, so maybe
2512000	2514000	When they have the Steam sale or something
2514000	2516000	I'll pick up all three Party Packs
2516000	2518000	Yeah, probably towards
2518000	2520000	Black Friday or something, they'll probably have a super bundle
2520000	2522000	That has a ton of stuff, I'm sure they will
2522000	2524000	But, what was I going to say about part 3?
2524000	2526000	I didn't get to play all of it
2526000	2528000	Because it definitely seems like
2528000	2530000	For a lot of people
2530000	2532000	Party Pack 3 is trivia murder party
2532000	2534000	And other games
2534000	2536000	Everybody goes and plays that one first
2536000	2538000	We didn't do faking it until the end until when people started leaving
2538000	2540000	Because we had 8 people
2540000	2542000	So faking it is only up to 6
2542000	2544000	So we're just like, oh we can't play that right now
2544000	2546000	We're just going to play these two
2546000	2548000	We played trivia murder party twice
2548000	2550000	And I like how the second time you play it the same people
2550000	2552000	It's the siblings
2552000	2554000	So it's the junior
2554000	2556000	And then they even create a part 2
2556000	2558000	With the subtitle
2558000	2560000	Unless you were the survivor the first time
2560000	2562000	Then you don't get the junior
2562000	2564000	Did you play a third game?
2564000	2566000	We didn't play the third one
2566000	2568000	There's an achievement for making a trilogy
2568000	2570000	Yeah, an achievement for making a trilogy
2570000	2572000	And you get part 3, the never ending gory
2572000	2574000	That's awesome
2574000	2576000	I only got to play the trivia murder party
2576000	2578000	And we played Gespionage
2578000	2580000	We played Gespionage quite a bit
2580000	2582000	I was going to say one more trivia murder party
2582000	2584000	Because basically
2584000	2586000	For anyone that's not familiar with it
2586000	2588000	So you answer a trivia question
2588000	2590000	If you get it right
2590000	2592000	You get money, if you get it wrong
2592000	2594000	You have to play a mini game
2594000	2596000	And the mini games, if you fail the mini game you die
2596000	2598000	But the one we played
2598000	2600000	But your ghost can still play
2600000	2602000	So you're not out of the game
2602000	2604000	You can still play
2604000	2606000	But the final round
2606000	2608000	If you're a ghost, you're at a huge disadvantage
2608000	2610000	Well, it depends
2610000	2612000	I've had games where you can
2612000	2614000	Take over someone's body and win
2614000	2616000	So there was one
2616000	2618000	This one, you didn't die
2618000	2620000	But you had to pick a finger that cut off
2620000	2622000	Yes, I hated that one so much
2622000	2624000	I was like
2624000	2626000	What is this? You pick a finger
2626000	2628000	Well, I'll pick this finger
2628000	2630000	And come to find out, there's always four answers
2630000	2632000	And then if you happen to cut off that particular finger
2632000	2634000	You can't answer that question correctly
2634000	2636000	That was brilliant
2636000	2638000	We just spoiled it for everybody
2638000	2640000	The first time I saw it was brilliant
2640000	2642000	You cut off a finger, so like you say, you cut off your first finger
2642000	2644000	Then you can never answer the first answer
2644000	2646000	All you see is a picture of a finger
2646000	2648000	Of a severed finger
2648000	2650000	That was fucking brilliant
2650000	2652000	It reminded me of Heavy Rain
2652000	2654000	It's kind of disturbing
2654000	2656000	It was a fantastic game
2656000	2658000	But then when the answer is that answer
2658000	2660000	You can't guess it
2660000	2662000	So you go right back to the killing room
2662000	2664000	So it's an interesting mechanic because
2664000	2666000	The longer you play, the more likely you are to
2666000	2668000	Have severed fingers and fail out
2668000	2670000	It prevents
2670000	2672000	Indefinite games
2672000	2674000	My favorite one was the one that Shane got
2674000	2676000	That was like the wheel of death
2676000	2678000	The wheel of
2678000	2680000	The wheel of
2680000	2682000	The wheel of
2682000	2684000	Losing
2684000	2686000	It was like these giant
2686000	2688000	Squares for death and the teeniest
2688000	2690000	Little sliver for you live
2690000	2692000	There was one where you had to make the
2692000	2694000	Longest word out of the letters
2694000	2696000	I made a pretty long word
2696000	2698000	I forgot to hit submit
2698000	2700000	Oh my god, that happened to me in the first game
2700000	2702000	I had a sixth game, aw crap
2702000	2704000	It happened to me in the first game, alright
2704000	2706000	We've been talking about Jackbox Party back for ten minutes
2706000	2708000	But it's a lot of fun
2708000	2710000	Anything else for your game of the week?
2710000	2712000	That's it
2712000	2714000	Fair enough, we'll go to our guests next
2714000	2716000	We haven't heard a lot from Shane, how was your game of the week?
2716000	2718000	What have you been playing?
2718000	2720000	Pokemon, oh it was an Octillery by the way
2720000	2722000	I looked at my list
2722000	2724000	I see, so that was the
2724000	2726000	100th Pokemon then
2726000	2728000	100th shiny unique Pokemon
2728000	2730000	And I went to round one this weekend
2730000	2732000	And I played theater rhythm in the arcade
2732000	2734000	And that was really fun
2734000	2736000	How is theater rhythm in the arcade different from the DS?
2736000	2738000	Well you don't use the touch screen to play
2738000	2740000	You have two little buttons to hit
2740000	2742000	And these little rounded
2742000	2744000	Knobs
2744000	2746000	And so if you've played theater rhythm
2746000	2748000	You've got times when you're tapping the screen
2748000	2750000	And times when you're sliding your stylus
2750000	2752000	Across the screen
2752000	2754000	So the knobs act like the stylus part
2754000	2756000	And the buttons act like the tapping part
2756000	2758000	And because there's two
2758000	2760000	Knobs, sometimes you have to
2760000	2762000	Do both in the same direction, opposite directions
2762000	2764000	It's really interesting
2764000	2766000	It's pretty fun, I wish I had more songs
2766000	2768000	But you can unlock them, I don't know how still
2768000	2770000	But I unlocked one song so I was happy with that
2770000	2772000	And I want to play it again
2772000	2774000	Because it was good
2774000	2776000	The end of that story
2776000	2778000	And that's all I've been playing
2778000	2780000	Because it's all I ever play is Pokemon
2780000	2782000	So at round one you were just playing the usual stuff
2782000	2784000	DDR Ace?
2784000	2786000	No I didn't play any DDR because I was tired
2786000	2788000	Because I had just packed up a whole bunch of stuff
2788000	2790000	And moved it to my new house
2790000	2792000	And so I played
2792000	2794000	Crossbeats a lot
2794000	2796000	Because they had a Halloween event
2796000	2798000	And when you played this specific song
2798000	2800000	And beat it on different difficulties
2800000	2802000	You got new titles
2802000	2804000	For your account
2804000	2806000	So I got the title Trick or Treat
2806000	2808000	And the title Happy Halloween
2808000	2810000	I was happy about that
2810000	2812000	And I changed my avatar to a ghost and a pumpkin
2812000	2814000	Because I also unlocked that
2814000	2816000	And that was cool
2816000	2818000	I'm trying to think if they had anything else
2818000	2820000	Noteworthy and new there
2820000	2822000	But I think theater rhythm was the only thing
2822000	2824000	I saw that was really new
2824000	2826000	Okay that's all
2826000	2828000	Alright
2828000	2830000	No I'm gonna go get food
2830000	2832000	Okay have fun
2832000	2834000	JD how was your gaming week?
2834000	2836000	It was good
2836000	2838000	So like we talked about I played Guild Wars 2
2838000	2840000	I picked up Pokemon Go again
2840000	2842000	Because I actually lost my battery about a month ago
2842000	2844000	So my phone just didn't have battery to play Pokemon Go
2844000	2846000	Because it's a real drainer
2846000	2848000	So I've started on the Halloween event
2848000	2850000	And I like that a bit
2850000	2852000	I've been playing Pokemon Shuffle
2852000	2854000	On my phone which is a puzzle game
2854000	2856000	It's sort of third party-ish
2856000	2858000	I forgot the name of the developer
2858000	2860000	But it's a match 3
2860000	2862000	Pokemon game
2862000	2864000	But it's a more puzzle aspect
2864000	2866000	And they're doing all of their Halloween stuff
2866000	2868000	So lots of ghost Pokemon events
2868000	2870000	I picked up Mini Metro
2870000	2872000	Or I picked that back up
2872000	2874000	I noticed they added a San Francisco map
2874000	2876000	And Mini Metro is a game in which you are developing
2876000	2878000	A subway
2878000	2880000	And it's algorithmically generated
2880000	2882000	So stations will pop up
2882000	2884000	Of different shapes
2884000	2886000	And you try to draw lines that will match them
2886000	2888000	And you're moving passengers around
2888000	2890000	Before they have to wait too long
2890000	2892000	If you have too many unhappy people waiting there
2892000	2894000	Your system will close
2894000	2896000	Because you've caused a meltdown
2896000	2898000	Because they burned the station down
2898000	2900000	They riot
2900000	2902000	Exactly
2902000	2904000	There's a bunch of different world cities
2904000	2906000	Most of them are famous for having subways
2906000	2908000	Like New York and London and Paris
2908000	2910000	And then there's some more exotic ones
2910000	2912000	Like Melbourne, Australia
2912000	2914000	And I think the Auckland one
2914000	2916000	Is this is a future scenario
2916000	2918000	In the hypothetical Auckland Metro
2918000	2920000	If they ever make one
2920000	2922000	But San Francisco was just added
2922000	2924000	And since I live there and I'm a transit geek
2924000	2926000	I was super excited to play that
2926000	2928000	You're basically building your own BART system
2928000	2930000	What is a transit geek?
2930000	2932000	I think Misty
2932000	2934000	Who listens to this show a lot
2934000	2936000	Is also a transit geek
2936000	2938000	She takes trains everywhere across the nation
2939000	2941000	That's definitely part of it
2941000	2943000	I'm also interested in where things go
2943000	2945000	And why and how
2945000	2947000	I get involved in the city planning process
2947000	2949000	Sometimes going to show up
2949000	2951000	At local government stuff
2951000	2953000	It's kind of like
2953000	2955000	You know those government meetings in Parks and Recreation
2955000	2957000	That's basically very accurate
2957000	2959000	Even in San Francisco
2959000	2961000	Shane is going to be sad he missed a Parks and Rec reference
2961000	2963000	That's his favorite show
2963000	2965000	That's what happens when you leave
2965000	2967000	I love it
2967000	2969000	I know this is a video game show
2969000	2971000	But I have to ask
2971000	2973000	The high speed rail in California
2973000	2975000	Oh my god
2975000	2977000	It's going to happen
2977000	2979000	They're already building it
2979000	2981000	But in Fresno, JP
2981000	2983000	They're building it in Fresno
2983000	2985000	To Bakersfield or something
2985000	2987000	These are cities nobody wants to go to
2987000	2989000	There's already a train
2989000	2991000	That goes from Bakersfield to Oakland
2991000	2993000	And it gets a lot of ridership
2993000	2995000	Because people don't necessarily go
2995000	2997000	From one end to the other
2997000	2999000	Don't get me wrong
2999000	3001000	I love the idea of a high speed rail to connect
3001000	3003000	San Francisco, Sacramento and LA
3003000	3005000	And Oakland and the big places in between
3005000	3007000	But you need to start
3007000	3009000	With San Francisco to Sacramento
3009000	3011000	You don't start it in Fresno
3011000	3013000	Well you have to start somewhere
3013000	3015000	To be honest there's less of a fight
3015000	3017000	Politically by starting in the Central Valley
3017000	3019000	Than there would be trying to figure out
3019000	3021000	Which alignment to get to LA
3021000	3023000	Which alignment to get to the Bay Area
3023000	3025000	Or to get up the Central Valley except the farmers
3025000	3027000	Well I mean Hanford has a problem with it
3027000	3029000	But they're the only ones
3029000	3031000	If you compare Hanford raising a fuss
3031000	3033000	To Palo Alto raising a fuss
3033000	3035000	That's why it's starting there
3035000	3037000	You have to start somewhere
3037000	3039000	Get something operational and it'll be harder to kill
3039000	3041000	Alright so gaming
3041000	3043000	So these are the things you have to consider in mini Metro
3043000	3045000	Also on trains I picked up Ticket to Ride
3045000	3047000	They added achievements
3047000	3049000	And new maps and DLC
3049000	3051000	So I played a couple of games
3051000	3053000	I played a Steam version of a board game
3053000	3055000	Because Days of Wonder is really good about
3055000	3057000	Making computerized versions of their games
3057000	3059000	And I mean if you've played board games
3059000	3061000	Some of the biggest hassle with it
3061000	3063000	Is putting all the pieces away
3063000	3065000	And it's nice to have a computer do it for you
3065000	3067000	And keep score
3067000	3069000	That is nice, that is awfully convenient
3069000	3071000	I don't like to clean
3071000	3073000	You know that now that you've seen the house
3073000	3075000	Hey it's not that bad
3075000	3077000	Alright anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
3077000	3079000	I think that's about it
3079000	3081000	I've been playing more Final Fantasy 14
3081000	3083000	Because you all know I love that game
3083000	3085000	So I'm still hitting the ground with that
3085000	3087000	So even though I kind of went off on Fan Fest
3087000	3089000	A couple of weeks ago
3089000	3091000	It really did re-energize my love of that game
3091000	3093000	So I've been playing that a lot
3093000	3095000	But I have been playing other stuff too
3095000	3097000	I randomly, this super random purchase
3097000	3099000	But I saw it on the Playstation store and I was like
3099000	3101000	Okay I want to get that, I got King of Fighters 94
3101000	3103000	So I played that a little bit
3103000	3105000	And I forgot how fucking hard that game is
3105000	3107000	Or at least for me
3107000	3109000	I can get past the first
3109000	3111000	Fight barely
3111000	3113000	But then the second fight I die a lot
3113000	3115000	So it doesn't matter
3115000	3117000	I can use Team Europe
3117000	3119000	I can use Team Korea
3119000	3121000	It doesn't matter I'm going to get my butt kicked
3121000	3123000	So that was a fun Neo Geo throwback
3123000	3125000	And I remember we were talking about that on the show
3125000	3127000	A couple of weeks ago how those games were going to start showing up
3127000	3129000	In that series that I think a lot of people forget
3129000	3131000	Is on Playstation 4
3131000	3133000	Because they don't really promote it heavily
3133000	3135000	But it's there
3135000	3139000	There's some real deep cuts in the library there
3139000	3142000	It was right there when you went to go buy Jackbox
3142000	3144000	So it was at least a little promoted
3144000	3148000	It was but I also knew to go sort new by date
3148000	3150000	So I could find Jackbox
3150000	3152000	Even Jackbox I don't think it had a splash banner
3152000	3155000	Or if it did I totally missed it
3155000	3157000	It's kind of a habit now
3157000	3160000	Like on Tuesdays I just go to the Playstation store
3160000	3162000	And I sort new
3162000	3164000	And I just look at what's new and see if there's anything I want
3164000	3166000	And I do the same thing on Xbox One
3166000	3169000	I don't think the store is as well laid out on Xbox One
3169000	3171000	But I will boot up the Xbox One every Thursday
3171000	3173000	To see what's backwards compatible this week
3173000	3175000	What just showed up in my library
3175000	3177000	For the backwards compatibility
3177000	3179000	And I've been getting a lot of surprises there
3179000	3181000	So that's cool
3181000	3183000	So yeah I played a little King of Fighters 94
3183000	3185000	So that was cool that that showed up
3185000	3188000	But I've also been playing a lot of Dragon Quest Builders
3188000	3191000	Now I mentioned that I picked up this game
3191000	3193000	While I was out in Vegas
3193000	3195000	I never got around to playing it last week
3195000	3198000	But I finally sat down and spent some quality time with it this week
3198000	3200000	And I really do like that game
3200000	3202000	I mean I know a lot of people are writing it off
3202000	3204000	It's like a Minecraft clone
3204000	3206000	But it doesn't, like when you were watching me play it
3206000	3208000	Does it, I mean I should say
3208000	3210000	Does it look like Minecraft? Yes
3210000	3212000	The graphics look like Minecraft
3212000	3214000	But did the interface and the UI look like Minecraft? No
3214000	3216000	I actually haven't played Minecraft so I can't give that comparison
3216000	3218000	It's not Minecraft
3218000	3220000	It honestly
3220000	3222000	To me feels like
3222000	3224000	More like a classic JRPG
3224000	3226000	But it's just that
3226000	3228000	It's in this world
3228000	3230000	That you can break bricks
3230000	3232000	And that's how you find things
3232000	3234000	But it's got like the very rudimentary crafting system
3234000	3236000	That you would saw in a lot of early JRPGs
3236000	3238000	So it's just kind of like honestly
3238000	3241000	It's honestly like a Super Nintendo style
3241000	3243000	Dragon Quest game
3243000	3245000	But I don't even know if I can call it that
3245000	3247000	Because then you would expect the fights
3247000	3249000	But the fights are more like Zelda
3249000	3251000	Like you can charge your sword and do the spins
3251000	3253000	And all that, it's more actiony
3253000	3255000	It's not like the classic battles
3255000	3257000	It definitely looks like there was a collection aspect to the game also
3257000	3259000	So like 3D.Dragon
3259000	3261000	Actually
3261000	3263000	Actually that's not a bad comparison at all
3263000	3265000	I would say this game has a lot more in common
3265000	3267000	With 3D
3267000	3269000	3D.Action Heroes
3269000	3271000	3D.Game Heroes
3271000	3273000	That game on PS3, you all know which one
3273000	3275000	But with a destructive environment
3275000	3277000	That's the big difference there
3277000	3279000	And that 3D
3279000	3281000	3D.Action Hero
3281000	3283000	That was a straight up Zelda rip off
3283000	3285000	No but I say that in the best possible way
3285000	3287000	I mean if you're going to rip Zelda off
3287000	3289000	Do it good
3289000	3291000	And that game did a very good job of doing it
3291000	3293000	And kind of bringing a Zelda-esque game to the Playstation
3293000	3295000	And I say Dragon Quest Heroes
3295000	3297000	Kind of continues that a little bit
3297000	3299000	I'm really into it
3299000	3301000	I think it's really fun
3301000	3303000	I hear there's only like 4 chapters in the game
3303000	3305000	But I've been playing for like 10 hours
3305000	3307000	And I'm still on the first chapter
3307000	3309000	Like there are long chapters
3309000	3311000	So what exactly do you do in that?
3311000	3313000	Do you build up your town?
3313000	3315000	So you start in a little hole in the ground
3315000	3317000	And you work your way out
3317000	3319000	And you find this town
3319000	3321000	And there's voices that are talking to you
3321000	3323000	Like this world once thrived
3323000	3325000	And then the Dark Lord came
3325000	3327000	The Shadow Lord came and took it all down
3327000	3329000	Like every generic JRPG trope
3329000	3331000	But then you start
3331000	3333000	The girl will be like
3333000	3335000	If only we could patch the house back together
3335000	3337000	So and it's very obvious
3337000	3339000	Like where you put the bricks
3339000	3341000	So you learn that if you put your bricks
3341000	3343000	Like too high
3343000	3345000	And if your room has a bed and a light
3345000	3347000	That'll become a bedroom
3347000	3349000	And that will get your town points
3349000	3351000	Because you have a bedroom
3351000	3353000	And so basically you start to learn that if you
3353000	3355000	Craft such and such things
3355000	3357000	You'll increase the points of your town
3357000	3359000	Or you have to craft food to keep yourself alive
3359000	3361000	You craft weapons and shields to fight the enemies
3361000	3363000	Or you craft bigger and better things
3363000	3365000	For your town basically
3365000	3367000	And then the townspeople will start
3367000	3369000	Making requests
3369000	3371000	It'll be like hey we need to have a forge
3371000	3373000	So we can make more stuff or whatever
3373000	3375000	So you make this
3375000	3377000	But then some of the requests
3377000	3379000	It's not always about buildings
3379000	3381000	Sometimes the request is
3381000	3383000	You need to go into this pyramid
3383000	3385000	That's way out there through the teleporter
3385000	3387000	And you need to go into this pyramid
3387000	3389000	And you need to steal the two idols that are in the pyramid
3389000	3391000	This is a quest that I just did
3391000	3393000	For one to dislodge the idols
3393000	3395000	You have to have the highest weapon
3395000	3397000	So you build the weapon
3397000	3399000	Then you go to the pyramids
3399000	3401000	And you find your way through the pyramids
3401000	3403000	Where the walls are not destructible
3403000	3405000	And then you find the idols
3405000	3407000	And you tear them down with a hammer
3407000	3409000	But then when you do that all the people that are praying to the idols
3409000	3411000	Turn into the magician dudes from Dragon Quest
3411000	3413000	So you have to run the fuck out of there
3413000	3415000	So it's not only building quests
3415000	3417000	It's the typical type of fetch quest
3417000	3419000	You would see in RPGs and things like that
3419000	3421000	It's like all that mixed together
3421000	3423000	And I think that's kind of why I enjoy it
3423000	3425000	It's a little bit of Minecraft and a little bit of
3425000	3427000	Zelda and a little bit of Dragon Quest
3427000	3429000	Kind of like all together
3429000	3431000	But I can say all that and how much I like this
3431000	3433000	But I think there's some people out there that won't be able to
3433000	3435000	They were not going to be able to stand it
3435000	3437000	They're going to play this for five minutes and go
3437000	3439000	This is dumb
3439000	3441000	But there's a demo out there
3441000	3443000	And unlike some other games
3443000	3445000	Like World of Final Fantasy and Inokuni
3445000	3447000	I think the demo for Dragon Quest Builders
3447000	3449000	Is really good
3449000	3451000	The demo for Dragon Quest Builders is like the first
3451000	3453000	Five quests of the game
3453000	3455000	All strung together
3455000	3457000	You get to play it up to the point you get your first teleportal
3457000	3459000	And then when you try to go through the teleportal
3459000	3461000	It says, sorry but this area is closed
3461000	3463000	In the demo, hope you enjoyed playing
3463000	3465000	And you can't progress any further in the story
3465000	3467000	Because you can't go through the portal
3467000	3469000	So it's a decent demo
3469000	3471000	So if you think this might be up your alley
3471000	3473000	Just download the demo
3473000	3475000	I think this is a safe one to judge the game off of
3475000	3477000	So there you go
3477000	3479000	Let's see, going to the chat
3479000	3481000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
3481000	3483000	Let's see
3483000	3485000	Dungeon Buster says
3485000	3487000	I really like the Japanese demo for Dragon Quest Builders
3487000	3489000	Just need to pick it up at one point
3489000	3491000	There you go
3491000	3493000	Some folks in the chat room talking about King of Fighters
3493000	3495000	I guess talking about King of Fighters 2014
3495000	3497000	Rageinator says, there's a King of Fighters 14
3497000	3499000	I thought the 13 was the newest one
3499000	3501000	And Dark Tetsuya says, no 14 came out a little while ago
3501000	3503000	So yeah
3503000	3505000	Vidpower says
3505000	3507000	King of Fighters 98 was the centerpiece of our arcade
3507000	3509000	It was the game everyone gathered around
3509000	3511000	Good times
3511000	3513000	You know, I guess I'm more of a classic person
3513000	3515000	Because my favorite to this day is still
3515000	3517000	Fatal Fury Special
3517000	3519000	Which is on Xbox 360
3519000	3521000	And I don't know if it's on the backwards compatibility yet
3521000	3523000	I don't remember
3523000	3525000	But that was the last time I remember that game was playable
3525000	3527000	I hope they bump that one up
3527000	3529000	For the Playstation 4 archives
3529000	3531000	And so forth
3531000	3533000	I just like the classic one a little bit more
3533000	3535000	I think too
3535000	3537000	Anyway
3537000	3539000	Alright that's it for our gaming week
3539000	3541000	So we're going to get into some news
3541000	3543000	But quickly I just want to mention some housekeeping
3543000	3545000	We will not be here live on Sunday November 13th
3545000	3547000	There will be a show that week
3547000	3549000	There should be a taped show
3549000	3551000	It looks like we're going to tape
3551000	3553000	Hopefully if it works with Loki schedule on Wednesday of that week
3553000	3555000	And we'll have something new
3555000	3557000	At 6 o'clock on Sunday
3557000	3559000	But we will not actually be here live
3559000	3561000	To interact with
3561000	3563000	Just so you know I'm going to Chicago
3563000	3565000	So I won't be here
3565000	3567000	But otherwise we'll be here next week
3567000	3569000	And then on November 20th
3569000	3571000	Episode 666 of our show
3571000	3575000	Which I don't think we're doing anything particularly special for it
3575000	3577000	It's just everybody keeps making this big thing about
3577000	3581000	Oh my god you guys are going to get to episode 666
3581000	3583000	And to be fair
3583000	3585000	A lot of shows don't get to episode 666
3585000	3587000	Some do
3587000	3589000	If you're more than once a week
3589000	3591000	Like Critical Myth
3591000	3593000	They're on 700 something
3593000	3595000	But they do three shows a week
3595000	3597000	So they can get the numbers faster
3597000	3599000	I don't know if there's a lot of weekly shows out there
3599000	3601000	That have hit episode 666
3601000	3603000	So I think we're heading into uncharted territory
3603000	3605000	A little bit
3605000	3607000	So we're going to have to set the tone
3607000	3609000	For how shows celebrate episode 666
3609000	3611000	I'm not sure
3611000	3613000	That sounds too ego-y though
3613000	3615000	I don't want to say that either
3615000	3617000	I don't know what's going to work best for us in our audience
3617000	3619000	So be here
3619000	3621000	I want Travis to come on
3621000	3623000	Do DJ Satan
3623000	3625000	I want the Satan voice that I enjoy
3625000	3627000	But my understanding is that he already said no
3627000	3629000	So whatever
3629000	3631000	He wants to retire or whatever it is
3631000	3633000	Alright let's get into some gaming news for now
3633000	3635000	Loki
3635000	3637000	So it's just been a couple weeks
3637000	3639000	Since we heard some news about the Switch
3639000	3641000	And now we've already got more news
3641000	3643000	On when we're going to hear more news on the Switch
3643000	3645000	So the Nintendo Switch presentation
3645000	3647000	2017
3647000	3649000	Is going to be held on January 12
3649000	3651000	It'll be streamed online
3651000	3653000	And with that they're going to announce
3653000	3655000	The console's price, the release date
3655000	3657000	And the lineup of games in development
3657000	3659000	So
3659000	3661000	I don't expect to hear much until then
3661000	3663000	But that's kind of cool that we
3663000	3665000	Have a date
3665000	3667000	That they're not just keeping us hanging
3667000	3669000	Along with that there is
3669000	3671000	Comments regarding the 3DS
3671000	3673000	Because people are thinking
3673000	3675000	Hey the Switch is coming out
3675000	3677000	It's a portable system, it's a console
3677000	3679000	What's going to happen with the 3DS
3679000	3681000	Is this going to be a successor to the 3DS
3681000	3683000	Well apparently the 3DS
3683000	3685000	Is not going to be replaced by the Switch
3685000	3687000	Instead they're going to coexist
3687000	3689000	With each other so
3689000	3691000	And I call bullshit
3691000	3693000	Now
3693000	3695000	Now I will
3695000	3697000	Take this back
3697000	3699000	If in the presentation that we're getting on January 12
3699000	3701000	They mention that the Switch and the 3DS
3701000	3703000	Can like talk to each other or something
3703000	3705000	Or maybe there's some type of environment
3705000	3707000	Created between the two systems
3707000	3709000	Where it would be helpful to own both
3709000	3711000	But otherwise I'm sorry
3711000	3713000	I don't buy this line
3713000	3715000	I think this is to not cannibalize
3715000	3717000	3DS sales but ultimately
3717000	3719000	This isn't really Nintendo's
3719000	3721000	Decision because if all the
3721000	3723000	Third parties stop making games
3723000	3725000	For 3DS and go over to Switch
3725000	3727000	Then guess what the 3DS is not going to be
3727000	3729000	Recorded anymore you might have indies which is cool
3729000	3731000	And some of that but I think even in the
3731000	3733000	In the indies if it's as easy to make
3733000	3735000	A game for the Switch as it is 3DS
3735000	3737000	I think a lot of indies are going to be looking over there
3737000	3739000	It's also going to depend on a lot of factors like
3739000	3741000	Battery life and stuff because if the battery life on the Switch
3741000	3743000	Is abysmal then you know
3743000	3745000	True how portable is it
3745000	3747000	But I just I kind of
3747000	3749000	Like sorry I know a lot of
3749000	3751000	People have been throwing this at me when I say
3751000	3753000	That well so much you know this is the 3DS
3753000	3755000	Is a successor and I view this as a 3DS
3755000	3757000	Or I've been sent a link to this quote
3757000	3759000	I don't know how many times and I'm like
3759000	3761000	Okay but they do this
3761000	3763000	Companies do this like
3763000	3765000	When they came out with a Playstation Vita
3765000	3767000	I'm sure they said something about well the PSP is not really
3767000	3769000	Going away or is still going to support the PSP
3769000	3771000	Like of course companies do that
3771000	3773000	Because they don't want to cannibalize
3773000	3775000	Sales of the existing system
3775000	3777000	Yeah it will replace it
3777000	3779000	But hey
3779000	3781000	You can buy the 3DS for a few months
3781000	3783000	But if for whatever
3783000	3785000	If for whatever reason Nintendo remains
3785000	3787000	Super committed to 3DS and I'm wrong
3787000	3789000	Then I'm wrong that's fine
3789000	3791000	But I would have a hard time believing
3791000	3793000	There's going to be the major tent pole releases
3793000	3795000	To substantiate that
3795000	3797000	And that's not being made
3797000	3799000	For the Switch
3799000	3801000	You know what I mean
3801000	3803000	They could do that it would make much sense
3803000	3805000	But they could do that
3805000	3807000	We'll see I guess
3807000	3809000	Thank you Raman Chat says Microsoft said the same thing
3809000	3811000	About the 360 look what happened
3811000	3813000	MXC said they said it before with how
3813000	3815000	The DS was not going to take over Game Boy Advance
3815000	3817000	Oh I remember that
3817000	3819000	So I'm sorry but this is
3819000	3821000	This is a line you hear all the time
3821000	3823000	I mean Nintendo could also do the Smash 4
3823000	3825000	Treatment where they release it on 3DS and
3825000	3827000	On their console like
3827000	3829000	You know with the Switch
3829000	3831000	Or you know what else would be really awesome
3831000	3833000	Is that what if like the 3DS
3833000	3835000	Can serve as like an
3835000	3837000	Extra controller when the Switch is on
3837000	3839000	The dock or something
3839000	3841000	Maybe there is still something they could do
3841000	3843000	To add the 3DS into that environment
3843000	3845000	But otherwise I just don't believe that
3845000	3847000	There's a place for the 3DS when the Switch comes out
3847000	3849000	You're wrong I'm back
3849000	3851000	Oh please tell please let me know how I'm wrong
3851000	3853000	Because with the example with the
3853000	3855000	Game Boy Advance and the DS
3855000	3857000	The DS played Game Boy Advance
3857000	3859000	Games the Switch does not play
3859000	3861000	Anything as far as
3861000	3863000	Nintendo's confirmed except Switch games
3863000	3865000	So all your 3DS
3865000	3867000	Games they're not coming over to that
3867000	3869000	You can't play them on that so there's still a
3869000	3871000	Part for the 3DS
3871000	3873000	But the developers are going to
3873000	3875000	Abandon it to make games for the Switch
3875000	3877000	Will they? Because I think they will
3877000	3879000	Because this is still going to be a more expensive
3879000	3881000	Platform the 3DS and the
3881000	3883000	2DS and the new 3DS
3883000	3885000	Those are all still more
3885000	3887000	I don't want to say aimed at kids but they're more affordable
3887000	3889000	And so parents can replace these
3889000	3891000	Systems easier for kids
3891000	3893000	Versus a Switch I think
3893000	3895000	I don't think anything is replacing anything until
3895000	3897000	We see how that thing sells in the first place
3897000	3899000	Yeah I'll give you this
3899000	3901000	This whole thing could be to leave
3901000	3903000	The door open a crack for the 3DS
3903000	3905000	In case the Switch
3905000	3907000	Flops which
3907000	3909000	I don't know based on just the buzz
3909000	3911000	It looks good but
3911000	3913000	The buzz for the Switch is already better than it was for the Wii U
3913000	3915000	But I feel like maybe this is to leave the door
3915000	3917000	Open in a jar for the 3DS so that way
3917000	3919000	If the Switch does flop Nintendo can
3919000	3921000	Still kind of fall back on it
3921000	3923000	Yes it's a portable, yes it's a console
3923000	3925000	We need to know what the battery life is on that
3925000	3927000	So it has to at least match the 3DS
3927000	3929000	I feel like if it's even
3929000	3931000	Like if it has any potential
3931000	3933000	To push the 3DS out
3933000	3935000	So also there's a frog
3935000	3937000	Outside I almost hit it with a car
3937000	3939000	It's adorable
3939000	3941000	Don't hit it with a car then
3941000	3943000	Then I was going to go catch it I was like no because I'm about to eat
3943000	3945000	It's not a Pokemon
3945000	3947000	But it's still adorable like a Pokemon
3947000	3949000	Alright
3949000	3951000	So what about the fact that we get no new Switch
3951000	3953000	Information until 2017
3953000	3955000	Expected in my opinion, totally expected
3955000	3957000	Yeah
3957000	3959000	I like that they set the date
3959000	3961000	Yeah I feel even with this presentation
3961000	3963000	That they had
3963000	3965000	It was more of like people keep bothering
3965000	3967000	You know
3967000	3969000	I don't know it's just like
3969000	3971000	I apologize if you said it and I missed it
3971000	3973000	But is this a presentation
3973000	3975000	Like a Nintendo Direct type of thing
3975000	3977000	Yeah it's going to be a live stream
3977000	3979000	So could that mean that it's an E3
3979000	3981000	Style presentation which we haven't seen
3981000	3983000	Like a live
3983000	3985000	Live demo that's what I assume
3985000	3987000	Yeah because that would be a very interesting
3987000	3989000	Shift for Nintendo
3989000	3991000	To go back to the big E3
3991000	3993000	Style conference which you're allowed to do
3993000	3995000	Outside of E3 Sony does their
3995000	3997000	Expo they do game developers
3997000	3999000	Conference Microsoft did their own event
3999000	4001000	For the Xbox One
4001000	4003000	We all remember the famous unveiling of the Xbox
4003000	4005000	One and how well that went
4005000	4007000	So there's no reason why Nintendo can't do
4007000	4009000	Their own live event I'd just be very curious
4009000	4011000	Because we haven't seen Nintendo live in a while
4011000	4013000	So it would be very interesting if they did that
4013000	4015000	We saw them at E3
4015000	4017000	But they didn't know they didn't Nintendo Direct
4017000	4019000	They didn't do an E3 press conference
4019000	4021000	They didn't do a press conference but they did
4021000	4023000	All sorts of live things for E3
4023000	4025000	They did Treehouse you're right
4025000	4027000	Pokemon and all that good stuff
4027000	4029000	I guess
4029000	4031000	I don't associate the Treehouse stuff
4031000	4033000	With the executives
4033000	4035000	But that's a fair point
4035000	4037000	I don't think it's gonna be like
4037000	4039000	Here's Reggie and Miyamoto playing
4039000	4041000	Mario Do you think it's gonna be like an all day
4041000	4043000	Twitch event like all day on January 12th
4043000	4045000	No it'll be some hours
4045000	4047000	But maybe two hours at the most
4047000	4049000	Interesting
4049000	4051000	Let's see going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
4051000	4053000	Dark Tetsuya says yeah maybe
4053000	4055000	This is Nintendo's answer to those other events
4055000	4057000	The companies are doing
4057000	4059000	I just think they have to have the information
4059000	4061000	Out there because I would expect
4061000	4063000	It already out by now
4063000	4065000	Nintendo could easier than anyone
4065000	4067000	Hold their own
4067000	4069000	Expo
4069000	4071000	Convention
4071000	4073000	Nintendo could easier than anyone do it
4073000	4075000	Oh yeah I would go to a Nintendo experience
4075000	4077000	So many people would go
4077000	4079000	Even though Sony experiences in San Francisco I didn't go
4079000	4081000	I would go to Nintendo's
4081000	4083000	It was really good
4083000	4085000	I'm very tempted to go to the one in Anaheim
4085000	4087000	One of my friends is really trying to talk me into going
4087000	4089000	I'm like I am convention out
4089000	4091000	I've got to so many conventions
4091000	4093000	But I would go to the Nintendo one in a heartbeat
4093000	4095000	I think the Nintendo one
4095000	4097000	Would be a ticket mess
4097000	4099000	And maybe that's why Nintendo doesn't want to get involved
4099000	4101000	Because I think it would be
4101000	4103000	It would be faster than
4103000	4105000	PAX selling out tickets
4105000	4107000	I feel like Nintendo gets a lot of really strong
4107000	4109000	Focused brand loyalty in ways that Sony
4109000	4111000	And Microsoft don't get
4111000	4113000	Oh you better believe it for sure
4113000	4115000	Loki you were going to say something before I get to another chat comment
4115000	4117000	Oh no I was just thinking
4117000	4119000	What would the new
4119000	4121000	PlayStation event have
4121000	4123000	What would they be showing up
4123000	4125000	I guess Horizon Zero Dawn
4125000	4127000	It's probably going to be some of the titles from early next year
4127000	4129000	But they do announce a lot of stuff
4129000	4131000	At the PlayStation thing
4131000	4133000	We got the Final Fantasy 7 remake
4133000	4135000	We got the actual gameplay footage
4135000	4137000	Finally for that
4137000	4139000	There was Dumne no Kuni 2 that nobody cares about
4139000	4141000	There was Rez
4141000	4143000	I want to say
4143000	4145000	Was that zombie game there that nobody asked for?
4145000	4147000	Street Fighter 5 came out of
4147000	4149000	The PlayStation expo
4149000	4151000	No
4151000	4153000	Street Fighter 5 was announced
4153000	4155000	I thought that was just the characters
4155000	4157000	No it was a huge deal when they announced it
4157000	4159000	Wait the last one or the one before that?
4159000	4161000	I'm only talking last year
4161000	4163000	I don't know what happened the year before
4163000	4165000	They announced the exclusiveness on Sony
4165000	4167000	And it was a huge deal
4167000	4169000	No man's sky
4169000	4171000	Well it looked better than it was
4171000	4173000	Anyway
4173000	4175000	Let's see
4175000	4177000	It could be the Nintendo Powerfest
4177000	4179000	I love it
4179000	4181000	I missed the Powerfest
4181000	4183000	It was so good
4183000	4185000	Let's see
4185000	4187000	Akuma JP in chat says
4187000	4189000	Here's a thought, we make games for new systems all the time
4189000	4191000	But we're not making a Switch game
4191000	4193000	And you know
4193000	4195000	I think that's
4195000	4197000	An interesting division
4197000	4199000	That I think it's very obvious
4199000	4201000	To everybody out there that the Switch
4201000	4203000	Is not going to be something you can just port
4203000	4205000	A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game over to
4205000	4207000	I thought that was the whole rumor
4207000	4209000	That it was so easy that's what's going to make it
4209000	4211000	Do better
4211000	4213000	Why wouldn't you be able to?
4213000	4215000	Because the hardware is not going to be up to speed with PlayStation 4
4215000	4217000	Yeah but from what I understand
4217000	4219000	It's just a little less powerful
4219000	4221000	From the rumors and these rumors that are saying
4221000	4223000	This are the rumors that have gotten everything else
4223000	4225000	Right about it so far
4225000	4227000	We'll have a see
4227000	4229000	That would be great
4229000	4231000	If it can compete on that level
4231000	4233000	Yeah we'll have to take a wait and see approach
4233000	4235000	Alright
4235000	4237000	Let's get to some more news
4237000	4239000	Also about the Switch
4239000	4241000	And you know what's very important for this
4241000	4243000	Is third parties and people being interested in developing
4243000	4245000	For Switch
4245000	4247000	Well one of the people who has expressed interest
4247000	4249000	In making games for the Switch
4249000	4251000	Is Hajime Tabata
4251000	4253000	And if you don't know that name
4253000	4255000	Well you probably know the game he's directing
4255000	4257000	Final Fantasy XV
4257000	4259000	So he's interested in making games for the Switch
4259000	4261000	Not necessarily Final Fantasy XV
4261000	4263000	But the quote is
4263000	4265000	I'm very interested in this machine
4265000	4267000	As a player but also as a developer
4267000	4269000	The Nintendo Switch that you can transform
4269000	4271000	Into a controller that you can put into a dock
4271000	4273000	That you can move around with
4273000	4275000	On which you can replace elements
4275000	4277000	It's been a while that I've told myself I would like to make games
4277000	4279000	On a Nintendo machine
4279000	4281000	So if the Nintendo Switch could be that opportunity
4281000	4283000	I'd be delighted
4283000	4285000	That was an interview with Game Blog
4285000	4287000	Where Hajime Tabata said that
4287000	4289000	There's definitely, it's catching the attention of people in the industry
4289000	4291000	And we've kind of heard that too
4291000	4293000	In some of the rumors
4293000	4295000	Like the rumors were saying
4295000	4297000	That there was a lot of interest out there
4297000	4299000	Because people really liked the concept of
4299000	4301000	That you could pick it up and go
4301000	4303000	And it sounds like this whole fact that it transforms
4303000	4305000	It's like a Transformers machine
4305000	4307000	With the fact that the controllers pop off
4307000	4309000	And they can be used one way
4309000	4311000	You're not limited to necessarily one configuration
4311000	4313000	I just hope it works in execution
4313000	4315000	Like it sounds
4315000	4317000	Oh they pop off, poof!
4317000	4319000	Alright now here's one other
4319000	4321000	Big big rumor about the Switch
4321000	4323000	This will be the last thing we'll talk about
4323000	4325000	Again this is rumor but
4325000	4327000	If I were to bring out the wheel of plausibility again this week
4327000	4329000	I'm sure it would rank very highly
4329000	4331000	Anyhow this is a tweet from a technology
4331000	4333000	Reporter for the Wall Street Journal
4333000	4335000	It's Takashi Mochizuki
4335000	4337000	And is mentioning in this tweet
4337000	4339000	Looks like standard capacity
4339000	4341000	Of Switch game card at least when
4341000	4343000	Console launched
4343000	4345000	It was around 16 as in gigabytes
4345000	4347000	Enough for one layer
4347000	4349000	Blu-ray game so it looks like
4349000	4351000	The Switch game cards are 16
4351000	4353000	Gigabyte cartridges however
4353000	4355000	We don't necessarily know if that means
4355000	4357000	It's limited to 16 and can't grow
4357000	4359000	Later because even the original
4359000	4361000	NES was
4361000	4363000	Limited to what 32
4363000	4365000	Kilobytes maybe I could be totally
4365000	4367000	Wrong on that but that was expanded
4367000	4369000	By the time
4369000	4371000	And that's also why cartridges got more and more expensive
4371000	4373000	But that was expanded by
4373000	4375000	The end of its run so
4375000	4377000	I don't see why maybe you have a 16
4377000	4379000	Gig cartridge as the original
4379000	4381000	Configuration but that's gonna grow
4381000	4383000	To 32
4383000	4385000	Maybe even 128 if the technology
4385000	4387000	Gets there
4387000	4389000	But I notice a lot of people on blogs and so forth
4389000	4391000	Are very negative on this 16
4391000	4393000	Gigabyte number because it's less than
4393000	4395000	A 25 gigabyte
4395000	4397000	Blu-ray but my
4397000	4399000	Question is how
4399000	4401000	Like you guys do a lot of
4401000	4403000	Digital game downloads right
4403000	4405000	How many games out there are more
4405000	4407000	Than 16 gigs to download
4407000	4409000	I can't think of a lot
4409000	4411000	Maybe the major games are bigger than that
4411000	4413000	Dragon Age was bigger? No
4413000	4415000	Like a lot of the major games are bigger than that
4415000	4417000	They're like 30, 40 gigs
4417000	4419000	But those are like major
4419000	4421000	Major games
4421000	4423000	I don't know it depends on what that
4423000	4425000	Thing outputs at
4425000	4427000	I imagine the texture sizes
4427000	4429000	I think will probably reduce it quite a bit
4429000	4431000	Compression maybe
4431000	4433000	Wasn't 16 gigs
4433000	4435000	Like the entire capacity of the basic
4435000	4437000	Wii U
4437000	4439000	So if this is bigger
4439000	4441000	Than that that's good news I think
4441000	4443000	Well like you know
4443000	4445000	Compression I'm sure has placed some of it
4445000	4447000	Because I think a lot of that stuff they had
4447000	4449000	Especially on disc I'm not sure about
4449000	4451000	Actually downloading it though but like a lot of it
4451000	4453000	Had to stay in compressed because the drive wasn't
4453000	4455000	As fast or maybe I'm thinking
4455000	4457000	3 but
4457000	4459000	I don't know
4459000	4461000	We'll see I mean
4461000	4463000	They're gonna make it work
4463000	4465000	It's not gonna be like ah shit you know
4465000	4467000	The game doesn't work too well
4467000	4469000	Or or
4469000	4471000	I mean they could pull a fucking Microsoft
4471000	4473000	And say oh okay well 16 gigs
4473000	4475000	Fits on this and we're gonna download the rest
4475000	4477000	I was gonna say it's not
4477000	4479000	Necessarily out of character to have
4479000	4481000	Some of it on the cartridge
4481000	4483000	But the rest of it will download
4483000	4485000	If the Switch has a large
4485000	4487000	Internal capacity
4487000	4489000	Still do 32 gigs please
4489000	4491000	Well I was gonna say if you downloaded all the high quality
4491000	4493000	Stuff for Xenoblade
4493000	4495000	On Wii U
4495000	4497000	That will fill up your entire drive
4497000	4499000	Like with all the high
4499000	4501000	Stuff but you know maybe the Switch
4501000	4503000	Can incorporate something like that I don't know
4503000	4505000	So anyway
4505000	4507000	Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
4507000	4509000	Dartitsia pointing out
4509000	4511000	The cards at the start are right in between
4511000	4513000	Dual layer DVDs
4513000	4515000	9.4 gigs and Blu-rays
4515000	4517000	25 gigs respectively
4517000	4519000	And I'm sure there's a possibility the cards could get bigger
4519000	4521000	Down the line yeah if they go to 32
4521000	4523000	Gigs which would be the assuming that any
4523000	4525000	Of this information is even accurate in the first
4525000	4527000	Place that is very true
4527000	4529000	Sj100Matt says as long as it's not
4529000	4531000	Proprietary memory cards people
4531000	4533000	Will just buy larger SD cards
4533000	4535000	They're so cheap now
4535000	4537000	We can hope you know the 3DS
4537000	4539000	Allowed you to use a non-proprietary
4539000	4541000	Card so there's hope
4541000	4543000	The Wii let you use a non-proprietary SD card
4543000	4545000	I have a 256 gig one or whatever it is
4545000	4547000	I don't remember but it's huge
4547000	4549000	The Wii kind of struggles to load all of the
4549000	4551000	Space because it has to like count all the
4551000	4553000	Blocks right but it works
4553000	4555000	Yeah the Wii U
4555000	4557000	Will allow you to connect an external
4557000	4559000	Hard drive if I'm not correct or if I'm not mistaken
4559000	4561000	Yeah because their internal storage is
4561000	4563000	Yeah stupid but I mean but the
4563000	4565000	Good news is you know when we're talking
4565000	4567000	About what's plausible and what's not
4567000	4569000	You kind of look at the track record right
4569000	4571000	So Nintendo has a pretty good track record of not being
4571000	4573000	Not constricting memory
4573000	4575000	To its ecosystem so that's
4575000	4577000	That's hopeful that
4577000	4579000	We'll be able to do that with the Switch
4579000	4581000	That's kind of standard nowadays anyways
4581000	4583000	I mean it feels like Nintendo has often had expansions to its consoles
4583000	4585000	Like the N64 had the expansion pack
4585000	4587000	You know there's always been little
4587000	4589000	Add-ons that they add on later in the
4589000	4591000	Console's life
4591000	4593000	Rama says the Switch will use
4593000	4595000	Proprietary cards for the games
4595000	4597000	But standard micro SD if you ask me
4597000	4599000	And I would agree with that I don't think
4599000	4601000	They would want just anybody making
4601000	4603000	Game cartridges they don't want
4603000	4605000	People to circumvent that so
4605000	4607000	No I'm sure it will be circumvented
4607000	4609000	Don't you worry
4609000	4611000	Well I mean it's so early
4611000	4613000	To know but Loki
4613000	4615000	Have you seen anything out there about people
4615000	4617000	That are like planning to hack the
4617000	4619000	Switch Oh no I haven't seen anything
4619000	4621000	But it's gonna happen It always happens
4621000	4623000	It'll have to happen Yeah that's
4623000	4625000	A given it will happen
4625000	4627000	It just you know how easy is it gonna be
4627000	4629000	Is the question Yeah interesting
4629000	4631000	Alright let's move on
4631000	4633000	With another story Loki
4633000	4635000	Alright so this week
4635000	4637000	Hello Games actually finally tweeted
4637000	4639000	Something out and their tweet
4639000	4641000	Was No Man's Sky was a mistake
4641000	4643000	And everyone's like
4643000	4645000	Whaaaat
4645000	4647000	And it actually ended up being that
4647000	4649000	Apparently their Twitter account was hacked
4649000	4651000	And someone posted
4651000	4653000	That on there and yeah
4653000	4655000	It was some type of back door through LinkedIn
4655000	4657000	Is what they blamed too Yeah they're all
4657000	4659000	100% not hacked anymore obviously
4659000	4661000	Those mails and tweets were fake
4661000	4663000	Back to work and then you know they were saying
4663000	4665000	That umm
4665000	4667000	Which you know
4667000	4669000	Sorry real quick by the way
4669000	4671000	There's a little bit of tangent but it's not
4671000	4673000	Okay so Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
4673000	4675000	Is where you guys can call us later on the show right
4675000	4677000	I don't know if you guys have noticed this
4677000	4679000	I've been getting inundated with Skype spam
4679000	4681000	Lately and because the Orange Lounge Radio account
4681000	4683000	We've collected you know
4683000	4685000	Hundreds of listeners over the years that have called
4685000	4687000	Into the show
4687000	4689000	We will get like I just had to clean up
4689000	4691000	Like 8 spam messages
4691000	4693000	As we launch for the show tonight
4693000	4695000	Do you know what they all were?
4695000	4697000	They were links to LinkedIn
4697000	4699000	That said LinkedIn and it had some weird code
4699000	4701000	After it and it wasn't a phish
4701000	4703000	LinkedIn site it was definitely LinkedIn.com
4703000	4705000	But I think it was some type of back door
4705000	4707000	Injection or something I don't know
4707000	4709000	The reason why I bring that up
4709000	4711000	If they were hacked through LinkedIn
4711000	4713000	I wonder if it wasn't part of this whole Skype thing
4713000	4715000	Or something that's going on
4715000	4717000	LinkedIn got hacked a while ago
4717000	4719000	Server hacked
4719000	4721000	We were binging Mr. Robot episodes as quickly as we can
4721000	4723000	Looking for answers
4723000	4725000	They were saying if anything was a mistake
4725000	4727000	It was using LinkedIn without two factor authentication
4727000	4729000	Nothing ever comes from LinkedIn
4729000	4731000	That's not true
4731000	4733000	I'm going to stick up for LinkedIn
4733000	4735000	My current job
4735000	4737000	I got through LinkedIn
4737000	4739000	So it does work
4739000	4741000	So it's kind of like I'm sorry
4741000	4743000	I have to jump to LinkedIn's defense
4743000	4745000	I realize why a lot of people pick on them
4745000	4747000	But it actually fucking works
4747000	4749000	In some circumstances
4749000	4751000	I got to give props for props to do
4751000	4753000	But it is nice to hear
4753000	4755000	From Sean Murray
4755000	4757000	Unfortunately it's not anything that has to do with No Man's Sky
4757000	4759000	So that is still in the dark
4761000	4763000	So Sean Murray finally tweeted
4763000	4765000	But the tweets were about the hack
4765000	4767000	And nothing else
4767000	4769000	But at least it's one of those
4769000	4771000	I'm glad to see you're alive
4771000	4773000	I don't mean to sound so
4773000	4775000	Someone's alive
4775000	4777000	I'm glad to see he's alive
4777000	4779000	Because I was starting to get worried
4779000	4781000	Well it's like when Pokemon Go was radio silent
4781000	4783000	When they were having all their issues at launch
4783000	4785000	It's nice to see something
4785000	4787000	Yeah but even Pokemon Go finally figured that out
4787000	4789000	After a week or two
4789000	4791000	The radio silence from Hello Games has been
4791000	4793000	Deafening on this
4793000	4795000	Because
4795000	4797000	Isn't there talk about
4797000	4799000	A possible bundle pack that's going to have No Man's Sky
4799000	4801000	By the end of the year
4801000	4803000	They've still made a lot of promises for what they're going to do
4803000	4805000	They've got
4805000	4807000	It's not just that game
4807000	4809000	They've got a few different three-game pack
4809000	4811000	PlayStation 4s that are coming out
4811000	4813000	So they have one that was
4813000	4815000	No Man's Sky, Uncharted 4
4815000	4817000	And
4817000	4819000	Something else
4819000	4821000	There was another one
4821000	4823000	Uncharted 4 and two other games
4823000	4825000	It's a Sony game
4825000	4827000	Of course they're going to do some of those bundles
4827000	4829000	I don't condone the hacking
4829000	4831000	And it's not appropriate
4831000	4833000	Or any of that stuff
4833000	4835000	With this radio silence
4835000	4837000	I don't want to say they were asking for it
4837000	4839000	But they were definitely
4839000	4841000	The longer this goes on
4841000	4843000	And they're not saying anything
4843000	4845000	The fan base
4845000	4847000	Is doing this type of shit
4847000	4849000	Well it's kind of hard
4849000	4851000	Especially now after how much
4851000	4853000	That was hyped up by Sony too
4853000	4855000	It's like
4855000	4857000	Who are we going to trust anymore
4857000	4859000	When it comes to these big
4859000	4861000	Games that look so amazing and stuff
4861000	4863000	What I'm saying is if they need to
4863000	4865000	They need to just rip the band-aid off
4865000	4867000	If they need to make the tweet that says
4867000	4869000	We've ended all development on No Man's Sky
4869000	4871000	And we're moving on to our next project
4871000	4873000	As much as that's going to piss people
4873000	4875000	To fuck off
4875000	4877000	Drop it on a Friday at 5pm
4877000	4879000	But as much as it's going to piss people off
4879000	4881000	You just need to get over with
4881000	4883000	Drop it on election day
4887000	4889000	Yeah but there are British companies
4889000	4891000	That doesn't mean that they're not affected
4891000	4893000	That's true
4893000	4895000	That's actually kind of a brilliant idea
4895000	4897000	If you're going to drop bad news do it on election day
4897000	4899000	Or if there's any number of political events they could bury it under
4899000	4901000	That's the best way to make it go away
4901000	4903000	That's true, that's a good thought
4903000	4905000	Yeah, and Sjoan Undermat says
4905000	4907000	You can be pissed at a developer not providing updates
4907000	4909000	But to a point, right
4909000	4911000	And I'm not saying, again, I'm not condoning what happened
4911000	4913000	Or what have you
4913000	4915000	I'm not going to go hack his email, what the hell is that going to do
4915000	4917000	But I've been on the internet long enough to know
4917000	4919000	That's what's going to happen
4919000	4921000	Not having communication is the worst thing you can do
4921000	4923000	For yourself for damage control
4923000	4925000	Yeah, anyway
4925000	4927000	But you know
4927000	4929000	I want to see the best for everybody
4929000	4931000	Involved in that situation
4931000	4933000	You know, I enjoyed No Man's Sky for what it is
4933000	4935000	Because I didn't buy into the fucking hype
4935000	4937000	In the beginning
4937000	4939000	So, you know
4939000	4941000	Although you all were so mad at me in the beginning
4941000	4943000	When I was like, remember when they would show
4943000	4945000	The No Man's Sky stuff at E3 and I'd be like
4945000	4947000	Okay, so where's the fucking game
4947000	4949000	Right, and people were like
4949000	4951000	And I'm like, guess what
4951000	4953000	That attitude's paying off now
4953000	4955000	It's not even that, it's just the game wasn't very good
4955000	4957000	I mean, just the whole inventory management stuff
4957000	4959000	Is retarded
4959000	4961000	So that was the whole game
4961000	4963000	And a lot of it was thrown in there just to
4963000	4965000	Stretch the amount of time it would take to play the game
4965000	4967000	And it's just
4967000	4969000	Stretching out nothing is what it was
4969000	4971000	There was no game there
4971000	4973000	Yeah, but there's no game in Minecraft
4973000	4975000	But add VR support and I'll be all over that shit again
4975000	4977000	Alright, well
4977000	4979000	Speaking of VR
4979000	4981000	Microsoft, I didn't want to get too far into this
4981000	4983000	But Microsoft had a big event where they unveiled a surface
4983000	4985000	That made a lot of people very excited
4985000	4987000	To see that
4987000	4989000	They're also talking about a push
4989000	4991000	Into virtual and augmented reality
4991000	4993000	There's going to be a new line
4993000	4995000	Of virtual reality headsets
4995000	4997000	And they're working with a host of partners for these headsets
4997000	4999000	I should note though, this is not for the
4999000	5001000	Xbox One, but this is for Windows 10
5001000	5003000	Some of the partners for the headsets
5003000	5005000	HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer
5005000	5007000	Starting at $299
5007000	5009000	So this was again a Microsoft VR headset
5009000	5011000	But you better believe though
5011000	5013000	Ideally what they're saying is
5013000	5015000	Running on mid-end machines
5015000	5017000	Just regular laptops and stuff
5017000	5019000	I'm down with that
5019000	5021000	Then if it runs on that, it should run on
5021000	5023000	Xbox One I would think
5023000	5025000	Now I also do want to point out it's a wired device
5025000	5027000	And the tracking is handled by
5027000	5029000	Sensors on the headset itself
5029000	5031000	It's a little different from
5031000	5033000	The camera sensors
5033000	5035000	So it does something a little bit different
5035000	5037000	I think that's similar to the HoloLens
5037000	5039000	Yes, most definitely
5039000	5041000	Similar to that
5041000	5043000	And this should also be noted
5043000	5045000	That speaking of HoloLens, just because
5045000	5047000	This whole thing is happening, that doesn't mean HoloLens
5047000	5049000	Is stopping development or anything
5049000	5051000	Like that, but there is a difference
5051000	5053000	Between AR and VR, so work
5053000	5055000	Continues on the HoloLens
5055000	5057000	Which, as you might remember on a previous
5057000	5059000	Episode, I got to check out one of those dev kits
5059000	5061000	And I thought
5061000	5063000	HoloLens was pretty awesome
5063000	5065000	Did you watch the presentation for
5065000	5067000	What Microsoft did? No, but to be fair
5067000	5069000	I didn't watch Apple's thing this week either
5069000	5071000	I didn't watch Apple's thing I didn't watch any of it
5071000	5073000	It was funny though, after they showed off
5073000	5075000	The nice thing and Apple was like
5075000	5077000	Oh, we got a touch bar
5077000	5079000	And everyone was like, eh, fuck that shit
5079000	5081000	To be fair
5081000	5083000	It's a neat idea
5083000	5085000	But I got burned the last time I bought an Apple laptop
5085000	5087000	So I'm not doing it again
5087000	5089000	The virtual reality window thing that they were showing
5089000	5091000	Was kind of cool, I thought it would be pretty neat
5091000	5093000	I definitely still want to get a HoloLens someday
5093000	5095000	When the tech is actually what it's showing
5095000	5097000	Once we're there
5097000	5099000	Then yeah, I'll be all over that
5099000	5101000	I think the virtual reality stuff is pretty cool
5101000	5103000	In that they're kind of embracing that
5103000	5105000	And also the other thing
5105000	5107000	That they showed was the app that they had
5107000	5109000	That you can 3D scan stuff with your phone
5109000	5111000	Which I thought was pretty cool
5111000	5113000	Of course they said a Windows phone
5113000	5115000	I'm like, no, I'm not buying a Windows phone for that
5115000	5117000	But eventually all phones
5117000	5119000	So it's exciting
5119000	5121000	That they're getting into that
5121000	5123000	And I think with Microsoft backing virtual reality now
5123000	5125000	Too, I mean
5125000	5127000	With Windows and everything
5127000	5129000	It's probably going to be
5129000	5131000	Just getting better
5131000	5133000	It's not going to be a fad, I think
5133000	5135000	Alright, moving on
5135000	5137000	Loki, a follow up to some news from last week, right?
5137000	5139000	Yes, so apparently
5139000	5141000	Several of the video game companies
5141000	5143000	Have been affected by this
5143000	5145000	Voice actor strike
5145000	5147000	They have issued a statement
5147000	5149000	And
5149000	5151000	Basically
5151000	5153000	I'm not going to read all of this here
5153000	5155000	Let's see if we can just cover it a little bit
5155000	5157000	This is a strike that did not have to happen
5157000	5159000	SAG-AFTRA never communicated
5159000	5161000	To its members
5161000	5163000	What was on the table
5163000	5165000	When on October 19th
5165000	5167000	It declined to counter
5167000	5169000	The company's last proposal
5169000	5171000	And pushed away from negotiations
5171000	5173000	So obviously, I mean
5173000	5175000	I'm guessing the stance by this
5175000	5177000	Since I haven't read everything
5177000	5179000	They're kind of defending themselves
5179000	5181000	And obviously saying, well
5181000	5183000	Come put blame on SAG-AFTRA
5183000	5185000	Maybe if they stayed in negotiations a little longer
5185000	5187000	They might be something that they would have
5187000	5189000	You know, been able to resolve on that
5191000	5193000	Let's see
5193000	5195000	And I guess the offer of a 9% increase
5195000	5197000	And additional compensations
5197000	5199000	Are meant for bonuses
5199000	5201000	For quick resolution
5201000	5203000	To negotiations expires on
5203000	5205000	December 1st
5205000	5207000	So that's like, it's the last offer that they have
5207000	5209000	This is not good though
5209000	5211000	That this is still going
5211000	5213000	The fact that this wasn't resolved in days
5213000	5215000	Now we have to wonder if this is
5215000	5217000	Going to be something that's going to take months to resolve
5217000	5219000	How long did that writer's strike go on
5219000	5221000	A few years ago? It was a while
5221000	5223000	It was months
5223000	5225000	And so now I worry because this is going to affect
5225000	5227000	Video games
5227000	5229000	Now will possibly
5229000	5231000	Games go to non-union
5231000	5233000	I kind of think
5233000	5235000	The rise of a silent protagonist
5235000	5237000	Yeah, either the rise of the silent protagonist
5237000	5239000	Is going to start happening
5239000	5241000	With non-union voice actors
5241000	5243000	I think there's plenty of people
5243000	5245000	That will do it
5245000	5247000	But it's not going to have that same star power
5247000	5249000	And I'm not saying that I support that
5249000	5251000	I'm just looking at the reality of it
5251000	5253000	I think for these games to stay on target
5253000	5255000	They're just going to go, okay fine
5255000	5257000	Get a non-union voice actor
5257000	5259000	Do an internet contest
5259000	5261000	To find somebody to be the voice of somebody
5261000	5263000	Like, they'll find it
5263000	5265000	Yeah
5265000	5267000	But, you know
5267000	5269000	I understand the voice actor's perspective
5269000	5271000	And some of the things they're asking for
5271000	5273000	Make an awful lot of sense
5273000	5275000	Especially when we talk about the vocal strain
5275000	5277000	Knowing what the projects are
5277000	5279000	Having more information on that
5279000	5281000	A little less secrecy for them
5281000	5283000	And a lot of that makes sense to me
5283000	5285000	I hope they can work it out
5285000	5287000	Because the longer this goes on, nobody wins
5287000	5289000	Nobody wins
5289000	5291000	Anyhow, we'll see
5291000	5293000	Going to chat over at
5293000	5295000	Live.vognetwork.com
5295000	5297000	Let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says
5297000	5299000	Great, the alternative might be Chaos Wars
5299000	5301000	Level of voice acting
5301000	5303000	Yeah, that could
5303000	5305000	Mean the voice acting quality is going to dip
5305000	5307000	A bit too
5307000	5309000	S2100Matt says, the Rider Strike ruined Heroes
5309000	5311000	In my opinion
5311000	5313000	Oh yeah, not just that show, but several shows
5313000	5315000	The Rider Strike just killed those shows
5315000	5317000	It helped some things though
5317000	5319000	Yeah, we did get Doctor Horrible out of the Rider Strike
5319000	5321000	So it wasn't all bad
5321000	5323000	We also got a really good season of Power Rangers
5323000	5325000	It was the worst season they ever did a Big Brother
5325000	5327000	Yes, how can you tell?
5327000	5329000	It was the winter season of Big Brother
5329000	5331000	It was awful, if you follow that series
5331000	5333000	It was the worst season they ever did
5333000	5335000	But that doesn't make any sense, it's supposed to be non-scripted
5335000	5337000	How would a Rider Strike affect a non-scripted show?
5337000	5339000	Right, but yet
5339000	5341000	Not to get too far into reality TV
5341000	5343000	Here's the crazy part
5343000	5345000	So they're doing a bonus Big Brother right now
5345000	5347000	That's only on the online
5347000	5349000	And it's like the best cast one they've had in years
5349000	5351000	Well it's because they're not using
5351000	5353000	The same casting agency for it
5353000	5355000	So yeah, this is the best season of Big Brother
5355000	5357000	It's the one that's not even on TV
5357000	5359000	People who don't follow it
5359000	5361000	Probably don't even know about
5361000	5363000	But it's the best season they've had in years
5363000	5365000	All I know about Big Brother is that
5365000	5367000	Davon GIF that everyone shows
5367000	5369000	The one that's always on Twitter
5369000	5371000	Hi!
5371000	5373000	She knows how to make an entrance
5373000	5375000	She was a great player, but
5375000	5377000	She was not a great player at all
5377000	5379000	She was an entertaining player
5379000	5381000	That's what you really need for reality TV
5381000	5383000	Best diary rooms of anybody
5383000	5385000	Not once in a competition
5385000	5387000	Kaijuto in chat says
5387000	5389000	Big Brother over the top is the shit
5389000	5391000	I'm not gonna lie
5391000	5393000	It is the best season of Big Brother since probably 11
5393000	5395000	Don't forget to vote for Chrissy
5395000	5397000	As America's nominee tonight
5397000	5399000	And
5399000	5401000	Shane obviously has his feelings
5401000	5403000	About what's going on there
5403000	5405000	Kaijuto says
5405000	5407000	I have the feeds on right now
5407000	5409000	You never know, they might break out in a fight
5409000	5411000	Moving on
5411000	5413000	Let's talk about Kingdom Hearts
5413000	5415000	Because
5415000	5417000	If you missed Kingdom Hearts
5417000	5419000	It pays to wait
5419000	5421000	Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD
5421000	5423000	And 2.5 Remix
5423000	5425000	If you did not pick those up on PlayStation 3
5425000	5427000	You have Kingdom Hearts 4 now
5427000	5429000	I did the math
5429000	5431000	You will have the ability to pick them up all over again
5431000	5433000	On PlayStation 4
5433000	5435000	It was announced this week
5435000	5437000	Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5
5437000	5439000	Plus 2.5
5439000	5441000	Remix
5441000	5443000	Meaning there will be 6 games
5443000	5445000	Well 4 games and 2 movies
5445000	5447000	Involved in this
5447000	5449000	Will be coming out March 9th in Japan
5449000	5451000	March 28th in North America
5451000	5453000	So for those keeping track at home
5453000	5455000	That's Kingdom Hearts 1, 2
5455000	5457000	Chain of Memories
5457000	5459000	Birth by Sleep
5459000	5461000	And the movies for 3.58
5461000	5463000	And Recoded
5463000	5465000	Will not include the 2.8
5465000	5467000	Final Chapter Prologue
5467000	5469000	These fucking names
5469000	5471000	Will not include that
5471000	5473000	Because that is a separate PlayStation 4
5473000	5475000	Release
5475000	5477000	That's the one that has Dream Drop Distance
5477000	5479000	Which is a 3DS game
5479000	5481000	Just wait a bit longer
5481000	5483000	Wait a bit longer
5483000	5485000	Right before they finally bring out Kingdom Hearts 3
5485000	5487000	1.5, 2.5, 2.8
5487000	5489000	And 3
5489000	5491000	I actually preordered these
5491000	5493000	Because I don't really have a big desire to play Kingdom Hearts
5493000	5495000	But to have them all on one console
5495000	5497000	Is pretty tempting
5497000	5499000	And it was enough, I preordered them
5499000	5501000	I have the 1.5 remix on PlayStation 3 obviously
5501000	5503000	But when they announced 2.5
5503000	5505000	This was after Final Fantasy 10
5505000	5507000	Was on PS3 and PS4
5507000	5509000	And I was like, uh uh
5509000	5511000	I'm not getting those on PS3 because I know they're going to put them on PS4
5511000	5513000	Granted, I thought it would happen a little sooner
5513000	5515000	But I'm glad that it's finally happening
5515000	5517000	What, a year later, finally
5517000	5519000	Do they change a lot in the HD remakes?
5519000	5521000	Because I've been playing through the original PS2
5521000	5523000	And off and on
5523000	5525000	Well, keep in mind, right off the bat
5525000	5527000	The fact that they're widescreen natively
5527000	5529000	Is a huge change
5529000	5531000	These are a little bit HD-er
5531000	5533000	Yeah, they're more HD-er
5533000	5535000	But they still play the original games
5535000	5537000	You know, and so forth
5537000	5539000	It's interesting because you mentioned that you still use
5539000	5541000	A CRT TV
5541000	5543000	You have a CRT TV
5543000	5545000	Right, exactly
5545000	5547000	So since all my music games
5547000	5549000	A couple are on the Wii
5549000	5551000	And we won't talk about San Bodeo Amigo right now
5551000	5553000	But I have a PS2
5553000	5555000	And I tried
5555000	5557000	When I first moved into my place
5557000	5559000	And I tried doing it with an HDTV
5559000	5561000	And it just was unplayable
5561000	5563000	You know, it's 10 or 15 millisecond lag
5563000	5565000	Which doesn't sound like a lot
5565000	5567000	But when your timing window is less than 10 milliseconds
5567000	5569000	Then that's a big problem
5569000	5571000	Oh, and Akdeft in chat brings up a very good point
5571000	5573000	These games are final mixes
5573000	5575000	Which are better and improved versions of the original
5575000	5577000	So it's kind of like, you know how Final Fantasy 10
5577000	5579000	Was like the international version
5579000	5581000	And now 12 is going to be the Zodiac one
5581000	5583000	And 12 is going to be the Zodiac one
5583000	5585000	Which I'm really excited about that
5585000	5587000	More than Final Fantasy
5587000	5589000	It's really complex because you can't just make your character
5589000	5591000	Wait, how did you play some of it?
5591000	5593000	Possibly on an emulator on a computer
5593000	5595000	I played a good chunk of the PS2 version
5595000	5597000	It's really good
5597000	5599000	Oh, the PS2 version
5599000	5601000	Yeah, because it came out in Japan as the international
5601000	5603000	I was like, wait, you played the remaster?
5603000	5605000	What the fuck did you do that?
5605000	5607000	Basically because I upped all the textures
5607000	5609000	It looked really good
5609000	5611000	That's different
5611000	5613000	So that is the other big difference
5613000	5615000	That you're playing the last international version
5615000	5617000	Or whatever
5617000	5619000	And Akdeft points out that on PlayStation 4
5619000	5621000	It's all going to be in HD and 60 frames a second
5621000	5623000	So if your non-CRT TV is like mine
5623000	5625000	That has the super good refresh rate
5625000	5627000	Where movies don't look real
5627000	5629000	They just look crazy
5629000	5631000	It's one of those smart TV things
5631000	5633000	Where the frame rate is so good
5633000	5635000	It's not like it doesn't
5635000	5637000	TV looks different now
5637000	5639000	When you have that fast refresh rate
5639000	5641000	It just doesn't look real
5641000	5643000	Or it looks too real
5643000	5645000	The realness
5645000	5647000	Shut up
5647000	5649000	Moving on with our next story
5649000	5651000	We're almost to the Classic Game of the Week
5651000	5653000	But first, Loki
5653000	5655000	Skyrim Special Edition
5655000	5657000	Was just released on Friday
5657000	5659000	And already
5659000	5661000	There's Bethesda bug issues
5661000	5663000	With the game
5663000	5665000	What a shock
5665000	5667000	I'm going to die from that surprise
5667000	5669000	So apparently there are some issues
5669000	5671000	With the audio
5671000	5673000	And this is only affecting right now
5673000	5675000	The PC and Xbox One versions
5675000	5677000	So it might not win for the PlayStation 4 guys
5677000	5679000	Although you don't have mod support
5679000	5681000	So give it a take
5681000	5683000	Apparently
5683000	5685000	It's that wonderful audio
5685000	5687000	Anyways
5687000	5689000	The special edition features
5689000	5691000	Dramatically compressed audio
5691000	5693000	Sounding more muddled
5693000	5695000	Than the game's original release
5695000	5697000	And that I guess is the issue
5697000	5699000	And
5699000	5701000	Apparently it says the vanilla game
5701000	5703000	Sound assets
5703000	5705000	Other than the music and voiceover
5705000	5707000	Is in an uncompressed wave format
5707000	5709000	The special edition has the sound assets
5709000	5711000	In a very aggressively compressed
5711000	5713000	XWM format
5713000	5715000	Which is compressed sound format
5715000	5717000	Designed for games
5717000	5719000	This isn't so bad
5719000	5721000	Necessarily it's possible
5721000	5723000	To compress the audio to
5723000	5725000	XWM without significant
5725000	5727000	Quality degradation
5727000	5729000	Unless you crank the compression
5729000	5731000	Way up to insane levels
5731000	5733000	What did Bethesda do?
5733000	5735000	They cranked the compression up to
5735000	5737000	Insane levels
5737000	5739000	So it sounds like
5739000	5741000	They just need to patch it
5741000	5743000	That's probably going to be a pretty sizable patch
5743000	5745000	They're going to have to download the audio
5745000	5747000	All over again
5747000	5749000	Boy oh boy
5749000	5751000	My audio will still be good on the PlayStation 4 version
5751000	5753000	Too bad I don't got any fucking
5753000	5755000	Good mod support for it
5755000	5757000	I still haven't bought the game yet
5757000	5759000	Well Alan got it for free
5759000	5761000	Technically I have a PC I already have it
5761000	5763000	Because I bought Skyrim a long time ago
5763000	5765000	Well wait a minute I bought Skyrim on the PC
5765000	5767000	But I didn't get this new one for free
5767000	5769000	It is free
5769000	5771000	No because I don't have all the DLC
5771000	5773000	I only have the base game
5773000	5775000	I looked at it on the store
5775000	5777000	It still wanted 40 bucks
5777000	5779000	You think I have all the DLC on
5779000	5781000	I'm pretty sure I have all the DLC
5781000	5783000	I never bought any of the DLC
5783000	5785000	Because I didn't play enough Skyrim
5785000	5787000	Alan on the other hand played it all
5787000	5789000	Seems like a special edition on Skyrim
5789000	5791000	For PCs kind of stupid
5791000	5793000	Since there's enough mods out there
5793000	5795000	Anyways it would probably make it look even better
5795000	5797000	Than the special edition
5797000	5799000	There's way too much bloom in that
5799000	5801000	Like the god rays
5801000	5803000	I mean yellow tint all over the screen
5803000	5805000	I'm hoping to check it out at some point
5805000	5807000	But I've got a million games
5807000	5809000	I'm trying to play right now
5809000	5811000	But I did see that they have
5811000	5813000	The Macho Man Randy Savage mod
5813000	5815000	Thank god
5815000	5817000	Dragon mods all ready for Xbox
5817000	5819000	That's fantastic
5819000	5821000	Unfortunately I read some modder comments
5821000	5823000	They're like yeah we're not supporting the Playstation 4
5823000	5825000	With our mods because
5825000	5827000	Of this limitation
5827000	5829000	That's gonna suck
5829000	5831000	Alright well let's take a trip down memory lane
5831000	5833000	Back when you couldn't mod games
5833000	5835000	Like this
5835000	5837000	It's a classic game
5837000	5839000	Of the week and unfortunately
5839000	5841000	You guys I'm sorry to say that Radio Magic
5841000	5843000	Is broken for the second week in a row
5843000	5845000	With the teleporter
5845000	5847000	Devices that allow radio magic
5847000	5849000	Oh right we get to do Halo again
5849000	5851000	Yes we're doing Halo again
5851000	5853000	As I said last time Loki suggested we do Halo
5853000	5855000	And Jamie's not here
5855000	5857000	I'm just letting you know chat
5857000	5859000	I am your advocate here
5859000	5861000	Alright well I thought
5861000	5863000	The nice thing to do since
5863000	5865000	We were unable to make Radio Magic happen this week
5865000	5867000	I thought the nice thing to do was to
5867000	5869000	Let our guest pick the classic
5869000	5871000	Game of the week and I thought
5871000	5873000	This is a very creative pick from JD
5873000	5875000	As well so we're gonna let JD pick tonight
5875000	5877000	The classic game of the week and I kinda think
5877000	5879000	Dark Sakura would approve of this
5879000	5881000	Pick but there is no music with
5881000	5883000	This pick right? Correct
5883000	5885000	And why is there no music?
5885000	5887000	Because this is a game about stick figures
5887000	5889000	Alright what is the classic game of the week?
5889000	5891000	So this is Kingdom of Loathing
5891000	5893000	This came out in 2003 and it is a browser
5893000	5895000	Based with lots of frames
5895000	5897000	It's a multiplayer online game
5897000	5899000	So it's an MMO
5899000	5901000	But it's turn based
5901000	5903000	So you have a bunch of adventures everyday
5903000	5905000	In which you can go out and do stuff
5905000	5907000	In the world
5907000	5909000	It was like a BBS game on the way
5909000	5911000	It really was
5911000	5913000	Black and white aesthetic to it
5913000	5915000	It's very lightweight
5915000	5917000	So the basic story is
5917000	5919000	You're trying to
5919000	5921000	The nasty sorceress is the
5921000	5923000	Big boss at the end of the game and you're trying to
5923000	5925000	Gain levels so that you can fight her
5925000	5927000	But the bulk of the game you spend
5927000	5929000	Just doing all of the side quests
5929000	5931000	And there's so much
5931000	5933000	There's a lot of pop culture references
5933000	5935000	And puns all over the place
5935000	5937000	Which is why it's one of my favorite games
5937000	5939000	Like I got
5939000	5941000	Lost just reading the wiki about all of the various
5941000	5943000	Items in the game
5943000	5945000	You have 40 adventures
5945000	5947000	Everyday
5947000	5949000	Because there's a daily reset at a certain time of day
5949000	5951000	And you go out and
5951000	5953000	Just do side quests and main quests
5953000	5955000	You can get more adventures by eating food
5955000	5957000	And having alcohol like just in real life
5957000	5959000	Hooray! And if you have too much alcohol
5959000	5961000	You get drunk and you have bad adventures
5961000	5963000	Or you hurt yourself
5963000	5965000	Less hooray! Right
5965000	5967000	There are three
5967000	5969000	There are six different classes that you can be
5969000	5971000	And there are
5971000	5973000	Three stats
5973000	5975000	There's five elements
5975000	5977000	So like a lot of other games
5977000	5979000	It has elemental rock, paper, scissors
5979000	5981000	But they're not the same elements you may be used to
5981000	5983000	There's hot and cold
5983000	5985000	But then there's spooky stench and sleaze
5985000	5987000	And they all fit together in different ways
5987000	5989000	Kind of like a Pokemon
5989000	5991000	This is good against that and not against that
5991000	5993000	It's a constantly
5993000	5995000	Evolving game
5995000	5997000	They have content every couple of months
5997000	5999000	And they're really good
5999000	6001000	About having in-universe explanations
6001000	6003000	When stuff goes wrong
6003000	6005000	Pretty early in the game's life cycle
6005000	6007000	There was a lot of hacking going on
6007000	6009000	And the currency in the game is meat
6009000	6011000	Which is, you know, slang for money
6011000	6013000	But it's also
6013000	6015000	They really go full hog with that
6015000	6017000	They have meat paste and meat smithing
6017000	6019000	Anyway, so
6019000	6021000	I played a little bit of Kingdom of Loathing
6021000	6023000	And I remember all these very sassy jokes
6023000	6025000	There's a lot at Konami
6025000	6027000	He's working hard, huh?
6027000	6029000	I was a disco bandit
6029000	6031000	Yeah, that's one of the classes
6031000	6033000	It looks interesting
6033000	6035000	I've never seen this game before
6035000	6037000	But it's still going, right?
6037000	6039000	Even though it qualifies as a classic game of the week
6039000	6041000	Because it's, what, 13 years old
6041000	6043000	It's still going
6043000	6045000	Because it's not a finished game either
6045000	6047000	It's in open beta
6047000	6049000	Because they never have a 1.0
6049000	6051000	Because it's continuously evolving
6051000	6053000	And they add on a couple of new levels
6053000	6055000	At the end
6055000	6057000	The final level used to be 11
6057000	6059000	And now it's 13
6059000	6061000	That happened a bunch of years ago
6061000	6063000	Yeah, but they continuously add on
6063000	6065000	New areas in the game
6065000	6067000	And it's all very solid
6067000	6069000	There's a great fan community around there
6069000	6071000	And lots of other stuff
6071000	6073000	There's a chat system
6073000	6075000	And in order to gain access to chat
6075000	6077000	You have to pass a test from the ghost
6077000	6079000	Of the English language
6079000	6081000	Because English is just so tortured
6081000	6083000	It's given up the ghost
6083000	6085000	And now you have to pass a small typing test
6085000	6087000	In order to get access
6087000	6089000	Wow, this really sounds like a game Dark Soccer would approve of
6089000	6091000	In fact, she's probably going to be pissed you took it
6091000	6093000	That's alright
6093000	6095000	I mean, there's a bunch of channels
6095000	6097000	There's a haiku channel
6097000	6099000	You get to leave after today, I know
6099000	6101000	The chat is all going
6101000	6103000	So what happens if the guest picks Halo
6103000	6105000	Could you get away with it?
6105000	6107000	And I'm like, I still don't want that phone call
6107000	6109000	I'll take that phone call
6109000	6111000	But I'm not taking the Halo call
6111000	6113000	I'm forwarding it to Shane's phone
6113000	6115000	That doesn't make sense
6115000	6117000	Alright, anyway
6117000	6119000	Yeah
6119000	6121000	There's a lot of
6121000	6123000	There's optional player versus player
6123000	6125000	But it's definitely not a big component of the game
6125000	6127000	It's definitely much more a cooperative aspect
6127000	6129000	Even though it's like
6129000	6131000	You're generally all by yourself
6131000	6133000	The fan communities and the forums and such
6133000	6135000	Are out there
6135000	6137000	The wiki is extensively documented
6137000	6139000	And there's
6139000	6141000	This is also a game in which people love to break on it
6141000	6143000	And see how things work
6143000	6145000	And in the game it's called spading
6145000	6147000	To figure out what exactly all the mechanics are
6147000	6149000	That underlie everything
6149000	6151000	And so every time there's a new content release
6151000	6153000	People try to figure it out
6153000	6155000	And there's a lot of
6155000	6157000	Specific details on that
6157000	6159000	The other thing about this game
6159000	6161000	Is they also have a radio channel that they do
6161000	6163000	Live 365 channel or something?
6163000	6165000	I don't think it's on Live 365
6165000	6167000	Oh no, nothing is
6167000	6169000	They shut down this year
6169000	6171000	But yeah, they've had
6171000	6173000	A radio show going for a while as well
6173000	6175000	Oh that's awesome
6175000	6177000	How do we get on that network?
6177000	6179000	Have your people call their people
6179000	6181000	I guess, do I gotta throw meat at them?
6183000	6185000	It's also a free game
6185000	6187000	Although there are paid things you can buy
6187000	6189000	So there are no ads anywhere
6189000	6191000	And that is always really nice
6191000	6193000	In a free content thing
6193000	6195000	That you never actually have to spend real money on
6195000	6197000	For a web game
6197000	6199000	And it's not pay to win
6199000	6201000	Like a lot of free to play games end up being
6201000	6203000	Alright
6203000	6205000	So this is something that people can play now
6205000	6207000	Yeah
6207000	6209000	I think it's .com
6209000	6211000	Alright
6211000	6213000	And Shane, maybe you should go check on your character
6213000	6215000	I wouldn't even remember my login
6215000	6217000	Well yeah, that's the other thing
6217000	6219000	If you don't log in
6219000	6221000	I think it's like two months or something
6221000	6223000	Your character will go away
6223000	6225000	As a resource saving thing
6225000	6227000	So you do have to play it pretty often
6227000	6229000	So it's not like Neopets
6229000	6231000	I think I had a Neopet back in 2004
6231000	6233000	Which would have been the last time I fed it
6233000	6235000	Oh it's probably dead
6235000	6237000	I don't think Neopets ever die
6237000	6239000	Well I remember I joked with you
6239000	6241000	When you told me you were going to pick this game
6241000	6243000	I was like, oh you should pick Neopets
6243000	6245000	They have another game called Word Realms
6245000	6247000	Oh interesting
6247000	6249000	So there is, if you do pay
6249000	6251000	There's an item called a Mr. Accessory
6251000	6253000	That if you leave it on your character for a day
6253000	6255000	It'll mark your character
6255000	6257000	Undeletable
6257000	6259000	So that is a thing you can do to keep it long term
6259000	6261000	But it means financially supporting the game
6261000	6263000	Oh that's smart
6263000	6265000	There's a lot of smart stuff in this game
6265000	6267000	Alright
6267000	6269000	There it is, your classic game of the week
6269000	6271000	Kingdom of Loathing
6271000	6273000	It's kind of like when Jamie picked World of Warcraft
6273000	6275000	But it's still going strong today
6275000	6277000	So check that out
6277000	6279000	Good pick
6279000	6281000	I like the fact that it's not your typical
6281000	6283000	Console type game
6283000	6285000	It's a web game
6285000	6287000	I don't think we've had anything like that
6287000	6289000	Cool pick
6289000	6291000	So there it is, your classic game of the week
6291000	6293000	Since we did not have Radio Magic though
6293000	6295000	We are going to take a quick in-studio break
6295000	6297000	So when we come back we're going to talk plenty more
6297000	6299000	We're going to get to what's in stores this week
6299000	6301000	Do some rapid fire news
6301000	6303000	Again we're short so
6303000	6305000	You should send us emails sometime
6305000	6307000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6307000	6309000	But we will get to your calls
6309000	6311000	At Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
6311000	6313000	When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio
6319000	6321000	Welcome back everybody
6321000	6323000	Orange Lounge Radio live in progress
6323000	6325000	Episode 663 for this
6325000	6327000	October the 30th of 2016
6327000	6329000	You know an appropriate game for Halloween
6329000	6331000	Castlevania I'm sure
6331000	6333000	You know with spooky ghosts and things like that
6333000	6335000	And before the show
6335000	6337000	Tigerclaw put a link in our chat room
6337000	6339000	And I hadn't seen this yet
6339000	6341000	But I guess somebody was taking on the project
6341000	6343000	To remake Castlevania in Unity
6343000	6345000	And we were watching a little bit of that in studio
6345000	6347000	And I was very impressed
6347000	6349000	Was it Unreal or was it Unity?
6349000	6351000	I thought it was Unity
6351000	6353000	It was one of those engines
6353000	6355000	That it was done on
6355000	6357000	Let me check one more time here
6357000	6359000	You know why I'm probably thinking that?
6359000	6361000	I think I saw a Zelda thing
6361000	6363000	That was done earlier this week that was in Unity
6363000	6365000	That's probably why my wires are crossing
6365000	6367000	And that one looked really good too
6367000	6369000	So it's tough to
6369000	6371000	Kind of look at this and realize that like
6371000	6373000	One guy did it and you're like
6373000	6375000	This is the type of reimagining I would like
6375000	6377000	To see of a Castlevania game
6377000	6379000	I mean granted it had some flaws
6379000	6381000	It wasn't perfect like you could see some little graphical bugs
6381000	6383000	And things but honestly
6383000	6385000	I guess you could just go on there and download it
6385000	6387000	And check it out and I'm like alright
6387000	6389000	Lords of Shadow was a good game that first one
6389000	6391000	I liked that reimagining it was pretty good
6391000	6393000	Yeah alright fair enough
6393000	6395000	But yeah I just
6395000	6397000	You liked what you saw Loki of that little
6397000	6399000	Castlevania remake? Yeah it looked cool
6399000	6401000	Same thing so alright I liked it
6401000	6403000	But then let's see
6403000	6405000	Oh Dungeon Buster says the guy also put it up
6405000	6407000	On Kickstarter which is not a smart move
6407000	6409000	That's definitely not a smart move
6409000	6411000	That'll draw attention
6411000	6413000	Konami will sue
6413000	6415000	That's not a good idea
6415000	6417000	They don't have a lot going for them
6417000	6419000	They're going to shut you down I wouldn't go to Kickstarter with that
6419000	6421000	Now if you want to do
6421000	6423000	A different game
6423000	6425000	That's like you know
6425000	6427000	Bloodstained Ritual of the Night
6427000	6429000	Oh wait you can't do that either
6429000	6431000	But you see where I'm going with this
6431000	6433000	You could do a different type of you know
6433000	6435000	Ghosty goblin-y
6435000	6437000	You know type of game
6437000	6439000	And it would be okay
6439000	6441000	So you might want to think about that my friend
6441000	6443000	Alright
6451000	6453000	Anyhow let's get into some rapid
6453000	6455000	Fire news and talk about quickly
6455000	6457000	A couple other things going on in gaming this week
6457000	6459000	Loki so if you like game soundtracks
6459000	6461000	And you happen to like those soundtracks in
6461000	6463000	Vinyl well there's some good news for you
6463000	6465000	Shovel Knight they're going to be bringing their soundtrack
6465000	6467000	Out to Vinyl and CD
6467000	6469000	Very soon
6469000	6471000	So it looks like it's going to be
6471000	6473000	It looks like a double LP
6473000	6475000	And you can get the CD version for $18
6475000	6477000	Vinyl is going to be selling for
6477000	6479000	$35
6479000	6481000	And yeah it looks
6481000	6483000	Pretty awesome so
6483000	6485000	I'm not sure when that's going to be available
6485000	6487000	Looks like the 2 dispersion is on Bandcamp
6487000	6489000	And then the double vinyl
6489000	6491000	Double LP is going to be on Big Wax
6491000	6493000	So soon
6493000	6495000	Also the last
6495000	6497000	Guardian
6497000	6499000	Golden going to be coming around the corner here pretty soon
6499000	6501000	Also getting it's soundtrack on
6501000	6503000	Vinyl as well also going to be a double
6503000	6505000	LP
6505000	6507000	And you can get that through
6507000	6509000	Iam8bit
6509000	6511000	And it's going to cost you $35
6511000	6513000	And I'll be coming
6513000	6515000	First quarter of 2017
6515000	6517000	And since we're on the topic of
6517000	6519000	Fan games
6519000	6521000	This one thankfully won't get shut down because of
6521000	6523000	You know Sega's wonderful
6523000	6525000	Stance hey fan games cool make them
6525000	6527000	So this is going to be one year
6527000	6529000	In fact you can probably do them better than we can at this point
6529000	6531000	Yeah exactly and honestly this looks
6531000	6533000	Kind of better than
6533000	6535000	No one can touch their Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account
6535000	6537000	Nobody will do better than that
6537000	6539000	Maybe Arby's they're like neck and neck sometimes
6539000	6541000	Arby's and Denny's you know
6541000	6543000	Denny's Denny's is really great
6543000	6545000	Go right now and look at Denny's
6545000	6547000	Sonic Utopia
6547000	6549000	It's a 3D Sonic
6549000	6551000	Game and it's
6551000	6553000	Supposed to combine all the elements of
6553000	6555000	You know the best elements of
6555000	6557000	Different Sonic games so basically
6557000	6559000	They wanted to expand the Sonic
6559000	6561000	Gameplay in an intuitive 3D way
6561000	6563000	And also
6563000	6565000	They said the capture best of the Sonic
6565000	6567000	Style and stuff the trailer
6567000	6569000	Looked pretty cool and actually looks like
6569000	6571000	A lot of fun the controls I mean
6571000	6573000	It seemed like it would control pretty well but hey
6573000	6575000	Don't let the trailer just
6575000	6577000	Be the judge you can actually check out this
6577000	6579000	Game and download it now so if you go check out
6579000	6581000	The trailer
6581000	6583000	You can also download the game
6583000	6585000	There's a link in the description
6585000	6587000	I haven't yet played it yet
6587000	6589000	But judging by the trailer it looked like
6589000	6591000	You know this would probably be a
6591000	6593000	Pretty good take on a 3D Sonic
6593000	6595000	Game so go check it out
6595000	6597000	Alright well
6597000	6599000	I'm going to bring up this story and I didn't realize
6599000	6601000	Shane would be here on tonight's show when I put
6601000	6603000	This in rapid fire news but I have a feeling
6603000	6605000	Shane's going to turn this into a long form story
6605000	6607000	Because this is about Pokemon Sun
6607000	6609000	and Moon and there was
6609000	6611000	There was a new trailer this week
6611000	6613000	For Pokemon Sun and Moon
6613000	6615000	Which well wait no it's not
6615000	6617000	All bad news oh no I know I know what happens
6617000	6619000	At the end alright so
6619000	6621000	Here's the deal is that the final
6621000	6623000	Evolutions for the starters were
6623000	6625000	Unveiled so you get to see the
6625000	6627000	Brand new final forms
6627000	6629000	Are you going to butcher their names I can't wait
6629000	6631000	Okay
6631000	6633000	This is the only one I'm not sure of Decidueye
6633000	6635000	Yeah that's good enough
6635000	6637000	That's how I would say it
6637000	6639000	That's Rowlet's final form and I like this
6639000	6641000	A grass ghost type
6641000	6643000	Yes for a couple different reasons
6643000	6645000	People are trying to basically say
6645000	6647000	Because the owl it's based off
6647000	6649000	Of from what people can tell is an
6649000	6651000	Extinct owl in Hawaii
6651000	6653000	Called the stilt owl
6653000	6655000	It's also well I'll let you finish the other
6655000	6657000	Well it also uses ghost moves
6657000	6659000	Like spirit shackles
6659000	6661000	Well that's because it's ghost
6661000	6663000	What else did you want to say?
6663000	6665000	Oh I was going to point out the connection between the
6665000	6667000	Secondary types in all three
6667000	6669000	Okay alright well then let me move on
6669000	6671000	To Nsign
6671000	6673000	No I
6673000	6675000	I went to purposely mess it up for change
6675000	6677000	Incineroar is the second one
6677000	6679000	This and of course I know that one because
6679000	6681000	Litten will be the character
6681000	6683000	And it's super cool oh my gosh
6683000	6685000	I like the WWF
6685000	6687000	Fire belt that it wears
6687000	6689000	I love its spinning lariat move it's so cool
6689000	6691000	Fire dark type
6691000	6693000	And then the worst thing in the
6693000	6695000	World
6695000	6697000	Primarina
6697000	6699000	That's better than what it is
6699000	6701000	Primarina and the diamonds
6701000	6703000	Primarina it's a real heartbreaker
6703000	6705000	It's not a robot Primarina is the
6705000	6707000	Water fairy type
6707000	6709000	Of course it's a fairy type
6709000	6711000	And it's a mermaid
6711000	6713000	Looking Pokemon and Shane
6713000	6715000	Is not a fan
6715000	6717000	It's also based on a siren
6717000	6719000	So now they also unveiled
6719000	6721000	Some other Pokemon but if you want to hear
6721000	6723000	On that you'll have to tune into the next episode
6723000	6725000	Whenever that is
6725000	6727000	But I will bring up Alolan Persian
6727000	6729000	Form because
6729000	6731000	Alolan Persian looks like
6731000	6733000	Garfield to me
6733000	6735000	And I can't get over it like how
6735000	6737000	Stupid it looks
6737000	6739000	All it did was eat some bees
6739000	6741000	So the other thing on the secondary types for the
6741000	6743000	Starters finals is that ghost dark
6743000	6745000	Fairy forms a
6745000	6747000	Trio kind of the same way that the
6747000	6749000	Fire water grass
6749000	6751000	Interesting observation
6751000	6753000	And those are
6753000	6755000	Like those are newer types too
6755000	6757000	At least dark and fairy
6757000	6759000	Dark is gen 2 and fairy is gen 5
6759000	6761000	Or gen 6
6761000	6763000	It's one of the later ones
6763000	6765000	And then
6765000	6767000	Also apparently
6767000	6769000	You will run into
6769000	6771000	Your old pals
6771000	6773000	Ghost isn't strong against fairy though
6773000	6775000	Right so it's not a complete trio
6775000	6777000	I guess we don't have to talk about
6777000	6779000	No we're just continuing the discussion
6779000	6781000	So red and blue
6781000	6783000	You will run into
6783000	6785000	As part of the game
6785000	6787000	But make sure you knock on their door
6787000	6789000	First before barging in
6789000	6791000	A lot of the stuff I've been seeing on
6791000	6793000	Twitter lately and loving
6793000	6795000	But yeah apparently they're all
6795000	6797000	Grown up now although they don't look that grown up
6797000	6799000	But also I want to point out
6799000	6801000	That blue is actually
6801000	6803000	I can show you some pictures where they look pretty grown up
6803000	6805000	Blue is actually wearing green
6805000	6807000	Capri shorts and green shoes
6807000	6809000	Probably because he's green in Japan
6809000	6811000	Yes I know that
6811000	6813000	I'm just beating you to it
6813000	6815000	I'm just questioning the choice of wardrobe here
6815000	6817000	That's all I'm saying
6817000	6819000	Why are you questioning against green shorts?
6819000	6821000	Because he looks like mom in that wardrobe
6821000	6823000	No he doesn't he just looks super gay
6823000	6825000	Because that's what he is
6825000	6827000	If you watch the trailer and he throws out his Pokemon
6827000	6829000	And then you see him standing behind it
6829000	6831000	Is the flammiest pose I've ever seen
6831000	6833000	Any character in Pokemon
6833000	6835000	Is flammier than a male Primarina
6835000	6837000	And like
6837000	6839000	Go for real
6839000	6841000	Load it up while I can continue talking about Pokemon
6841000	6843000	And then Red has a 96
6843000	6845000	On his shirt to you know
6845000	6847000	Harken back to the fact that they came out in Japan
6847000	6849000	Oh I just thought it was 69 upside down
6849000	6851000	That's all
6851000	6853000	You want me to show you pictures?
6853000	6855000	No no my god
6855000	6857000	The things you see
6857000	6859000	On Tumblr you can't unsee
6859000	6861000	You've been tweeting enough
6861000	6863000	Yeah I just retweet whenever I see
6863000	6865000	If it's like ugly
6865000	6867000	Well to be fair so have I
6867000	6869000	If you just go to Shane and Linko on Twitter
6869000	6871000	I was going to say man that Pokestop Podcast
6871000	6873000	Feed is going to be very interesting
6873000	6875000	Oh god I'm just going to
6875000	6877000	I'm just going to leave the room for 30 minutes
6877000	6879000	While Shane just reads
6879000	6881000	Tumblr porn about Red and Blue
6881000	6883000	Well it's not going to be hard to do
6883000	6885000	I think it's just images at this point mostly
6885000	6887000	Anyway there you go
6887000	6889000	You didn't even talk about
6889000	6891000	Other things that happen in the trailer
6891000	6893000	Because I'm making people wait for the next episode of the Pokestop Podcast
6893000	6895000	Hey also guys if you have the demo
6895000	6897000	There's a demo event today
6897000	6899000	So you better go do it before your timezone changes
6899000	6901000	Now
6901000	6903000	You can check this out if you're in Japan
6903000	6905000	Anyway because I don't think it's coming here
6905000	6907000	Kunio-kun
6907000	6909000	Nekketsu complete Famicom
6909000	6911000	Series is coming out December 8th in Japan
6911000	6913000	This is a 3DS game
6913000	6915000	That's coming out for 4,800 yen
6915000	6917000	Or you can download it for a little cheaper
6917000	6919000	4,444 yen
6919000	6921000	Arc System Works is putting this out
6921000	6923000	And it's going to come with some themes
6923000	6925000	And so forth but you might be wondering
6925000	6927000	Well what is this game?
6927000	6929000	Well this is a collection of every
6929000	6931000	Kunio-kun game that was released
6931000	6933000	For the Famicom
6933000	6935000	This means River City Ransom
6935000	6937000	Super Dodge Ball
6937000	6939000	Renegade
6939000	6941000	Crash and the Boys Street Challenge
6941000	6943000	And other games that never even came out over here
6943000	6945000	Featuring those same characters
6945000	6947000	It's a very unique art style of characters
6947000	6949000	And I'm sure a lot of you know River City Ransom
6949000	6951000	And Super Dodge Ball
6951000	6953000	So this is a collection of all those games
6953000	6955000	There is all to be said 11 games in the collection
6955000	6957000	So it looks like it's going to be a pretty
6957000	6959000	Kickass collection
6959000	6961000	Boy it's a bummer the 3DS isn't region free
6961000	6963000	Yeah thanks Nintendo
6963000	6965000	Just have a Japanese 3DS like what I'm playing right now
6965000	6967000	To be fair they may be switching that
6967000	6969000	With the Switch
6969000	6971000	Apparently the Switch is region free
6971000	6973000	If you believe rumors
6973000	6975000	I don't
6975000	6977000	I believe in disappointment
6979000	6981000	Alright let's travel around

7065000	7067000	At E3 that everybody was kind of going
7067000	7069000	Oh what's this, this is like a space game
7069000	7071000	This looks like it would be cool, and then it's like
7071000	7073000	Call of Duty and everybody's like, oh they just fucking
7073000	7075000	bait and switch to us, that's fucking rude
7075000	7077000	Like
7077000	7079000	I think a lot of us kind of had that reaction
7079000	7081000	I don't know, I may hold off on it because I bought
7081000	7083000	Infinite Warfare, or not Infinite Warfare
7083000	7085000	Advanced Warfare
7085000	7087000	The last one before Black Ops 3 was
7087000	7089000	And like I bought it and I was like
7089000	7091000	Oh season pass, I'm gonna go gung-ho multiplayer
7091000	7093000	Have not played a thing on it
7093000	7095000	It's like a waste of money
7095000	7097000	Just throwing it up, throwing off that money
7097000	7099000	And just a quick FYI from the chatroom
7099000	7101000	Loki's Xanadu
7101000	7103000	Not a Olivia Newton-John movie
7103000	7105000	Dungeon Buster clarifying
7105000	7107000	Xanadu next is another of
7107000	7109000	Falcom's RPGs, that's the
7109000	7111000	studio behind the Ys series
7111000	7113000	Not to be confused with Ys
7113000	7115000	It's Ys, that's how you say it
7115000	7117000	So yeah, it's that
7117000	7119000	same type of game
7119000	7121000	RPG in that fashion
7121000	7123000	Based around the Xanadu movie
7123000	7125000	Yes, where it's starring a roller rink
7125000	7127000	And cartoon sequences
7127000	7129000	that make no damn sense and so forth
7129000	7131000	Alright, anyway
7131000	7133000	That is such a good movie though
7133000	7135000	Moving on, oh actually now see
7135000	7137000	Rageonator brings up, I remember
7137000	7139000	Fushanadu, or in fact
7139000	7141000	Xanadu is what a lot of people said
7141000	7143000	Pretty good game and I love the title
7143000	7145000	Screen theme, that was a great NES game
7145000	7147000	I love that game to this day
7147000	7149000	Great game, anyway
7149000	7151000	Let's travel to Japan, quick, everybody on the plane
7151000	7153000	Let's go, whee, alright
7153000	7155000	Coming out in Japan on
7155000	7157000	November the 2nd on the PlayStation 4
7157000	7159000	Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2
7159000	7161000	And Atelier Firis
7161000	7163000	Fushigi Na Taibo no
7163000	7165000	Renken Jutsuji
7165000	7167000	In a regular premium box
7167000	7169000	Special collection box with a music
7169000	7171000	Combo set for
7171000	7173000	349 bucks
7173000	7175000	That's a lot of money
7175000	7177000	So yeah, that is all stuff to look forward to
7177000	7179000	This week in Japan on the PlayStation 4
7179000	7181000	I don't think
7181000	7183000	There's anything of note on the Wii U
7183000	7185000	I think things are very quiet over there
7185000	7187000	So look at the handhelds real quick
7187000	7189000	On the Nintendo 3DS
7189000	7191000	Actually there's nothing on the 3DS this week
7191000	7193000	They're getting pumped up for Sun and Moon
7193000	7195000	There's a new, yeah I was gonna say the new
7195000	7197000	3DS XL Sun and Moon edition
7197000	7199000	That's it, there's really nothing
7199000	7201000	It's kinda, kinda quiet on the 3DS
7201000	7203000	Well, at least you still have
7203000	7205000	releases on the Vita where that same
7205000	7207000	Atelier Firis game is
7207000	7209000	also being released on
7209000	7211000	the 3rd
7211000	7213000	And that seems to be the tent pole for the week
7213000	7215000	I'm not familiar with that series
7215000	7217000	But that must be, what is that called
7217000	7219000	over here? Do they have that series here?
7221000	7223000	Which one? Atelier
7223000	7225000	Yeah they have Atelier
7225000	7227000	I just never got into this series then
7227000	7229000	They have a ton of them
7229000	7231000	It was like about once a year
7231000	7233000	So yeah, that's a big release in Japan this week
7233000	7235000	It looks like at least the only one that's releasing over there
7235000	7237000	So that's pretty much it for Japanese releases
7237000	7239000	Alright, well
7239000	7241000	PC's not, or I'm sorry
7241000	7243000	Europe is not getting much
7243000	7245000	Including, well, Football Manager 2017 on PC
7245000	7247000	It doesn't list it but I'm pretty sure
7247000	7249000	Call of Duty Infinite Warfare is also coming out
7249000	7251000	the same day there as well
7251000	7253000	That's it
7253000	7255000	Alright
7255000	7257000	Let's get back into some news
7257000	7259000	Because usually we would do the mailbag right now
7259000	7261000	But the mailbag's empty
7261000	7263000	That's the second week in a row
7263000	7265000	Is it because you guys miss Jamie?
7265000	7267000	I understand. Do you miss Jamie criticizing your emails?
7267000	7269000	If you want, I'll criticize your grammar
7269000	7271000	I'll do it
7271000	7273000	I'll make Shane read emails or something
7273000	7275000	He'll love that
7275000	7277000	He'll criticize your name
7277000	7279000	He'll criticize wherever you're emailing us from
7279000	7281000	Your opinion is probably garbage
7281000	7283000	So I'll criticize that too
7283000	7285000	It's a show where every gamer has a voice
7285000	7287000	And then Shane yells back at said voice
7287000	7289000	Anyway, participate
7289000	7291000	I don't deal with stupidity so if you're going to be stupid
7291000	7293000	Just watch out
7293000	7295000	We don't have stupid listeners, Shane
7295000	7297000	Well, do you want me to start?
7297000	7299000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
7299000	7301000	And don't worry
7301000	7303000	Shane's going to be too lazy to show up to the show next week
7303000	7305000	Probably so
7305000	7307000	He will be too busy playing more Pokemon or something
7307000	7309000	Alright
7309000	7311000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
7311000	7313000	Actually, you could send an email where you rant about Shane
7313000	7315000	I would love that
7315000	7317000	And then I'll come over
7317000	7319000	That would be hilarious
7319000	7321000	Especially because he moved
7321000	7323000	And now he's a little bit closer
7323000	7325000	Not too close, far enough away
7325000	7327000	What would happen is I'd read the email
7327000	7329000	This is John Doe
7329000	7331000	And I'm emailing him
7331000	7333000	Talking about how much I hate Shane
7333000	7335000	By the time I'd be done reading the email
7335000	7337000	Shane wouldn't even knock
7337000	7339000	He'd just barge through the door
7339000	7341000	And he'd just say, hold on a minute
7341000	7343000	I got something to say
7343000	7345000	I got something to say
7345000	7347000	Alright, let's get back into some news
7347000	7349000	Aw, strangers with candy
7349000	7351000	You know last night at Rocky Horror
7351000	7353000	I made a strangers with candy joke on TV
7353000	7355000	I said something about going back to high school
7355000	7357000	And I said, I was a user, a boozer, and a loser
7357000	7359000	And I counted
7359000	7361000	Two people in the audience laughed
7361000	7363000	See, you're just pointing out all the reasons
7363000	7365000	Why that is a stupid thing to go to
7365000	7367000	Shut up
7367000	7369000	You should have thrown in, I stole the TV
7369000	7371000	I know, I should have
7371000	7373000	Did you catch that joke?
7373000	7375000	Oh my god, it's only the best
7375000	7377000	Okay, is it still on Netflix and Hulu
7377000	7379000	No, it's not on Netflix
7379000	7381000	It might be on Hulu still
7381000	7383000	But it's long gone from Netflix
7383000	7385000	Okay, I'm telling you guys, strangers with candy
7385000	7387000	Which was a
7387000	7389000	Comedy central show in the late 90s
7389000	7391000	Late 90s, early 2000s
7391000	7393000	It stars Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert
7393000	7395000	Before he had the whole success
7395000	7397000	Of the Daily Show
7397000	7399000	And they're on this show
7399000	7401000	And it's about a 40 year old woman
7401000	7403000	That goes back to high school
7403000	7405000	After she was in jail, basically, for so long
7405000	7407000	It's so good
7407000	7409000	It's a parody of those self-help movies
7409000	7411000	From the 70s
7411000	7413000	I've seen the movie, it's on YouTube
7413000	7415000	That it's all based on
7415000	7417000	I was at my rock bottom
7417000	7419000	It's like one of those scared stiffs
7419000	7421000	It's still on Hulu
7421000	7423000	Is that the Hulu Plus or the Hulu Free?
7423000	7425000	There is no Hulu Free anymore
7425000	7427000	Get rid of it
7427000	7429000	But if you have Hulu, check out Strangers with Candy
7429000	7431000	Because it is Rob Roberts' favorite TV show ever made
7431000	7433000	There is a movie too
7433000	7435000	Yeah, I think the movie's not that great
7435000	7437000	The movie's not as good as the show
7437000	7439000	But it's a good cheat
7439000	7441000	It's a good cheat
7441000	7443000	Wasn't the movie the one where she stabbed somebody with a fork
7443000	7445000	Or something like that?
7445000	7447000	I think so, yeah
7447000	7449000	I do have to say, not having seen Strangers with Candy
7449000	7451000	Was that episode really confusing?
7451000	7453000	Oh yeah, because they did the trivia
7453000	7455000	That's right, no, none of that would have made sense
7455000	7457000	If you've never seen Strangers with Candy
7457000	7459000	So you owe it to yourself to watch this show
7459000	7461000	And you should watch the episode
7461000	7463000	The spelling episode
7463000	7465000	The spelling bean
7465000	7467000	And...
7467000	7469000	That's probably the best episode of the show they ever did
7469000	7471000	That was in the second season
7471000	7473000	I don't know, because there's also the one with the blind guy
7473000	7475000	And that one's really good too
7475000	7477000	What's the name of that episode?
7477000	7479000	Wait, is it that one?
7479000	7481000	No, it's the blank page
7481000	7483000	That's it
7483000	7485000	And then it's the fourth episode
7485000	7487000	In the first season
7487000	7489000	Who Wants Cake
7489000	7491000	That is great
7491000	7493000	And Stephen Colbert's character
7493000	7495000	In that show
7495000	7497000	Is the funniest thing in the world
7497000	7499000	So please do yourself a favor
7499000	7501000	And watch that show
7501000	7503000	There you go
7503000	7505000	Kaijuto says
7505000	7507000	It was just the echo of Rob's laugh
7507000	7509000	And the silence
7509000	7511000	Oh no, there were definitely people laughing
7511000	7513000	There were people laughing loudly
7513000	7515000	Just there weren't very many of them
7515000	7517000	So the people who got it really loved it
7517000	7519000	Yeah
7519000	7521000	And I'm not afraid to waste everybody's time
7521000	7523000	With a joke that only two people are gonna get
7523000	7525000	And really get
7525000	7527000	I mean, that's kind of the beauty of Rocky
7527000	7529000	A lot of things will just fly over your head if you don't get it
7529000	7531000	But it's funny for the people who are there for it
7531000	7533000	It is, it is
7533000	7535000	Alright, see what happens when you don't email us
7535000	7537000	We talk about Hulu
7537000	7539000	Alright, let's move on
7539000	7541000	With some more gaming news stories
7541000	7543000	So once again, this was something I didn't actually
7543000	7545000	Watch, I was busy watching
7545000	7547000	The Microsoft conference
7547000	7549000	And apparently there was an Apple conference
7549000	7551000	Going on at the same time, or near
7551000	7553000	The same time
7553000	7555000	Close enough
7555000	7557000	I just didn't care
7557000	7559000	But yeah, they were talking
7559000	7561000	A little bit about Apple TV
7561000	7563000	One thing I wanted to mention is
7563000	7565000	Hey, Minecraft is coming to Apple TV
7565000	7567000	Because Minecraft is coming to everything
7567000	7569000	Something that is kind of cool about it
7569000	7571000	You will be able to play your Minecraft worlds
7571000	7573000	With other users that are also on other Apple devices
7573000	7575000	Like iPads and iPhones
7575000	7577000	And
7577000	7579000	Yeah
7579000	7581000	And that's coming at some point
7581000	7583000	So you like Minecraft
7583000	7585000	Do you think this is a good idea for Apple TV?
7585000	7587000	Sure, I mean, it's always good to have
7587000	7589000	More things that it can do
7589000	7591000	I mean, I didn't get an Apple
7591000	7593000	I looked at
7593000	7595000	I talked someone out of getting an Apple TV
7595000	7597000	Because they were looking for streaming devices
7597000	7599000	For their home, and it's like, oh yeah
7599000	7601000	This doesn't have a remote on it
7601000	7603000	Your remote is an iPhone
7603000	7605000	It's like, no it's not, you get a remote
7605000	7607000	With Apple TVs, not that one
7607000	7609000	That I looked at, they should all come with them
7609000	7611000	They come with a really garbage one, but yeah
7611000	7613000	They should have a little silver one, yeah
7613000	7615000	But then again, this is a qualified
7615000	7617000	Walmart employee, so
7617000	7619000	Very possible that he did no shit
7619000	7621000	Just saying, no
7621000	7623000	Hey, yeah, you
7623000	7625000	Know that you need an
7625000	7627000	iPhone to control, and I was like
7627000	7629000	Fuck that shit
7629000	7631000	Yeah, no, the guy was an idiot, because they
7631000	7633000	Definitely come with remotes, I've seen it
7633000	7635000	I thought so, but he was very insistent
7635000	7637000	And I was like, well I'm not going to have you buy this
7637000	7639000	When you can just buy Roku for 40 bucks
7639000	7641000	So forget it
7641000	7643000	Alright, well I'm kind of surprised
7643000	7645000	That there isn't more gaming on Apple
7645000	7647000	TV, like I know there was like that harmonics
7647000	7649000	Game, and there's a few things here and there, but it's just like
7649000	7651000	You feel like
7651000	7653000	How long do you think it is going to be before they get into VR
7653000	7655000	Because I have a feeling that Apple will try to
7655000	7657000	Do something, you know
7657000	7659000	I'm really surprised they haven't, but sometimes
7659000	7661000	They show up to the party late, and they'll put their own
7661000	7663000	Little spin on it, they have to figure out how to market it
7663000	7665000	Like they market all the other stuff, you know what I mean
7665000	7667000	We're Apple, we're releasing something, go buy it
7667000	7669000	Yeah, we'll see
7669000	7671000	Anyway, well speaking of the Apple
7671000	7673000	Platform, one thing that people are very much
7673000	7675000	Looking forward to is Super Mario
7675000	7677000	Run, now obviously
7677000	7679000	This isn't restricted to just the Apple
7679000	7681000	Platform, although I think it's coming out there first
7681000	7683000	Before it comes out on the Android devices
7683000	7685000	Just like every game
7685000	7687000	Not always, Ingress was on Android
7687000	7689000	Before it was on iOS, of course
7689000	7691000	But only because it was developed by Google
7691000	7693000	It was developed by a spin-off Google team, yeah
7693000	7695000	Anyway, so apparently
7695000	7697000	Nintendo is really determined to make
7697000	7699000	This a huge game
7699000	7701000	This was in an interview with Bloomberg
7701000	7703000	Where Tatsume Kimishima
7703000	7705000	Who of course is the president
7705000	7707000	Of Nintendo right now, said
7707000	7709000	In terms of expectations, we all saw what happened
7709000	7711000	When we delivered Pokemon Go
7711000	7713000	You delivered Pokemon Go?
7713000	7715000	Hold on
7715000	7717000	Nintendo really didn't do anything with Pokemon Go
7717000	7719000	Let's get that clear first
7719000	7721000	They provided the intellectual property
7721000	7723000	That's it, but anyway
7723000	7725000	In terms of expectations, we all saw what happened when we
7725000	7727000	Delivered Pokemon Go, and honestly I was quite surprised by it
7727000	7729000	Myself, there's no doubt that
7729000	7731000	More people are using smartphones to play games
7731000	7733000	And at this time we're using
7733000	7735000	And as this time we're using
7735000	7737000	Mario, that's a very important
7737000	7739000	Intellectual property for us
7739000	7741000	And that's what Miyamoto's team is working on now
7741000	7743000	Making sure it spreads out
7743000	7745000	Just as quickly as Pokemon Go
7745000	7747000	More than 20 million people
7747000	7749000	Have already registered to receive
7749000	7751000	Notifications when the game is available
7751000	7753000	Continuing with some comments
7753000	7755000	In terms of the game itself
7755000	7757000	You can download it and play a certain part of it
7757000	7759000	And then pay a fixed price
7759000	7761000	And play it over and over as many times as you want
7761000	7763000	Without having to pay anything extra
7763000	7765000	And that should give peace of mind that kids can play it
7765000	7767000	And we're hoping that it will help it become
7767000	7769000	More popular
7769000	7771000	So there's no limited Pokeballs
7771000	7773000	Or incubators or any of that stuff
7773000	7775000	So it will be one fee
7775000	7777000	That's going to be the whole game
7777000	7779000	We knew that was coming, they've said that before
7779000	7781000	It was going to be one of those typical iPhone games
7781000	7783000	It's basically now everything's shareware
7783000	7785000	Again, you get the first episode free
7785000	7787000	You've got to pay to unlock it
7787000	7789000	That's what Super Mario Run is going to be
7789000	7791000	It's going to be shareware
7791000	7793000	I mean, I like the shareware model
7793000	7795000	Those are my first games
7795000	7797000	Yeah, don't get me wrong, I like that model
7797000	7799000	Bigger than Pokemon Go, Loki?
7799000	7801000	I would way rather something be shareware for real
7801000	7803000	Than to try to be freemium
7803000	7805000	And just nickel and dime you out of everything
7805000	7807000	You know
7807000	7809000	If they're talking about the biggest Pokemon Go at launch
7809000	7811000	No, and I'll tell you why
7811000	7813000	Pokemon Go is free, for one
7813000	7815000	Pokemon Go was kind of a unique gameplay thing
7815000	7817000	Where actually
7817000	7819000	People were never really exposed to this kind of
7819000	7821000	Augmented reality thing
7821000	7823000	Versus a licensed runner
7823000	7825000	I'm sorry
7825000	7827000	Even if it is Mario
7827000	7829000	It'll be popular
7829000	7831000	Don't get me wrong, but they're not going to
7831000	7833000	Fucking do news stories about it
7833000	7835000	People aren't gathering at fucking parks for it
7835000	7837000	It's not going to be like that
7837000	7839000	Because it's not bringing anything that unique
7839000	7841000	To the table
7841000	7843000	It's a Mario game, which people have been waiting for
7843000	7845000	But it's a fucking runner
7845000	7847000	I'm sorry, it's just kind of
7847000	7849000	Whatever, cool
7849000	7851000	I think the game will be huge
7851000	7853000	It will be Candy Crush huge
7853000	7855000	It will be, you know, draw something huge
7855000	7857000	It will not be Pokemon Go huge
7857000	7859000	Because, and you're kind of hitting the nail on the head
7859000	7861000	It's not going to have that same effect
7861000	7863000	Where it's on the news and all this stuff
7863000	7865000	Because it's not a social game
7865000	7867000	Pokemon Go became a very social thing
7867000	7869000	Where you got together with friends
7869000	7871000	And you all downloaded the game
7871000	7873000	And you went out into the real world
7873000	7875000	And there's all the, oh you're walking and exercising
7875000	7877000	There's nothing like this
7877000	7879000	Mario Run's not going to have that
7879000	7881000	But that's not to say the game's not going to do extremely well
7881000	7883000	It's going to do very well for Nintendo
7883000	7885000	It's going to be number one in the store
7885000	7887000	For some time
7887000	7889000	It's just not going to be Pokemon Go levels
7889000	7891000	And also if it's a purchase game
7891000	7893000	Even if people don't like it, then they buy it
7893000	7895000	Because it's Mario, that's going to drive a lot of sales
7895000	7897000	And that actually, that's the thing
7897000	7899000	I really hope it's a good game
7899000	7901000	But the fact that they have a part of it that's free
7901000	7903000	If it's not a great game
7903000	7905000	You're not going to get that conversion I think
7905000	7907000	That's true
7907000	7909000	I still think people will download it
7909000	7911000	Just because it's Mario
7911000	7913000	Well they'll download it, but they might not buy it
7913000	7915000	And Nintendo's only going to report on who downloads it
7915000	7917000	They're not going to report on who buys it
7917000	7919000	Anyway, MXC in chat says
7919000	7921000	Could it be bigger than Pokemon Go
7921000	7923000	Since it will be iOS exclusive to start
7923000	7925000	That's a very good point
7925000	7929000	Well Pokemon Go couldn't afford to be only iOS only at start
7929000	7931000	Because then it would have locked out these situations
7931000	7935000	Like if JD and I wanted to go to Old Town Sack or something to play
7935000	7937000	We couldn't do it because JD's on Android and I'm on iOS
7937000	7939000	So it would have cut that element out of it
7939000	7941000	Now with Super Mario Run, again
7941000	7943000	Because the social element isn't the same
7943000	7945000	They can get away with doing that
7945000	7947000	But you bring up a darn good point
7947000	7949000	How can they meet those kind of numbers
7949000	7953000	When it's not even going to be on both platforms at first
7953000	7955000	And I think it also may show Nintendo a little bit though
7955000	7957000	It should really show them
7957000	7961000	Because they've kind of missed the boat on a lot of this social gaming stuff for a very long time
7961000	7963000	I mean, yeah, sure, Miiverse
7963000	7967000	I know they're very big on parties in the same room and so forth
7967000	7969000	But there's a whole other element to online gaming
7969000	7971000	That Nintendo's just kind of slept on for a long time
7971000	7975000	Well, I think they also don't know how to handle it
7975000	7979000	Because Nintendo is so focused on their family friendly, all ages audience
7979000	7983000	And you just can't subject that to the internet without losing some of that
7983000	7987000	You know, that's I think one of the reasons why
7987000	7991000	All of the chat and the friending and stuff is so locked down on all of the things
7991000	7995000	Doing a code exchange handshake thing like with DS and all of that
7995000	7999000	It's designed to make sure you're not just adding random people
7999000	8003000	That's why Nintendo is not very good at social
8003000	8007000	Because it's not designed to be explosive, viral, social growth
8007000	8011000	I'm a little pissed they took away my swap notes so I can't send my friend's dicks anymore
8011000	8013000	On 3DS
8013000	8015000	Good thing you have Snapchat for that
8015000	8017000	But that's not Nintendo
8017000	8019000	See, it's a missed opportunity
8019000	8021000	I can't send to Snapchat and have it go
8021000	8025000	Nintendo needs to put Mario stickers in Snapchat
8025000	8029000	Maybe they will when Super Mario Run comes out, who knows
8029000	8031000	Alright, moving on, Loki
8031000	8035000	So there's some more developments in the ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus
8035000	8037000	The two main points from this
8037000	8043000	One, they are issuing a subpoena to Samsung
8043000	8049000	To basically get some information related to Samsung's use of the source code and technology
8049000	8053000	Provided by Oculus in order to create the Samsung Gear VR
8053000	8057000	So because of that they have to comply within three weeks
8057000	8059000	I guess of this lawsuit
8059000	8063000	The other thing is that they are issuing
8063000	8075000	They want Oculus to provide the imaging of the hard drive from John Carmack
8075000	8079000	As part of this discovery right now
8079000	8083000	It's interesting to see they're dragging Samsung into this as well
8083000	8087000	God, I hope there's no Hillary Clinton emails on that
8087000	8089000	Let's not even go there
8089000	8091000	I'm a little late for that now
8091000	8093000	You know, a couple more days
8093000	8095000	Sorry, I couldn't help myself
8095000	8097000	People will not just shut the fuck up about it
8097000	8099000	Never could the FBI director
8099000	8101000	Does she have any porn or emails?
8101000	8103000	Because that's really all that I'm interested in
8103000	8105000	She's getting subscriptions from like
8105000	8107000	I'm sure that it's not in hers
8107000	8109000	Alright, back to
8109000	8113000	Then again, if you've been reading about where the emails were found
8113000	8115000	Maybe there was porn there, but nobody wants to see it
8115000	8117000	Anyway, back to
8117000	8121000	Back to the ZeniMax Oculus thing
8121000	8123000	So what, any chance they're going to settle out of court?
8123000	8125000	Isn't that how these
8125000	8127000	All these lawsuit stories are
8127000	8129000	And then they settle out of court
8129000	8131000	I think ZeniMax has the eye and the prize there
8131000	8133000	They're hoping to get the big payout
8133000	8135000	So I don't think there's going to be any settling
8135000	8139000	If ZeniMax does end up winning
8139000	8141000	Can you use that money to please patch your games?
8141000	8143000	Fix that shit?
8143000	8145000	Because, I don't know
8146000	8148000	Well, if you are a fan of classic games
8148000	8150000	Like us here at Orange Lounge Radio
8150000	8152000	You can be
8152000	8156000	Confident that GameStop is trying to build up more of the classic gaming
8156000	8158000	In their stores
8158000	8160000	Which is ironic because they stopped taking trades of classic games
8160000	8162000	Not too long ago
8162000	8164000	Yeah, they were kind of like, nah, we're kind of over that
8164000	8166000	But now they're back doing it
8166000	8168000	GameStop is now accepting retro consoles as trade-ins
8168000	8170000	This originally was a pilot thing
8170000	8172000	But it was a success
8172000	8174000	So all stores nationwide
8174000	8180000	Will now accept NESes, Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast games
8180000	8186000	They will also take Sega Saturns, Game Boy Colors in advance, GameCube, and Xbox
8186000	8189000	Are they just taking them or are they selling them again?
8189000	8192000	I think they are taking them
8192000	8194000	And they're probably either selling them online
8194000	8196000	Or I know the way they used to do it
8196000	8198000	Is like one store in the area was kind of like the retro store
8198000	8200000	But I don't know what they're doing now
8200000	8202000	As far as the turnaround
8202000	8204000	I don't know if they're selling them online
8204000	8206000	But sell them on eBay
8206000	8210000	Yeah, I mean it seems like if all they're going to do is just sell it online
8210000	8212000	Like it doesn't make any sense from the consumer's perspective
8212000	8214000	To not just do it at all
8214000	8216000	Like if I were to buy a retro console
8216000	8218000	I sure as hell wouldn't buy it from GameStop
8218000	8220000	I'd buy it from eBay
8220000	8222000	Or some other online source
8222000	8224000	Or from another independent game store that would probably have that stuff
8224000	8226000	I think there's going to be a lot of people though
8226000	8228000	That dig up these cartridges
8228000	8230000	And then they hear that, oh, GameStop's buying these
8230000	8232000	They're going to go unload the games at GameStop
8232000	8234000	Because they don't
8234000	8236000	Yeah, they're hoping that
8236000	8238000	Oh, hey, look at you
8238000	8240000	You got a nice sealed Chrono Trigger there
8240000	8242000	We'll give you two cents for that
8242000	8244000	Yeah, exactly, right? We'll give you $2.50
8244000	8246000	In-store credit
8246000	8248000	Anyway, I mean
8248000	8250000	I'm a big retro game fan
8250000	8252000	So I guess this is cool
8252000	8254000	I like going to flea markets
8254000	8256000	And finding stuff there
8256000	8258000	Sometimes you find some gems there
8258000	8260000	Although the people who specialize
8260000	8262000	In selling games at flea markets
8262000	8264000	They know what they're doing
8264000	8266000	You're not going to find deals there
8266000	8268000	But sometimes you find games amongst other stuff
8268000	8270000	And that's where you find the best stuff
8270000	8272000	Yard sales
8272000	8274000	Yeah, it's basically yard sales, for sure
8274000	8276000	But I guess that's cool that all the retro stuff
8276000	8278000	Is kind of coming back
8278000	8280000	I find it very interesting that Genesis
8280000	8282000	Is in that list because I think back to
8282000	8284000	We were at Target today
8284000	8286000	And one thing I noticed in the video game area
8286000	8288000	There's an Atari Flashback 7
8288000	8290000	For God's sake, they're up to 7
8290000	8292000	How different new stuff could they
8292000	8294000	Possibly have on that now?
8294000	8296000	It's got to be HDMI at this point
8296000	8298000	Yeah, I'm sure they've judged
8298000	8300000	HDMI, man, I'm sure the upscaling
8300000	8302000	Of that 4-bit graphics
8302000	8304000	But then
8304000	8306000	They also had a Genesis
8306000	8308000	System that had a bunch
8308000	8310000	Of the Sonic games, of course
8310000	8312000	Altered Beast, which you'd expect
8312000	8314000	And I guess somehow, amongst the
8314000	8316000	Midway closure, they picked
8316000	8318000	Up the rights to Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3
8318000	8320000	The Genesis versions
8320000	8322000	So those are all on there as well
8322000	8324000	And then I believe the Genesis flashbacks have
8324000	8326000	Some homegrown games on them
8326000	8328000	In fact, you notice when you look at the back of the box
8328000	8330000	Some of the pictures are big
8330000	8332000	Which are all like the Sega games
8332000	8334000	And there's a bunch of small pictures
8334000	8336000	I've never heard of any of these games
8336000	8338000	I think they're homegrown games that are in there
8338000	8340000	So that's kind of interesting that they do that with Flashback
8340000	8342000	Yeah, they did that with the Coleco one
8342000	8344000	These aren't very good
8344000	8346000	But I think the Atari one does that too
8346000	8348000	I think some of those games on there are homegrown games
8348000	8350000	But then there also was a Genesis
8350000	8352000	Portable system that was like
8352000	8354000	The exact same thing, it was like a Flashback
8354000	8356000	But they actually called it
8356000	8358000	A Game Gear
8358000	8360000	Flashback or something
8360000	8362000	It was like the name, it actually had a little
8362000	8364000	Tie-in to what the Sega handheld
8364000	8366000	Used to be called
8366000	8368000	And you could have a handheld
8368000	8370000	One of these, and it was relatively
8370000	8372000	Cheap, I think it was only like 30 bucks
8372000	8374000	For the handheld
8374000	8376000	But I still didn't buy one
8376000	8378000	Because I'm like, okay, I don't need
8378000	8380000	A Genesis handheld, I'm never going to play it
8380000	8382000	But I thought that was neat that that was
8382000	8384000	Out there, but also the reason why I bring that up
8384000	8386000	Is that kind of stuff
8386000	8388000	Is kind of becoming more and more where it's like
8388000	8390000	You have the consoles with the games built in
8390000	8392000	Is there going to be a market of people
8392000	8394000	Looking to buy a second-hand Genesis system
8394000	8396000	At GameStop
8396000	8398000	Some people there are collectors
8398000	8400000	Probably, but I just don't know
8400000	8402000	If you'd really want to do it that route
8402000	8404000	Because it would be cheaper probably
8404000	8406000	Just to buy a system that has a lot of that stuff
8406000	8408000	Built in, or even buy one of those systems
8408000	8410000	Buy a flash card, if you're not looking
8410000	8412000	To collect the actual stuff
8412000	8414000	You're just looking for those games
8414000	8416000	Buy a flash card, really cheap
8416000	8418000	And then download all the ROMs to it
8418000	8420000	Or you can buy
8420000	8422000	The Nintendo Classic system that's coming out in a couple weeks
8422000	8424000	Thank you for bringing that up
8424000	8426000	Because I was going to say, Nintendo is also getting into this game
8426000	8428000	Big time, I'm sure a lot of you
8428000	8430000	Are looking at that Nintendo
8430000	8432000	Classic thing that's coming out
8432000	8434000	That's coming out in two weeks
8434000	8436000	Yeah, next week really
8436000	8438000	Well, not next week, but the week after next
8438000	8440000	Very, very soon
8440000	8442000	Yeah
8442000	8444000	Cool
8444000	8446000	Alright, so yeah
8446000	8448000	Those are some things you can trade in at GameStop
8448000	8450000	Who probably also sells
8450000	8452000	The Flashback consoles, I imagine they have to
8452000	8454000	Alright
8454000	8456000	In any sense they will
8456000	8458000	Well, it might depend on the size of the store too
8458000	8460000	The mall ones that are really small may not have room for them
8460000	8462000	But the one we were at today was a strip mall one
8462000	8464000	That's huge, so some of the GameStops are a lot bigger than others
8464000	8466000	Alright, anyway
8466000	8468000	Let's move on, Loki, one more story from you
8468000	8470000	And then we're going to get calls here soon
8470000	8472000	Okay, so this is pretty cool
8472000	8474000	I have no interest in going to Blizzcon
8474000	8476000	But
8476000	8478000	Now I have slightly more interest
8478000	8480000	If I were going
8480000	8482000	Weirdo Yankovic
8482000	8484000	This is going to be the actual
8484000	8486000	Music act at Blizzcon
8486000	8488000	This year
8488000	8490000	And that is the best band
8490000	8492000	Musician whatever they've ever had
8492000	8494000	Closing the show at Blizzcon
8494000	8496000	I'm sorry, and by the way
8496000	8498000	Remember earlier in the show I said Metallica
8498000	8500000	Did it one year
8500000	8502000	Blink 182 did it recently
8502000	8504000	And I'm trying to think, they've had a lot of those
8504000	8506000	Types of bands
8506000	8508000	Right, we were talking about the different types of music
8508000	8510000	Well, it's always been kind of like that type of music
8510000	8512000	It's awesome that Weirdo Yankovic is doing it
8512000	8514000	It's a great choice
8514000	8516000	And it kind of makes you go, why haven't they done this before?
8516000	8518000	Why didn't they have Weirdo Owl before?
8518000	8520000	Maybe this first year it worked out
8520000	8522000	He's just such a geek, you know
8522000	8524000	And there's great overlap there
8524000	8526000	Yeah, it's great overlap
8526000	8528000	That almost, almost
8528000	8530000	I'm not going to, but it almost makes me want to buy the stream
8530000	8532000	I might
8532000	8534000	He's probably listening
8534000	8536000	Maybe I'll buy it for Allen
8536000	8538000	If they have an Overwatch
8538000	8540000	Because he plays a lot of Overwatch
8540000	8542000	So I think Allen would really appreciate it
8542000	8544000	They do have a Bastion skin
8544000	8546000	Do they? Well, he never plays Bastion
8546000	8548000	So maybe I don't need to get it for him
8548000	8550000	If you're interested in that virtual ticket
8550000	8552000	$40 gets you the concert
8552000	8554000	As well as the panels and the rest of the show
8554000	8556000	I mean, it's cheaper than a concert ticket
8556000	8558000	Oh no, that's next weekend, isn't it?
8558000	8560000	Yeah, November 4th
8560000	8562000	It's not Veterans Day weekend
8562000	8564000	Like it usually is, it's the weekend before
8564000	8566000	So that's pretty cool
8566000	8568000	I'm excited, yay Weird Al
8568000	8570000	And what a great choice there
8570000	8572000	I hope the concert blows the roof off
8572000	8574000	And Blizzard goes, we should do more music like this
8574000	8576000	In the future
8576000	8578000	Anyhow, so here we are towards the end of the show
8578000	8580000	And usually the phrase
8580000	8582000	Would be something a little different
8582000	8584000	But I think tonight we should best say
8584000	8586000	Last and certainly least
8586000	8588000	We have a story
8588000	8590000	About
8590000	8592000	Uwe Boll
8592000	8594000	Remember him? Do you remember Uwe Boll?
8594000	8596000	Isn't he the guy who did the lawsuit over Kadabra?
8596000	8598000	Or no, that's Yuri Geller
8598000	8600000	No, no
8600000	8602000	No, you think he's somebody else
8602000	8604000	Uwe Boll was the great
8604000	8606000	Director
8606000	8608000	Of video game movies
8608000	8610000	Such as House of the Dead
8610000	8612000	Alone in the Dark
8612000	8614000	Postal
8614000	8616000	BloodRayne
8616000	8618000	Name of the King, a dungeon siege tale
8618000	8620000	Well folks, it was announced this week
8620000	8622000	That Uwe Boll
8622000	8624000	Is retiring from
8624000	8626000	Filmmaking, that's right
8626000	8628000	He's chosen to retire from the film industry
8628000	8630000	Because, shock of shocks
8630000	8632000	He was no longer making money from it
8632000	8634000	Can't imagine why
8634000	8636000	Actually he was saying that he was
8636000	8638000	Losing capital financing his movies
8638000	8640000	Himself, in a quote he said
8640000	8642000	The market is dead
8642000	8644000	You don't make any money anymore on movies
8644000	8646000	Because the DVD and Blu-ray market
8646000	8648000	Worldwide has dropped 80%
8648000	8650000	In the last three years
8650000	8652000	That is the real reason I just cannot
8652000	8654000	Afford to make movies
8654000	8656000	Well
8656000	8658000	Yeah, you can't
8658000	8660000	Uwe Boll
8660000	8662000	You could sell your movies to Netflix
8662000	8664000	Or Amazon or Hulu
8664000	8666000	If they were any fucking good
8666000	8668000	At all
8668000	8670000	But that's the part that's missing
8670000	8672000	Is these movies
8672000	8674000	Are
8674000	8676000	Shit
8676000	8678000	They're really bad
8679000	8681000	Unfortunately
8681000	8683000	I think there's a Roku app for that
8683000	8685000	I kind of want a movie app called Shitflix
8685000	8687000	That's just like really bad movies
8687000	8689000	I'm pretty sure there's like
8689000	8691000	Gonna be like pornos called that
8691000	8693000	Uh oh
8693000	8695000	Well no, I like that though
8695000	8697000	No, I like that like really bad B movies
8697000	8699000	There's a lot of interesting
8699000	8701000	Apps on the Roku that are
8701000	8703000	You know, have to do with films and stuff
8703000	8705000	There might be just like an equivalent of the Razzie
8705000	8707000	You know like
8708000	8710000	Anyway, Uwe Boll
8710000	8712000	Continued to rant saying
8712000	8714000	I've been using my money since 2005
8714000	8716000	And if I hadn't made this stupid video game
8716000	8718000	Based movies, I would never
8718000	8720000	Have amalgamated the capital
8720000	8722000	So I could say, let's make the Darfur movie
8722000	8724000	I don't need a Ferrari, I don't need a yacht
8724000	8726000	I'm invested in my own movies and I
8726000	8728000	Lost money
8728000	8730000	By the way, he has one more film coming out
8730000	8732000	It's his final director effort
8732000	8734000	It's called Rampage, President Down
8734000	8736000	Please tell me that's not based on
8736000	8738000	I hope it isn't, please
8738000	8740000	Please
8740000	8742000	That would be an interesting game to turn into a movie
8742000	8744000	Well, Uwe Boll
8744000	8746000	I got two words for you
8746000	8748000	Bye Felicia
8748000	8750000	Now you gotta find out about this
8750000	8752000	Rampage
8752000	8754000	Rageinator in chat says
8754000	8756000	In fairness, his movies
8756000	8758000	They have a trailer, it looks generic
8758000	8760000	In fairness, his movies have to improve
8760000	8762000	Dramatically to qualify as shit
8762000	8764000	You insulted shit movies everywhere
8765000	8767000	I apologize
8767000	8769000	I apologize deeply
8769000	8771000	You gotta love the
8771000	8773000	Tagline
8773000	8775000	This bill will not be vetoed
8775000	8777000	Really?
8779000	8781000	That's just bad
8781000	8783000	For some reason I hear Arnold Schwarzenegger in my mind
8783000	8785000	Saying that line
8785000	8787000	Not to be vetoed
8787000	8789000	Do not veto it
8789000	8791000	Who stars in this movie?
8791000	8793000	I use my quote
8793000	8795000	Who's starring in this movie?
8795000	8797000	Who's featured?
8797000	8799000	Yeah, I was trying to read the plot here
8799000	8801000	Bill Williamson is back
8801000	8803000	Alive and well
8803000	8805000	I guess this is a sequel to something
8805000	8807000	So his name is actually William Williamson?
8809000	8811000	Hey, wait a minute
8811000	8813000	Don't make fun of him
8813000	8815000	Don't make fun of him
8815000	8817000	Yes, Bill Williamson is back
8817000	8819000	and alive and well
8819000	8821000	Doing a recon mission around DC this time
8822000	8824000	This time he wants to cause
8824000	8826000	major population disruption
8826000	8828000	within the USA
8828000	8830000	which will result in a devastating consequence
8830000	8832000	reverberating
8832000	8834000	throughout the world
8834000	8836000	His new mission this time is to bring down
8836000	8838000	the president of the United States
8838000	8840000	and his secret service detail
8840000	8842000	Bill brings with him
8842000	8844000	an all freakin'
8844000	8846000	havoc and acidity
8846000	8848000	This is a third
8848000	8850000	of a series of movies?
8852000	8854000	It sounds so generic
8854000	8856000	There's like no plot to it
8856000	8858000	Guy goes after president
8858000	8860000	Bill Bill Bill goes after president
8860000	8862000	And it's like Sharknado
8862000	8864000	will make more money
8864000	8866000	Now that's a good shit movie
8866000	8868000	Because it's not a generic movie
8868000	8870000	It's just over the top
8870000	8872000	This isn't over the top
8872000	8874000	This is like, crap
8874000	8876000	If it was like, yes
8876000	8878000	and Bill Williamson is coming back
8878000	8880000	with his, you know
8880000	8882000	cannon or something like that that fires live sharks
8882000	8884000	William Williamson
8884000	8886000	and Rob Roberts
8886000	8888000	You should do like a Saints Row movie
8888000	8890000	Just make it, well actually they should just
8890000	8892000	do a Saints Row movie would be fantastic
8892000	8894000	You need to find your third co-star
8894000	8896000	John Johnson
8896000	8898000	Right? Right? I do need to
8898000	8900000	But yeah, this is starring
8900000	8902000	and I have no
8902000	8904000	I honestly do not recognize
8904000	8906000	any of the names on this
8906000	8908000	but we've got
8908000	8910000	Is there anybody that
8910000	8912000	No
8912000	8914000	There's no names
8914000	8916000	Bill Williamson is played by Brendan Fletcher
8916000	8918000	And we've got Bruce
8918000	8920000	Blaine, Loretta Walsh
8920000	8922000	Zane McG-
8922000	8924000	Okay, I don't even fucking know
8924000	8926000	None of these people
8926000	8928000	These are the actors
8928000	8930000	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line
8930000	8932000	Save us from a Nuevo film discussion please
8932000	8934000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype
8934000	8936000	If you want to give us a call
8936000	8938000	We can talk about anything that we've discussed so far
8938000	8940000	Or perhaps
8940000	8942000	You have something new you'd like to discuss
8942000	8944000	Again, it's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
8944000	8946000	on Skype
8946000	8948000	While we wait for some calls to come in
8948000	8950000	Loki, do you have anything, last minute story you want to discuss here?
8950000	8952000	Oh goodie, Uwe Boll plays a part in the movie himself
8952000	8954000	He is Rampage Killer number two
8954000	8956000	Because he's just like Alfred Hitchcock
8956000	8958000	Just like him
8958000	8960000	He's just like M. Night Shyamalan
8960000	8962000	Just like him
8962000	8964000	Just like him, exactly
8964000	8966000	Remember when Lady in the Water was like
8966000	8968000	If that was like watching M. Night Shyamalan
8968000	8970000	Blow himself on it
8970000	8972000	It was so bad too
8972000	8974000	Because all the other movies were pretty good
8974000	8976000	It's like, oh man, I wonder what this is going to be like
8976000	8978000	Oh man, this is so fucking terrible
8978000	8980000	Actually, I think, wasn't the village before that?
8980000	8982000	The village was before that
8982000	8984000	I thought the village was okay to me
8984000	8986000	I did not hate the village
8986000	8988000	I didn't like the village
8988000	8990000	Lady in the Water and then The Happening
8990000	8992000	The Happening was so bad
8992000	8994000	Oh and The Visit was so bad
8994000	8996000	I mean, the village and The Sixth Sense
8996000	8998000	Are the only two Shyamalan movies I've seen
8998000	9000000	So maybe that affects my opinion
9000000	9002000	A lot of people liked Signs
9002000	9004000	The ending kind of made people go
9004000	9006000	Like literally, fuck you
9006000	9008000	Signs could have been so much better than what it was
9008000	9010000	Unbreakable was pretty good though
9010000	9012000	Oh yeah, Unbreakable was great
9012000	9014000	That was a great movie
9014000	9016000	The ending for that was probably one of the best
9016000	9018000	Out of any of his movies, that was a great twist ending
9018000	9020000	So, anyway
9020000	9022000	Orange Lawns Radio, all one word on Skype
9022000	9024000	If you want to give us a call
9024000	9026000	Any last minute stories here?
9026000	9028000	No, slow
9028000	9030000	Slow news week
9030000	9032000	It's slow. Alright, well you know
9032000	9034000	Things are so slow around here, I think we should
9034000	9036000	Probably take a moment
9036000	9038000	To do a little bit of ranting
9038000	9040000	You know, because I think we missed this last week
9040000	9042000	So, I'm going to take an opportunity to do
9042000	9044000	The FUs of the week
9050000	9052000	So with that
9052000	9054000	Here is justice
9054000	9056000	Here is punishment
9056000	9058000	Here is
9058000	9060000	This is fucked up
9060000	9062000	Loki
9062000	9064000	My FUs week goes to Microsoft
9064000	9066000	For their wonderful Windows 10 updates
9066000	9068000	Because all that happened
9068000	9070000	During the week I was awake
9070000	9072000	I was ready to work on my game
9072000	9074000	There was an update that needed to be done
9074000	9076000	I was like, damn, I'll just do the update real fast
9076000	9078000	And then be done with it
9078000	9080000	And on top of that it screwed up my touchpad again
9080000	9082000	Trying to install some sort of driver's port
9082000	9084000	That don't really work with it
9084000	9086000	And it's still not quite right
9086000	9088000	Even after I uninstalled it
9088000	9090000	It's just very twitchy now
9090000	9092000	Thanks a lot
9094000	9096000	Shane, do you have any FUs you'd like to get out
9096000	9098000	Of the system?
9098000	9100000	FU to Walgreens for not having
9100000	9102000	The Power Ranger toys I want
9102000	9104000	Same with you, Target
9104000	9106000	But otherwise, no
9106000	9108000	My FU of the week goes to Shane
9108000	9110000	For calling me fat
9110000	9112000	There's a whole story behind it
9112000	9114000	And I didn't do it on the show
9114000	9116000	But I'm going to before it's over
9116000	9118000	And I'll find a way
9118000	9120000	Shane called me fat today
9120000	9122000	No, because you implied you were
9122000	9124000	And I was like, I didn't say that
9124000	9126000	And you kept pushing me
9126000	9128000	So I was like, okay then, you're fat
9128000	9130000	JD, do you have an FU of the week?
9130000	9132000	The cost of airfare
9132000	9134000	I found out I need to fly back to Florida
9134000	9136000	And that's the worst time
9136000	9138000	The worst time to go
9138000	9140000	That you need to go
9140000	9142000	FU to that
9142000	9144000	FU to airfare
9144000	9146000	It sucks
9146000	9148000	Alright
9148000	9150000	Well, we've got one call coming in
9150000	9152000	Let's get to it
9152000	9154000	Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio, who's this?
9154000	9156000	Hi, this is Ragingator
9156000	9158000	Hi Ragingator, what's on your mind tonight?
9158000	9160000	Just two questions
9160000	9162000	Unfortunately, they're probably going to entail
9162000	9164000	answers
9164000	9166000	Well, no
9166000	9168000	I know it's a little bit early for this
9168000	9170000	But since
9170000	9172000	it's just a matter of a few weeks away
9172000	9174000	Obviously
9174000	9176000	Thanksgiving
9176000	9178000	is coming up, which means Black Friday
9178000	9180000	and sales and whatnot
9180000	9182000	And chances are
9182000	9184000	all the major retailers are going to
9184000	9186000	be having their sales
9186000	9188000	Plus, obviously, Steam
9188000	9190000	That being said, are there any
9190000	9192000	names that you folks are looking
9192000	9194000	forward to picking up if they
9194000	9196000	go on sale? Anything you have your eyes
9196000	9198000	on during a Black Friday sale
9198000	9200000	You know, since Shane can't
9200000	9202000	find three games for me to buy during
9202000	9204000	a Target sale that's going on right now
9204000	9206000	I don't know about a Black Friday sale I found them, you just didn't want them
9206000	9208000	I don't know why Well, you know
9208000	9210000	as far as Steam goes, there's always
9210000	9212000	something that suckers me in on a Steam sale
9212000	9214000	And I gotta say, Valve is pretty genius for
9214000	9216000	building in that wishlist thing
9216000	9218000	I love it when they email me when a wishlist
9218000	9220000	thing goes on sale I love it and I hate it
9220000	9222000	because they'll go, an item on your wishlist is on sale
9222000	9224000	and then I'll be like, oh fuck, it's only
9224000	9226000	99 cents bought, and then I just bought
9226000	9228000	70 games for 99 cents a piece
9228000	9230000	So, I love it
9230000	9232000	and I hate it, but the honest answer is
9232000	9234000	probably some of the stuff that's on my wishlist
9234000	9236000	which oftentimes is stuff
9236000	9238000	I already own on console, but it's like
9238000	9240000	I want it on PC as well
9240000	9242000	Sometimes you want the best
9242000	9244000	of both worlds, right? I'm hoping
9244000	9246000	3DSs go on sale because I don't have
9246000	9248000	one, and I'd love to pick one up
9248000	9250000	Yeah, there'll be a deal
9250000	9252000	if not 2DS, there might be a 2DS sale
9252000	9254000	Well, I don't want a 2DS
9254000	9256000	You might luck out, there might be a 3DS sale
9256000	9258000	but I wouldn't expect to get Pokemon Sun and Moon on a discount
9258000	9260000	I'm not expecting a game that came out a week before
9260000	9262000	to be on sale, no
9262000	9264000	Well, sometimes they'll do
9264000	9266000	like, buy the game
9266000	9268000	and get a $10 gift card
9268000	9270000	or something, sometimes they do that
9270000	9272000	that's like the little enhanced thing
9272000	9274000	I want VR games
9274000	9276000	I want more VR games
9276000	9278000	for my PS4, that'd be great
9278000	9280000	to see some of those that I have
9280000	9282000	a pretty solid interest in
9282000	9284000	to drop to even lower
9284000	9286000	That'd be very cool
9286000	9288000	Loki, anything you're gonna have your eyes on for Black Friday?
9288000	9290000	Not really, because I have so much stuff in my
9290000	9292000	backlog now, it's just
9292000	9294000	I don't know, hopefully they drop some of the prices
9294000	9296000	of those PlayStation VR games
9296000	9298000	but even right now, even looking
9298000	9300000	at what's coming out later on
9300000	9302000	there's not really anything on the horizon
9302000	9304000	except for in December, I think there's some rollercoaster
9304000	9306000	game that's coming out that might be interesting
9306000	9308000	but that's kind of it
9308000	9310000	I mean, there's a lot of stuff that came out apparently
9310000	9312000	at launch, but
9312000	9314000	It's mostly digital too, though
9314000	9316000	It's just kind of not
9316000	9318000	a lot of stuff I really want to pick up
9318000	9320000	it's kind of a lull right now, I guess
9320000	9322000	AkumaJP has another example
9322000	9324000	of a sale that happens
9324000	9326000	AkumaJP suggests, buy a 3DS and get
9326000	9328000	50% off a new game
9328000	9330000	they do those types of things as well
9330000	9332000	that's when I bought my Xbox One
9332000	9334000	that's what finally broke me, is they did buy an Xbox One
9334000	9336000	get a free game, so I got
9336000	9338000	Forza Horizon 2 at the time
9338000	9340000	so that's what finally broke me on an Xbox One
9340000	9342000	so anyway, there you go
9342000	9344000	Rage Nator, I think for a lot of us, we kind of have to see
9344000	9346000	what's on the table first, and then we go
9346000	9348000	ooh, that's an attractive idea, we'll see
9348000	9350000	I don't know, what was your other question?
9350000	9352000	You said you had a second question
9352000	9354000	Well, since you folks
9354000	9356000	brought up GameStopper
9356000	9358000	and
9358000	9360000	obviously GameStopper is universally
9360000	9362000	hated, pretty much
9362000	9364000	that, I would like
9364000	9366000	to take my question
9366000	9368000	in a different route
9368000	9370000	is there
9370000	9372000	a traditional brick and mortar store
9372000	9374000	that you folks
9374000	9376000	used to, at one point or another
9376000	9378000	really used to love going to
9378000	9380000	for your games and other
9380000	9382000	entertainment?
9382000	9384000	Great question, is there a brick and mortar store
9384000	9386000	that maybe is gone, or maybe it's still there
9386000	9388000	but maybe a brick and mortar store
9388000	9390000	that you would go to for your games
9390000	9392000	that was fun, for me
9392000	9394000	it was Software, etc. and then GameStop
9394000	9396000	bought them, was the problem
9396000	9398000	I thought that was the other way around
9398000	9400000	was the other way around, yeah, because EB Games got bought
9400000	9402000	by GameStop, I just remember
9402000	9404000	back in the day, when Software, etc. was the place
9404000	9406000	where I got a service
9406000	9408000	Software, etc., Babbage's
9408000	9410000	and then I think Electronics Boutique
9410000	9412000	was another, all those stores, but they all
9412000	9414000	got bought by GameStop, even if it is the same
9414000	9416000	company now, like it was
9416000	9418000	different 20 years ago, it was much different
9418000	9420000	20 years ago, that was before the age of pre-ordering
9420000	9422000	or when you would
9422000	9424000	sign up on a list to get a
9424000	9426000	phone call the day it comes out, and they would
9426000	9428000	just hold it for you, I think was the thing
9428000	9430000	I remember that was the thing
9430000	9432000	I used to do pre-orders over the phone
9432000	9434000	yeah, it was like much different then
9434000	9436000	so, yeah, I remember certainly for those
9436000	9438000	what about JD? When I was a kid
9438000	9440000	I actually looked in the phone book for
9440000	9442000	video game stores, because, I mean
9442000	9444000	yeah, there were chains in malls and stuff, but I found
9444000	9446000	some pretty neat, like small
9446000	9448000	independent used game stores, and I
9448000	9450000	missed those, because they're not really around anymore
9450000	9452000	there was one in Orlando that
9452000	9454000	I liked, and
9454000	9456000	even in San Francisco, I moved there in
9456000	9458000	2009, and there was one on Powell
9458000	9460000	in North Beach, and I think it closed
9460000	9462000	a couple years after I moved, so I
9462000	9464000	missed those
9464000	9466000	and you know, I miss, and
9466000	9468000	Shane, I know you're going to like this answer too
9468000	9470000	I miss the retro
9470000	9472000	Toys R Us
9472000	9474000	oh, okay, you said retro, I was like, oh where is this going, but Toys R Us
9474000	9476000	the retro Toys R Us, where you would actually have the
9476000	9478000	pull tags, and you'd have to pull the tag
9478000	9480000	and then they'd get it for you up front, and that's
9480000	9482000	where we used to get, like, that's where my family always got
9482000	9484000	conversation, we need to make another trip to the
9484000	9486000	Toys R Us set time for God, because the Chico
9486000	9488000	Toys R Us still has pull tags
9488000	9490000	and that whole system, I was like, oh my
9490000	9492000	gosh, is Chico stuck in 1993?
9492000	9494000	probably, as somebody
9494000	9496000	who lived there in 1996
9496000	9498000	yes, it probably is still stuck there
9498000	9500000	but anyway, yeah
9500000	9502000	I like Toys R Us back in the day
9502000	9504000	that's where my family got all the Commodore 64 games
9504000	9506000	but a lot of these stores just kind of
9506000	9508000	changed over the years, you know, it's just
9508000	9510000	different now, online also really really
9510000	9512000	changed the game, it really really did
9512000	9514000	Loki, any quick memories you want to share
9514000	9516000	real quick?
9516000	9518000	places I used to buy games, it was pretty much like
9518000	9520000	software, etc, I think
9520000	9522000	was the local store I used to go
9522000	9524000	to
9524000	9526000	honestly, back when I was
9526000	9528000	purchasing games from stores like that
9528000	9530000	well, console games
9530000	9532000	console games would pretty much be
9532000	9534000	wherever I'd go to, like Walmarts
9534000	9536000	and stuff like that
9536000	9538000	actual PC games, I used to
9538000	9540000	buy a lot of shareware, and they
9540000	9542000	used to have those kiosks everywhere
9542000	9544000	used to buy dead shareware disks
9544000	9546000	at my local video store
9546000	9548000	and used to pick up demos all the time
9548000	9550000	oh yeah, the old school computer
9550000	9552000	shops, yes
9552000	9554000	I used to get
9554000	9556000	wherever, or you even go to the computer show and sale
9556000	9558000	and stuff like that
9558000	9560000	I don't know if they still do that
9560000	9562000	no, not anymore, like that was the huge one they do at
9562000	9564000	Cal Expo, right?
9564000	9566000	all sorts of legitimate things
9566000	9568000	now it's shoes
9568000	9570000	so, Rage Nator, it sounds like you had a
9570000	9572000	quick story before we let you go
9572000	9574000	well, I was
9574000	9576000	going to say that
9576000	9578000	it's kind of hard for you guys to relate
9578000	9580000	because you're out in California
9580000	9582000	you don't know
9582000	9584000	in the Buffalo area
9584000	9586000	but out in
9586000	9588000	one of the local burbs
9588000	9590000	in the Buffalo area
9590000	9592000	which is called
9592000	9594000	Amherst
9594000	9596000	there's a plaza
9596000	9598000	they're called the T.G. Max
9598000	9600000	Plaza, obviously because
9600000	9602000	T.G. Max is in there
9602000	9604000	but back in the 90's
9604000	9606000	I used to love going there
9606000	9608000	because they had Toys R Us
9608000	9610000	there, like what you were
9610000	9612000	mentioning, they had the pull tabs and all that
9612000	9614000	I used to love buying my games there
9614000	9616000	when I started buying games on my own
9616000	9618000	and right
9618000	9620000	within the same plaza
9620000	9622000	I used to love going to media play
9622000	9624000	yeah
9624000	9626000	I mean
9626000	9628000	yeah, they had the video games
9628000	9630000	there, but aside from that they had
9630000	9632000	everything else there that
9632000	9634000	I could possibly want
9634000	9636000	music, movies
9636000	9638000	posters, you name it
9638000	9640000	we had the
9640000	9642000	gathering cards
9642000	9644000	that place was heaven, I swear to god
9644000	9646000	there was times
9646000	9648000	that on the weekend
9648000	9650000	I would be there literally all
9650000	9652000	day to the point where
9652000	9654000	I was there until clearly closing
9654000	9656000	and they had to kick me out
9656000	9658000	sounds like a fun place, but I will say this
9658000	9660000	even though we are all the way
9660000	9662000	in California, we have T.G. Max
9662000	9664000	out here as well, and there's a T.G. Max Plaza
9664000	9666000	here, and that's where the Mongolian barbecue
9666000	9668000	is, so we
9668000	9670000	have our own T.G. Max Plaza that we go
9670000	9672000	to, so there's that
9672000	9674000	I also miss CompUSA, they had
9674000	9676000	a computer lab set up to demo
9676000	9678000	their games, and I played the logical
9678000	9680000	journey of the Zoombinis there a bunch
9680000	9682000	that was the early PC days
9682000	9684000	and my brother and I
9684000	9686000	would sit there on the computers and just play games
9686000	9688000	until they were done, I feel like the first time I ever
9688000	9690000	played the Castle of Dr. Brain was that
9690000	9692000	I love that series, right?
9692000	9694000	oh my god, yes
9694000	9696000	alright, I'm going to let you go
9696000	9698000	but thanks so much for the call
9698000	9700000	thanks for the trip down memory lane
9700000	9702000	later, alright
9702000	9704000	Orange Launch Radio, one word on Skype
9704000	9706000	if you want to try to get in, although I didn't see any other calls
9706000	9708000	coming in, so I don't know, it might be a quiet night tonight
9708000	9710000	but I'll give it a couple minutes just in case
9710000	9712000	yeah, trip down memory lane
9712000	9714000	good times, that CompUSA
9714000	9716000	building here in SAC
9716000	9718000	still, still no new tenant
9718000	9720000	it's still just empty
9720000	9722000	I think I finally saw a sign
9722000	9724000	that they were going to turn it into some event center
9724000	9726000	or something, but it's kind of sad
9726000	9728000	that CompUSA building has been empty forever
9728000	9730000	I mean, they went out of business a long time ago
9730000	9732000	but nothing will beat
9732000	9734000	the sign that still is up
9734000	9736000	that says Circuit City
9736000	9738000	oh, those things are ghost towns
9738000	9740000	there is still a sign that says Circuit City, which is funny
9740000	9742000	because the store did convert
9742000	9744000	it was, I want to say
9744000	9746000	it was a Good Guys for a short minute
9746000	9748000	when they were still around, then they went under
9748000	9750000	and then it was, it's a wine store now
9750000	9752000	it's nothing but wine
9752000	9754000	yeah, no, it's a great conversion
9754000	9756000	but it's still, for some reason
9756000	9758000	the sign in the front says Total Wine
9758000	9760000	or whatever the name of the store is, but the sign in the back
9760000	9762000	still says Circuit City
9762000	9764000	it's crazy
9764000	9766000	alright, we got one more call coming in, then we'll wrap it up
9766000	9768000	hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
9768000	9770000	hey, what's going on everybody, it's Ranma
9770000	9772000	hey Ranma buddy, how you doing?
9772000	9774000	nostalgic
9774000	9776000	right, in fact I brought up Circuit City and that was another place we used to go check out
9776000	9778000	like games and stuff at, but anyway, what's on your mind buddy?
9778000	9780000	I want to back up what Rage Nator said
9780000	9782000	because I remember growing up
9782000	9784000	in my small little town
9784000	9786000	it was like this one little store
9786000	9788000	called Weekend Gifts where I would buy all of my
9788000	9790000	video games from, because I wasn't
9790000	9792000	really allowed to travel outside of the town
9792000	9794000	and there were a couple other stores
9794000	9796000	back and forth I'd get my games from
9796000	9798000	and then, what usually
9798000	9800000	sucked because it's a smaller store
9800000	9802000	games were a little bit more expensive
9802000	9804000	yeah
9804000	9806000	when I got into high school and I had a bus pass
9806000	9808000	I traveled from point A to point B
9808000	9810000	I discovered software, etc
9810000	9812000	Circuit City
9812000	9814000	and sales
9814000	9816000	and sales
9816000	9818000	yes, I was so excited
9818000	9820000	like it wasn't that long ago, because Alan
9820000	9822000	and I, well I guess Alan and I have been together a while
9822000	9824000	now, but it was probably about five years ago, Alan and I
9824000	9826000	took a road trip to Oregon
9826000	9828000	it was about five years ago, and we stopped
9828000	9830000	at a mall in, I want to
9830000	9832000	say it was Ashland, where we
9832000	9834000	stopped, we stopped at a mall in Ashland
9834000	9836000	to like eat or whatever, and in the mall
9836000	9838000	they had a GameStop, and
9838000	9840000	a software, etc
9840000	9842000	they still had a fucking software, etc
9842000	9844000	and bonus, there's
9844000	9846000	no sales tax in Oregon
9846000	9848000	so I was like, alright, fuck it, I'm gonna go
9848000	9850000	buy a game here, just so I can have
9850000	9852000	say I shopped the software, etc while I was
9852000	9854000	here, and I actually had a receipt
9854000	9856000	I don't know if it's still, it's probably long closed
9856000	9858000	this was a good five, six years ago, but
9858000	9860000	sorry, I just had to bring that up, because that
9860000	9862000	was a nostalgia trip for me, that that was still open
9862000	9864000	like in the year 2010,
9864000	9866000	2011, it was awesome
9866000	9868000	brother, let me tell you
9868000	9870000	if memory serves me correctly
9870000	9872000	I still have friends that live up in my
9872000	9874000	in the towns, in the areas
9874000	9876000	I used to hang out in, the town over
9876000	9878000	where the software, etc it was
9878000	9880000	from my understanding
9880000	9882000	to this day, it's
9882000	9884000	still a software, etc
9884000	9886000	rad, although
9886000	9888000	it's funny that we're reminiscing, because there
9888000	9890000	literally is no difference between software, etc and GameStop
9890000	9892000	now, like it's really just the
9892000	9894000	logo and all the purple, is the only thing
9894000	9896000	that differentiates them at this point, so
9896000	9898000	but, I don't know, there's just something
9898000	9900000	about it, there's something about it
9900000	9902000	true, but you know what
9902000	9904000	my thing was, I just loved
9904000	9906000	I just like funko way, and you go
9906000	9908000	in every month, you get like this
9908000	9910000	this newspaper of all the sale
9910000	9912000	prices, and you knew what they had
9912000	9914000	and they had these cool demos up
9914000	9916000	and it was like, they
9916000	9918000	only carried the popular games
9918000	9920000	so, what they didn't have, you had to
9920000	9922000	run over to Toys R Us
9922000	9924000	or software, etc, or at the
9924000	9926000	time, if you really wanted to do it,
9926000	9928000	KB Toys, to get those games
9928000	9930000	because KB was the spot
9930000	9932000	where I used to get my Master System games
9932000	9934000	My Atari 2600 games came
9934000	9936000	from KB Toys, that was old school
9936000	9938000	I think I bought my first Game Boy Color at KB Toys
9938000	9940000	Yeah, wow, they didn't
9940000	9942000	last long past
9942000	9944000	the Nintendo 64 era, right?
9944000	9946000	They were, they went
9946000	9948000	under a long time ago, anyway
9948000	9950000	Alright, good times
9950000	9952000	good memories, so
9952000	9954000	yeah, lots of
9954000	9956000	stores that are unfortunately long gone
9956000	9958000	Where do you buy your games now?
9958000	9960000	Um
9960000	9962000	I actually buy my games from
9962000	9964000	either Micro Center
9964000	9966000	or Best Buy
9966000	9968000	or Nintendo World
9968000	9970000	If I have to go to New York City
9970000	9972000	I kind of bless myself
9972000	9974000	before walking in, so that I
9974000	9976000	don't have a stroke talking to these
9976000	9978000	people about a particular game I'm looking for
9978000	9980000	or something like that
9980000	9982000	Since you're in New York City, you can just go straight to the
9982000	9984000	30 Rock Nintendo store and
9984000	9986000	get it from the stores, that's pretty awesome
9986000	9988000	Yeah, and then I can go upstairs and play
9988000	9990000	Star Fox on the Wii U on a big ass
9990000	9992000	250 inch screen
9992000	9994000	That's the life, the life
9994000	9996000	of New York City, but you pay a premium to live there
9996000	9998000	just kidding
9998000	10000000	Sky, you have no idea
10000000	10002000	I have some idea
10002000	10004000	Yeah, keep in mind, our buddy
10004000	10006000	JD here is from San Francisco, we get
10006000	10008000	near full from our friends over there, so
10008000	10010000	we have some idea
10010000	10012000	I'm just thankful they didn't hike up my rent
10012000	10014000	this year, because my place
10014000	10016000	is about the size
10016000	10018000	of the old studio
10018000	10020000	of what I came to visit
10020000	10022000	that time
10022000	10024000	Which is small
10024000	10026000	Does New York have rent control?
10026000	10028000	Oh, New York has rent control, but when you're living somewhere
10028000	10030000	and you're paying month to month
10030000	10032000	because you need to rent out the basement
10032000	10034000	it gets a little tricky
10034000	10036000	At least
10036000	10038000	Squatter's rights are on my side
10038000	10040000	Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we wrap up
10040000	10042000	the show, thanks for the call and the memories
10042000	10044000	Alright, Rob, one more thing
10044000	10046000	Stay fabulous, brother
10046000	10048000	Always, always, stay black
10048000	10050000	I try
10050000	10052000	Work on it, alright, take care
10052000	10054000	Bye
10054000	10056000	Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight
10056000	10058000	If you didn't get through, you should email us
10058000	10060000	or participate at orangeloungeradio.com
10060000	10062000	That is
10062000	10064000	gonna wrap it up for another episode of
10064000	10066000	Orange Lounge Radio
10066000	10068000	Hey, Shane, thanks for being here tonight in studio
10068000	10070000	I'm sure you had a great time
10070000	10072000	as always. Did you catch any Pokemon during
10072000	10074000	the show? I'm not catching anything right now
10074000	10076000	I'm working through the story
10076000	10078000	Oh, excuse me, excuse me, I'm sorry about that
10078000	10080000	He needs a ditto
10080000	10082000	Did you not pay attention earlier?
10082000	10084000	Is it because you're too fat?
10084000	10086000	Worked it in! Yay!
10086000	10088000	Rude and unnecessary
10088000	10090000	Uh, JD, thanks for being here
10090000	10092000	I hope you had fun. Was it fun being
10092000	10094000	in the studio? Absolutely
10094000	10096000	What do people out there need to know about the way
10096000	10098000	OLR really works?
10098000	10100000	Oh, man
10100000	10102000	Um, I don't know if there's anything
10102000	10104000	I can share
10104000	10106000	It's all a secret
10106000	10108000	Alright, you'll just have to come find out for yourself
10108000	10110000	Alright, anything you're here to plug
10110000	10112000	You don't really have a show or anything
10112000	10114000	Do you have a blog, a Twitter
10114000	10116000	Or something that people should follow
10116000	10118000	Twitter is probably the best place to find me
10118000	10120000	If you want to know more
10120000	10122000	I retweet a lot of stuff
10122000	10124000	Sometimes it's politics, sometimes it's ash
10124000	10126000	Or not ash, it's red and blue in fan art
10126000	10128000	Who knows what, you'll be fine
10128000	10130000	And your Twitter account is?
10130000	10132000	jai underscore d-i-t
10132000	10134000	It's jaydee from French
10134000	10136000	That's how you say it!
10136000	10138000	So it's French for I have said
10138000	10140000	But it's also my name
10140000	10142000	Because puns are very central to me
10142000	10144000	I remember the first week I was like
10144000	10146000	Is it jaydee? What is it?
10146000	10148000	Oh, it's jaydee, it's his name, I get it
10148000	10150000	I'm looking right now for this fan art
10150000	10152000	I'm not seeing it
10152000	10154000	Because I have to compare to see if I have any of it
10154000	10156000	Alright, uh
10156000	10158000	Any final thoughts to leave with our listeners tonight?
10158000	10160000	You know, I don't know if they're still around
10160000	10162000	But For Your Entertainment used to have
10162000	10164000	A DDR machine in the mall
10164000	10166000	One of the malls in Orlando I went to
10166000	10168000	I think a lot of those stores closed, sadly
10168000	10170000	It was all part of the Suncoast
10170000	10172000	That's another fun thing
10172000	10174000	As always, I just want to say
10174000	10176000	Thank you for listening to Orange Lawns Radio

10188000	10190000	A nice five star review wherever you found this show
10190000	10192000	Like iTunes or Google Play
10192000	10194000	Will go a long way in helping us with discovery
10194000	10196000	We really appreciate each and every
10196000	10198000	Five star review
10198000	10200000	And my final thought tonight is
10202000	10204000	I'm glad I got capped for tomes on Final Fantasy 14 already
10204000	10206000	So I don't have to play again tonight
10208000	10210000	I can play more Jackbox Party Pack or something else
10210000	10212000	Loki, last but not least my friend
10212000	10214000	Your final thought tonight
10216000	10218000	I get pizza tomorrow? I don't know
10218000	10220000	Pizza party!
10220000	10222000	Fortunately I have to watch a
10222000	10224000	You know
10224000	10226000	I'm gonna call a keynote
10226000	10228000	I'm gonna get a presentation from our CEO
10228000	10230000	Well good luck with that
10230000	10232000	But at least I get pizza
10232000	10234000	Good luck with that
10234000	10236000	Happy Halloween everybody
10236000	10238000	Be safe, don't be a fool
10238000	10240000	But I think most of you probably already finished your celebrating
10240000	10242000	I was gonna say it wasn't a Halloween thing
10242000	10244000	And I almost did this too
10244000	10246000	But I totally want to make some of those Borderlands pants
10246000	10248000	That they have
10248000	10250000	Have you seen those?
10250000	10252000	Where they paint them so they look cel shaded?
10252000	10254000	I would just wear those regularly
10254000	10256000	Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio
10256000	10258000	Have a good Halloween, we will see you in 7 days
