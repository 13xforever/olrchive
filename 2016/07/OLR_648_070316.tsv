0	18520	This week, US Dave and Busters in Round 1 locations will be receiving DDR Ace! Fingers
18520	21800	crossed that there's one coming near you! And that's just the tip of the iceberg for
21800	26060	this week's gaming news. This and more starts right now on the show, where every gamer has
26060	41980	a voice.
41980	49940	This July the 3rd of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie.
49940	53360	And joining you live here at the Voice of Geeks Network, where we do tape live every
53360	56980	Sunday night. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
56980	62100	show VOG Network dot com. That's V-O-G Network dot com. We are here based out of Sacramento,
62100	66980	California in Studio N7, talking about the latest and greatest in video games, gaming
66980	71820	culture, the gamer lifestyle. Again, I'm Rob Roberts. Not joining us tonight, unfortunately.
71820	76040	DarkSakura not in studio tonight. She is off. Lots of people doing stuff for the holiday,
76040	80580	obviously with American Independence Day tomorrow. So she had a conflict this week and couldn't
80580	87420	be here. But joining us tonight is Techmaster Loki. Hello, Loki. How are you doing?
87420	88420	Fine.
88420	93100	Okay, Loki is completely distracted. He's just his head is down looking at his phone
93100	96940	while he's going tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. What the hell's going
96940	97940	on over there, Loki?
97940	101540	I'm playing the new tap my Katamari game.
101540	103500	So what is tap my Katamari?
103500	109300	It's the unholy alliance of a Katamari game mixed with a cookie clicker type game.
109300	112420	Yeah, that sounds that sounds bad. I think the only thing that could be worse would be
112420	115860	like a Final Fantasy cookie clicker game. That would be like right up my alley. But
115860	120420	Katamari is pretty, pretty close. It's Yeah, yeah. What do you do you think you're gonna
120420	122180	be able to put that down long enough to read some stories?
122180	125540	Oh, yeah, I don't even need the clicker game. It plays by itself.
125540	129860	So yeah, I just I'm just gonna sit here and kind of kind of make my fingers kind of run
129860	135460	on the screen while I'm reading a story. Oh my god, Loki. All right. Yeah, SSU 100
135460	141340	Matt is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Oh, dear, that is a bad combo. And
141340	146300	fifth dream says I use eight fingers to play the Katamari game. Yes, you can join our live
146300	149740	chat room. Again, we are live on Sunday nights at six Pacific nine Eastern at vog network
149740	156260	and you can join chat live.vognetwork.com. If you want to chat along with the show, stop
156260	161460	me in chat saying tap my Katamari is something you don't say in an international airport
161460	167140	TSA check. Yes, probably probably not something you're gonna want to explain in a sealed off
167140	172480	room. We do have some guests in studio filling in tonight. Since we are down a dark soccer,
172480	177360	we brought some of our longtime friends of the show in to help fill the space tonight.
177360	182940	So say hello over there is Shane from Ranger pride joining us the studio again, two weeks
182940	188580	in a row. Yeah, I don't know why. Yeah. Except he's not really on the show because he keeps
188580	193660	looking over again. We have lots of distractions going on. So no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
193660	199380	no, no, no, no. You're about to say something that's not true. Big surprise. Okay. It is
199380	203180	true. He's watching the summer games done quick, which I know. No, no, no. That's not
203180	207520	what's on my screen. And you're, you're, you're doing that with your eyes and your hand is
207520	212020	moving around and yes, capturing show. Tell me that's a lie. Well, no, cause I haven't
212060	217100	got a shiny for a little bit here. So yes, my hands are playing Pokemon right now trying to
217100	222100	catch a shiny, but no, I am reading dialogue from the classic game of the week for this week. And I
222100	227300	am laughing because of some of these things I forgot and am now remembering. Oh, okay. All
227300	231500	right. But, and so good. As soon as you're done with that, you'll go right back to watching the
231500	235580	summer games done quick. Well, technically there's a little window over here that see,
235580	240620	oh, you're, oh, you got one of those picture in picture, one of those fancy iPads that does the
240620	246460	multiple apps. He's got the fancy one that can do that. So I get, I can't be mad though. The summer
246460	250820	game's done quick and you know, awesome games. They do those things twice a year and it's for
250820	254580	charity and it's everybody loves it. It's just Metroid Prime right now. So I really don't care
254580	260660	that much, but it's also summer games done quick. So I have to watch it anyway. You still have to
260660	265660	watch it a little bit. Of course, of course. And yeah, vidpower in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
265660	270540	says the gaming multitasking of everyone on the show tonight is strong. Yes, it really is. All
270540	274660	though we do have another guest here joining in studio and I got to give him props because I don't
274660	279740	see him. He is, he is ready to go and he has a phone in his hand. You know what's on that phone
279740	284940	is tonight's show roll. Well, he's ready to go. If I double click my home button, I can get right
284940	289500	back to the show. Whatever, whatever. Say hello everybody to Flaco Jones. Hello everybody. Hey,
289500	293460	how you doing? I'm doing great. How are you doing? Good. Good to have you back. Thanks. I like,
293460	297020	it's been a while, but it's like there's always so much TV on Sunday night. Like I can't be on
297140	302060	OR till all my shows are over. They're all over. They're all over. No Walking Dead. No Fear the
302060	307900	Walking Dead. No Game of Thrones. Sunday's boring. I'm glad we're the fourth or fifth priority. Yeah,
307900	312340	Big Brother. See, look, I picked you over Big Brother. Oh, that's so sweet. That's not like
312340	317260	three times a week. I can go without. You can read the live feeds. I can watch After Dark every night
317260	321460	too. And you need to get Davon's Diary Rooms on the CBS website. It's all you need. That's the
321460	325020	only reason to watch the actual show is to see your diary. Which by the way, I will say this,
325020	329140	if you are a fan of that show, um, I don't know if you guys on the show is bad. We've been on a
329140	333380	really schedule on guys on the show, but like expert was sick, like really super sick. So we
333380	336780	had to take a couple of weeks off, but we came back this week and we did a Big Brother themed
336780	340940	episode with our pal. I haven't listened to our pal Ronnie, who was a contestant years ago. So
340940	345380	it was a really fun show. So if you like that show, it was good. Check that out. Oh, that's cool.
345380	350900	Logie doesn't even watch that garbage. I have no idea. I know of Big Brother. I've not watched.
350900	354340	He was a great guest when he was on Hoard House. So yeah. And I tried not to repeat,
354340	359380	I tried to repeat a lot of the same stuff, some of the, but like most of it was kind of new
359380	363420	information. I, the big, I will say this, the biggest shot, I shouldn't ruin this. You should
363420	366620	go listen to it. But I will say the biggest shocking thing that came out of that for me is
366620	372020	that there, the little intros, when they get their keys, totally staged stuff, right? Of course. No,
372020	378220	it's not. What? I don't believe you. I don't believe Ronnie either. That's such a lie. Did
378220	382740	he watch this season? Maybe when he did it. Maybe back when he did it like 20 years ago
382740	388500	when he was on Big Brother. It's like, how, how did you get like a bag of bread that has a key
388500	392340	in it? What do you have a whole camera crew watching them for? The trick is they put keys
392340	398380	in all of them. They're like going, go listen to the guys on the show this week and form your own
398380	401340	opinion. Listen to your own lies. But I got to bring it back to video games. I got to bring it
401340	406140	back to video games. I love that you dressed up for the radio show wearing your Splatoon shirt.
406140	413180	It's Splatoon mashed up with Powerpuff. Oh my God. It is Powerpuff Splatoon. This has to have
413180	415900	come from the internet. Where else do you find this? This is like T Fury, I think. Or yeah,
415900	419580	I think it's T Fury. I don't know. I like that. But yeah, it's from the internet. Of course. Of
419580	424060	course it is. I'm pretty sure because we got Shane like an early birthday present, a Silent Hill shirt
424060	426780	from there too. It's like a Silent Hill, was it Fighting Game? I don't even remember. I want to
426780	430380	say that. Mario Kart. Oh, Mario. It's like Silent Hill Kart. That's right. That's hilarious. One of
430380	433900	those other sites. What is it? Redbubble? Is that the name of it? Yeah, they're a good one. I got
433900	439420	that. It's the Kermit the Frog mashed with Bayonetta. And so I wear that to all. Yeah,
439420	443020	it's Kermit. It's Kermitetta. It's Kermit the Frog mashed with Bayonetta. I can't even imagine
443020	446300	what that looks like. It's fucking amazing. I'm imagining it and you don't want to.
447340	451740	Like I'll go get the shirt in a minute here, but I wear it to all the Ingress events since I play
451740	457420	on Green Team. So we're frogs. So I wear my Kermitetta shirt. And like most people just
457420	461580	kind of like don't even like get it. They're just like, what a weird thing on his shirt. But like
461580	467100	once in a while, somebody will look at it and go, is that Kermit and Bayonetta? And I'm like,
467100	471980	you're cool. Yes, it is. I just got back from a trip to Seattle, you know. Oh, you saw Splatoon
471980	476140	on this shirt. That's the first thing you saw. Well, I was going through TSA and the guy saw
477180	483100	Powerpuff Girls. And he was, you know, very, I don't know what to say, but he was like,
483100	488940	he was like, whoa, I think you're the first man I've ever seen walking through here wearing a
488940	494380	Powerpuff Girls shirt on. It's like, oh, okay. You should have been like, I wore it for my
494380	499900	little girl. It was her one wish today, asshole. I know he just had to be like, he's like, oh,
499900	504540	I wore pink before. I wear pink camo, breast cancer awareness month when I'm in the army.
505100	510940	Of course. Oh my God. Like I want to go to that airport right now because I am wearing my pink
510940	517340	Kim Chi from RuPaul's Drag Race shirt. And it's like, like this is a screaming homosexual t-shirt.
517420	520700	I'm just wearing a purple shirt, man. And it's got Powerpuff Girls on it.
521740	525020	I don't get why the TSA people try to talk to you anyway, cause you don't want to be there.
525020	529980	Cause to be honest though, that shirt looks like it could be a brat shirt. So it's really hard to
529980	537500	say it does look like a brat shirt. I'm just saying, you know, it could be some confusion
537500	541180	there. Yeah. We got to kick out of it though. It's like, really? That guy was that when I went
541180	547180	through the airport recently, I was wearing my Popplio shirt and the chick at the end was like,
547180	550620	Oh, I love Pokemon. I love Bulbasaur. I'm like, thank you. Let me get my shoes and leave.
552620	556940	I did not care to talk to her about that. Like don't come at me with Bulbasaur when I'm wearing
556940	560780	Popplio. I don't care about your Bulbasaur. I can't believe that somebody like tried to
560780	566700	talk to Shane about Pokemon and he just like shot it down when like, I don't like it anymore.
566700	572300	No, it is not Bulbasaur. If she didn't call it Bulbasaur. If she did, I would have smacked her.
573260	578060	Yeah. Okay. But here's, here's the thing. If, if I were to call Shane and be like,
578060	581820	Shane, I'm really upset right now. Cause I had to take Alan to the hospital today. He would be like,
581820	586780	well, did you play Pokemon in the waiting room? That's pretty right. Actually, I would say
586780	592380	something like that. And he'd be like, cause I caught three shinies today. Have you even gotten
592380	597820	a badge yet? And I'd be like, I'm in a moment of personal crisis, but I'm in a moment of personal
597820	601740	crisis because you're not playing Pokemon. Yeah. That's how it is. Exactly. It had to
601740	604460	arrange who's going to go out there and hack my portal for the day.
606780	612780	Kind of get that done until September, until yeah, September. And then, then I'm free.
612780	616860	Then you're free. No way you think you're free, by the way, Loki's referencing Ingress in which
616860	624140	there is an achievement or a badge for how many you have to hack once a day for 360 days to get
624140	630780	a particular badge. But my counter, like, even though I have that badge is almost up to 500.
630780	637180	I keep saying I'm going to get to 500 and then uninstall just in time for Pokemon go.
637980	642460	Yeah, they might, it might time out that way. We'll see. Oh, sure. That'll stop you from playing
642460	648140	both or not. We'll see. We'll see. I already have my strategy for how to play Pokemon go when it
648140	653100	launches. You don't really need to go anywhere. Cause the book might come to you. Well,
653900	659500	keep in mind in the beta, they were feeding people coins. So, and that's the pay currency.
659500	664220	So I figure you're probably going to have to drop 10 or 20 bucks, like just to load up on some of
664220	668700	the items. Like again, if, if you want to, if you want to really be the very best that no one ever
668700	673580	was, of course, they're going to make you pay money. You can buy her fee the very best. Yeah.
673580	676780	But you're not going to be able to buy Pokemon balls on a whim. You're going to have to hack
676780	680380	them. So you're gonna have to find where all the pokey stops are. So I'm going to have to go to
680380	685500	one of the parks where there's a ton of today, Ingress nodes, where there'll be Pokemon go stops
685500	689340	and like, just basically walk around for an hour and just hack, hack, hack.
689340	692540	I just wish they would just stop, you know, working on another game and just maybe,
692540	697020	I don't know, update the portals that they have out right now, because I swear to God, like,
697660	701340	a vast majority of them are just like non-existent anymore. It's like, yeah,
701340	705740	this is for this church, which has been torn down or, Hey, this is for this mural. That's
705740	712140	now painted over. I don't know. In, in general, I have issues with some of the ways Ingress has
712140	716060	been moderated. Like there's, there's a lot of like rampant cheating going on,
716060	719900	which is kind of shitty and kind of ruins it for everybody. And it's like, it's like people
719900	722460	like right now, I don't know how much I should say on there, but there's,
722460	726460	there's a lot of issues. Like multiple accounts will say that like, there's like well-known
726460	731900	people that are carrying more than one account. And it's like, like one or two people with eight
731900	735180	accounts in their back pocket. So they can build whatever portals they want. It's like,
735180	740940	kind of ruins it for everybody else, you know, silly. Anyway. I was going to ask you quickly
740940	744700	about your shirt, Shane, cause you have an escape room shirt on. Oh yeah. Cause I love talking about
744700	747500	the escape room stuff. I know. So I'm trying to think of something we haven't talked about.
747500	750780	You should get a shirt that says, ask me about escape room. Well, why haven't we done one in
750780	755340	SAC yet? I don't understand. Shane's been home for like two weeks and we still have not done,
755340	758780	and this is very unlike Shane. And I think it's only because he's distracted with the
758780	761900	Pokemon shiny collecting thing. I really am distracted by Pokemon. He'll be the only guy
761900	766540	in the escape room with his DS playing Pokemon at the same time. They probably wouldn't let me
766540	776060	play it. Yeah, exactly. No, I don't know why we haven't. I suggested doing it on a whim one time
776060	782220	and then we didn't. And so like whatever, because you suggested doing it on a whim when I couldn't
782220	787580	do it. And I also think it was father's day that day. It was father's day, but escape room is
787580	796300	better than father's. Well, you haven't done an escape room. I have done fatherhood.
797260	801420	You know what we should do Flaco, but we should go to an escape room without Shane
802220	806300	and it would be like the nastiest prank. Yeah, but you know what? You wouldn't win cause I wasn't
806300	811740	there. Yeah. I don't think I'd be good at those. I really don't. I don't, I don't, I don't know.
811740	815340	Do you download any of those phone apps? I never know. Are the escape room? Cause you know,
815340	818220	they, they try to kind of put that in the gaming space for people that enjoy that.
818220	821900	I don't think it would be as fun to be quite honest. I think it's one of those things that
822780	828620	I'll try it. You were talking a lot about like the, the decor of the place does a lot. Like if
828620	834460	you have like bookshelves that actually flip around slides that you slide down, like crazy,
834460	838460	double dare shit in the escape room, big hamster wheel that we had to run around,
839580	849180	slid down like a mouth with teeth. Yeah. Double dare escape room. I could just,
849180	854620	I could just see Shane dragging us all to the super slimy double dare escape room or something.
854620	859100	It was like, yeah, I just, I'm always gaming. I could see you would be able to do a lot,
859740	865500	like possibly in a sense, cooler things because it's not physical and real. But I think there's
865500	871020	something to be said that when we unlocked that bookcase to slide over, that was an amazing moment
871020	875020	in, in playing that escape room. So I just don't think that would translate well to a game.
875820	879020	But I'm not opposed to trying a game when I just, I haven't sought that out because
879020	882220	I'd rather do the real experience. What about a VR escape room?
883500	888300	That could be cool. I would, I would try that. I would probably run into things on accident
888700	892540	and hurt myself, but. Isn't that just going to be like
892540	896460	Resident Evil 7 on VR or some of those types of games? Because aren't those kind of like escape?
897420	903260	The room in what Silent Hill, Silent Hill is gone. It's silent Hills is done. You can't,
906780	911980	like stop wanking on the show because it's not going to happen. Hold on. Now we were just going
911980	917420	to get a persona. We were just talking about a mate and you made for TV silent Hill movie. So
917420	922300	yeah, we were, it's not gone. Yeah. They're still trying to beat. They're trying to reanimate the
922300	927020	core. But again, I want you to, I want you to examine what you just said. It's a silent Hill
927020	933340	made for TV movie. Okay. Made for it's probably not made for TV is made for streaming networks
933340	938380	movie. Like the last made for, you know, who else does, you know, who else does streaming
938380	945340	movies for Netflix is Adam Sandler. Oh, he does. He has quite a lucrative career doing that with
945340	950060	none of which I've watched. I'm like, damn, he's making a lot of movies. Cause you apparently the
950060	954460	whole thing is that you can, you can kind of watch those. You can hate, if you can, you can
954460	958940	have a hate boner and watch those movies without anyone knowing. And you know, that's, that's
958940	962460	basically the thing is that you can watch those movies and nobody will ever know you watch them,
962460	966780	except for the people you share your Netflix account with. They should publish at like
966780	971660	Netflix, the list of people who watch Adam Sandler movies. And Netflix shame. What the hell are you
971660	977420	watching? What was it? The, what was it? The, I kind of can't remember all his stupid movies.
977420	982540	He has, he shouldn't do over. I know that Jack and Jill was the one that I'm talking about.
982540	990060	Like the made for, we all know that the racist Indian one, the race people thought it was like
990060	996780	ridiculous six or something like that. I think that's what it was. Act Def points out Netflix
996780	1000940	has a Facebook sharing feature. Remember when no one's going to use, remember when Netflix was
1000940	1005500	still new and on the three 60, you could do like Netflix party and everybody could actually watch
1005500	1009580	the same thing together, like through the three 60 and you could kind of like chat about it.
1009580	1013420	And then Netflix got rid of that for some reason. I mean, and it's not like it's stopping people
1013420	1018300	from just getting on Skype and doing that. Right. It's cool. We'll just create a new app
1018300	1022620	that people can come together and just chill while they watch some movies. We'll call it Netflix,
1022620	1028780	Netflix and chill the app. Love it. All right. We need to get back into some video game talk.
1028780	1033100	So let's start off tonight's show talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games
1033100	1037580	that we've been playing this week. Loki, we'll start with you tonight. So, uh, let's see this
1037580	1043740	week. I kind of can't remember which week was what. Um, I did finish playing South Park. I
1043740	1048940	finished that game and that's is hilarious. Absolutely awesome game. Worth a replay even.
1048940	1056220	Um, just, it's like watching an episode of the show. It's just that well done. And so definitely
1056220	1060540	recommended if you haven't tried it out yet, still get it on the steam sale, which is, you know,
1061500	1068300	I think it's still eight bucks. So definitely check that out. Um, what else? I also played,
1068300	1074460	um, this stupid Katamari game that I am still tapping on. Um, Ingress, I played a little bit,
1074460	1079500	uh, Pokemon Go just because there's a couple of days left. So I, you know, tried it a little bit.
1079500	1084540	They had, I don't know if it was intentional or if they just fucked up the coding because
1084540	1089100	a lot of that shit was pretty fucked up anyways in the app. But for some reason,
1089180	1094780	one of the last days of Pokemon Go, they had like, I don't know if it was like no spawn delay or if
1094780	1100460	they were just spawning the whole day's worth of Pokemon at once. So you'd load into the game and
1100460	1106220	all of a sudden it's like, Hey, there's 30 Pokemon standing right at my feet. So that was kind of
1106220	1113260	interesting briefly. So we did that and, um, yeah, that's pretty much it. Oh, and I raised a Ferrari
1113260	1117340	and a Lamborghini. So that's non gaming, but it was fun. How briefly tell us about that. Cause you
1117340	1122860	were hyping that on the show last week. Awesome. So it's basically this, um, I don't know. It's
1122860	1128620	a company. They have like a, like six exotic cars and they do these different, like you can either
1129820	1135340	rent them and go like on a trip, like you go down, you know, Napa and you're driving the highways
1135340	1140300	and stuff that, or they have what they call like the autocross challenge thing. So basically it's,
1140300	1149100	they set up this course in a parking lot at the San Joaquin fairgrounds. So it's a parking lot
1149100	1155100	and then you drive through the course in one of those cars. So you don't get really fast because
1155100	1161100	think of it like, um, you go to one of those indoor go-kart tracks. It's like that, you know,
1161100	1165500	it's a lot of turns and stuff, but you're in a Ferrari instead of, you know, a go-kart. So
1166380	1171660	it's, you're basically in second gear the entire time, but you still feel the power from those
1171660	1176060	cars. It's just ridiculous. So I got to do that and it was a lot of fun. I started off with the
1176060	1181820	Lamborghini and, um, I mean, that was just incredibly fast. And then of course I couldn't
1181820	1187900	get enough of that. So I also, um, decided to do the Ferrari that they had there as well.
1187900	1193580	And I actually liked the Ferrari a little bit more because it felt like it kind of kind of
1193980	1198780	kind of drifted a little bit more. Um, I mean, they were pretty much so low the ground and,
1199660	1203740	you know, they have the traction control and everything or all wheel drive on the Lamborghini.
1203740	1209740	So you're not really skidding too much, but you can hear it. I did make a really cheesy music
1210540	1214540	video thing, you know, kind of showing the footage. Cause I was actually doing Periscope,
1214540	1219180	um, at least for some of those. In fact, the, when I did the Ferrari, I had the guy who was
1219180	1223660	the instructor kind of guy holding my phone and Periscoping the whole thing. So that was kind of
1223660	1228780	cool cause I don't normally do that. And so I kind of cut some stuff from that, but you can hear it.
1228780	1233100	Like you can hear the tires squealing as you're like turning and stuff, but it was fun. I mean,
1233100	1237340	I'd totally do it again. It's just incredibly expensive. You know, what's open now that we
1237340	1241500	need to do is the indoor skydiving place. That would be fun. I would be down with that, but yeah,
1241500	1245420	that is like, it's something like you're all, you know, racing the car. This would be kind of fun,
1245420	1250460	but man, you get in that thing. It's just like, you're not ever going to be able to do this
1250460	1255580	normally. I mean, it's just, these are expensive cars that you'll never be able to buy. Yeah. And
1255580	1261020	just getting to actually drive them. I mean, that's, it was just awesome. It was really fun.
1261020	1265900	Uh, SSG100Matt says, uh, in chat over at live.vognetware.com, I kind of want to do this
1265900	1270380	myself with my dad also. I'll have to look into this. It sounds like great father-son bonding
1270380	1277500	things. I mean, I don't know how they're in LA and I think I know in Stockton, but I think
1277500	1283500	they've got some maybe elsewhere in other States, but definitely don't buy it straight from the
1283500	1288140	website. Cause it's like 200 and some dollars to just do the autocross thing, which is not worth
1288140	1292700	it, but you can get group on deals. I think my dad, cause he was the one that kind of treated
1292700	1298620	for it since it was like a father's day gift. He, I think paid 105 and then they offer you,
1298620	1302300	if you want to drive the second car, you just pay an additional 65 to do it.
1302300	1308060	So I paid an additional 65 to drive the car. I thought it was worth it. I mean,
1308060	1311740	especially now he was talking about like going to the indoor, um, go-kart tracks.
1312380	1317580	They're just as expensive to drive those shitty things. I did do that once I did the indoor and
1317580	1321260	it was like Mario Kart in real life. Yeah. Those are fun because those things, those suckers like
1321260	1325580	drift around the corners and stuff. I mean, and I would have loved, they had like different setups
1325580	1330460	and I think it based, it depends on how busy they are. Cause they had two tracks set up on this one,
1330460	1334620	but I watched their little commercial thing on YouTube and they have a different track set up
1334620	1338380	that's a lot bigger and a lot more straightaways. And I would've liked to do that a little bit more
1338380	1344540	cause you get more speed on that, but I had fun. I mean, it was fun. Just like, it's like Forza,
1344540	1349100	but you're doing it in real life and it's just totally different. It was a lot of fun.
1349660	1352700	All right. Well back to video games, I'll talk about my gaming week, which is actually pretty
1352780	1357580	busy. This, this live streaming thing I've actually been doing, like I kept talking about
1357580	1360940	in the past. I want to get into doing it more, but as of the past couple of weeks,
1360940	1364780	I have actually been doing more live streaming. So if you're not following me on Twitch,
1364780	1368380	please consider following me on Twitch. I'm Rob Roberts on Twitch. And I did some game streaming
1368380	1373500	this week because I hooked up the Wii U in my office. So I was doing some virtual console. I
1373500	1379500	did Super Mario Brothers 2. I did Super Mario RPG, which just came out on virtual console this week.
1379500	1384300	And that was a lot of fun. Um, and then, uh, I was doing like a random Final Fantasy 14 stream.
1384300	1389420	And I feel like I did something else this week, but what do you use to put your setup
1389420	1394220	together there? Um, well, they're not paying me to give this shout out and I hope I'm not missing
1394220	1400140	out on a referral bonus, but it's, uh, it's, if there is a referral bonus, please consider using
1400140	1405660	my email or ask me on Twitter. Um, but it is a website called game show. Uh, and they were at
1405660	1411740	Twitch con when Jason, our voiceover guy had me go to Twitch and I got a demo of it. And I liked,
1412620	1417020	you know, I really like open broadcast source, but I could not for the life of me figure out
1417020	1421340	how to do a lot of like the overlay stuff, you know, that they show like the followers and all
1421340	1425420	that stuff. Well, game show has it all built in. Oh, that's cool. And so you build your shot kind
1425420	1429420	of like you do an open broadcast source, but then you can have different shots in the bottom and you
1429420	1434620	can mix them. So that's what I have is I have like my game and cam shot, and then I have my game cam
1434620	1439580	chat follower, all that stuff. So I can kind of switch back and forth. I thought it was pretty
1439580	1444700	cool. And you can assign it with hotkeys too, but I use, I still use my mouse to do all that. So,
1445260	1448540	um, yeah, I mean, it can kind of be distracting. It was, you're kind of like trying to play your
1448540	1453020	game. You're also keeping one eye on chat. So it's, it's tricky, but, um, yeah, that's,
1453020	1457020	so that's my shout out to them. Cause that was the software that kind of, I will say though,
1457020	1462620	it does have some drawbacks because like in order to change the game that I'm pushing to Twitch,
1462860	1467820	like a couple of weeks ago, I did a Overwatch stream, but it was labeled final fantasy 14.
1467820	1473580	Well, that's because I just used my shot construction from Final Fantasy 14, but just
1473580	1478780	changed the window to Overwatch to save like a new project. Yeah. Yeah. You have to like save it.
1478780	1484300	You have to edit the file as a text file to go in and change the setting for what game it's telling
1484300	1489580	Twitch you're playing into the right game. So there are some weird quirks that they still
1489580	1494060	need to work out. The PS4 never gets that right anyway though. Yeah, that's always one stream
1494060	1499340	behind. It's always whatever you last ran. Right. Yeah. Even if you change it, it will still show.
1499340	1504060	What I have to do is log into Twitch on a computer and then tell it right then what game I'm going
1504060	1507900	to. Oh yeah. That's what I always do. I didn't know that that's the way, but it's annoying
1507900	1512380	because my computer sucks. So I don't want to turn it on and wait like 10 minutes to
1512380	1517820	get it to go. Cause I have my computer's like seven years old or something. Yeah. And Bobby
1517820	1523900	says it also used your camera mic that one time. That was kind of my bad because, um, again, when
1523900	1529740	I set up the shot originally, I was playing around with the camera mics that you guys could hear Alan
1529740	1532780	in the background. Cause you'll notice when I stream, you can't really hear him, but I thought
1532780	1538700	the camera mic would pick him up, but it sounded like crap. But for some reason I copied that into
1538700	1542380	what I ended up really using. And then I went back to my Final Fantasy 14 shot and it was,
1542380	1546700	wasn't fixed, blah, blah, blah. But yeah, the camera mic thing was awful, but that was kind
1546700	1551580	of my fault and not the programs. Um, okay. So yeah, I've been doing more live streaming. So
1551580	1555020	that was, that was cool. But I've also been playing other games too. I went back to round
1555020	1560380	one yesterday, uh, over in San Jose. And so I got to play some music games. Um, and you're here,
1560380	1565740	you guys go, some of you guys that, uh, have been sad that I have fallen out of love in many ways
1565740	1569500	with music games. I don't follow them as much as I used to in the early days of OLR, but obviously
1569500	1572700	I've been getting back into it. Thanks more and more to round one. I think you guys will get a
1572700	1577580	kick out of this. I bought an EMUs card, so I actually have an EMUs. Yeah. And you played it
1577580	1582460	on 2DX and what songs did you play on 2DX? Old songs. So you're still out of it. Well,
1582460	1587420	hold on though, because I got like a bonus thing at the end that was like, what was it called?
1587980	1590860	The music game fans are going to laugh at me because I don't follow this stuff as much as
1590860	1598380	I used to. It was something like, um, it was like a train, like, like a bonus train stage
1598380	1603580	came up at the end and I played that and it was one of the new songs because I was like,
1603580	1607180	Ooh, what's this special thing that I'm sure if you had your choice, you would just be like,
1607180	1611820	I'm going to go play spooky or something. They took spooky out of the game. I don't know what
1611820	1616140	the old songs that they have anymore because they're old and nobody plays whatever, whatever.
1616140	1620940	Um, so yeah, I was playing that musica and, uh, you know, just, just some random stuff that at
1620940	1626300	round one. So, um, I'm sure Shane didn't go yesterday because he was doing other stuff,
1626300	1630300	but, um, I'm sure, well, I still have like 20 bucks worth of credits left on my card,
1630300	1633580	so we're going to have to go back so I can spend that $20. Right.
1634300	1640540	Oh, you know what? I just decided I'm going to go there on August 15th.
1641260	1644300	Why that particular day? Am I out of town that day or something? And I'm just not remembering
1644300	1648620	in the moment. No, but I will be coming back from Power Morphicon and I have to make a stop
1648620	1654380	in San Jose anyway. Okay. And it sounds like that stop is not going to be extended to round one.
1654380	1657900	Okay. That works, I guess. So you can meet me down there.
1657900	1662940	Maybe. I don't, I have, I have to look at my calendar, see if I'm busy that weekend.
1662940	1667420	It's not a weekend. Oh, well then that's going to make it really hard to get over there.
1667420	1673740	It's like a Tuesday. Yeah. It's about that. Anyway. Um, and then, uh, on the mobile,
1673740	1676780	I want to make sure I mentioned this game as well because there's a new free to play.
1676780	1680540	You know, um, Loki was talking about the Katamari thing. He's still playing at the moment by the
1680540	1686380	way. Uh, and I checked out a new free to play game called Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, which
1686380	1690300	just came out on mobile. Um, I think this past week in the US. You have to try that too.
1691020	1695660	Yeah. It's, um, it's another fine. It's, it's different than record keeper though. Record keeper
1695660	1699340	keeper is I think a little bit more of the traditional Final Fantasy kind of looking thing.
1699340	1706540	This one has like, it looks like the traditional battles, but you, you just tap the, um, units and
1707020	1711500	they go attack. So it almost sounds like that horrible active time battle game, but it's,
1711500	1715260	it's actually nothing like that. I hated that active time battle game. And I really liked this
1715260	1720220	one. Um, because not only like you can hold your finger down instead of just tapping and you can
1720220	1727180	swipe to the right to use magic limit breaks, espers that you fuse with the units and all that
1727180	1732300	stuff. So it has a lot of that like traditional Final Fantasy six stuff, but it is a free to play
1732300	1737980	games. There's a lot of grindy stuff in it. Cause they want you to spend the currency that they
1737980	1742540	give you a little taste of for free, but you know, to, to get all the good stuff, you have to use
1742540	1748060	that currency, but I'm still enjoying it. And I don't, I don't play any huge marathon sessions
1748060	1752220	and I get enough bonus energy from completing quests and stuff that it hasn't really been a
1752220	1758940	problem for me yet. So, um, yeah, I'm enjoying the Brave Exvius. That's for sure. Um, I'm getting
1758940	1762940	asked a question about my gaming week and chat over at live.vog network.com. Vid power says,
1762940	1769260	I assume it's beat media 2d X 23 copula at round one. Yes it is. Yeah, it is. I could, again,
1769260	1772940	sound Voltex was busy the entire time. I couldn't get on that one. That's like the most popular,
1772940	1777020	but wanting you to play it last time either because it was really fun all the time. It was
1777020	1781740	pretty fun. Um, let's see. And then Kaijuto talking about the, uh, PlayStation four streaming
1781740	1787340	says, once you switch a game on PlayStation four, you have to reset up the broadcast. At that point,
1787340	1791260	you change the name to what you're currently playing. That doesn't work.
1792540	1796380	Uh, I don't, I don't know. I haven't streamed. Does he mean like start it and then stop it and
1796380	1800140	then start it again? Cause I guess that could work. Cause I would think that would technically
1800140	1804940	work, but that seems really ridiculous. I feel like I've tried that before. It didn't work,
1804940	1809660	but I don't know. Yeah. I I've just, I always fill in the thing. And then when I go to look
1809660	1814060	at my stream efforts of an archive, it's the previous game I played. This is I've always
1814060	1817900	done what you did, but the like having it on the computer and updating it there.
1817900	1821660	But the reason why I did that is so that I could have the chat room up on the computer in case
1821660	1826460	somebody had to be kicked or banned from chat. I can't do that from PlayStation four, but I could
1826460	1831020	excuse my, I could excuse myself to go to the restroom, boot the person from chat and then
1831020	1836140	come back. Yeah. So there's always that, but that's why I always set it up that way. So,
1836140	1839660	all right. That's pretty much it for my email. We have a, Oh no, I need to mention this one more,
1839740	1844380	one more because, um, uh, Loki last week got me some awesome birthday presents. And one of
1844380	1849180	the games he got me was grand theft auto five. I did play grand theft auto five today, and I beat
1849180	1853260	the prologue part of the game, which is the little, like, you know, uh, escape sequence
1853260	1857900	in the beginning. And then you race some cars and, and, uh, yeah, I played through that. Um,
1857900	1861420	I would have played more of it, but when I first went to go play at Thursday night,
1861980	1866700	it had to install and it was very, very slow. And then I had to download a patch. So it was like
1866700	1872620	at least 10 gigs, if not more. So I was just like, all right, I guess I'm not playing tonight.
1872620	1876220	I'm sure when I go back to play that, I'm going to have to do that as well. Well, not the install,
1876220	1882300	but the patching, cause they release a ton of content on the line. So my advice to y'all,
1882300	1887180	if you're gonna play grand theft auto five, start the night before. So it can update everything and
1887180	1892300	then come back the next day. Yeah. And the same thing happened. Like, Oh, I can't play for like
1892300	1897020	hours. Oh yeah. That's. And when you start the game, that's a really funny way to just,
1897020	1900940	it's not even like the, the, the whole PlayStation network installing in while you could do other
1900940	1905260	things. It's, I started the game and then it had like some kind of install on a loading screen
1905260	1910700	forever. A lot of PS four games are like file four. I felt was the same way. Dragon age
1910700	1915820	Inquisition, I think did that. They do that because they're streaming the way they do it
1915820	1920220	so fast as they put part of the game on the hard drive. Part of it stays on the desk and they
1920220	1926300	stream it from both. So it's reading off the hard drive and the Blu-ray at the same time. So they,
1926300	1930380	they're able to, you know, stream faster that way. At least that's what they need to do with
1930380	1935660	the older consoles. Not sure if that's necessary, the new ones, but that's, I know at least the only
1935660	1940860	game that I've had to do that with. So that's an interesting way to fuck over the red box people
1941420	1945260	is to like make the game install take all night. So now that the game's installed,
1945260	1950620	got to take it back. Sucka. Anyway. Uh, that's about it for my gaming week. So we'll go over to,
1950620	1954380	uh, Flaco Jones. How was your gaming week? What did you play? It was pretty good. I played, uh,
1954380	1958460	I played Splatoon because I hadn't logged on since the new weapon. I don't know when the new weapons
1958460	1962780	came out. They came out a couple of weeks ago or whatever, but the last round of weapons came out.
1963340	1968940	So I tried each one of them out. It was pretty cool. Uh, I wasn't a big fan of any of the new
1968940	1975900	weapons, maybe the new and zap, but it's tough to learn new combinations, especially when you're
1975900	1982140	used to the old ones. So I, I, I, I give them some, another chance or two. So, and then I played
1982140	1989580	a lot of Hearthstone on my phone and Marvel puzzle quests on my phone and Overwatch tons and tons of
1989580	1994060	Overwatch because I didn't even mention Overwatch, but yeah, I've been playing that too. Did you play
1994060	1999100	the new, uh, competitive mode? No, I don't play that much Overwatch. I'm not ranked 25. You're
1999100	2005900	not 25. So I was 24 and three quarters. So I got on and one night and I did, I only needed to win
2005900	2012140	like a couple more games and I got up to 25. So then I did the, I think this was Friday night.
2013420	2018060	It was the main cause it wasn't working the next day. So yeah, Friday night I did the placement
2018060	2024300	deal. So you have to play 10 games in the new competitive mode format. And after that,
2024300	2029100	they give you, based on, I guess your win and loss ratio, I guess it's always really based on,
2029100	2036220	you get a, I figured what it's called like a rating. So I did terribly, I lost my first game,
2036220	2041500	then I won my second while I was playing with extra for, and then I lost like, I want to say
2041500	2049580	the next six in a row or maybe five in a row. And then I won three of my last four to get to
2049580	2055580	a semi-respectable four wins out of 10. So I got a 39, which I was actually fine with. It was like,
2055580	2059180	I was like, you know, it sucks to lose since I actually lost a couple of them really close,
2059180	2068060	like very near wins. And then I, uh, I, um, got on there and I got a 39, but I was like, you know,
2068060	2072860	it's not too bad because I want, I'd rather be up against weaker competition anywhere,
2072860	2076460	but it's not weaker. It's probably more of my, it seems to make sense. That's probably the people
2076460	2081020	that should be up against. I will be that loser that gets zero wins out of 10 in the placement
2081020	2084780	and I will fucking rage and throw my keyboard against the wall. But then you don't have to
2084780	2089020	play against this hardcore people. I guess that's the bonus. That's, that's the bright side I took.
2089020	2092380	I even was like, man, I kind of wish I'd won three. Like we did one of those, you know,
2092380	2096060	those ones where it's like 50, 50, I call it 50, 50. I don't know what it's called, but it's like,
2096060	2100700	you have to have the percentage go to a hundred first for the other side. We won the first round
2100700	2105500	of that and it's best out of five as opposed to best out of three, what it is in quick play.
2105500	2111740	And then the other team, three people just dropped or four people dropped. So then it was the rest
2111740	2116780	of our team, six people against two and they still make you play the whole thing out. I felt so bad
2116780	2122620	for those two people. I've heard that the really toxic, gross part of the community is coming out
2122620	2129020	in that competitive match. I wouldn't know, but, but blizzard has also said, if you drop too many
2129020	2132940	matches, you're going to get banned from the competitive mode. Yeah. Blizzard said they're
2132940	2136620	watching it. And if you drop too many matches, you, you get kicked out of competitive mode and
2136620	2141660	they'll get the rewards. Wow. So yeah, we basically just two poor guys, but they stuck through it.
2141660	2146700	I felt bad for them. Like, should they, so they get a loss then on their placement, right? That's
2146700	2151820	just feels so unfair. Yeah. Cause they had no chance that he was only one loss when, um,
2151820	2157740	when I play Overwatch, I'm like that GIF of Ron Swanson with the headphones on just kind of
2158460	2164540	bobbing back and forth because I just don't ever turn on my voice chat. I ignore everything in
2164540	2169340	party chat. I'm like, can't hear you. I don't, I don't give a fuck what any of you have to say.
2169340	2173420	That lets me mute it. So they can't hear me, but I turn it on, but I've never heard anyone. I have
2173420	2177980	team chat auto join. I've never heard a single soul on the way to say like four people in team
2178060	2184620	chat. I suppose it's unfortunate because there's probably people that actually want to help and
2184620	2188780	like help people do better. Maybe that's why I leave it open just in case somebody actually
2188780	2192220	has something constructive to say that I'll, I would chime in, but I've never had to. Yeah.
2192220	2196060	That's why I would get zero out of 10 placement, but it's like, I'm not going to put up with the
2196060	2200620	toxic garbage. Anyway. Um, Alan walked into studio and I know Alan's been playing a crap ton of
2200620	2204860	Overwatch as well. So you, you have something to say on this clearly. Hello. Hi. How are you doing?
2204860	2210380	Um, yeah. So for the 10 evaluation rounds, yeah. If you drop out of those, cause a lot of people
2210380	2214300	want to game the system and get as many wins as possible. Yeah. If you drop out of those,
2214300	2218860	then you can possibly be banned from the season altogether. But once you do the 10 evaluation
2218860	2224380	rounds and you are in the actual season competitive mode with everyone that has their rank,
2224380	2229820	if you drop, and I have a complaint about this in a minute, if you drop your other teammates will
2229820	2235260	be like, you lost a person and they haven't signed back on. If you wait 90 seconds, you can all leave
2235260	2240140	this round without a penalty. So if someone drops. Oh, so that's why everybody else left.
2240140	2247900	Yeah. So it kind of, yeah. Okay. So there'll be a notice that says like, cause also I've disconnected
2248540	2253020	not on purpose, just because lag spike or internet went down and I'm not sure if this is working as
2253020	2259180	intended, but I was able to reload the Blizzard client, get back into the game, click play, or
2259180	2263340	actually put me right back into the match. So I was in, but because I disconnected and was out
2263340	2268060	for a minute, even though we won, it counted as a loss to me personally. And my rank went down by
2268060	2275580	one. Oh, wow. And that's awful. And actually, and cause you know, in chat is saying if they ban
2275580	2279420	people, they better refund their money too. Well, I don't think people that are getting banned are
2279420	2284460	getting banned for the entire game, just from the season, just from the, the rank play or whatever.
2284540	2287580	Yeah. You can still do play the normal game. You can do quick play. You can do. Yeah.
2288220	2292940	Um, but you, it is possible to get banned from normal play too, but you have to be one of those
2292940	2297660	like really toxic assholes to get that happen. Um, and then I got four out of 10 for my evaluation
2297660	2302140	rounds. Yay. Uh, what, what did you get for it? Yeah. What was it? What would the number they
2302140	2306300	gave you? 46 or 47. Well, how does that part work? Cause I was like, shouldn't I just be a
2306300	2310540	40? I was a 39. That's like, what did they, how did they decide I was a 39 and not a 40?
2310540	2316220	I think it goes by how many like, cause a lot of, a lot of the escort, the vehicle ones are escort,
2316220	2321420	the payload. There are checkpoints. So if you get all five checkpoints, that's more points.
2321420	2324860	All right. That makes more sense. So yeah. Oh, so I probably got a really good boost from that one
2324860	2329660	wherever he left. Cause we won three to nothing. Two or three of my losses ended in sudden death
2329660	2335100	where it was tied. And then we lost. It was so fun. I should be like seven to 10, but yeah, no.
2335900	2342220	Um, yeah, so I was given a 47 rank, but because of disconnects and losses,
2342220	2349180	I'm now at like 44. So I'm going down, down, down. But yeah, if you get to level 25,
2349180	2351900	you can do your 10 evaluation matches. I don't know if I can help you though.
2352540	2356540	Yeah, probably. You probably can't do the evals with me. It's fine. I just need to suck it up
2356540	2361100	and play more Overwatch. It was kind of cool. Like I sit up till almost two in the morning
2361100	2364220	at like one 30 in the morning, I think just playing that. Cause it's like, I just want
2364220	2367100	to finish it. I know I'm doing terribly, especially when I was on the bad streak,
2367100	2372140	but you know, I ended well, so it was fun. I just want to be that guy that gets zero of 10.
2372140	2377340	The competitive matches are actually a lot longer because yes, you do a full match. And then the
2377340	2380940	other than it's flipped where if you're escorting the payload and you're on defense, then you're on
2380940	2387420	attack. And um, though actually they can be shorter. Yeah. Cause if you don't meet the
2387420	2391260	criteria that the other team met, it just ends. It does. It's like, there's no point now. Yeah.
2391260	2399260	Like, um, we got our payload in like with like three minutes to spare. So the other team had
2399260	2404540	to do it in that time or less. So their timer was adjusted to buy what our score was. So they
2404540	2409020	had to basically do it better than we did. So yeah, it adjusts. Um, or you only, we only had
2409020	2412140	to make it to the second checkpoint on one. You didn't have to make it all the way to the end of
2412140	2415500	the map. You just get, you just had to beat the other team and then you, then it's over.
2416300	2419580	But yeah, otherwise it's like, if it's like you said that that contributes to your rating,
2419660	2423820	wouldn't that hurt your rating then you couldn't get the max points. Like say if you went first,
2423820	2429580	you can go down anywhere from a half to a whole point. Like I've gone down three quarters of a
2429580	2433740	point before. Okay. So yeah, I still haven't played since doing my placement actually,
2433740	2437340	but cause I've been busy. Yeah. So they're really long cause it could be upwards of three
2437340	2442220	whole matches. Yeah. It's an investment. It makes you do best of five instead of best of three,
2442220	2446780	which what it is on quick play. Yeah. So they changed that too. So that's all Overwatch,
2447180	2450140	Overwatch. It's what a lot of people are playing right now. So
2450780	2454780	I've had a blast. You guys have more experience with it than me. Although I feel like I've been
2454780	2459900	playing enough, you know, but I thought I was so surprised. Like I feel like I've been playing
2459900	2465420	a lot and then I log out. I'm like, I'm not 25. Okay. My name is Splatoon. Splatoon. You'll
2465420	2469420	need to get to 10 to play ranked mode. I don't know. I don't think time comparison wise. I
2469420	2472700	don't know if it's similar or not. I think, I think it's a lot faster to get a 10 in Splatoon
2473020	2477340	25 in Overwatch. But I agree with that. Anything else for your gaming week?
2477340	2480060	I think that's pretty much it. All right. Let's go to Shane. Shane, how was your gaming week?
2480060	2486060	What have you been playing? I played Pokemon. That's literally it. Um, I know I did play
2486060	2489420	the Final Fantasy game on mobile, but I've already uninstalled it. I don't like it.
2490060	2497420	Not a fan. It's not very fun to me. So Pokemon. How's your, uh, shiny decks going?
2497420	2505260	55 is my current total now. Yeah, but it's not really when there's 720. Oh my gosh. Which you
2505260	2510060	can't even get all shiny, but have you caught any shinies during the show tonight? No, not yet.
2510060	2520700	What one are you working on now? Uh, Ivy soar and, uh, pan Sage and, uh, Quilladon. Those are
2520700	2523660	the three I'm looking at at the moment. I thought you got one of those last night.
2523820	2530860	Yeah, I got pan Sage, but I evolved him. So I need to get him again. Oh, got it. Yeah. So
2532060	2539260	just those lots. You looking forward to Pokemon world? Uh, the worlds. Yeah. I'm so excited for
2539260	2545340	that. They had the, um, cause it's not in the show at all. Uh, they had the American and Australian
2545340	2551420	and I believe Hong Kong nationals this weekend. So I was watching, I wasn't watching Hong Kong
2551420	2557500	cause I don't think there was a stream of it. Um, but American and Australian were both on Twitch
2557500	2561260	and I watched that and it was a lot of fun. Yeah. Actually vid power and chat over at
2561260	2565580	live.fognetwork.com says, uh, Pokemon national championships is this weekend. Yeah. I saw some
2565580	2572300	of the trading card, um, which is, is still fun to watch. I play a little bit on my iPad sometimes.
2572300	2577740	I didn't watch any of the Pokken. Um, even though that got streamed and I watched a lot of the
2578380	2583740	actual video game and that was like the best. I cannot wait to watch it in person.
2584860	2589980	So much fun. All right. Well, uh, let's get to tonight's gaming news. Uh, just some quick
2589980	2594700	housekeeping. Um, remember to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio.
2594700	2599100	We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. Um, and as far as our schedule goes,
2599100	2605260	uh, the next show we will have off for sure is labor day weekend. Um, as I will be at dragon con,
2605260	2609100	which that, that date is sneaking up sooner rather than later. I got to get my flights
2609100	2615980	booked this week. Cause uh, yeah. Wow. I can't believe it's the end of next month or no, I guess,
2615980	2619740	I guess the way the dates fall this year, it's actually the beginning of September with the labor
2619740	2624140	day kind of got close enough. Yeah, but close enough. Close enough. I've started thinking about
2624140	2628780	what cosplay I want to do, but I saw my pal Victoria. I haven't seen in like a year and I
2628780	2632140	feel like she came on this show. Was it, she was on guys on the show. She did the Disneyland
2632140	2636220	episode of guys on the show. Um, and she does like a lot of super cosplay stuff. She did a
2636220	2640540	game of thrones character yesterday at Rocky, uh, cause they were doing like a nerd theme.
2640540	2646620	Uh, so she's, uh, she did, uh, who's the one that shame, shame. Oh, I don't know the nun.
2646620	2651260	I don't know her name. No, not, not the nun. She was Cersei. Cersei. That's okay. You see,
2651260	2655260	look, I have a show Sunday nights. I don't get to watch the other one, but you got close. I got
2655260	2661420	close. I described it. Well, because I know at the very, at the beginning she was dressed and
2661420	2665180	she was sipping from a wine glass, which I guess is like a big thing. That's all she ever does.
2665180	2670940	Okay. So she was doing that. And then at the end, apparently she came out and she was not wearing
2670940	2676060	a lot of clothes and the whole audience was throwing popcorn at her going shame, shame. Yeah.
2676060	2680220	And that was like the joke. So anyway, um, how do we get on that? Oh yes. Because she said she
2680220	2684940	would help me do a cosplay, whatever I want to do for dragon con this year. But I'm not,
2684940	2688300	I'm not sure. Like I could do my joker again, even though the belt broke. So I have to get that
2688300	2691820	fixed. But then I'm like, well, I kind of want to do something else, but I also really don't
2691820	2697020	want to shave my beard. So kind of limits what I can do. I don't know. We'll see. Does it,
2698140	2707020	you could be a Pokemon. I'm going to be a Pokemon. Oh my gosh. Can I really pick? Yes. Pick. Yeah.
2707020	2712700	What Pokemon? Let me go look, which one I want you to be. Do I get to pick which one I want him
2712700	2720220	to be all like in your memory? No. Yeah. I have a Pokemon. Cause the one, the one I would like
2720220	2727100	you to be is goth to tell. I think that would be hilarious. I'll show you in a minute. I'll search.
2727100	2734700	Um, or you could be, Oh, it'd be hilarious. Like all I'm just trying to think about is,
2734700	2743820	Oh, you could be, um, a Florges also. So basically I'm picking the female looking one.
2745100	2750940	Whatever. I, and you know what, for the right, actually, that's not a horrible outfit.
2751820	2759340	Oh my God. For, for the right, for the right costume, I'll consider shaving my beard.
2759340	2762780	No, you don't have to shave your beard. You just paint over it. You just cover it. Just cover my
2762780	2768460	beard. I'm going to find the mustache. And you get to pick which color flower petals for this one.
2768460	2773100	Goodie. I like how, I like how he's already saying it. Like it's a sure thing. Like what
2773100	2779420	was the one you played in, in a poke and tournament? Um, it's a Fennekin's evolved form.
2779420	2784460	Breaks in. Yeah. Breaks you in. Isn't that like a ginger? It's a Fox. I don't know. Fuck off.
2785740	2790700	Here's the one you could be. Oh, you've shown me that one. That's just a flower.
2791420	2797820	It's like a drag queen flower. Look, it's got like all these flowery.
2797820	2801580	Does it even have a face? What is that? It's faces right there. Actually,
2801580	2805900	I don't understand. You know what? Dark Tetsuya makes an awesome nerd point in our chat room at
2805900	2812380	live.voggenower.com saying, isn't that what the guy that played Joker in Batman 66 did? He didn't
2812380	2817100	shave his mustache. Yes. Cesar Romero who played Joker in the old sixties, Batman. He, he never
2817100	2820780	shaved. That's why his face kind of looked funny. He would not shave his mustache for the role.
2820780	2826460	They painted over it in the white paint because the older cameras, they didn't really catch it,
2826460	2830300	but since they have to remaster Batman, like if you go back and watch the Batman 66 movie,
2830300	2835100	like he's really bad. I have breaking news. What happened? What I have a better Pokemon for you to
2835100	2843980	do. I hate it when shame breaks. It's not, it's never legitimate. Not going to dress up as yes.
2843980	2849100	What is that? One is like the old school one that looks like the drag queen basically. Well,
2849100	2855980	like all the ones I'm picking for your drag queen. I might as well do Mr. Mime. No,
2855980	2860060	that's not drag. I'll just, I'm just going to wear a pink Snuggie and say I'm a ditto.
2860060	2865740	That's that'll be it. All right. Stupid. Yeah. Just like your ideas. Not as stupid as being jinx.
2866540	2875180	All right. Look, I don't even, I think you would do a very good job. I would have to
2875180	2881020	Orko enjoy. I would have to paint my entire body purple. You know, just your hands and your face.
2881020	2885100	Oh, well that's all. And, but not your lips. That's some lipstick you could wear. And then
2885100	2890700	you get a blonde wig and then like the, um, you could just be a Pokemon trainer, get a blow up
2890700	2898860	doll, dress it up like that. Okay. Now here's the thing. And I could do this. And then we're
2898860	2906380	getting into gaming news. We're leaving this. I actually, years ago, one Halloween, I dressed as
2906380	2912300	Ash Ketchum because I have a Pokemon that's like life size, a little Pikachu. And like,
2912300	2918220	you can kind of put your arm through the tail and it can sit on your shoulder. So I actually did
2918220	2923660	that one year. So I could do the Ash Ketchum again, except this is like Ash Ketchum pushing 40.
2925340	2930700	I haven't caught them all yet. This is not a very good life plan.
2933020	2935660	Which if you think about it with as old as Pokemon is
2936380	2940380	Ash Ketchum ought to be pushing 40 now. So it's kind of appropriate.
2941180	2944620	All right. Very best that I could be in accounting.
2944620	2948700	That was the very best. And then I took an arrow to the knee.
2948700	2951100	Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, found a better one.
2951100	2955180	Then you got drafted into the war. All right. I'm so done with this topic. We
2955180	2959100	need to get back into some gaming news. This is all about games right now.
2959100	2963820	It's it's horrible. I would have unsubscribed hours ago. This is pretty awesome. All right.
2963820	2971420	Loki get his can be a lot bunny. It's basically, no, it's a bunny. It's like a Playboy bunny.
2971420	2976220	I a Playboy. Oh my God. Gaming news. Loki started us off tonight.
2977340	2983420	So Microsoft is getting rid of X-Box fitness. Which is a bummer. I was going to use that to
2983420	2987420	lose some weight so I could do some slutty cosplay like jinx. That's not going to happen
2987420	2993100	either. I'm not going to be slutty jinx with that. Um, but yes, apparently, um, you know,
2993100	2997100	they're going to start to go wind down. So right now you can't buy new content.
2998060	3003740	And those who have purchased content so far, you can use those up until June 30th, 2017.
3003740	3009660	And then after that, well, too bad. You don't get free shit anymore. You don't get to, uh,
3009660	3016940	view your content that you paid for anymore. That kind of sucks. Well, that sucks for you.
3016940	3022620	If you bought that $60 Jillian Michaels workout video that it's just going to get taken away from
3022620	3029100	you. I've never, ever even heard of X-Box fitness, like for real. When did that happen?
3029660	3034460	At the launch of the three or at the launch of the 360 and the launch of the one when the connect
3034460	3040780	was included with every X-Box and you know, a big part of why the connect took off in the beginning
3040780	3045660	was what dance games and fitness games. Right. That was like all the connect was in the beginning
3045660	3051020	for the 360 for the X-Box one. It was never anything. Well, it was an extra thing that
3051020	3055100	they packaged in with your system that you're paying for. I think it had hoped to continue
3055100	3059500	the, um, dance game and fitness game trend because, um, there was, there was a dance central game for
3059500	3064780	a hot minute, but it was like, uh, here's a very bare bones version of it. Now buy all our songs
3064780	3072460	extra that that doesn't fly usually pretty much. So, and Microsoft still has not said, like,
3072460	3078300	you're going to get compensated. I mean, this is why people are nervous about buying shit digitally
3078300	3083180	and they should be, you know, again, it depends how much you're spending, I suppose.
3083180	3088060	Like, you know, if steam went belly up tomorrow and I can no longer download,
3088780	3093340	you know, the shower with your dad simulator that I spent 69 cents on, I'm not going to be that
3093340	3097340	worried about it. You know, when you were saying that you got that game, I confused it with that
3097340	3101580	other showering game with guys where you actually have to like rub them down. You've seen that game
3101580	3106380	before I have that game. It's hilarious. No, you're weird. You know, if you saw this game,
3106380	3111260	you'd be like, why am I not playing it right now? It's by the guy that does the lot of like
3111260	3117740	the sex games, I guess like, Oh, that guy. Oh no, no. Like he has stuff on steam. It's like,
3117740	3123180	that's what he's known for. He had the game where you, where you take like penis pictures,
3123180	3128860	like you were, um, like on, you know, one of those social media things and
3128860	3134460	Is this guy to steam like that guy on Amazon who writes those books? It's like pounded in the butt
3134460	3142060	by my butt and like, uh, like, uh, pounded in the butt by the Brexit and like all these like
3142060	3146620	random things. I mean, please tell me somebody else has heard of this on Amazon. Yes. There's
3146620	3150860	this author on Amazon who writes all these like crappy. Well, I don't know. I haven't,
3150860	3154460	I haven't read them. I don't know if they're good or not, but they're, you know,
3154460	3160220	gay Rodica things that have these like ridiculous names. I don't think they're supposed to be good.
3160220	3167900	One of them got troll nominated by the CD side of Twitter for a prestigious, like a Hugo award
3167900	3174620	or something. And it was, it was, um, it was one of this guy's books. So this sounds like that,
3174620	3180940	but on steam anyway, I don't know how we got from X-Box fitness to pound it in the butt by my butt,
3180940	3185580	but basically, so the reason that they're terminating the service is because the service
3185580	3191180	requires regular content updates, given the service, um, relies on providing you with new
3191180	3195820	and exciting content regularly. Microsoft has given too much or has given much consideration
3195820	3204220	to the reality, um, updating the service regularly in order to sustain it. And, um,
3206380	3214540	and that's it. That's like half of a quote. What the hell? Um, we thought about it and that's it.
3214780	3219500	We're done. Um, we thought about, Hey, yeah, we were going to update that service called
3219500	3225260	game room too, but those guys. Yeah. That's a sore spot too. Cause I spent money on game room
3225260	3232060	and it's like, well, that's gone pounded in the butt by Microsoft. Um, looking at the internet,
3232060	3235980	I found the name of that book that got nominated for a Hugo award. It was space Raptor button
3235980	3242220	invasion. That's the one that got nominated for you. I hope they get made into a movie.
3242220	3251100	It'll probably do better at the box office. You know what? You laugh, but I bet space Raptor.
3251100	3257180	What was it? Space Raptor button vision or space Raptor button vision has more of a story than
3257180	3262620	Tetris does and Tetris is getting a three movie deals. So why can't space Raptor button vision
3262620	3267020	get at least one movie? Why not? I never thought Loki would be defending space Raptor button
3267020	3271740	vision here on the show, but seriously, we are that having a movie would be less ridiculous
3271820	3276460	than Tetris having a movie. That is how ridiculous that concept is.
3278140	3283820	Um, all right. Well, one concept, uh, we would like to hear about soon already is the
3283820	3288860	Nintendo NX and what is the fricking catch with the Nintendo at X? What is the thing?
3288860	3294140	Uh, apparently in an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto this week talked about that the reason
3294140	3300220	why the NX has not been unveiled is because there is a secret idea. And, uh, from this
3300220	3306940	article with big story, uh, that he said in terms of NX, there's an idea we're working on.
3306940	3310940	This is why we can't share anything at this point. And I don't want to comment on the other
3310940	3315660	companies. If it was just a matter of following advancements in technology, things would be coming
3315660	3320380	out a lot quicker. So in other words, what I draw from that is that, look, if we were just bumping
3320380	3325420	up the specs and putting out like a power console, then, then we would have said it already. But
3325420	3330460	because there's some type of twist to the system that they don't want other people to steal,
3331260	3338300	that's why they're not unveiling it. What? This is a stupid fucking reason. I'm sorry.
3338300	3342700	I want to, I do want to just quickly say though, maybe there's a translation thing going on here.
3342700	3346940	I do. Cause this has happened a couple of times. That's the case. And then this, I mean,
3346940	3351900	translators, come on, seriously. But, um, assuming that there's not a translation issue,
3351900	3356380	I think that is a dumb fucking excuse because seriously, what is two fucking months or how
3356380	3360940	many months between now and when they're going to announce it, is it going to matter? And they're
3360940	3365660	going to fucking copy it anyways, if it's a good idea. But it didn't come out right away. Like the
3365660	3370860	move and the connect weren't a thing that was like out at the launch of the weed. The connect
3370860	3375980	was sort of like an evolved idea. I wouldn't really consider Microsoft doesn't necessarily
3375980	3379980	just steal ideas. They steal them and make them better. And that's what they will try to do in
3379980	3385100	theory with connect that they didn't really, that they didn't really perfect until the Xbox one,
3385100	3389020	by which point everybody stopped caring to see a trend of Microsoft where they try to steal these
3389020	3393100	ideas and make them better. They're not really successful with a lot of them. Like the windows
3393100	3403900	phone, the zoom, the connect, uh, what was that? The, uh, or the, yeah, but then they do something
3403900	3408860	like a second screen glass crap. Okay. Uh, but then they do something like Xbox live,
3408860	3413180	which has been like the biggest innovation. So they kind of been doing that for a long,
3413180	3417260	one could argue that was bitten off. What like game spy servers and things that were already
3417260	3422060	existed in the PC world. Okay. So fine. They did something right there, but it's been a while
3422060	3427180	since they've had it hit. But like, I seriously think that as a stupid fucking reason and it's
3427180	3432300	cause it's, if it is a gimmick of some sort, they're not going to change their game plan.
3432300	3436460	That, I mean, if it's that significant, I don't think that these companies are a changer game plan
3436460	3441180	that quickly. And if it is something that they can change that quickly where they're like,
3441180	3446380	if you announced it now, they're going to be able to steal it by the time that you release this.
3447260	3452700	Who cares? I mean, it's going to be like, yeah, so it'll delay it a few more months and then
3452700	3458140	they'll steal it. I mean, what's the big deal? I think I know what it is. It is putting a handle
3458140	3463340	on your system again, just like they did with the game. Uh, dark to see you in chat says,
3463340	3466540	well, yeah, I mean, look at the, we, after it was announced and Sony came out and said,
3466540	3470380	look, our system has motion control on our control. It was fucking so I can see why
3470380	3475100	Nintendo went that way. They're still using that fucking garbage motion controller. I disagree.
3475100	3481020	I think the move actually was better. Like it was way more accurate than the we, and it felt,
3481020	3485260	it just didn't really have, you know, you're right. Yeah. Cause I did use that. I do remember
3485260	3489500	that now, but like the implementation of it was garbage. Like they didn't have the games
3489500	3495180	to justify it. But I give Sony massive props that now it's like, okay, well that's coming back. So
3495180	3502700	like, it's not, it was good back then, but it's not good enough. I think they need to do more
3502700	3508220	with it. Uh, let's see. And then Stoppy says, uh, because you know, Nintendo doesn't have a legal
3508220	3513420	arm to go to after companies that copy their idea. Maybe they're all busy going after let's players
3513420	3517420	and coffee table books. Well, that's a whole nother issue, but yeah. Uh, maybe their legal
3517420	3523740	arms tied up with that. Although, you know, again, apparently Sony or I'm sorry, apparently, um,
3523740	3530460	Nintendo couldn't stop the move, but I would bet because the move was based with a camera and the
3530460	3535980	Wii thing was based on infrared. That's was different enough for it not to be a very different.
3535980	3540940	Yeah. Yeah. Cause we, you, the, the remotes are looking at a sensor bar. So they're basically
3540940	3546300	finding like two, two points that are on top of your TV and they're tracking that versus the
3546300	3552060	camera tracking the actual controllers instead. Well, I mean, they're going to have to unveil
3552060	3557580	what it is eventually to make people want one. So I, I still kind of agree with the general
3557580	3562940	consensus that the week before Tokyo game show is when this will be revealed. And the reason why
3562940	3568300	is not because Nintendo, you know, Nintendo doesn't really do Tokyo game show, but the third
3568300	3573740	parties that are going to put games out on an X will then be able to, uh, basically promote for
3573740	3577580	them at Tokyo game show. And I, I, that's why I believe that we will hear about the NX the week
3577580	3582060	before Tokyo game show. Can we at least all agree that whatever they're hiding right now is probably
3582060	3586700	insignificant really? Yep. Yep. I don't think it's, I don't think it's something that's so
3586700	3590540	game changing that they need to hide it. I'm going to agree with it, but not in such a negative
3590540	3594860	connotation. I think because they're hiding it, it's something that's really easy to copy.
3595420	3600060	So that's why they're hiding it. So we'll see. What's it going to be over your own VR? I mean,
3600060	3604860	seriously, like, I don't know what they could, well, they've already publicly stated that they
3604860	3609340	are, you know, they've seen a lot of things that they're thinking about doing things and they have
3609340	3613740	projects and ideas. I'm starting to get the impression that they don't know what the fuck
3613740	3617420	they're going to make that system into that. They're just throwing all these ideas like,
3617420	3621100	Oh, maybe we should do some VR. Well, maybe we should do this. Maybe we should do this.
3621100	3623740	I don't think that's why they're showing it because they don't know what the fuck it is.
3623740	3628780	Yeah. They don't have anything to show. It's just like, I'm going to throw a wild dart
3628780	3634780	against the wall. And if this whole handheld and console universe thing, it proves to be true.
3635580	3642620	Nintendo are, I think it has something to do with game streaming. And they're worried that
3642620	3647980	Sony's going to jack it for PlayStation now. And I don't, I'm sorry. I don't, you know,
3647980	3653820	if I knew what it was, boy, I'd probably be a lot richer and, uh, you know, be a games analyst full
3653820	3659580	time. But, um, I have a feeling, I don't know why my gut tells me it seems like a natural evolution
3659580	3665100	of the fact that the Wii U streams from the countertop box to your device, maybe they
3665100	3668940	figured out a way to get that done over the internet or something there. It's something
3668940	3673340	they don't want Sony to incorporate into PlayStation. Now, again, that's just a wild
3673340	3678780	guess, but that would strike me as something that's quote unquote, easy to copy. If Sony
3678780	3682780	were to dedicate the resources to the copy, because I think they are dedicating the resources
3682780	3687180	to it. I wish they'd spend those resources on getting backwards compatibility to work instead,
3687180	3690780	because I don't believe for a second that they can't get that to run on the PS4.
3691660	3695340	Stop being chat says, I don't disagree with Rob, but game streaming, if that's the idea,
3695340	3699420	they're worried if people copying, they deserve all the hate they get. I, here's the thing,
3699420	3704220	it's not like, like, obviously it's not just game streaming. There's something new there. And if I
3704220	3710540	knew what it was, then I could steal Nintendo's idea, but I'm speculating. I wonder if, here's
3710620	3714300	the, here's might be, okay, I'll put out the wild guess that I think it might be.
3715180	3720700	Because with PlayStation now you stream games from a centralized server. You don't really stream it
3720700	3726780	to your place. You don't stream it from your PlayStation four to your Vita, unless you're
3726780	3733100	in wifi. I think what could be the catch is that Nintendo's figured out a way through low bandwidth
3733100	3736860	or something, maybe just for virtual console games, maybe for very, very low bandwidth games
3736860	3742460	or something. They found a way that you can stream over the internet, over the air from your
3743580	3749900	NX to your handheld NX, no matter where you are. That's, that's my guess.
3751420	3755420	It's a crazy guess. I totally admit, but that's, that's what I mean when it's something to do with
3755420	3759820	game streaming, but it's something we haven't quite seen yet. No, I don't think you could
3759820	3764700	literally pause your game at home. Get in the, get in the car to go start going to work or the
3764700	3769740	train to go to work and pick up right where you left off on your device. The Vita and the
3769740	3775500	PlayStation four almost do this, but they don't really do it over the internet. I, I don't think
3775500	3781180	so. That's just my wild guess. Uh, all right. Anyway, let's, uh, let's move on to some more
3781180	3788300	stories. Uh, who's going to go next? Jim, it's me. It's me. Uh, I wanted to talk about, uh,
3788300	3793100	summer games done quick. And I know a lot of this is covered. I heard the tail in the Bobby show,
3793100	3798700	so, but, um, uh, that's okay. We have podcasters who might listen in reverse. They might listen
3798700	3803100	to reverse order and listen to Bobby second. So, so the thing that I wanted to open up with
3803100	3808460	before I get into the summer games done quick was, you know, they were featured, uh, one of
3808460	3813500	the speed runners is featured on the Colbert show or was it called the late show? It's sad that I
3813500	3817580	don't know what it's called Letterman's old show. It's the late show because that was Letterman's
3817580	3821900	show. It's the late show with Steven Colbert. It was Steven Colbert. They had Mitch flower power,
3821900	3827420	whose name real name is Mitch Fowler. I'm like, Oh, I get it now. So they had him on and he ran
3828220	3833180	Super Mario brothers three. And I guess because his, one of his fast times is like three Oh eight.
3833180	3838940	Then Colbert raced him in like cooking and eating a hot pocket. And then he also had like,
3838940	3845500	these guys do a relay race from some local track. It was like Columbia. I think so. Yeah. So yeah.
3845500	3848940	So they did like a three way thing where like these guys were running a relay race and Colbert
3848940	3854220	was microwaving and eating a hot pocket. And this guy was running some more of a string. Colbert won
3854220	3860300	because this guy didn't Mitch didn't get his best time, but he did it in like three 35. I think it
3860300	3864220	was kind of lost in the broadcast because once Colbert finished, they kind of ended this segment.
3864220	3868460	And, but then, you know, he finished his run. I think he got like a three 35 and then like
3868460	3873180	something he didn't trigger the glitch as fast as you usually get. But he got it. And I saw her,
3873180	3876300	I saw him walk up to the princess and all that. So he triggered the ending without having to fight
3876940	3879900	Bowser. So that was pretty cool. And I just thought it was cool. Cause then at the end,
3879900	3883660	they plugged summer games on quick. So they plugged it on national TV. And I know
3883660	3887500	this marathon has been running for a while every year. They've been making more money,
3887500	3891740	except for the last awesome gives. They made less money than the previous one, but I think it'd be
3891740	3896540	cool to see what kind of bump summer games gets this year. And I like, I've always followed this
3896540	3902140	a lot. I actually applied to be, or I guess submitted a run to be on this year's summer
3902140	3905580	games on quick, but I was rejected, but it was a PT. I was going to try to run.
3905580	3907020	You're going to keep submitting until you get it though, right?
3907020	3910060	Yeah, I'll keep trying. I don't know if it's a game they would ever want to put on.
3910060	3913340	I almost wanted to like promote it as like, cause I was, I was trying to say like
3913980	3920540	every summer because the S I told you earlier, it's during the awful or during the AGDQ,
3920540	3923980	they do awful games on quick during the summer. They do silly games on quick starts in S well,
3923980	3927820	they also do spooky games on quick every summer. And they usually throw a couple of horror games
3927820	3930300	in there. So I thought, Oh, this would be great compliment. Cause it's so short,
3930300	3933660	just squeeze it into a spooky games block. But now I'm like, wouldn't it be funny if they did
3933660	3940460	like a slow games done quick. Cause PT kind of falls into that realm of, I hate to say walking
3940460	3943820	simulators, but it's a game where you just pretty much are walking down the hallway, except for one
3943820	3950220	short segment where you're going fast. But I've also seen speed runs on games like, uh, uh, gone
3950220	3953740	home. You can beat in under a minute. Yeah. Gone home is another one. I was playing when I was
3953740	3957020	waiting for the grand theft auto installation. I actually played gone home on PlayStation four and
3957020	3961340	I re there's a trophy for beating it in under a minute. And I was like, why you can beat the game
3961340	3965420	in a minute? And I let you go home. You're like, all right, I'm done. No. If you know,
3965420	3971180	I mean, spoiler alert, but if you know where the secret door is, where the key to the attic is,
3971180	3974940	which you usually find throughout the discovery, you get kind of get clues to where the secret
3974940	3977820	door is. But if you know where it is, you just go right to it, grab the key to the attic,
3977820	3981420	go to the attic, get the diary and end the game. And you can be, uh, everyone's gone to the rapture
3981420	3986060	in like a minute because there's a glitch you can do. If you kind of like jump and twirl around
3986060	3990380	near the start, you can jump a fence. And actually where you start is really close to the place where
3990620	3998700	you start switches tonight and then you walk up and do the final cut scene. So you can do that.
3998700	4003020	So I was like, Oh, that'd be fun if they did a block of slow games done quick. The S thing,
4003020	4006780	they're games that are typically slow. Uh, until Dawn is another game where you pretty much walk
4006780	4010700	the whole game and there's some glitches in that good game. I don't think you could speed run that.
4011980	4016460	Tiger watch. Yeah. Tiger con chat says you think they will ever do a winner games done quick.
4016700	4021500	That is awesome. That is awesome. Games is in the winter. Awesome. Games happens every January. So
4021500	4025740	we're speed running until Dawn. Do you just kill everybody off? Uh, there's different categories.
4025740	4028780	There are categories for saving everyone. It's just like every speed run. There's categories.
4028780	4032140	There's any percent and there's, you know, all the, any percent, it doesn't matter what happens.
4032140	4036780	Usually that's the most popular category in any speed run. Uh, so yeah. So yeah, I looked at the
4036780	4041980	schedule. I think it's a pretty cool, you know, uh, marathon this year. I kind of like how they're
4041980	4046060	ending it with super Mario RPG. They've, they've typically ended either with the final fantasy
4046060	4050620	game or I think a couple of times they've ended with Corona trigger. So this time,
4050620	4054060	and I think one time did they end with the Metroid race? I don't know. I don't think they ever have.
4054060	4057740	I think you've always ended with an RPG. Yeah. Metroid's like right before it's usually much
4057740	4061100	as right for it. It is again this year. It's like they don't match rated because it's the
4061100	4066620	big moneymaker to be fair though. Super Mario RPG is another square. Super Nintendo is true.
4066620	4072220	So it does kind of fit. That's the thing. It just came out recently. Yeah. So Nintendo,
4072220	4075340	they set this a while ago though. They set the schedule a long time ago, which I think is kind
4075340	4078780	of funny. I think it's just a coincidence. I don't think it's because of that, but yeah.
4078780	4084540	Hey, you never know. Nintendo may be looking at it going bump that up or something. Yeah.
4084540	4088860	I don't see anything really great on there, but the one game that stuck out to me,
4088860	4095020	I think it's during their silly block is a bubble ghost because that's a game boy game that I had
4095020	4099980	for game boy. It's so cute. I see. I didn't see that. Yeah. What I kind of like about the marathon
4099980	4105420	is I discover games that I either never heard of or barely heard of or just wouldn't even think
4105420	4109180	about watching. And I see them and they're really funny. Like, you know, I actually discovered,
4109180	4115740	uh, roundabout on there and I thought that was so good. And I first saw it on, uh, games on quick.
4115740	4119740	And then I went and I bought it. I was like, let me look at this game. And it happened to be on
4119740	4123500	sale when I looked it up. It's like, I'm going to buy that. So I bought that right away. And, uh,
4123500	4127100	gosh, what was that Western game they did? Yeah. I was just thinking about that. I don't know what
4127180	4132460	really bad, but hilarious, like old, old PC Western game, the teaser classic game of the week.
4132460	4137340	I saw that one as well on there. And so we'll see more of that later. But, um, yeah, there's,
4137340	4141420	I, that's, that's why the scene, the schedule doesn't really bother me. You see the ones that
4141420	4144780	are there that are always there. The mega man games is of course the Metroid race and all
4144780	4151580	that stuff. The Mario block is always, I love the Mario 64, like the, the minimum stars run,
4151580	4155100	whatever that is. I love that every time I watch, I love watching them run backwards.
4155100	4159100	So I'm, I'm a big portal runs. Yeah. The portal runs are good. I don't think those are on this
4159100	4163660	year. I saw, I saw with a tear in my eye, the spooky games block. It's not much of a block.
4163660	4166300	It looks like, I don't know if there's a scheduling issue, but it looks like they broke
4166300	4169660	up the games cause they're doing the amnesia on one night and the next night they're doing like
4169660	4173260	silent Hill three and like resident evil. Maybe they just don't think amnesia is scary.
4174460	4178940	Spooky games like near Halloween or anything like that. No, no, no. They just have a spooky block
4178940	4183500	during the summer. Cause of the, yes. You know, uh, they just, they usually, you know, confine
4183500	4188620	it to sometime after midnight and they throw those in there. The block that amnesia is in,
4188620	4193260	it has like Wolfenstein and Dishonored too. So maybe it's some sort of like first person.
4193260	4197340	I think that's part of a first person block. Yeah. But it may, and maybe the guy that runs it,
4197340	4200700	it looks like the person that runs silent Hill three is the exact same person. Yeah. Running
4200700	4205980	resident evil two. So the spooky games block, so to speak, it's just silent Hill three resident
4205980	4210220	evil two and little big planet and little big planet. That could be spooky. Yes. Um,
4210220	4214620	I do want to point this out. It's kind of related is that humble bundle tends to do a themed
4214620	4219180	bundle for the, um, summer games, no quick and awesome ways to quick. They just released the
4219180	4223980	summer games bundle. Um, but what's interesting about it is that the minimum is 15. There is no
4223980	4228460	games that you just get for like a dollar. So you have to pay at least 15 or more there. It's, it's,
4228460	4234300	I think it's some you kind of seen before, like super meat boy and VVVVV, which I mean are great
4234300	4239260	games, but they're kind of in every pack, but there's also, I have like most of these, uh,
4239260	4244300	there's serious Sam, double DX XL and serious Sam, the random encounter. There's freedom planet,
4244300	4249420	escape goat to Guacamelee and dust forest DX. So the other games that I'm pretty sure I have
4249420	4255340	almost all of these with the exception of maybe escape go to with the rest. I know I have,
4255340	4258380	yeah, I don't. Are these all games that are actually featured this year? They're not
4258380	4262140	featured this year. I don't see them are maybe meat boy is that's, that one's a pretty mean,
4262140	4266460	that's a mainstay. I think it might not be VVVV maybe. I don't think that one is on this year.
4266460	4270220	I didn't see that one, but I thought I saw meat boy. Now that I'm more awakened, looking at this
4270220	4279020	list, there looks to be a, like a Disney Capcom, any S block that block looks like DuckTales.
4280380	4285100	Disney's little mermaid, Mickey mouse, capade. They almost always do a Disney block. Ship
4285100	4288860	and Dale rescue Rangers too. Oh yeah. Rescue Rangers too. That's the way. Yeah. Like I want
4288860	4294060	to watch that. All right. I can't because I'll be, I've had it on all day. Like it started at
4294060	4297340	10 AM. It's been on that. It's probably still play. Well, you know, it's probably not playing
4297340	4302460	now because Catherine just started and my wife hates that case. I hate that game. So
4302460	4307260	you hate it cause it has sheep when she was pregnant with our son, I believe I was playing
4307260	4311820	it like crazy and she just was, you know, anything she relates to all that sickness for me and
4311820	4316380	pregnancy. She's just like, I don't like it. Except Taco Bell. Well yeah, she still is Taco Bell.
4316380	4319900	Isn't it like a puzzle game or something? It is pretty much a puzzle game. Yeah. But there's also
4319900	4326460	like a whole, like a dating SIM almost thing in the middle of it or not really a SIM, but there's
4326460	4329740	like, when you go to the bar, there's like all these social things you have to do. And that
4329740	4335020	unlocks kind of how the story unfolds. Beating the puzzles is one thing, but yeah, I played on
4335020	4338460	easy mode cause I, I'm not good at those puzzles, but I beat the game and it was really fun. I
4338460	4343740	thought, but yeah, it was, it was weird. He had really good anime cut scenes and what's
4343740	4347180	interesting about that run, which I have to watch it later because I do actually want to watch it
4347180	4352380	because the guy who's running it is playing co-op mode, but he's playing it himself with two
4352380	4356780	controllers. So it's one player with two controllers. That's awesome. I'm like, that sounds
4356780	4361660	amazing. So I wish I got one of his controllers is a fight stick. Okay. So that makes it easier then.
4362380	4365660	Wow. I didn't see that. See, I haven't seen it. So Shane's watching it right now. One controller is
4365660	4372380	a dance pad. That'd be cool. That'd be awesome. All right. Let's, let's move on with some other
4372380	4376620	news. I'm sure a lot of people are multitasking with the summer games done quick, but they do,
4376620	4378860	they put everything on YouTube anyway. So if you miss something.
4379660	4382060	Yeah. They're really good archiving. If you, if you don't watch it on YouTube,
4382060	4385420	sometimes you take a little longer. Are you that one? You're not getting picked up. Oh,
4385420	4388220	sorry. You might not be like, no, just, just right then.
4388780	4394780	Okay. Anyway. Yeah. They, uh, if you go on, uh, usually the Reddit thread that references
4394780	4401180	summer games on quick, they'll usually have links to the, what I want to say, like the time code,
4401820	4407580	the splits or whatever in their Twitch stream. That's faster way to see the archives. If you
4407580	4412780	don't want to wait for YouTube and if you're new to it, I highly suggest watching any of the relays
4412780	4417420	because the relays are always fun. There's, they did a donkey Kong country, tropical freeze one
4417420	4423580	today, Canada versus USA. And there's a super Mario maker blind custom team relay race,
4423580	4427740	which they did that in, uh, awesome games. And that was really fun to watch.
4427740	4431020	And so they'll be doing it again. And also don't forget it is for charity.
4431020	4435420	So donate to the French doctors without borders. I don't know what that is.
4435420	4440860	It's doctors borders, but they're, they're like, uh, things in French. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know
4440860	4446220	that many sounds on frontiers or whatever. I don't speak French, obviously. Wow. You sound
4446220	4450620	like me trying to do Japanese release dates. That's great. All right. Uh, let's get to some
4450620	4454300	other news though, for a time. Cause we, uh, are running a little long, but that's all right. Uh,
4454300	4461820	Loki. So there's a key reseller, um, G2A, which most people don't like because they're also known
4461820	4467420	for people that, you know, they hack people's accounts and steal codes or, you know,
4467420	4473260	fraudulently obtain keys and resell them on their market. Um, but now, Hey, they're trying to get
4473260	4481340	on the good side of developers by offering up to a 10% royalty and for keys sold on their platform.
4481340	4486860	However, it is up to the developers to set that royalty, which will be applied on top of the
4486860	4492620	prices set by third party sellers. And in order for the developers to take advantage of that,
4492620	4499980	they need to partner with the site. So they will need to register their products with G2A
4499980	4508460	and acknowledge owned intellectual property in games. Hmm. Um, yeah. In fact, I mean,
4508460	4512700	there's been some developers that have come out and said basically, Hey, we'd rather you
4512700	4517500	pirate our game than the purchase from this website. They're not very liked.
4517500	4523180	No, they're not. Well, I mean, yeah, there's, there's, you know, allegedly stolen credit cards.
4523180	4528140	I don't think it's alleged be like they have had instances where people have purchased stuff off
4528140	4535340	of that site and it's been with a stolen account and the keys get revoked. So you just gotta be
4535340	4542140	aware or, you know, wary of where you purchase things. Yeah. I don't know if that's a site that
4542140	4545740	can really redeem itself. And were there ones that were also like reselling the humble bundle
4545740	4549900	keys and stuff like that? Was that them? The dollar keys? I want to say it was them. I don't
4549900	4556540	know. That's shady too, though. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange
4556540	4563500	Andradeo at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SOFA. All right. Well, uh, let's move on to
4563580	4567820	something. Uh, I know I'm really looking forward to it because I love this series of games. Um,
4568380	4573180	and that's Diablo. And apparently, uh, there's rumblings that there is something new coming
4573180	4578060	out in the Diablo universe, which in a way is kind of a duh because, you know,
4578060	4582460	Blizzard just released Overwatch and they're, they've got Heroes of the Storm going and
4582460	4585660	Hearthstone, which, you know, they're still supporting those games. World of Warcraft
4585660	4590140	has an expansion that's just about to come out. So what's left? Starcraft and Diablo. Well,
4590140	4596380	Starcraft 2 just kind of, they just finished that trilogy, right? That, that last game, uh,
4596380	4600860	what the hell is it? There was the Heart of the Void Swarm. Wings of Liberty or something.
4600860	4606060	Whatever the last one. Starcraft something of something. That just came out not that long ago.
4606060	4610220	And so Diablo is kind of the game that hasn't seen a little love in a couple of years. Um,
4610220	4615580	because, well, they had the expansion for Diablo 3 or the game that fixed Diablo 3,
4616540	4621900	Reaper of Souls, but then that's kind of it. And if you've played the game and you beat,
4621900	4626940	uh, Reaper of Souls, you kind of know that the game is wide open for another expansion.
4626940	4631740	And so it seems very likely that this is going to happen, but, uh, apparently a Blizzard's
4631740	4638860	career page now has a job posting relating to the future of Diablo. It's a game director to lead the
4638860	4645020	quote, unannounced project for Diablo. It's just talking about leading the Diablo series into the
4645020	4650140	future. So it is showing up, uh, on their jobs page. They're definitely still recruiting for
4650140	4654700	Diablo's future. I think this is much more than just patches because they're still, I mean,
4654700	4659580	they're doing seasons in Diablo, they're doing patches, but you know, it's that, that, that's
4659580	4665580	starting to run out of steam. Like I love Diablo. I played this season long enough to get the banner
4665580	4671260	and the rewards. And then I stopped, like I haven't been hitting it as hard as I did some of
4671260	4676940	the previous seasons. So, um, I'm assuming it'll be another expansion and not a Diablo 4. Diablo
4676940	4682540	4 is going to take a lot of time, but, uh, we'll see. What if it's some sort of like competition
4682540	4686780	game since that's what all their games are now at this point? Well, I'd be, I don't see how Diablo
4686780	4691660	really works in that universe. They, they technically, there is a PVP mode in Diablo.
4691660	4695980	It's just, they kind of just threw it away. I mean, there's, you can't really do a lot with
4695980	4702460	it to be honest. Did they actually put anything you got put in it? You, you can enter, uh, with
4702460	4706460	a friend of yours and there's an MPC that you can talk to and you can go to a Coliseum where you can
4706460	4710620	like kick each other's butt, but that's it. Like there's no matchmaking. There's originally,
4710620	4714460	they said there was going to be an arena in Diablo. That's never happened. None of that's there.
4714460	4718540	There's just, you can go and you can BBB, but I think a good thing to put in the next expansion,
4718540	4723420	if that's what they're working on that, that might be it. Who knows? So, uh, we'll see.
4724140	4729420	I would assume though that there's going to be, you know, uh, a new act, a new class,
4729420	4734300	you know, uh, 10 more levels, all that stuff too. But yeah, we'll see. Shane, what do you have for
4734300	4740460	us? I have Pokemon. So, um, for the past few weeks, the Pokemon company has been teasing
4740460	4747820	that we were going to get some new news on July 1st, but some crazy thing happened. And, uh,
4748460	4756460	the morning, early, early morning of June 30th on YouTube, there were leaks for random Pokemon.
4756460	4760140	Couldn't tell if they were real or not, but they came from a Russian something or other,
4760140	4765580	cause it looked like, like a Russian ESRB sort of, uh, splash screen at the beginning,
4765580	4771500	but they were real. And so we got seven new Pokemon. We got a fish that looks like a drag
4771500	4779500	queen named Bruxish. We got an adorable, uh, bee fly named Cutiefly. We have an old grandpa dragon
4779500	4789340	named Drampa. We have the Pikachu clone for the new, uh, region, uh, Togedemaru. We have Grubbin's
4789340	4794620	evolution, uh, charge a bug, which looks like to me a bus. And I think it's adorable, but it's
4794620	4800140	apparently a battery, whatever. Uh, and that evolves into a Vic Viper looking thing from
4800140	4808300	Gradius called Vikavolt. Um, and then we also finally got the English names. Oh yeah,
4808300	4814220	the English names for the koala Pokemon called Komala and the puppy Pokemon called Rockruff.
4814220	4820300	And then finally we got a, um, what we kind of guess might be a legendary, um, for one of the
4820300	4828220	islands that you start on. Um, his name is, uh, Tapu Koko. It's awesome. I mean, the Vikavolt
4828220	4833500	thing seriously looks like Vic Viper from Gradius. It's really cool. Rockruff is a really cute name.
4833500	4840300	It's adorable. It's my, like, we didn't have any footage in what they gave us on, on the first,
4840300	4847980	but at the Hong Kong nationals, uh, they showed the first in-game footage of Komala and Rockruff,
4847980	4855820	and I will have all the plush toys of Rockruff possible. Now you, you said that there was like
4855820	4859820	a Pikachu clone in this game. What was the name of the Pikachu clone? Togedemaru. But it's not,
4859820	4864380	it's not Pikachu. No, every, um... It looks more like a Marill to me than a Pikachu. Every
4864380	4872300	generation has an electric Pokemon, like, in the same vein as Pikachu. So, and we had Pikachu in
4872300	4876780	the first generation. We had its pre-evolution in the second, Pichu. Then we had Plusle in
4876780	4883100	mine and in the third. We had Prachirisu in the fourth, Emolga in fifth, and then Dedenne in the
4883100	4889100	sixth, and now the Steel Electric. I think it's actually a Hedgehog. It has little spikes,
4889660	4894860	and it's a Steel Electric. It's super cute. I would like a plush toy of that as well.
4894860	4899100	Actually, there are a lot of these I want plush toys of. Not the Drag Queen Fish, though.
4899100	4904620	I'm okay with it, but it's kind of frightening, and, uh, I don't know.
4905820	4908380	Fifth Dream in chat at live.bogonetwork.com says,
4908460	4913340	Beautyfly and Cutiefly should get married. Do you ship Pokemon?
4913340	4916860	No. I was just curious. Well, ditto in everything when I'm making eggs.
4920780	4923980	When you made 5,000 oshawott in your quest to get a shiny one.
4923980	4930460	Yes, five years of hatching oshawott. So many people got winter coats because of that.
4930460	4933500	All right, we're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games
4933500	4936620	that you can play a lot sooner than Shane can play Pokemon Sun and Moon.
4938060	4939340	Why would you have to rub that in?
4940220	4942460	Because it makes me feel better because you're mean.
4942460	4944220	All right, Loki, what's coming out of the US this week?
4944780	4949180	We have Fury, which is coming out on PC and PlayStation 4. It's also part of
4949820	4955500	the PlayStation Network, you know, the free games that you get for PlayStation Plus.
4955500	4957740	So that'll be coming out this week.
4958460	4962060	Mega Dimension Neptunia 7. That's on PC.
4962620	4966860	Romance of the Three Kingdoms 13 on PC and PlayStation 4.
4967420	4970220	The Banner Saga 2 is coming to PlayStation 4.
4970940	4972700	Inside on PC.
4973660	4977980	Carmageddon max damage on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4977980	4979980	And Hawken on PlayStation 4.
4979980	4981340	Carmageddon's coming back?
4981340	4982780	Yeah, they got a new Carmageddon.
4982780	4983260	All right.
4983260	4987340	And it's very offensive to people because they've got, you know,
4988700	4990940	people in wheelchairs and stuff that you're destroying.
4992620	4993120	Wow.
4994220	4995020	All right.
4995020	4999180	Traveling over to Japan and checking out what's coming out on the PlayStation 4 over there.
4999180	5004140	This week on July 7th, you can get price reductions on Tales of Zestiria
5004140	5006540	and Sengoku Basara for Sumogari.
5006540	5012380	There is a new game called Shin Hairagami 2 comes out this week in Japan.
5013100	5018300	It looks like it might be like a mystery anime type of thing that is based on.
5018300	5020780	So that's what you have to look forward to on the PlayStation 4.
5021020	5023740	Uh, I don't believe the Wii U has anything this week.
5023740	5030460	Oh no, they are getting a, um, like a Splatoon bundle with the system in Japan.
5030460	5033820	It's like, I guess that's Splatoon, but it has the new Amiibo with it.
5033820	5034380	So that is...
5034380	5036060	I forgot that's coming out pretty soon.
5036060	5037180	Those Amiibo, aren't they?
5037740	5039180	In Japan, we're out this week.
5039180	5039900	One week?
5039900	5040400	Yes.
5040860	5042460	So that makes sense that we would be getting...
5042460	5043900	Squid Sisters and Recolors.
5043900	5044700	Very soon as well.
5045660	5050540	That Shin Hairagami 2 comes out on the PlayStation Vita as well.
5050620	5053100	And then lastly on the 3DS this week.
5053100	5056460	Ooh, Cold Sept Revolt comes out on the 3DS.
5056460	5057020	I...
5057020	5060620	This is one of those games that I really wish had done better in the US.
5060620	5063420	It's like a trading card game meets Monopoly.
5063420	5064700	I think these games are rad.
5065660	5068700	They're like, they're really hard to master and I'm really terrible at them,
5068700	5069660	but they're fun to play.
5070700	5072860	But I don't think the series did very well here.
5072860	5074140	So I highly doubt this game.
5074140	5078700	I'd have to import this game if I want to play it and play it on Shane's Japanese 3DS.
5078700	5082140	But since I can't read Japanese, I'm not going to do me a lick of good.
5082140	5082860	But if you're a Cold Sept...
5082860	5086700	And that's a Pokemon 3DS that only plays Pokemon, really.
5086700	5088780	So nothing else can go in there.
5090220	5093180	When he's not looking, I'll grab it and put Cold Sept in there.
5093180	5095980	It's also blue, so you have to pry it from my dead hand.
5095980	5099500	I tainted your 3DS with another game series.
5100380	5101500	All right, how about the UK?
5101500	5105740	I believe Flaco Jones is filling in for the UK releases this week.
5105740	5107180	Yeah, I got it right here.
5107180	5110300	The first game is a PC game I've never heard of called Bum Rush.
5111260	5112620	So that sounds weird.
5112620	5115500	Like maybe it's a sequel to that Raptor butt.
5115500	5119500	What I was going to say is the American version called Butt Rush because they call them bums.
5120700	5125180	Anyway, that's on July 6th and July 7th.
5126060	5128060	PC game Inside.
5128060	5130540	That's the Xbox game that we have over here, right?
5130540	5131740	Is it also on PC over here?
5133180	5134780	Everything is on Xbox and PC now, right?
5134780	5135900	Yeah, it was on PC over.
5136220	5140700	Yeah, anyway, I heard about that from Extifer actually, and he said it's really awesome.
5140700	5141820	I think he only played the beginning.
5142460	5144940	And then Lion's Song on PC, also July 7th.
5147020	5148860	All right, that's it for Europe.
5148860	5150380	That's it, that's all I got.
5150380	5151820	There's just a couple more stories for you guys,
5151820	5154540	then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
5154540	5155500	But first, Loki.
5156220	5161180	All right, so we got some cool news regarding upcoming movies.
5161180	5164300	I'm pretty excited about the sequel, The Wreck-It Ralph,
5164380	5166620	which will be coming out in 2018.
5167500	5171420	And yeah, they haven't really said...
5171420	5174220	Oh, March 9th, 2018 is when that'll be coming out.
5176140	5177260	Nice to have that confirmed,
5177260	5180300	even though I think some of the voice actors had already spilled that they were working on it.
5180300	5181180	Right, yeah.
5181180	5185500	And then the live-action Minecraft movie has a release date now as well.
5186220	5191340	And that's coming out May 24th, 2019.
5192300	5195820	I still can't believe that's being directed by the guy from It's Always Sunny.
5196700	5197340	Yeah, yeah.
5197340	5199900	I don't know, like, I don't know that it sounds awesome.
5199900	5201020	It's Mac, it's Mac, yeah.
5201020	5203340	Yeah, it sounds incredibly awesome.
5203340	5203740	I just...
5204940	5205900	I'm curious to see what's going on.
5205900	5211180	I mean, Marvel gets a lot of guys that aren't necessarily super experienced at the big budget
5211180	5211580	movies.
5211580	5212700	I think it'll be great.
5212700	5215500	So Marvel gets to get a bunch of guys from TV to do their movies.
5215500	5217980	I just can't imagine a live-action Minecraft.
5217980	5218940	I have no idea.
5218940	5220300	But hey, you mean the live-out?
5220300	5222380	I think it's supposed to be CG.
5222380	5224540	Like, I thought it was supposed to be like a CG movie.
5224540	5225900	It probably has a lot of CG.
5225900	5229660	If they pulled off that Minecraft story mode, like, it's gonna be like that.
5229660	5232540	Minecraft story mode was, like, done with, like, in-game graphics.
5232540	5235580	Like, I can't imagine a live-action movie, like, with people.
5235580	5236700	I don't see that.
5236700	5240380	Like, it has to be, like, an animated movie.
5240380	5242620	Or, like, some kind of combination or something like that.
5243660	5246300	Speaking of which, I really want to see the Lego Batman movie when that comes out.
5246300	5247820	Yeah, that trailer was hilarious.
5247820	5248320	I love it.
5248960	5250880	All right, um...
5250880	5252400	Going back to Wreck-It Ralph 2 really quick.
5252400	5253200	Yeah, go for it.
5253200	5254640	Does anybody else, like, think it's kind of...
5254640	5256800	I mean, I haven't read any of the details on it.
5256800	5260480	But the image is him, like, over all these, like, internet parody sites.
5260480	5262560	Like, they have Google, but spelled with a U.
5262560	5264000	So is he just invading the internet?
5264000	5264500	Like, Google?
5264500	5265520	Is it not gonna be so...
5265520	5268320	Well, yeah, but it has, like, a thing over it.
5268320	5269200	I don't know.
5269200	5272320	Anyway, so, yeah, I was like, so is he just gonna be going...
5272320	5273520	Is it not really gonna be about gaming?
5273520	5275280	Is it just gonna be about him invading the internet?
5275280	5277280	Or is it gonna be on a gaming app?
5277280	5277920	Like, I don't know.
5278320	5279520	It's all browser games.
5279520	5282960	I just hope it doesn't get too far away from the video game thing.
5282960	5284800	I know the first movie kind of did that, but...
5284800	5288720	It could be more contemporary games, as opposed to, like, throwback references.
5288720	5289440	But, yeah.
5289440	5290480	Shiny, yay.
5291360	5292800	Well, they still were pretty contemporary.
5292800	5297600	I mean, they have, like, a Call of Duty-type parody and Mario Kart and that type of stuff.
5297600	5297840	True.
5297840	5298320	Yeah.
5298320	5300720	By the way, I'm surprised he didn't make me play the breaking news bumper.
5301440	5303600	No, because I was like, I have to say it now.
5303600	5305280	I didn't have time for a breaking news...
5305280	5307280	It's an Ivysaur, so it's cool.
5308000	5309680	Anyway, that was the only thing that kind of concerned me.
5309680	5311280	I was like, oh, I do want to see more Wreck-It Ralph,
5311280	5316240	but I hope it's not just, I don't know, him just invading different websites or whatever.
5316240	5319280	Did they announce who's, like, signed on for it so far?
5319280	5320880	I think it's the original cast that's coming back.
5320880	5322160	Like, all of them?
5322160	5324080	I guess there'd be, like, four real ones.
5324080	5328880	It's not a huge cast, but I'm pretty sure all the main, all the principles...
5328880	5331120	Yeah, Sarah Silverman doesn't have a TV show anymore.
5331120	5331920	She's, what's she doing?
5331920	5334400	Well, on the poster, it's him and Sarah Silverman's character, right?
5334400	5336160	So, I'm sure they got the two mains back.
5336160	5338080	And I'm sure they'll also get Jack McBrayer.
5338080	5340000	Yeah, what, 30 Rock's been cancelled for years?
5340000	5340640	What's he doing?
5341280	5342480	He just does Conan bits now.
5343120	5344240	Does he really? That's it?
5344240	5347120	He makes cameos as that same guy, like, for the rest of his life.
5347120	5348640	That's because he is that guy.
5351360	5354880	Jane Lynch, what she did, does she still host the Hollywood Game Night thing,
5354880	5356000	or did that cancel?
5356000	5358400	I stopped watching it, but I was watching it.
5358400	5359520	But I think that's still going.
5359520	5361840	I think they just drop it in whenever they got room on the NBC schedule,
5361840	5362640	because it's cheap to produce.
5362640	5365840	You'd think I'd be more excited about game shows making this huge comeback on TV,
5365840	5366560	and I guess I am.
5366560	5369680	But, you know, Sunday night is now when they've got Family Feud,
5369680	5372080	$100,000 pyramid match game are all on Sunday night.
5372080	5374400	And everything I'm hearing about match game is that it's really good.
5374400	5375360	I know I need to watch it.
5375360	5377840	I didn't watch it last week because all games are and stuff, but yeah.
5377840	5379040	Yeah, so anyway.
5380720	5384480	Well, maybe one reason I don't watch as much TV is because I'm watching live streaming.
5384480	5386880	And, you know, a lot of that is probably coming from Twitch.
5388000	5390640	But if you have ever streamed from your PlayStation 4,
5390640	5392960	you know that you have several options when it comes to live streaming.
5392960	5394000	You can stream.
5394000	5397440	You can do YouTube live as well now, right, on PlayStation 4.
5397440	5398080	Yes, you can.
5398080	5401600	Is Daily Motion live or is that just an export video thing?
5401600	5402160	I don't know.
5402160	5404000	But I don't think they have a live component.
5404000	5408320	Ustream is the other one that you can stream to, but not for much longer.
5408960	5412800	Sony is going to be revoking support for the Ustream service,
5412800	5415600	and that's going to end on August 1st, 2016.
5416240	5419840	So this means that you will no longer even be able to view the Ustream stuff
5419840	5422720	from live from PlayStation or the Vita or anything.
5422720	5424080	Does anyone still use Ustream?
5424080	5425440	I think that's probably why.
5425440	5427840	Well, yeah, there's no reason for the termination.
5428400	5430960	Maybe there's some contract agreement or something like that.
5430960	5434000	I wonder if it has to do with the fact that Ustream is the only network
5434000	5436320	that will accept the Playroom anymore.
5436320	5437280	And that's where...
5438000	5439840	Remember when PlayStation 4 streaming first started?
5439840	5442320	Playroom was hilarious when it first started.
5442320	5446400	That was where you would see the nastiest shit was on those Playroom streams.
5446400	5447040	Funniest.
5447040	5449840	And they're still kind of like trash if you go in there and look.
5449840	5452080	Come on, they're doing strange shit now on Twitch, too.
5452160	5454560	I read something where they're like watching people eat.
5455120	5458880	Yeah, that's funny.
5458880	5462640	What I learned from watching Playroom on there, other than the obvious stuff,
5462640	5467520	was that everybody that does that on there has a long couch.
5467520	5472000	One of those ones that does the corner couches that takes up the entire living room,
5472000	5474160	and they always have a big dog wing on it.
5474160	5478720	Every time, there's always a big long corner couch and a big old dog sitting on the end,
5478720	5480000	and there's whatever going on.
5480000	5481440	They're smoking and doing whatever.
5481440	5483760	I'll never forget the night I got the PlayStation 4,
5483760	5486080	and I think Shane was living here or something at the time,
5486080	5488320	and was like watching, we were just watching some of the streams,
5488320	5490880	and like some chick just took her top off, right?
5490880	5493040	And like, this is awesome.
5493040	5494320	Shane was just horrified.
5494320	5497680	And I was laughing so hard that I was like crying because I'm like,
5497680	5500640	oh my God, these people are drunk and they're going to regret this.
5500640	5502160	Yeah, people are always drunk, too.
5503280	5504000	I remember.
5504960	5505680	All right.
5505680	5507040	So yeah, no more you stream.
5507040	5509280	So sadly, this means the end of the play.
5509280	5516960	I feel like there ought to be like one more like great Ustream dumpster fire stream day.
5516960	5518160	Looks like that's on you, Rob.
5518160	5519520	On the last day of July.
5520240	5520800	Fire it up.
5520800	5527760	They should just offer streaming for the game or playroom to Chatterbait instead now.
5528960	5531600	You know, you think Pornhub ought to get on this, right?
5531600	5534080	I'm sure Sony wants that partnership.
5534080	5534960	I mean, I know.
5534960	5536720	I'm assuming.
5536720	5538400	What doesn't Pornhub have?
5538400	5540080	They do have a lot of affiliate sites.
5540080	5540960	They probably own them.
5540960	5544560	I mean, I think the most hilarious thing I saw was that screenshot from
5546240	5551280	Pornhub that said something like hot British blonde fucks 15 million people all at once.
5551280	5553040	And it's that guy talking about the Brexit.
5555120	5555840	That was funny.
5556480	5558960	Anyway, let's let's you know what?
5558960	5560160	Let's go to a simpler time.
5560160	5564640	Let's take a step back into a time when we didn't we didn't have streaming pornography.
5564640	5568000	If you wanted to if you wanted pornography, you had to wait for like
5568720	5574480	the lingerie catalogs to get delivered in the mail or a dirty magazine because there
5574480	5575920	was no such thing as streaming pornography.
5575920	5580000	It's a simple time where we take a step back and look at a classic video game.
5580000	5584240	And usually Dark Sakura will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks
5584240	5585600	is worthy of your attention.
5585600	5587360	However, she's not here this week.
5587360	5591040	So we have an OLR first, I believe.
5591040	5593440	I don't think this has ever been done before.
5593440	5600000	We have a joint choice for Classic Game of the Week between Flaco, Jones and Shane have
5600000	5600720	both yet.
5600720	5605360	And I'll have you know that I did petition for a certain game, but was unfortunately
5605360	5608880	denied despite the fact that we had a perfect scenario here.
5608880	5610000	So blame it on all them.
5611200	5611760	Tough.
5611760	5614080	What is the classic game of the week?
5614080	5615040	Flaco and Shane.
5615600	5616960	We didn't even rehearse how we're going to do.
5616960	5618400	No, we really didn't talk.
5618960	5620080	So you go, Shane.
5620080	5621440	I talked last on UK.
5621440	5623200	So, OK, I'll say the name of the title.
5623760	5626480	Totally rad for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5626480	5634560	Oh, there's the music from 1990 Japan and in Europe in 1991 in North America.
5634560	5635280	Yeah.
5635280	5640160	I like how the release date, at least on the wiki, says that Europe just got it in 1990.
5640160	5641440	It's not more specific.
5641440	5642240	Yeah, that's funny.
5643360	5646320	Sometime in 1990, they got it.
5646320	5647520	This nebulous year.
5649040	5649520	All right.
5649520	5650960	So what are we talking about?
5650960	5651440	I don't know.
5652160	5655280	I first found out about this game on Games Done Quick.
5655280	5657360	And I think it was Awful Games Done Quick.
5657360	5659520	Did I say that we should watch it?
5660400	5662160	Because this is a game from my.
5662160	5663760	We always watch the Awful Games Done Quick.
5663760	5665200	And you had actually said you played this game.
5665200	5665600	Yeah, yeah.
5665600	5667200	This is a game from my childhood.
5667200	5669760	I played the heck out of this game when I was younger.
5669760	5671680	And I remember it being really fun.
5671680	5673520	But my memory was clearly tainted.
5674080	5676560	Or I was just remembering the dialogue.
5676560	5680560	Because when we watched it on Awful Games Done Quick, it was pretty awful.
5680640	5682000	It's a terrible game.
5682000	5686240	But the cutscenes alone, I think Rob's watching them right now, are so hilarious.
5686240	5687680	It's what makes it a classic game.
5687680	5691200	So we don't have to respect the guys giving the week this week.
5691200	5692880	You can all rip on it and say how terrible it is.
5692880	5694160	Yeah, it's not a good game.
5694160	5698800	We are literally picking this because it is a funny, funny, funny dialogue.
5698800	5702000	Dark Soccer does not always pick games that she thinks are good.
5702000	5702480	That's true.
5702480	5703840	She just thinks they're noteworthy.
5703840	5704000	Yes.
5704000	5706400	So you can go for this game.
5706400	5708080	Maybe you guys should read some dialogue.
5708080	5709760	Well, no, we'll do that.
5709760	5711360	Yeah, let's talk about what it is.
5711360	5712960	Talk about what it is and you can describe it.
5712960	5716640	So it's just a somewhat typical side scroller.
5716640	5719760	You play as Jake in the American version.
5720800	5728560	And basically, you know this crazy magician guy who's training you to use magic.
5728560	5730400	And all of a sudden, your girlfriend gets kidnapped.
5730400	5731600	And other people get kidnapped.
5731600	5733200	And you're on a quest to save them all.
5734560	5736640	In Japan, it was called Magic John.
5736640	5741840	I don't know why we didn't keep that name.
5741840	5742880	It's pretty good.
5742880	5747680	I'm going to assume it has to do with the basketball player Magic Johnson, who they
5747680	5748960	didn't want confusion.
5748960	5749680	I don't know.
5749680	5751440	I just thought it's not a magic toilet.
5751440	5752800	I guess that would make sense why they would change it.
5752800	5753600	Just a lucky guess.
5753600	5756080	And he is learning magic in the game, in the plot of the game.
5756080	5756400	Yeah.
5756400	5759040	From Zebediah, who has a P on his hat.
5759040	5759200	Yeah.
5759200	5760400	Which stands for Zebediah.
5760400	5760720	Yeah.
5760720	5762720	To Zebediah, the P-acyllic.
5763520	5767680	And it's not a very good game.
5768560	5771360	You get different power-ups, so you can become like an eagle thing.
5771360	5772880	You can become like a lion thing.
5774880	5775920	It's not good.
5775920	5776160	Yeah.
5776160	5779520	It's like a bad kind of Mega Man-ish rip-off.
5780080	5781600	It really does look like shit.
5781600	5783200	Like, it gets worse.
5783200	5784960	Because you're just looking at the first stage.
5784960	5785200	Yeah.
5785200	5787120	It gets way, way worse.
5787120	5789920	But some of the designs are hilarious.
5789920	5794640	There's this punk popcorn boss thing.
5794640	5801120	It's a stick of corn that's in a late 80s, early 90s biker gang.
5801120	5803920	It's got a mohawk and piercings.
5803920	5806880	But it is a big ear of corn.
5806880	5810320	And this guy right now that's on the video, he's throwing pizzas at you.
5810320	5811360	I don't know what they are.
5811360	5812800	Maybe they're supposed to be boulders.
5812800	5815200	I'm sure the Japanese game makes a lot more sense.
5815200	5818880	Because they did not translate it word for word.
5818880	5822560	Instead of getting a story, I'm guessing the Japanese had.
5822560	5825360	They kind of stuck with the premise.
5825360	5831520	But all the dialogue is in surfer lingo and late 80s speak.
5831520	5833120	And it is so funny.
5833120	5834320	Sorry to interrupt, but here it is.
5834320	5835680	This is the best line in the game.
5836320	5839040	Jake, they're like, stealing me or something.
5839040	5843360	And that's the female damsel in this dress after she gets kidnapped.
5843360	5846400	She says, Jake, they're like, stealing me or something.
5846400	5847840	There are so many best lines in this game.
5847840	5848800	That's the best line.
5848800	5850480	They're like, stealing me or something.
5850480	5851040	Wait, wait, wait.
5851040	5851600	I'm going to count it.
5851600	5852640	Because there's a game.
5852640	5854400	Jake was attacked by surprise.
5854960	5856880	Which is like, oh, surprise is attacking me.
5858400	5862960	There is a fact on Game Facts that just has the dialogue.
5862960	5865520	So something that I really like.
5865520	5866720	Let me pull it up here.
5867520	5869280	And the music right now while you're pulling that up.
5869280	5870320	I love this music the most.
5870320	5871520	Can you turn this up just a little?
5871520	5873920	It's like a weird twist on the circus theme.
5878800	5881200	Well, that doesn't sound the same as what I heard yesterday.
5881200	5884320	Anyway, it was more like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
5884320	5885360	Good job, Flago.
5885360	5885680	I know.
5885680	5886320	I blew that one.
5886320	5888560	But I swear it was different when I listened to it the other day.
5888560	5893360	So this is the dialogue in Act 2-3 according to the fact I'm reading.
5893360	5894320	And I remember this dialogue.
5894320	5898000	I just don't know if that's the right way to categorize it.
5898000	5900160	So the characters are Jake and Allison.
5900160	5902080	So it looks like you've already rescued Allison.
5902080	5903440	So here's what she says.
5903440	5906480	Jake, I'm like, really nervous.
5906480	5908240	Because I think that that typo is in the game.
5909760	5912000	Like, my dad tried to save me.
5912000	5913600	And now they've got him too.
5913600	5915280	I don't know what they've done with him.
5915280	5916800	Jake, no way.
5916800	5919680	He's the gnarliest professor on the coast.
5919680	5922880	So it's your dad they really want, Allison.
5922880	5925440	Jake, I kind of want my dad back, you know?
5926000	5928800	Jake, that's totally understandable.
5928800	5930400	Wow, how about if I save him?
5931520	5932960	He's such a take charge hero.
5932960	5934640	I really respect that about him.
5934640	5935360	So good.
5935360	5937200	I mean, I love this game and the cutscene so much.
5937200	5939040	This is like, if you follow me on Twitter,
5939040	5944240	at Flaco Jones, this is my avatar is Jake from Totally Rad.
5944240	5946880	And my name is like Totally Flaco on there.
5946880	5950640	So this is like actually the showgirls of video games, it seems.
5950640	5951280	Probably.
5951280	5951600	Maybe.
5951600	5952160	It's so bad.
5952160	5953680	Because the dialogue's so shitty.
5954800	5956960	Excuse me, we just talked about how great it was.
5957680	5958720	Well, you don't know shit.
5959680	5961040	Also, one thing to mention.
5961680	5963920	Weirdly enough, when they brought it over also,
5964320	5967440	um, the character models in the,
5967440	5970240	I guess what you would call cutscenes, look different.
5970240	5975040	So in the Japanese one, they're very like Japanese animation style.
5975040	5977680	But in the American one, I'm guessing in the European one,
5977680	5981360	that's really sometime in 1990, according to legends,
5982720	5984880	they redid them to look older.
5985520	5991120	And it's, I guess, just like typical, like, like Allison looks like,
5991120	5992640	you know, kind of like she talks like a valley girl.
5992800	5994480	She kind of looks like the typical valley girl.
5994480	5996160	I don't know about Jake though, his hair's kind of weird.
5996160	5998000	I don't know what he's supposed to look like.
5998000	6001040	I think it's almost like because it's drawing so much,
6001040	6003360	it's almost like they combined Bill and Ted into one person.
6003360	6006720	Yeah, yeah, I would say that's an accurate representation.
6006720	6008640	Oh, there's the corn cob guy.
6008640	6013120	Yeah, see, he is an ear of corn that is also like in a biker gang.
6013840	6015200	He's got little tight pants on.
6015200	6015680	It's great.
6017680	6018560	And high heels.
6018720	6022800	I think this might, it might be a feminine character, actually.
6022800	6023280	I don't know.
6023840	6025760	No, it's wearing like a vest and nothing else.
6026640	6030000	What? I don't want to, I don't want to sit here and try to decide.
6030640	6031440	Why?
6031440	6033040	Were there any of the great lines you can remember?
6033040	6035760	I know like there was a point where, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6035760	6038800	They, the professor and Allison just show up out of nowhere.
6038800	6039680	And Jake's like, how did you get here?
6039680	6041680	And they're like, oh, we took the Hollywood freeway.
6043200	6044960	Are they in a spaceship or something?
6044960	6045840	They're underground.
6045840	6046560	They're underground.
6049440	6051360	But in the original game, I believe they're in a spaceship.
6051360	6051920	That's the other thing.
6051920	6052480	It's kind of funny.
6052480	6053440	They say they're underground.
6053440	6056160	It's like, there's really like aliens and stuff involved.
6056160	6057600	And it's great.
6057600	6062480	And at the end, when Zebediah leaves you, he says, Jake, you've been most excellent.
6062480	6065120	By now, you know, I'm one of the underground people.
6066880	6068160	I don't know if this is a typo.
6068160	6068800	A doggy.
6068800	6069200	I don't know.
6069840	6070640	That was the bad guy.
6070640	6070960	Yeah.
6070960	6071920	Has been destroyed.
6071920	6076240	So I'm going back, back to my own people, back to my own world.
6076240	6078640	You've been a totally decent apprentice.
6078640	6080560	Maybe we can do lunch sometime.
6080560	6081200	Later, dude.
6082640	6084720	And then Jake's like Zebediah, dude.
6086720	6087120	Oh yeah.
6087120	6089440	And Alison constantly like locks herself in the trunk.
6090080	6095840	Because she's learning magic as like, like almost like a magician's assistant locking
6095840	6096800	herself in a trunk.
6096800	6097120	Yeah.
6097120	6099440	And then he talks about like copacetic.
6099440	6100240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6100240	6101040	He's like talking here.
6101040	6103600	He's like, it's totally tranquil, Alison.
6106800	6108160	I love this game.
6108160	6110000	So yeah, I think that's, I think that's about it.
6110000	6110880	Yeah, that's really it.
6110880	6113360	Everybody should go like, you know, watch a let's play.
6113360	6113600	What?
6113600	6116960	No, they should watch the AGDQ version.
6116960	6120720	Yeah, because they actually, they called it cut scene percentage on AGDQ.
6120720	6124400	So they didn't, even though it was a speed run, they left all the cut scenes intact so
6124400	6125360	you could watch them.
6125360	6126480	They kind of read along with it.
6126480	6127040	Yeah, they do.
6127040	6127360	Yeah.
6127360	6128800	So there's kind of like a laugh track going on.
6128800	6129440	It's fun.
6129440	6130000	It's funny.
6130000	6132720	I would recommend people watch that because the actual gameplay stuff they get through
6132720	6134480	quickly and then the cut scenes, they read them.
6134480	6138480	And you can see how bad the game is because they, they like point out like where like
6138480	6140560	it just drops to like one frame a second.
6140560	6143200	Basically it's, this is a bad game.
6143920	6148320	It's a classic classic game of the week.
6148320	6151040	Totally rad, which is totally bad.
6151600	6153520	And that makes me totally sad.
6153520	6155680	Again, you weren't listening to anything we said.
6156960	6158960	No, it's bad as in good.
6158960	6160640	Cause that's what they said back then.
6161280	6161920	That's right.
6162480	6164320	I can reread that dialogue, Shane.
6164320	6164820	All right.
6165280	6168960	We're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, there is more news to come.
6168960	6172400	And there's also some rapid fire news and some emails as well.
6172400	6177440	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6183920	6190240	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, July the 3rd of 2016 with episode
6190240	6196640	number 648 of our show already in progress, joined in studio tonight by our pals, Flaco
6196640	6198480	Jones and Shane here in studio.
6198480	6202480	Of course, myself and Loki not here tonight, Dark Sakura, you know, something I forgot
6202480	6204640	to talk about during my gaming week that I did play this week.
6204640	6207440	Cause I talked about how I went to round one again this week and I was kind of like, Oh,
6207440	6208160	music games.
6208160	6209120	I'm like 25 again.
6209120	6210160	This is so fun.
6210160	6216880	But one of my pals, um, actually owns at her house, a dance maniacs machine and which was
6216880	6217840	the classic game of the week.
6218080	6221520	Like last week or two weeks ago, last week was, was actually dance maniacs.
6221520	6223600	So I actually got to play that game again last week.
6223600	6226160	And you know, you know what my impression was after I played the game.
6226960	6228320	I want one of those machines.
6228320	6231440	Like, I think that is the Bemadi machine I want to have in my house.
6232000	6234160	And to be honest, those are really cheap too.
6234160	6236080	I can't, you gotta help me find one Loki.
6236080	6239280	Cause I don't even know where I can find one right now, but that's, I just joined the Facebook
6239280	6242320	group that I'm on and they put all sorts of stuff up there.
6242320	6243840	They list all the different Craigslist ads.
6243840	6244560	Maybe I'll do that.
6244560	6245200	Alan's in the kitchen.
6245200	6249120	Alan, can you, can you not wait for me to buy a dance maniacs machine to put in this
6249120	6249680	house somewhere?
6251120	6252400	He just gave a very fake.
6252400	6254320	I still want a DDR machine.
6254320	6256800	I know there is no way the wife's gonna allow that to happen.
6256800	6259040	No, you'll never, you'll never get one of those.
6259040	6260080	You could store it here though.
6260080	6261520	Just put a blanket over it.
6261520	6262880	She'll never know.
6262880	6264720	She will know cause she goes in the garage.
6264720	6268800	But like, um, or at least I've rebuilt my pants.
6268800	6274720	I have stuff like I bought sheet metal like years ago at this point to redo them.
6274800	6277520	And I have like parts for it, but I just never got around to it.
6277520	6279920	I was going to move my arcade cabinet to the garage too.
6279920	6283600	Well, you know, what's also interesting is that she also owns the, um, para para machine
6284160	6288640	that used to be at arcade infinity years ago, years and years ago that they, they own it
6288640	6289200	now.
6289200	6290880	Um, so I thought that was pretty cool.
6290880	6292720	And they, they did something, they switched something in it.
6292720	6294240	So it doesn't run off a hard drive anymore.
6294240	6295680	It runs off a flash card.
6295680	6299440	And so it loads like instantly, like it's like way faster than those machines used to
6299440	6299760	be.
6299760	6302960	So it's kind of interesting how some of the advances in technology actually affect these
6302960	6304560	arcade games from like 15 years ago.
6304560	6306160	It's kind of, kind of awesome.
6306160	6312240	So yeah, now I'm on that kick where I'm like, I could, I could buy an arcade game for the
6312240	6312640	house.
6312640	6313280	I'm worth it.
6313280	6313840	Right.
6313840	6315920	I can get my baby Pac-Man machine someday.
6315920	6318880	Cause I always said I would buy that machine at some point.
6318880	6327440	So we'll see, um, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, um, act deft, uh, saying
6327440	6331280	dark soccer would be sad because rageinator clearly didn't know, uh, the classic game
6331280	6333040	of the week last week.
6333040	6336320	Uh, and uh, yeah, Akuma JP saying, oh, it's 4th of July here.
6336320	6337840	So it's, it's early cause he's over in Japan.
6337840	6339680	So it's early 4th of July there.
6339680	6342720	Uh, probably not the day off like everybody has here tomorrow.
6342720	6344400	It's kind of, I don't have the day off.
6344400	6346000	Well, sucks to be you.
6346000	6347600	Uh, yeah, me too.
6347600	6349280	Uh, I had a four day weekend.
6349280	6349760	That's fine.
6349760	6352160	I'll just get paid basically double time and a half.
6352160	6353760	So whatever, whatever.
6353760	6357680	Um, one other thing I want to bring up, speaking of like money type stuff, uh, steam sales
6357680	6358400	still going on.
6358400	6361680	And during the break, we were briefly talking about it because Loki was like, when's that
6361680	6362160	thing over?
6362160	6366160	And it is over 10 o'clock AM our time on the 4th.
6366160	6367760	So it's pretty much in its last hours.
6367760	6370160	There's probably like 14 hours left in the sale.
6370160	6374560	Uh, I have yet to buy a game in the sale, which is kind of surprising for me, but I
6374560	6379200	feel like everything that's on my wishlist that I'm considering buying is like, it would
6379200	6380560	be nice to have.
6380560	6385760	But then I look at my gaming backlog and I'm like, uh, you got to play that stuff first.
6385760	6389520	You, you literally just got grand theft auto five and fallout four for plays.
6389520	6391520	Like you don't need to buy more fucking steam games right now.
6391520	6392640	Pokemon.
6392640	6392960	Yeah.
6392960	6394880	See, then I have to hear that too.
6394880	6398240	If I end up buying grim Dawn or one of those games that's on my list that I actually want
6398240	6398560	to play.
6399120	6401840	So I, yeah, I keep buying stuff anyways.
6401840	6404880	Like some things like are really cheap and it's just impulse buys.
6404880	6408800	Like, especially when stuff gets down to like $10 on PlayStation four or something like
6408800	6412640	that, it's like, you know, I want to play need for speed or dragon Asian acquisition.
6412640	6416480	I probably won't get around to it right away, but I went ahead and purchased those anyways
6416480	6418480	cause they were cheap.
6418480	6419120	So why not?
6420720	6421440	Well, we'll see.
6421440	6424800	We'll see if I can go 14 more hours without making a purchase or if I finally crack and
6424800	6425760	buy something tonight.
6425760	6431200	Although to be fair, dark Sakura bought me the shower with your dad simulator game because
6431200	6432560	it was not even a dollar.
6433360	6435040	And so that was a part of the steam sale.
6435040	6437840	She bought me for my birthday, but she also bought me, I should mention this, the steam
6437840	6438720	controller.
6438720	6441760	Um, and I just picked that up yesterday, so I haven't been able to play a game with it
6441760	6445200	yet, but I've just been kind of like touching the controller and I kind of like it, but
6445200	6448000	it appears I'm the only one in studio that really likes the controller.
6448000	6448560	Okay.
6448560	6449920	It's, it's neat, I guess.
6449920	6451440	Not if I just would have to try it out.
6451440	6452480	I mean it, I don't know.
6452480	6453040	It's different.
6453040	6453200	Yeah.
6453200	6456240	I don't want to, I don't want to give like a final say until I actually play some games
6456240	6458000	with it, but I like, I like the way it feels.
6458000	6459360	I like the big disc great.
6459360	6460400	I liked all the buttons.
6460400	6461520	It's very clicky.
6461520	6466240	I just, I mean, I'm just not sure about those giant pads and it's nice that it still has
6466240	6470320	the analog stick and the regular buttons on it too, but they're very pushed to the inside
6470320	6472880	because of the giant, like touch pads.
6472880	6474880	And so that part isn't super comfortable.
6474880	6478320	I'd be curious to see how it could, I think it'd be kind of neat.
6478320	6482400	I mean, it just, I just have to see how it plays out in the game.
6483120	6484400	Well, it's kind of a really nice feel to it.
6484400	6485200	I like it a lot.
6485200	6485440	All right.
6485440	6488480	We are going to be welcoming your phone calls this segment as well, a little later, not
6488480	6491600	just yet, but you can give us a call on Skype, orange lounge radio.
6491600	6493120	All one word is our username on Skype.
6493120	6494640	That's orange lounge radio.
6494640	6498960	If, um, you know, if you're using, uh, Skype on your computer, as opposed to a smartphone
6498960	6502480	or something like that, you might want to call echo one, two, three first to make sure
6502480	6503440	your connection works.
6503440	6507520	Before you give us a call, we'll be opening that up on about 30 to 45 minutes, but first
6507520	6508640	we have some news to get through.
6508640	6509840	We'll start with Loki.
6509840	6513600	Um, yeah, so this was something that's been teased to be coming out for a while now.
6513600	6518480	Um, at least people finding different retail list listings and whatnot, but, um, now they
6518480	6524400	finally announced that the BioShock, uh, collection will be coming out and it's going to be BioShock
6524400	6531680	one, two, and infinite, and that's going to be coming out pretty soon here.
6531680	6537920	Uh, they were going to be remastering BioShock one and two, and what's kind of a nice, um,
6537920	6541800	and I think they did this with Skyrim, you know, or they will be doing this with Skyrim
6541800	6543720	when it comes out later on this year.
6543720	6549320	Um, if you already own BioShock one and two, you get that free remaster or you get a free
6549320	6552280	remaster once these come out.
6552280	6553840	So that's going to be pretty awesome.
6553840	6558560	Um, the only thing it does not have is the multiplayer from BioShock two.
6558560	6560960	So they're not going to be bringing that, but who gives a shit?
6560960	6561960	Yeah.
6561960	6563480	I said all single player DLC and I think that's all.
6563480	6567360	And I never played the Minerva's den for BioShock two, which I never did that.
6567360	6574200	And I never finished the, the one burial at sea for BioShock infinite, which it was really
6574200	6578080	good, but I just, I moved the PS3 to the back bedroom TVs and I was nice back there.
6578080	6579080	So I never finished it.
6579080	6580080	I never finished two.
6580080	6582520	I just didn't get really drawn in.
6582720	6584000	Two is really good towards the end.
6584000	6586680	Like I know it's kind of repetitive early on, but two gets really good.
6586680	6589560	The last like third of the game is amazing.
6589560	6590560	Yeah.
6590560	6595960	So that'll be coming out later, um, on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC again.
6595960	6601840	Um, but like I said, you know, a night might be a good idea since if maybe you're not interested
6601840	6605800	in purchasing this all over again and say you own infinite and not the other two, I
6605800	6608640	bet the other two are on sale right now in the steam store.
6608640	6612280	So if you want to get that on PC, now might be the time to do that.
6612280	6613280	You get that free upgrade.
6613280	6617600	So I want this on PS4, I'm very excited that it's coming out.
6617600	6618600	Yeah.
6618600	6620080	I'd like to play through BioShock one again.
6620080	6621080	Infinite was great.
6621080	6622080	Infinite was good.
6622080	6623280	I never played one cause it scared me.
6623280	6624280	I did.
6624280	6628280	And I own one and two on PS3 like cause they were PlayStation plus games I think at some
6628280	6629280	point.
6629280	6630280	They were all PlayStation plus games.
6630280	6631280	Infinite was too?
6631280	6632280	Infinite was too.
6632280	6633280	Yeah.
6633280	6634280	That's hilarious.
6634280	6636280	That's why I bought a burial at sea cause I'd only originally rented infinite, but then
6636280	6637280	when it was free, I bought it.
6637280	6638280	I mean, I didn't buy it.
6638280	6640920	I downloaded it and then I bought the DLC cause I'm like, well, I should buy the DLC
6640920	6646080	since they're giving it to me for free and uh, but I still never finished it.
6646080	6647080	All right.
6647080	6651600	And then, um, let's see here on top of that, if you're not looking to necessarily purchase
6651600	6657800	new games, but you have a subscription to either PlayStation plus or Xbox live, um,
6657800	6661040	gold, you can look forward to some new games this month.
6661040	6666120	So starting off with, um, Xbox live, you're going to be getting, um, let's see in the
6666120	6671200	beginning of the month, the bear saga two on Xbox one and tumbles.
6671200	6672200	Let's see.
6672200	6674320	That's going to be the first half of month or actually the whole month, July 1st through
6674320	6678840	July 31st and then tumble stone will be July 16th through August 15th.
6678840	6682720	That's weird how they kind of offset those and then Xbox three 60 you'll be getting rainbow
6682720	6687640	six Vegas two for the first half of the month and try on evolution for the second half of
6687640	6688640	the month.
6688640	6691700	And remember those are going to be backwards compatible as well with the Xbox one.
6691700	6696040	So I don't have yet to play Toronto evolution, but I think I have the disc on three 60.
6696040	6699480	This was kind of interesting that it's coming out now for, actually I think I have it on
6699480	6702680	PlayStation, not three 60 because I borrowed it from you and I beat it.
6702680	6703680	Oh, there you go.
6703680	6704680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6704680	6705680	No, I have it on PlayStation.
6705680	6706680	Yeah.
6706680	6707680	It was actually pretty fun.
6707680	6710800	I mean, it wasn't great, but it was fun to play for free on PlayStation plus.
6710800	6715800	Um, as I mentioned in our games that are coming out this week, fury is a game that's coming
6715800	6718180	out, which looks pretty fantastic.
6718180	6719840	So definitely check that out.
6719840	6724540	I'm also on PlayStation four gain saints row got out of the hell.
6724540	6728520	So if you played through, you know, saints row four and that type of stuff and you're
6728520	6730020	looking for another game, it was all right.
6730020	6731860	I played through the whole thing.
6731860	6733500	Um, it's different.
6733500	6736080	I guess at least it was a new map.
6736080	6737080	So I give them that.
6737080	6740700	But you know, it's basically just another re-skin of saints row the third.
6740700	6743440	I had a quick question on that one for people that might know better.
6743440	6747660	Is that, so that's just a standalone, you know, it is a standalone game, but they never
6747660	6748660	made four free.
6748660	6754220	Did they, or they did on Xbox, funny enough, um, saints row, saints row for you was a free
6754220	6759420	on, on Xbox, saints row four was, um, maybe he's on PS three.
6759420	6760420	It was free or something.
6760420	6763060	It was on, it was free for, it was on PS three.
6763060	6765780	I know at one time, I think I know it's in my library.
6765780	6770920	I purchased the bundle together because they had got out of hell and saints row four remastered.
6770920	6772220	So that was something that was being sold.
6772220	6776220	I was hoping it was the collection together, but it's still just a standalone, just a standalone
6776220	6777860	game, um, which is fine.
6777860	6778980	Maybe they'll do that another month.
6778980	6781820	It'll be saints row four or something, but got a hell is not bad.
6781820	6783580	I mean, I check it out.
6783580	6784980	It's, you know, it's free.
6784980	6789140	Um, so aside from PlayStation four though, they have call Juarez bound in blood on PS
6789140	6795580	three fat princess on PS three and then on the Vita, um, or a Sheikah or was it array
6795580	6801300	Sheikah Sheikah, uh, tainted bloodlines and Prince of Persia revelation.
6801300	6809100	So those would be for July and finally a doom is getting an update.
6809100	6810100	That's right.
6810100	6811100	The brand new doom.
6811100	6815940	And one of the cool things that they're adding to that is the gun placement will be in the
6815940	6819120	center of the screen or classic doom weapon placement mode.
6819120	6820180	They have that.
6820180	6821180	So that's kind of neat.
6821180	6823320	It kind of a little bit of a throwback there.
6823320	6829340	They've also added photo mode to the game as well so you can take pictures of stuff.
6829340	6830340	Cool.
6830340	6831340	That might be one of those games.
6831340	6834540	I try the steam controller with cause I have do you know, photo modes, one of the things
6834540	6837660	you can do in grand theft auto, you can take selfies and stuff and take pictures of your
6837660	6838660	camera phone in there.
6838660	6839660	Awesome.
6839660	6842620	You can like murder somebody and take a picture of the corpse and they have all the like tumbler
6842620	6845340	filters and everything in there, like all sorts of cool stuff.
6845340	6846340	All right.
6846340	6847340	I'll get to that eventually.
6847340	6848340	I enjoyed what I played.
6848340	6852180	It's just, you know, unfortunately, uh, if the game hadn't taken like 20 hours to install,
6852180	6854620	that is unfortunate, but yeah, it'll be worth it though.
6854620	6856340	The game was fantastic.
6856340	6860860	Uh, let's, uh, talk about metal slug because it seems like, boy, these games get re-released
6860860	6865140	all the time and uh, sure enough, here comes another release of metal slug.
6865140	6869120	The metal slug anthology is coming to the PlayStation four.
6869120	6874120	It's part of the PlayStation two classics that will be available on PlayStation four
6874120	6876160	that is being released on Tuesday.
6876160	6878280	Uh, so you can check that out.
6878280	6883680	And there's also a Vita PSP version that you can get for $20 that has already been out.
6883680	6889720	But this, uh, this anthology that has the first six games and metal slug X, uh, that
6889720	6894820	was out for PS2, the Wii and PlayStation portable in 2007, uh, that is going to be, uh, coming
6894820	6895820	out this Tuesday.
6895820	6899740	So for you metal slug fans, uh, hooray, get excited.
6899740	6906500	Uh, also as mentioned in the opening by Jason, uh, dance, dance revolution, a or ACE, uh,
6906500	6909980	is, uh, going to be apparently coming out pretty soon.
6909980	6915300	Um, United States based round one locations are going to get DDR ACE this month.
6915300	6920460	Uh, apparently Dave and busters will also be getting this game.
6920460	6927460	Uh, they are saying that it was as of July 1st making its way out to the stores.
6927460	6931580	So Dave and busters may be starting to install these games already as they are making their
6931580	6935300	way from, uh, the Los Angeles port where these things are delivered.
6935300	6937620	Uh, so you can check that out.
6937620	6940980	Uh, apparently there will be more information on EMUs and what to look forward to with all
6940980	6942340	that later this week.
6942340	6946460	So next time we go to round one, Shane, they'll probably have DDR ACE there, which probably
6946460	6950420	won't play it now, which I don't know what's in it that it will be very exciting, but it
6950420	6951500	will, you never know.
6951500	6954900	There might be, there might be a new smile, DK song I hadn't heard yet.
6954900	6955900	So we'll see.
6955900	6958860	I, I will pass on that when I go back to round one.
6958860	6960860	Is the new thing they're adding pachinko slots?
6960860	6966380	No, I don't, I think music games are like one of the few things that Konami oddly enough
6966380	6970820	after all these years and all the shit we've given them about missteps in the past, the
6970820	6974340	music game seems to be kind of the one thing that they're kind of like, they're still gung
6974340	6975340	ho for.
6975340	6976340	Yeah.
6976340	6977380	They're kind of not fucking with the formula there.
6977380	6982340	So, and, and they have newer, like they have this sound voltex and music, like they're
6982340	6983580	doing new things with it.
6983580	6989060	So it's kind of hard to complain, I suppose, uh, street fighter five, which, you know,
6989060	6993940	just recently had the story mode patch has had a deep discount, no, not deep discount,
6993940	6995900	but discount enough for a new game on steam.
6995900	6999260	And I think on a recent PlayStation sale, they really want you to buy street fighter
6999260	7000260	five.
7000260	7003540	Well, uh, no more and more eyes are going to be on street fighter five.
7003540	7010600	That's because on Sunday, July 17th, ESPN two is going to be televising Evos street
7010600	7013180	fighter five world championship.
7013180	7015860	And that's going to be at seven o'clock Pacific on Sunday, July 17th.
7015860	7019860	Again, that's live from Mandalay Bay where Evo is happening.
7019860	7024900	So, um, that's pretty exciting that it's going to have that type of coverage on television.
7024900	7025900	It's not even on the Ocho.
7025900	7027580	No, it is not on the Ocho.
7027580	7028580	It's on ESP.
7028580	7029580	It's on the dose.
7029580	7030580	Number two.
7030580	7031580	Uh, let's see.
7031580	7032580	We have a couple on the number two.
7032620	7037300	Which I don't, some fighting game fans kind of feel that street fighter five is number
7037300	7040020	two, but that's, some people also really like it.
7040020	7041020	So we'll see.
7041020	7042020	All right.
7042020	7043140	Uh, we got a couple more stories here.
7043140	7044140	I think Shane first.
7044140	7045140	Yep.
7045140	7051060	So, uh, poke in tournament in Japan, uh, they have an arcade version of it and on July 20th,
7051060	7054360	they are getting, um, some characters we already have on the Wii U version.
7054360	7058420	They're getting Garchomp, Brakeson and shadow Mewtwo.
7058420	7062120	However, they are also getting a brand new character.
7062660	7065160	It's going to be a real full-fledged character, not just like support.
7065160	7073760	Um, there is rumors, uh, of who it could be because the Wii U had an update that had some
7073760	7075320	files data mined.
7075320	7084000	So right now people believe it's either going to be Scizor, um, Darkrai or Empoleon, uh,
7084000	7085000	but we're not sure.
7085000	7090720	And we will find out, uh, on July 14th, um, through a live stream on NicoNico if you're
7090720	7091720	in Japan.
7091720	7093720	I'm sure it'll leak to the web everywhere.
7093720	7099300	So you can probably expect that character to become DLC for the Wii U one.
7099300	7104180	It is very interesting how Pokken will bring a lot of these lesser known Pokemon to people's
7104180	7107300	attention other than like the base 151.
7107300	7108300	You know what I mean?
7108300	7109300	Thank God.
7109300	7114540	I was expecting it to be possibly somebody from the new generation, but, and before I
7114540	7118080	heard the whole, Oh, we data mined these things here.
7118080	7121120	So I'd be fine with either of those three.
7121180	7127440	My gut, if it is one of those three is it's going to be Scizor, but I would prefer Empoleon
7127440	7128980	or Darkrai.
7128980	7133800	Do you think maybe one of those is the fighter and then the other two are like a new support
7133800	7136200	bracket that's coming out?
7136200	7144080	I guess it could, but out of those three, I would only see really maybe Darkrai being
7144080	7147720	a support character, but stranger things have happened.
7147720	7150920	I guess, uh, we'll find out on the 14th.
7150920	7151920	All right.
7151920	7153440	Uh, Flaco, how about you?
7153440	7154440	Yeah.
7154440	7155440	Uh, let's see here.
7155440	7162440	The Nintendo, my Nintendo is adding new rewards and discounts to their whatever you'd call
7162440	7165560	it, like refresh service.
7165560	7170240	It's you know, it's the old way you would open up the package and you have like a code
7170240	7172840	in there and you'd put it in and you get the, you get free stuff.
7172840	7175280	Now it's based on what you buy.
7175280	7179260	The problem I have with it is like, I've been supporting the Wii U pretty well, so I have
7179260	7181420	most of these games already.
7181420	7185180	And the, the one thing that kind of stood out to me is I'm not going to read down this
7185180	7186180	whole list.
7186180	7190660	We can go check them out, you know, somewhere, but uh, no free game for silver.
7190660	7191660	This time.
7191660	7192660	Last time they had that one pick cross game.
7192660	7193660	I don't have a 3DS.
7193660	7197580	I didn't get to play it anyway, but they had that this time.
7197580	7204640	The only free ones are, are with gold coins, uh, Metroid 2, 3DS, Wario Land 3, 3DS, Super
7204640	7210440	Mario 3 Wii U, Donkey Kong 3, 3DS, Super Mario Kart Wii U, Virtual Console and Mario Kart
7210440	7213200	8 DLC pack one.
7213200	7216120	So those are all the ones that are free and then there's a bunch of discounts too.
7216120	7220520	But again, most of the stuff I already own or just don't care about and I feel like the
7220520	7223080	service is really going to shine when the next system comes out.
7223080	7226400	It's just weird that they implemented it while the Wii U is pretty much done.
7226400	7231480	You get this for buying new games, by the way, there's no new games coming up and like
7231480	7233000	you get it by buying digitally.
7233000	7235080	Well if you have a Wii, that's kind of hard sometimes.
7235080	7236560	Yeah, yeah, and it's only for digitally.
7236560	7240120	So if you go buy disc games and say you really want to get Mario and Sonic at the Olympics
7240120	7242000	on disc, you're not going to get any points for it.
7242000	7244720	I think it was launched more for Miitomo's benefit.
7244720	7245720	Yeah.
7245720	7246720	So once more these mobile games.
7246720	7247720	So what do you do with Miitomo?
7247720	7248720	Cause I see the coins.
7248720	7251560	They have like a separate thing from Miitomo.
7251560	7252560	They count as silver coins.
7252560	7256140	They still count as silver coins, but silver coins only get you discounts in that one game
7256140	7257680	they gave out the first time.
7257680	7259260	So you can earn that with Miitomo.
7259260	7260260	And they have a couple of crappy themes.
7260260	7262520	So what do you get platinum coins from?
7262560	7267200	Well, I guess from doing little quests and stuff, like if you go to the My Nintendo website,
7267200	7268200	there's hidden things.
7268200	7269320	There's like a, there's like a question.
7269320	7270600	There's like a coin block at the bottom.
7270600	7272000	If you tap on it, you'll get some coins from that.
7272000	7273400	But those are, those are still silver coins.
7273400	7274400	That's the thing though.
7274400	7275400	Those are silver.
7275400	7276400	I thought you said.
7276400	7277400	Oh, platinum?
7277400	7278400	No, yeah.
7278400	7279400	There's no platinum.
7279400	7280400	There's no platinum anymore.
7280400	7281400	It's just gold or silver.
7281400	7282400	Sorry.
7282400	7283400	I thought I had platinum and gold.
7283400	7284400	It was like gold slash platinum.
7284400	7285400	I think I'm logging in right now.
7285400	7286400	I think platinum and silver are the same thing.
7286400	7288940	It's just we're calling them different things here in the room.
7288940	7290200	There's Miitomo.
7290200	7291360	There's Miitomo coins.
7291360	7292720	There's silver coins.
7292720	7293720	And gold.
7293720	7294720	And gold.
7294720	7295720	That's it.
7295720	7296720	Yeah.
7296720	7297720	Okay.
7297720	7298720	Yeah.
7298720	7299720	There's no platinum.
7299720	7300720	Platinum was in the old way.
7300720	7301720	Yeah.
7301720	7302720	I missed.
7302720	7304640	They need an app or something for that thing because like I can't remember the login on
7304640	7305920	their stupid website for it.
7305920	7306920	Yeah.
7306920	7307920	You just have to go to the web.
7307920	7308920	Mobile web works fine.
7308920	7309920	It works fine on mobile web.
7309920	7310920	It's a good thing.
7310920	7311920	Yeah.
7311920	7313200	Sometimes it doesn't work the same on here as it does on my PC though.
7313200	7316960	Like I can't, I don't get a lot of the secrets on mobile that I would on PC.
7316960	7317960	Interesting.
7317960	7318960	I've noticed.
7318960	7319960	My little guy is holding a question block.
7319960	7320960	Okay.
7320960	7321960	Rapid fire.
7321960	7322960	So next story.
7322960	7323960	Oh, sorry.
7323960	7325960	Well, I was just gonna say, I really wish we could just have Club Nintendo back.
7325960	7328280	I really do not like my Nintendo whatsoever.
7328280	7331120	But I think this will be better when the next system comes out.
7331120	7332120	Yeah.
7332120	7333120	I'll wait for edX before I-
7333120	7335840	But I want like physical cool goods like you got from Club Nintendo.
7335840	7336840	That was so neat.
7336840	7337840	Yeah, that was true.
7337840	7338840	That was kind of cool.
7338840	7339840	I still use like five pouches.
7339840	7340840	I'd prefer games but-
7340840	7341840	I don't know.
7341840	7345160	I got way more free games with Club Nintendo than I could ever get or even want to get
7345160	7346160	from this one.
7346160	7347160	Yeah.
7347160	7348160	So it's kind of sad.
7348160	7349160	The rewards are not as good here.
7349160	7351040	And they'll get better when the next system comes out.
7351040	7355880	The story I really want to talk about at the next one, the final Splatfest has been announced.
7355880	7356880	I'm sad.
7356880	7360040	And I know it's going to be Callie versus Marie.
7360040	7361040	Also sad.
7361040	7367120	And I think everybody made the same like summation I did when they wrapped up the previous Splatfest
7367120	7370720	and they kind of ended it with, you know, well, next time we're playing for keeps.
7370720	7371720	I didn't know it meant the last one.
7371720	7373640	I just thought, oh, because their amiibo are coming out.
7373640	7377000	So the final Splatfest will be Callie versus Marie, but they'll do more after that.
7377000	7378440	But no, they've announced like, this is it.
7378440	7383600	This is the final Splatfest, which is like, how hard is it to just put two topics up like
7383600	7388280	once every two months and pick two colors, like, is it really that much to code?
7388280	7389280	But I guess it is.
7389280	7393720	And the team is obviously working on a Splatoon 2 or a Splatoon remaster for the next Nintendo
7393720	7394720	system.
7394720	7399680	So maybe that's when Splatfest will come back if there's like a remaster, obviously a sequel.
7399680	7404600	So it's a little sad to see it going away, but I'm excited to play it.
7404600	7406640	I still don't know which team to pick.
7406640	7410480	It's like, uh, with, well, it's going to be purple and green, right?
7410480	7411480	Yeah.
7411480	7412480	Purple.
7412480	7413480	Easy.
7413480	7414480	That's it.
7414480	7415480	I thought you like greens.
7415480	7416480	My favorite color.
7416480	7417480	I don't like the, I don't like the green.
7417480	7419800	And I don't like the green and splatoon neon yellow.
7419800	7420800	It's not green.
7420800	7422440	I like, like dark green forest green.
7422440	7423440	Fine.
7423440	7426240	I like, I like a lot of shades of green, but not like baby poop green.
7426240	7427240	Yeah.
7427240	7428240	I don't understand why they use that.
7428240	7429240	It's neon.
7429240	7430720	It's I think they even literally call it the game neon green.
7430720	7432440	It's like, oh, it's gross.
7432440	7433880	Looks more like neon yellow to me.
7433880	7435360	So yeah, I don't know which team I'm going.
7435360	7438000	I think I'm going to go Marie cause she's kind of mean.
7438000	7439000	Yeah.
7439000	7440000	She's the sassy one.
7440000	7441000	That's for sure.
7441000	7443120	Uh, Callie's one more splat fest.
7443120	7444120	She's one.
7444120	7445120	Ooh, gosh.
7445120	7446120	I don't know.
7446120	7447720	Like over 50% of them definitely.
7447720	7448720	She's one.
7448720	7449720	I think she's won a huge market.
7449720	7450720	I think Marie.
7450720	7451720	Wait.
7451720	7452720	Yeah.
7452720	7457720	I think Marie is only one, like five in North America and I think just as many in Japan.
7457720	7461600	So fucking Marie, I'm excited though.
7461600	7466000	I just, I really love splatoon and I, it's going to be sad to see splat fest go, but
7466000	7470200	at least I don't have to play till like, don't the amiibos unlock splat fest mode or something
7470200	7471200	like, or the splat fest.
7471200	7472200	They just do songs.
7472200	7473200	Yeah.
7473200	7475400	They just perform songs and like a concert stage or something.
7475400	7476400	Yeah.
7476400	7478720	But I love their songs, so I'm happy about that and I'm definitely getting this amiibo
7478720	7479720	when they come out.
7479720	7483120	I think on the eighth, sometime next week, I don't know, maybe 12th.
7483120	7484120	All right.
7484120	7487280	Well, sadly my dumb ass forgot to do a Fugu question of the week this week, but that's
7487280	7489680	okay because we're running a little long.
7489760	7493560	I might need to outsource that segment to somebody else cause um, it's, I keep, I haven't
7493560	7498440	been slipping too much lately, but you know what, somebody else can start posting.
7498440	7501400	I wonder why it might be an age thing.
7501400	7502400	It is.
7502400	7503400	It is.
7503400	7504400	It's old.
7504400	7505400	Yeah.
7505400	7506400	Super old.
7506400	7509840	I hope, I hope, uh, Julian's ready to take over the show soon cause I might not make
7509840	7510840	it.
7510840	7511840	We'll see.
7511840	7512840	All right.
7512840	7515900	Uh, so we do have some more news stories though, a little more long form.
7515900	7518820	We do have the mailbag FUs of the week still coming up as well.
7518820	7522540	And then, uh, we also are going to get to your calls at orange launch radio on Skype,
7522540	7523540	but first Loki.
7523540	7524700	All right.
7524700	7531180	So we've been kind of covering the saga of Vivendi trying to take over Gameloft and Ubisoft.
7531180	7540100	So now, um, Gameloft has announced that the new executive or new CEO is going to be, um,
7540100	7545260	coming from Vivendi and let's see.
7545260	7551660	They are going to basically be adding five of their own, um, executives to, I guess,
7551660	7556700	the shareholders group or their publishing board.
7556700	7565380	Um, so they've got, you know, four, five members from Vivendi and yeah, I don't know.
7565380	7567660	Basically just trying to complete their takeover.
7567660	7574280	They basically own, uh, 95.77% of Gameloft's voting rights.
7574280	7578840	So yeah, that hostile takeover is kind of happened.
7578840	7582040	I'm curious to see what's going to happen with Ubisoft though, because now they've got
7582040	7586320	Gameloft is like, how, how far away is that?
7586320	7589480	And can they really get less or more terrible?
7589480	7595600	I mean, I don't know if that's something you really want to, uh, question that can actually
7595600	7596600	happen.
7596600	7599320	You did see their press conferences E3 this year, right?
7599320	7600320	Watch all our students.
7600320	7601320	Okay.
7601320	7602320	I give them that.
7602320	7603320	Don't really give a shit about the rest of it.
7603320	7604320	And the South Park game.
7604320	7606840	Oh, and the South Park game is going to be fantastic.
7606840	7608720	That last South Park game was awesome.
7608720	7611200	Seriously, go play that if you have not played it yet.
7611200	7615240	Uh, William Murderface in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com suggests they could acquire
7615240	7616240	Zynga.
7616240	7618760	That sounds like it could get worse.
7618760	7621120	Yeah, I guess, I guess so.
7621120	7622120	All right.
7622120	7625760	Uh, let's, let's do some Twitch news because there are some updates on the Twitch fronts.
7625760	7628440	In fact, one of them, I think Loki kind of referenced earlier.
7628440	7635680	Uh, there is a new category on Twitch, which is watching people eat.
7635680	7636680	That's right.
7636680	7641720	It's a new category called social eating and, uh, you can watch people eat.
7641720	7645360	That is a fucking, I am blaming fucking millennials for this shit.
7645360	7646560	I'm sorry.
7646560	7647560	This is such...
7647560	7649960	Okay, grandpa, why?
7649960	7650960	It's stupid.
7650960	7653480	It is absolutely stupid.
7653520	7658360	Listen, I get it that you want to be, you know, social with your shit and you want to
7658360	7662680	share everything that you're doing because you're so fucking entitled that you feel that
7662680	7666040	everybody gives a shit about that.
7666040	7670000	I mean, like, it's bad enough that you take pictures of the food you eat and shit and
7670000	7673560	my wife is fucking guilty of this shit and I call her out on that and I'm like, what
7673560	7674560	the fuck are you doing?
7674560	7676680	Just eat that fucking food.
7676680	7681640	Anyways, but fucking live streaming yourself eating food.
7681640	7685840	The only excuse I would give to this, if you're fucking building a hamburger that's
7685840	7691200	the size of like a couch or something, you know, a la epic meal time, that is okay shit
7691200	7696360	to fucking stream, but I don't give a shit about you eating your fucking mac and cheese.
7696360	7700680	For what it's worth, it seems like that actually may be the case is this is, this is really
7700680	7705640	born out of a trend of people eating a lot and apparently it may be actually South Korea's
7705640	7710400	fault because this is actually something that gets a big audience in South Korea where they
7710400	7715480	call it mukbang and I'm probably mispronouncing that, but, uh, you have a host who eats a
7715480	7719320	lot of food and you can see this gallon, this live stream has about seven different dishes
7719320	7724120	in front of her that she's currently eating while she just talks with the audience.
7724120	7730200	So she knows it's impolite to talk with your mouth full of this is what I'll allow because
7730200	7733000	this is, I, this goes back to like a fourth of July tradition for me.
7733000	7738240	I will allow competitive eating is this, does it talk about competitive eating?
7738800	7744040	So my fourth of July tradition, which is coming up tomorrow, is I always watch the Nathan's
7744040	7749280	famous hot dog eating contest every morning at nine o'clock on ESPN, just like, you know,
7749280	7750280	all these great sporting events.
7750280	7751960	Like, uh, what'd we talk about?
7751960	7752960	Uh, Evo Evo.
7752960	7753960	Yeah.
7753960	7754960	Stuff like that.
7754960	7757440	And, uh, here's the storm or the dorm and, uh, yeah.
7757440	7761040	So I get to watch, uh, somebody, someone took down Joey chest out last year, so I'm super
7761040	7762400	excited tomorrow to watch that.
7762400	7764840	So if it's competitive eating on Twitch, I'll watch that.
7764840	7765840	I'm sure, sure.
7766440	7768240	Joey chest with the Twitch account now.
7768240	7769240	I don't think it is.
7769240	7771280	I just think it's people that he's more like foodstagram.
7771280	7775040	I think it's, it's more of just like people go because don't get me wrong.
7775040	7779520	I don't have a problem with you streaming that stuff mainly on YouTube, I think is a
7779520	7780800	better format of that.
7780800	7789160	But like, I guess it's just people will watch, you know, what they'll watch on there and
7789160	7790680	whatever becomes popular.
7790680	7791680	That's what it is.
7791680	7797080	I don't think it's a thing, but then again, people watch Bob Ross forever on there and
7797080	7798080	it was really fun to watch.
7798080	7799080	Bob Ross was fucking awesome.
7799080	7800080	He's so fucking awesome.
7800080	7801080	The chat made that.
7801080	7805080	And, and, and I, and I still watch it on Netflix now that it's on there.
7805080	7806080	I enjoy that.
7806080	7807440	My kids love it.
7807440	7808440	It's fantastic.
7808440	7813960	I'm glad to be able to share that with them, but I don't give a fucking shit about people
7813960	7815280	eating food.
7815280	7817400	I would never want to broadcast myself eating food.
7817400	7818400	That's stupid.
7818400	7820680	Even if I have a lot of food and trust me, all the meals I make for myself are usually
7820680	7821680	pretty large.
7821680	7822680	Loki does eat a lot.
7822680	7826680	Uh, look in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com William Murderface getting a little heated
7826680	7831760	saying, uh, blame it on gluttons all you want, but that blaming millennial shit is bullshit.
7831760	7835320	But to be fair, you said your wife does this shit too, and she's not a millennial.
7835320	7839480	So you're, you're blaming more.
7839480	7843520	You're blaming Instagram, foodstagram culture is what it is.
7843520	7847120	I'm blaming people that are way too involved in social media.
7847120	7849360	Like they want to share everything about their lives.
7849360	7852840	And trust me, not everything about your life is fucking interesting.
7852840	7858280	I know that social media, that's why I'm very minimally on Facebook.
7858280	7860820	I'm very minimally on Twitter.
7860820	7862440	It's usually to complain about something.
7862440	7865960	And that's usually the Twitter's for complaining about video games and talking about video
7865960	7866960	games.
7866960	7869720	Facebook is for sharing pictures of my kids when my wife tells me to upload a picture
7869720	7871000	of my kids.
7871000	7872320	That's usually what it's for.
7872320	7873320	It's all right.
7873320	7877520	Look, I have other Twitch news that maybe it'll be less controversial, maybe more.
7877520	7878960	I don't know.
7878960	7885020	But there's a new thing that's being experimented with, with some of the top streamers on Twitch
7885020	7886180	right now.
7886180	7890200	And what you can do, you can get this currency called bits.
7890200	7893600	And you use these bits in a feature called cheering.
7893600	7899000	So you buy the bits for like, you can get 100 bits for $1 and 40 cents.
7899000	7903560	And then what you do, you use this cheer, which is an animated chat emote.
7903560	7909620	So like if you type cheer one, a little gray triangle comes up and you just spent 1.4 cents
7909620	7914880	to cheer that streamer with a little animated emote icon.
7914880	7921520	And apparently that streamer will get one cent and Twitch gets the other 0.4 cents or
7921520	7922520	whatever it is.
7922520	7927280	So this is a way, I guess, where the whole tipping thing that's on Twitch is now built
7927280	7929200	because Twitch wants a cut of that.
7929200	7930200	That's what this boils down to.
7930200	7934880	And Twitch sees that all these live streamers are like, you know, tip me, tip me, tip me
7934880	7936280	on the, on the screen there.
7936280	7938200	Those are, yeah, those, those are the emotes.
7938200	7939320	That's fucking stupid.
7939320	7943600	Well, keep in mind that if you get into the subscription program or whatever, you can
7943600	7947040	design your own emotes that go with a subscription to your channel.
7947040	7949400	But, and don't get me wrong, I understand you.
7949400	7950520	It's not about the emote.
7950520	7952120	It's about the penny you get with it.
7952120	7955480	So what's up with the star David being, I know why is one of them like a sideways star
7955480	7956480	of David?
7956480	7958080	I that's really, is that offensive?
7958080	7959080	I think it might be offensive.
7959080	7961360	I think that might be if that's the most expensive.
7961360	7962360	Is that the red one?
7962360	7963360	Yes.
7963360	7964360	Yeah.
7964360	7965360	Turn your head sideways.
7965360	7966360	It's a red David.
7966360	7968940	It kind of, it kind of, yeah, I guess it looks like what Donald Trump just got in trouble
7968940	7969940	for tweeting.
7969940	7970940	Maybe.
7970940	7974480	Um, I don't know.
7974480	7979080	I don't know if I see it that same way, but, um, I guess I, I wouldn't know.
7979080	7984400	So uh, I'm sure it fucking be like, it's going to get to the point where I hate to have the
7984400	7988640	reference chatter bait again in twice in one episode, but it's going to be like, okay,
7988640	7992120	yeah, well I'm not going to play this level in the game until I get enough of these bits.
7992120	7997260	You know, technically though, if a streamer wanted to do that, they already could with
7997260	7998400	that whole tipping thing.
7998400	8002200	Cause I can't tell you how many streams I've watched where they have the little tip counter
8002200	8006800	and you know, all these people paid and I'm always, I, I'm going to dig myself a hole,
8006800	8009720	but I just, I'm going to say it because it's fucking honesty and that's what I give you
8009720	8010720	on this show.
8010720	8013800	I, I've been getting more and more into live streaming lately.
8013800	8016440	Um, it really doesn't cost anything to live stream.
8016440	8018840	Granted I did buy the capture card.
8018840	8022400	So I mean there are some expenses there where I guess you could buy a new microphone or
8022400	8030320	maybe a better card for your computer and stuff, but I just don't understand why people
8030320	8035220	beg for money to play video games on the internet.
8035220	8037980	Like it, I just, I don't know.
8037980	8042440	I would be grateful if somebody wanted to tip my stream or whatever, but I'd kind of
8042440	8046480	be like, you know, but here's some awesome charities that really need the money.
8046480	8048200	Cause me, I would have bought that stupid capture card.
8048200	8049600	It's because they're entertaining you.
8049600	8054280	It's like saying, why do we pay movie stars to act in movies?
8054280	8058160	But then, okay, but they're working at something to give you an experience.
8058160	8059160	Okay.
8059160	8061300	But honest talk, is it really, I'm not saying I agree with it.
8061300	8063940	Is it really just the person playing the game?
8063940	8066980	Shouldn't the game maker get a little bit of that?
8066980	8070900	And yes, I know this ties into the YouTube argument and I'm getting going down a slippery
8070900	8076780	slope here, but I do kind of feel like the game makers deserve a little bit, but it kind
8076780	8077780	of depends.
8077780	8081460	I guess it really depends on what you're doing with your stream.
8081460	8086280	Like there's some Twitch streams where literally the person is just sitting there with their
8086280	8090980	little head in the box playing the game and all they ever say is thanks for subscribing
8090980	8092980	so and so thanks to the donation.
8092980	8094500	So that's all they ever say.
8094500	8095500	That's it.
8095500	8098260	And when it's that stream, I kind of look and go, you know what?
8098260	8101180	The person who made the game is doing more than you did.
8101180	8104660	But then there's other streams where there's banter going on.
8104660	8105660	They're talking.
8105660	8106780	They're being funny.
8106780	8107780	And it's like, okay.
8107780	8108780	Awesome games done.
8108780	8109780	Quick streams.
8109780	8110780	Yeah.
8110780	8111780	That's different.
8111780	8114220	But who says this is this and this is that?
8114220	8115220	I would disagree.
8115220	8117100	They're getting publicity for their game.
8117100	8118100	People are watching.
8118100	8121840	I mean, they may be tuning in for the person that's streaming, but they're also seeing
8121840	8127300	this game that they're playing and that is free publicity for that game.
8127340	8132860	So I don't really think that the company necessarily needs to get paid on top of already, you know,
8132860	8136660	that game was purchased by whoever's streaming it, I would assume.
8136660	8140560	So they may get sales off of that person streaming it, but I don't see why they should get a
8140560	8145940	cut of that person, you know, whatever they make from streaming that game because they
8145940	8147480	could be streaming any other game.
8147480	8149820	They're trying to sell themselves, not the game.
8149820	8151820	The game is like a side thing for it.
8151820	8152820	Well, I don't know.
8152820	8155820	You know, this is one of those things where maybe the further down the rabbit hole I go
8155860	8158580	with live streaming, then I'll finally kind of get it.
8158580	8161680	And then people are going to be like, Rob, you fucking hypocrite, you settle that thing
8161680	8162680	on OLR.
8162680	8163680	Then now you're asking for money.
8163680	8167720	But as it stands right now, I feel like if people were to be kind enough to donate these
8167720	8172060	things on my stream, I would just put them back into Steam to buy games to stream.
8172060	8176380	Like I just, you know, it just kind of, that's how I'd spend it.
8176380	8181460	I don't feel like I'm going to make a living off Twitch streaming or any of that stuff
8181460	8184380	because I kind of like the job I do have right now.
8184380	8192580	So anyway, let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
8192580	8197420	Let's see, Tiger Claw says, if you think about it, that whole social eating thing is pretty
8197420	8199820	much product placement.
8199820	8203900	Stoppy in chat says, just wait for Rob to become the next booby streamer.
8203900	8204900	Be careful what you wish for.
8204900	8207740	I got a really nice top in the closet.
8207740	8211900	Let's see, Fifth Dream says, it's like saying if you watch a movie you bought a lot, you
8211900	8214060	should pay more for it.
8214060	8220740	Well, I know movies like the Rocky Horror Picture Show say that I had on VHS back in
8220740	8223340	the day, DVD, Blu-ray, iTunes.
8223340	8227300	Wait, wait, wait, perfect example then, here you go.
8227300	8232060	So all the people that go watch a performance of Rocky Horror, that movie is playing in
8232060	8237380	the background, should the people that made Rocky Horror get a cut of that money?
8237380	8241140	The people, okay, the people that made Rocky Horror are getting all the money.
8241140	8242500	The cast doesn't get anything.
8242500	8244540	They just go straight to whoever made the movie?
8244540	8250900	Well, it depends on a variety of factors, but I'm going to keep it simple and say, believe
8250900	8255460	me, 20th Century Fox gets a cut even to this day every time that movie is shown.
8255460	8257020	That's why you actually still have to get the rights.
8257020	8261500	You can't just show that in a theater and act, you still have to go through 20th Century
8261500	8262500	Fox and get the rights.
8262500	8264900	That's pretty stupid, I'm just going to say.
8264900	8265900	That's really stupid, actually.
8265900	8266900	Just letting you know.
8266900	8271740	All right, well anyhow, let's move on, we could probably talk for another hour about
8271740	8274500	this, but we do have some other gaming news we want to get to and we might have some calls
8274500	8275860	on this later, we'll see.
8275860	8277660	But anyway, for now, Shane, what do you have for us?
8277660	8284020	So Capcom released that Resident Evil 7 teaser.
8284020	8288640	People couldn't figure out what some of the items were for, specifically the finger that
8288640	8291860	you could pick up, and everybody was going crazy for it for like a week.
8291860	8295140	I can't believe they didn't understand that Capcom was giving you the finger.
8295140	8300740	Basically, yeah, because recently, if you had signed up for their ambassador program,
8300740	8308540	they sent you some email touting how many times the demo's been downloaded.
8308540	8314000	They actually make reference to the finger, and they say in a picture that the path is
8314000	8318640	closed for now, but patience, dot dot dot.
8318640	8323020	So maybe there'll be some sort of update or a new demo where you can use that finger.
8323020	8326320	But basically, the demo's garbage now.
8326320	8328900	There's no real secrets to it.
8328900	8334640	I think it really tried to evoke that spirit of P.T. and...
8334640	8335640	But without the payoff, really.
8335640	8338980	Yeah, without any sort of payoff.
8338980	8341380	It makes me less excited for the game now.
8341380	8345460	Well, so since they said the game, I mean, I know they said this about P.T. as well,
8345460	8348900	but P.T. stood on its own, but they said, like, oh, it's not going to really be anything
8348900	8349900	like this demo.
8349900	8351600	Yeah, they were just going for the atmosphere.
8351600	8354620	But I did read an article with one of the guys that said it is still going to be in
8354620	8355620	first person, though.
8355620	8356620	Oh, I didn't see that.
8356620	8357620	That's interesting.
8357620	8363180	Well, when it's going to be a VR game as well, that kind of seems like a given sense.
8363180	8364180	Do you think that...
8364180	8365180	Who cares?
8365180	8368660	OK, remember when P.T. first came out, the fact that it was a Silent Hill game was a
8368660	8370220	surprise at the end.
8370220	8377680	Do you think if Capcom had put out the demo as, you know, new Capcom VR demo, it didn't
8377680	8380740	tell you what it was, and at the end you found out it was Resident Evil 7, do you think that
8380740	8381740	would have had a greater impact?
8381740	8385700	It might have had a greater impact, but it still wouldn't have been as good of an impact
8385700	8391300	just because of how lame, really, overall that demo actually is.
8391300	8393740	I think people would have been like, that's Resident Evil?
8393740	8396420	It wasn't like, you know, people wanted a new Silent Hill game.
8396420	8400420	I think some people wanted a new Resident Evil, but it's kind of like, well, they already
8400420	8401420	have like seven of them.
8401420	8403380	Yeah, well, you know they're going to crank them out every couple years.
8403380	8406980	I mean, it's just like, it was just like, oh, that didn't really seem like a Resident
8406980	8409220	Evil game to me, but OK.
8409220	8413140	It wouldn't have been just like, holy shit, this is Resident Evil!
8413180	8414180	It just doesn't have the same effect.
8417180	8421300	All right, let's get through a few stories here, and then we'll get to tonight's mailbag.
8421300	8422300	Loki.
8422300	8424020	All right, so this is kind of cool.
8424020	8428020	There's a brand new Kickstarter for a System Shock remake.
8428020	8433460	It's being remade in Unity, and I think they're probably, well, they're probably going to
8433460	8439940	hit their goal already, because they've already, they're looking for 900,000, and I think the
8439940	8445340	last time I checked it, it was already 600,000 something, so, and it was still with like
8445340	8448660	almost 30 days left.
8448660	8449820	It looks pretty awesome.
8449820	8450820	You can check it out.
8450820	8457140	If you want, you can actually pick up a demo on Steam, Good Ol' Games, or the Humble Store,
8457140	8459420	if you want to check out and play the actual demo.
8459420	8467340	Yeah, they're up to $773,206, and they have 24 days to go, so most likely they're going
8467340	8472300	to hit it, and it looks like it's pretty good so far, so I would definitely, you know,
8472300	8476700	I'm kind of, I didn't really know too much about System Shock, but I mean, it looks something
8476700	8480380	like they could be pretty good to back, but definitely go check out the demo and see what
8480380	8484380	you think.
8484380	8486420	Are you, are you going to back this, Loki?
8486420	8487420	I don't know.
8487420	8488420	You don't really back any Kickstarters.
8488420	8492020	I am not backing that many kicks, oh, I'm probably not backing any Kickstarters right
8492020	8497820	now unless it's going to be like some hardware thing or something that I really want, but
8497820	8499100	just PC games, man.
8499100	8502600	Like the last few Kickstarters I backed, I did Shadowrun and everything, and I was so
8502600	8507060	gung ho about those, and then I completely forgot they came out and I didn't play them.
8507060	8511020	Like I can't say there's a Kickstarter game that I have played now in there, and I've
8511020	8515780	got like, you know, that, Among the Sleep, it's just a bunch of games that just sit at
8515780	8517820	my backlog.
8517820	8523380	Some folks in chat responding positively to this, vidpower in chat at live.vognetwork.com
8523380	8526780	says, played the System Shock demo, it was pretty fun.
8526780	8530280	When Dungeon Buster says, yeah, the demo was really good, I backed it, I still have the
8530280	8535900	original around here on all nine three and a half inch floppies.
8535900	8540200	Some folks very excited for this new Kickstarter.
8540200	8544100	Let me talk about this because this is very interesting where there was actually a Ford
8544100	8545100	commercial.
8545380	8548940	It was an advertisement that was, I think it was specifically from a dealer.
8548940	8550260	I don't think it was from like Ford Central.
8550260	8552780	It was just a print ad, not a commercial.
8552780	8556540	It was, no, there was actually a YouTube as well that was out there.
8556540	8557540	There was.
8557540	8562020	And this was like an email, and what it was, it was the Ford Freedom Event, but here's
8562020	8567900	the problem is that all the artwork that was on it was lifted from the game Firewatch because,
8567900	8574360	you know, the whole thing is a SUV go off in the wilderness or whatever, then the Firewatch
8574360	8578400	art kind of has all that wilderness element to it.
8578400	8584700	So yeah, a lot of people on Twitter kind of call in Ford out on this and what the hell's
8584700	8585700	going on.
8585700	8590600	Apparently, the dealer was contacted and the dealer was kind of, you know, like they were
8590600	8595840	kind of a little shifty about it, apparently hanging up on some people and not really commenting
8595840	8596840	to others.
8596840	8600940	But apparently, there was an email that got, went back to one of these sites like Game
8600940	8606160	Informer or something saying that the art was taken from a DMCA compliant site when
8606160	8608540	getting images.
8608540	8612500	But apparently, when they went and looked on the site, they didn't see anything like
8612500	8613500	that.
8613500	8618140	And actually, one of the folks behind the game Firewatch even called from Campo Santo
8618140	8624180	actually called and said, there's no way that the image came from that site because there
8624180	8627600	were images on there on the company's website that don't appear elsewhere.
8627600	8632160	So I mean, this just, it sounds straight up like the dealer took the art.
8632160	8637280	But I'm going to throw out the theory, here's what really happened because I don't, here's
8637280	8639720	what I don't think happened.
8639720	8644880	I don't think the dealer was like, oh, this video game, I really like this art.
8644880	8648200	I'm going to steal this art for the email.
8648200	8652360	I think what the dealer did, the dealer did a Google image search and just took the image
8652360	8656640	from Google image search, had no fucking idea it was from a game until Twitter alerted them
8656680	8657680	to the fact.
8657680	8660920	And that's why they're like, oh, well, the site we use is usually DMC, not, they use
8660920	8663400	Google image search and that got them in hot water.
8663400	8665680	That's what it is.
8665680	8669960	I would, I would bet money on that being exactly what happened is that the dealer used Google
8669960	8670960	image search.
8670960	8675740	So lesson learned, if you do anything that's out there in print or that stuff, do not use
8675740	8676740	Google image search.
8676740	8681480	I even, I create learning courses that go online for my, as part of my job and you know,
8681480	8687120	something I did at my former employer and I would specifically use public domain clip
8687120	8688120	art sites.
8688120	8689120	I was very cautious.
8689120	8690120	I never used Google image search.
8690120	8695280	I would use public domain sites to get whatever art I wanted to use, which, you know, there's
8695280	8696280	a few of them out there.
8696280	8700360	If you had to know where to look, um, that, that have a very generous license.
8700360	8707640	So anyway, uh, and act-deft in chat says, uh, pretty much they were lazy.
8707640	8708640	Yep.
8708640	8713320	And JD in our chat says, sure, but if you're using Google image search for business reasons,
8713320	8714940	it's on you to get right clearances.
8714940	8716480	That's absolutely right.
8716480	8719800	The whole fact that I found it on a Google search that ain't going to save you or this
8719800	8723760	dealer in this, in this circumstance, you still have to get the rights clearance.
8723760	8727900	I think there is a, I think, don't quote me on this, but I feel like there is a button
8727900	8730840	you can use on Google.
8730840	8733560	Maybe it's being actually, I can't believe I'm going to fucking reference being, but
8733560	8734560	I am.
8734560	8737760	I think there's something that you can actually specifically find images that are like creative
8737760	8742240	commons or you can find images under certain licenses on some of those search engines,
8742240	8744520	but you just kind of like, you can't be lazy about it.
8744520	8745920	You have to kind of think about that.
8745920	8747600	So there you go.
8747600	8750560	Um, I believe we are going to go to the mailbag now.
8750560	8758280	I think it's time to get in the mailbag.
8758280	8763760	Every week you guys email us, participate at orange lounge, radio.com and send us your
8763760	8768240	emails and we read a few of our favorite emails here on the air.
8768240	8771920	Uh, but I believe when I last checked the mailbag, there was only one email to read
8771920	8774400	tonight.
8774400	8776760	So I'm going to actually open up the mailbag right now.
8776760	8779480	Does it qualify as one of your favorites though?
8779480	8782080	Cause you just said you only read a few of your favorites.
8782080	8785940	Well, anytime somebody takes the time to email us, it makes me happy.
8785940	8792760	So yeah, by default, by default, yeah, it doesn't sound like a favorite by default.
8793680	8798400	Except now for some reason, I can't remember the password to get in our fucking email.
8798400	8799400	Shit.
8799400	8800800	This is embarrassing.
8800800	8801800	So old.
8801800	8803160	Let's have dark soccer to call in.
8803160	8807280	No, like I'm positive.
8807280	8808280	That's it.
8808280	8812640	What am I doing wrong?
8812640	8813640	This is so funny.
8813640	8814640	Since you're too busy to run the soundboard.
8814640	8815640	I'll do that.
8815640	8816640	Fuck.
8816640	8817640	Fascinating.
8817640	8828080	You're going to get locked out and like a 30 minute wait before you can try to get an
8828080	8829080	email.
8829080	8833880	Somebody's like, someone's trying to hack your account under lock until you can call
8833880	8835880	us to verify.
8835880	8836880	Well he's doing that.
8836880	8840120	I forgot to mention something in my gaming week cause it wasn't a video game, but I just
8840120	8842680	played today exploding kittens.
8842680	8843680	The card game.
8843680	8846120	It is really fun.
8846120	8847120	Is it?
8847120	8848120	Cause it sounds sad.
8848120	8849120	No, it's funny.
8849120	8850120	And it's fun.
8850120	8853640	I mean, we played the clean version, so I don't know how, if people prefer the dirty
8853640	8859360	version or whatever, but it was just like a really fun, fast to play like little card
8859360	8860360	game.
8860360	8863480	So I don't know if anybody in here bought that game or not, but it's Rob did.
8863480	8864480	Oh, Rob bought it.
8864480	8866680	Oh, but Rob's busy.
8866680	8868600	I did buy it and it's still in the box.
8868600	8869600	You haven't played it?
8869600	8870600	Did you unwrap the box?
8870600	8871600	Okay.
8871600	8873880	I just want to point out, I logged in on my phone.
8873880	8874880	With the same password.
8874880	8875880	With the same password.
8875880	8880480	Did you keep the caps lock key on, on accident?
8880480	8882600	I hope that's, but usually they warn you.
8882600	8883600	I don't know what the hell.
8883600	8884600	Sometimes.
8884600	8885600	I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
8885600	8886920	Did you try turning it off and then on again?
8886920	8887920	Yeah.
8887920	8888920	Try turning it on and off again.
8888920	8889920	Oh Jesus.
8889920	8890920	Now there's like a ton of emails too.
8890920	8891920	This is the best thing.
8891920	8894920	And I got to read them off my phone.
8894920	8896920	This is such a train wreck.
8896920	8897920	Oh, that's so great.
8897920	8898920	Ah, fuck off.
8898920	8899920	All right.
8899920	8902960	Uh, let's get to our first email tonight with all this tiny print I'm going to have to read
8902960	8903960	here.
8904040	8906160	Old people glasses to read it.
8906160	8908160	Can someone send me my glasses?
8908160	8909160	Oh God.
8909160	8910160	My focus.
8912160	8916480	Uh, this email comes to us from James Nighthawk starting us off this week.
8916480	8918680	Hello boys and girls of OLR.
8918680	8921760	James Nighthawk here emailing from across the pond in England.
8921760	8924360	Firstly, a belated happy birthday to the show.
8924360	8928960	I've been on board for over a year now and I've become a weekly listener via the podcast.
8928960	8932080	I'd love to listen live, but hey, time zones are a bitch.
8932080	8933600	I'd like to talk about music games.
8933600	8934920	Always a favorite topic with you all.
8934920	8936600	I have two questions.
8936600	8939200	Question one, what is it about music games that you love?
8939200	8941260	What drew you in and kept you playing?
8941260	8946120	As a musician myself, games like rock band never drew me in as a way to pretend to play
8946120	8947120	guitar.
8947120	8951140	For me, it was the way the reward systems and skill systems were tied to the music tracks
8951140	8956720	that kept me playing and wanting to improve my skills to replay levels and score higher.
8956720	8962440	I will admit, however, that rock band drums are pretty cool for a non drummer as at times
8962440	8967600	it does offer a damn good approximation of actually playing the drum track.
8967600	8968600	Let's start with that.
8968600	8969720	What about music games do you guys love?
8969720	8971120	Shane, you want to start?
8971120	8973120	The music.
8973120	8975680	Well as silly and sarcastic as that is.
8975680	8977000	No, it's not really sarcastic.
8977000	8978000	It's just true.
8978000	8980720	Yeah, no, it is kind of for me as a big motivator as well.
8980720	8983160	The music usually is pretty good.
8983160	8988080	And sometimes the gameplay that goes with it will make me like the music more or even
8988080	8989080	at all.
8989080	8994280	The music I may not have liked, but if it's in a game that I enjoy playing, then that
8994280	8999240	music gets elevated to maybe I could download this and listen to it and it'll like bring
8999240	9001260	back those memories of playing the game.
9001260	9004720	Like that happened a lot in Elite Beat Agents, like there are a lot of songs I would never
9004720	9008960	listen to outside of Elite Beat Agents until I played the game.
9008960	9010520	And now I'm like, oh, that song's cool.
9010520	9011520	I like it.
9011520	9015840	I think too, even though you might not be accurately making music, like you're playing
9015840	9019240	the guitar and it's not like actually playing an actual guitar.
9019240	9023560	You are still interacting with the game where you're making music through whatever the game's
9023560	9024560	system is.
9024560	9027920	And that goes as far back as say, Parappa the Rappa, which was one of the earliest music
9027920	9032700	games where you could do like freestyle segments where you kind of hit the buttons in whatever
9032700	9033700	order you wanted.
9033700	9037360	And that was, for me, that was always something I really liked about music games and like
9037360	9043440	say a game like BeatMania 2DX is that, okay, it's not actually DJing, but it's kind of
9043440	9046200	cool that the key presses do affect the music.
9046200	9048920	And when you play like shit, you're going to get shitty music.
9048920	9053080	But when you're playing in rhythm and at end time, you're creating these really awesome
9053080	9054680	trance or dance songs.
9054680	9057280	That was always part of the charm for me.
9057280	9060640	Loki or Flocko, want to chime in on this before I move on?
9060640	9061640	I always like the music.
9061640	9062640	Yeah.
9062640	9066200	And that's really, you know, kind of what drew me in is just museums plus, you know,
9066200	9067740	they'd be fun.
9067740	9071520	And VidPower in chat says, yeah, it was the butterfly song that first drew me into DDR.
9071520	9074120	And to be honest, that was kind of a big part of it for me too.
9074120	9078520	But I had already had played like Bust a Move, Bust a Groove, you know, that series before.
9078520	9081960	And so when I first saw that in the arcade, I was like, oh, it's like that.
9081960	9085120	But with your body, even though those of you that have played both know they're actually
9085120	9088600	not that similar, but I was like, it's like that, but you use your entire body.
9088600	9092480	And that was actually part of the real kick in the beginning was that DDR was something
9092480	9094380	you actually controlled with your body.
9094380	9096360	So it didn't play like any other game.
9096360	9100520	And I think that's a big draw of the music games too, or the peripherals, I suppose.
9100520	9106040	One more comment in chat where JD it says, yeah, key sounding is a big factor in my enjoyment
9106040	9107040	of music games.
9107040	9108040	Absolutely.
9108040	9110720	Anyway, moving on with James's email.
9110720	9118380	Question two, can you think of any great games which tie music-based gameplay to a more traditional
9118380	9120240	gaming system?
9120240	9124320	Games that come to mind for me are the bit trip games, as they do exactly that.
9124320	9127020	One is a runner where your actions time with the beat.
9127020	9130820	One is a pong clone with timing based on the song and so forth.
9130820	9135660	I've recently downloaded but have yet to start Rhythm Thief for the 3DS, thanks to the awesome
9135660	9137400	Nintendo Humble Bundle.
9137400	9139740	This sounds like it might be exactly what I'm looking for.
9139740	9144420	I find I'm now intrigued by the idea of games where the gameplay is music-based, but the
9144420	9147540	progression is more story or video game-based.
9147540	9150020	The theater rhythm games tried this.
9150020	9155660	Alas, while I enjoyed the mechanics, the RPG part is very lacking and largely ignorable.
9155700	9158900	I have high hopes for Rhythm Heaven on the 3DS once it comes to Europe.
9158900	9163180	I hated the DS version, as the stylus is not a way to play that style of game.
9163180	9166140	Although you were not impressed by the new Rhythm Heaven game, were you?
9166140	9170900	I am warming up to it, especially because I heard remixes are coming.
9170900	9172340	I just have to unlock them.
9172340	9173980	Do you have to use the stylus to play it?
9173980	9178980	No, but honestly, to counter what he just said, I was playing the game with just using
9178980	9183020	the A button, because that's what you would be using, and the directional pad.
9183020	9188420	And I was doing fine at it, but then when I switched over to stylus, I found it to be
9188420	9192460	a lot easier and a lot more fun.
9192460	9200540	The first game that comes to my mind is Crypt of the Neko Dancer, that's the one that comes
9200540	9201660	to my mind first.
9201660	9209940	I would say Rez, because it's a shooter, an on-rails shooter, and it has a story, and
9209940	9212820	it's all musical-based, and it's going to be VR.
9212820	9216220	Pick anything Mizuguchi was involved with.
9216220	9217220	You know what?
9217220	9221620	James, follow this guy, Mizuguchi, because everything he did is these types of games
9221620	9222940	you're looking for.
9222940	9225660	Space Channel 5 would be another game, right?
9225660	9226860	Right up the alley.
9226860	9228900	Luminous, one of the best puzzle games.
9228900	9230660	It's a puzzle game, but I don't know how...
9230660	9236220	But it uses music, because the sweeper is in time with the music, so that is very important.
9236220	9239020	That's a good use of that, Rez.
9239020	9240020	I just said Rez.
9240020	9241340	Yeah, it was literally just said.
9241340	9242340	No, it's alright.
9242860	9243860	Child of Eden.
9243860	9246940	Child of Eden, the sequel-esque type of thing.
9246940	9251460	Meteos didn't use music as much, but I did feel like, you know, another Q Entertainment
9251460	9254140	game where I feel like music was kind of a part of it.
9254140	9255140	Every Extend Extra.
9255140	9256140	That's the other one I was trying to think of.
9256140	9259500	I also kind of want to warn about Rhythm Thief.
9259500	9264660	It starts out kind of fun, but I felt like it got old pretty quick.
9264660	9268140	I know you got it as part of a bundle, so maybe it won't be so bad, but I paid full
9268140	9272300	price for that game when it came out, and I was not very happy with that purchase.
9273260	9278180	Alright, finishing up this email from James Nighthawk, thanks once again for the podcast.
9278180	9279580	Much love from the UK.
9279580	9280580	P.S.
9280580	9285180	I have no idea how the American media is covering the British referendum result.
9285180	9289140	Please please, listeners of OLR, be aware we are a nation torn by this.
9289140	9291980	Half of us did not want the result we ended up with.
9291980	9296820	Well, that feels just like in line with where we're at right now with the presidential election,
9296820	9301700	and I'm probably sure more than half of us don't like the result, or the choices we have
9301700	9302700	available to us.
9302700	9308440	I do feel like the biggest narrative we've been getting with Brexit is that, yes, Donald
9308440	9313020	Trump could be elected president if we don't fucking watch it.
9313020	9317980	That's kind of the sense I've been getting from the media and Facebook and all that stuff
9317980	9318980	here.
9318980	9319980	So your vote counts.
9319980	9321620	Yeah, I guess that's a nicer way to put it.
9321620	9322940	Think back to the 2000 election in Florida.
9322940	9326780	That's a more non-partisan way to put it, yes, that's very good, I like that.
9326780	9328260	Every vote counts.
9328260	9330380	Even some for people that aren't alive.
9330380	9331380	Yeah.
9332060	9336980	Okay, I will tell you the other thing we saw with the Brexit, where it's like, good lord,
9336980	9340880	we always thought British people were smarter, but they're really not when you get that guy
9340880	9347860	on TV that says, well, I didn't think it would actually pass, so I voted for it.
9347860	9350540	I thought, is that like-
9350540	9354540	That's like, okay, I'm gonna fucking dig some dirt here, you ready?
9354540	9362820	That's like my fucking ex-boyfriend, ex-boyfriend, who voted for Prop 8 just because everybody
9362820	9368660	was pressuring him to vote against it, and he felt like he had to vote against it, and
9368660	9370580	he had no will.
9370580	9372140	Wow.
9372140	9379100	There's a reason we use the word ex in that title.
9379820	9391100	Anyway, moving on to YYR, who sent us a couple emails this week, saying, first email, hello
9391100	9395940	LR, happy 14th birthday, Rob, hope you enjoyed yours as well, sorry that I couldn't be around,
9395940	9398100	but driving home from a convention took precedence.
9398100	9401460	I wanted to follow up on what was obviously the most important thing you talked about
9401460	9402820	on last week's show.
9402820	9406620	Yes, there is a place where RC Cola is on tap.
9406660	9411100	It is none other than the famous eight on the break arcade in Dunlin, New Jersey, where
9411100	9416220	they also serve the break steak special, a semi-famous break steak cheesesteak, a side
9416220	9421540	of fries, and a drink of your choice, perhaps even RC Cola, for just five bucks, and he
9421540	9422900	gives a link to their menu.
9422900	9425780	Oh yeah, and they have a ton of music games there too.
9425780	9427700	We'll be running the yearly tournament soon.
9427700	9429300	Not too late to hop on a plane.
9429300	9433000	Not that I expect you guys to fly out just for that, but suggestions can't hurt, right?
9433000	9436020	Now that we've established all of that, we can move on with our lives.
9436060	9438460	Thank you for that incredibly crucial update, YYR.
9438460	9443460	Actually that was good to know that RC Cola can be found on tap, and at a arcade that
9443460	9448100	music gamers, certainly the ones on the East Coast, have certainly heard of.
9448100	9451020	By the way, YYR sent us a second email.
9451020	9454540	I don't usually send two emails, but I've been listening to last week's show while doing
9454540	9458180	some summer cleaning, and Dance Maniacs happens.
9458180	9462620	Rob, while you were at MAGFest, did you happen to play on the Dance Maniacs that was there?
9462620	9464220	No, I did not.
9464220	9467880	If you only walked past it, you might not have noticed, but if you played, you might
9467880	9472460	have seen that it had a lot more songs on it than your typical Second Mix Append J Paradise.
9472460	9477300	That's because it was running a new custom version of the game, built from scratch, with
9477300	9483260	many new songs added, but still looking and feeling just like Second Mix Append J Paradise.
9483260	9486220	Of course, all the old songs were retained as well.
9486220	9490100	It won't make for great radio, but here's a video of this version running on the cabinet.
9490100	9494140	Anyway, the reason I wrote about this is that the creator is really cool, and would almost
9494140	9498060	certainly share this version with anyone who purchases a cabinet and expresses interest.
9498060	9502620	You may need to purchase some additional hardware, though, and have a spare computer lying around.
9502620	9504460	Hit me up if you need more information.
9504460	9507820	I'm going to send this to my friend with the Dance Maniacs machine that I talked about
9507820	9511100	earlier, because I bet she would be all over that.
9511100	9514940	So thank you very much for that, YYR, and someday when I get a Dance Maniacs machine,
9514940	9516860	I might want that too.
9516860	9520580	And now that I know there is a special Dance Maniacs machine at MAGFest, I'm going to be
9520580	9523740	on lookout next year.
9523740	9526740	Last email tonight from Redertainment, hello peoples.
9526740	9530300	As you may have already covered, this week Twitch launched a new category called Social
9530300	9531620	Eating.
9531620	9535180	There's something about this new category I'd like to spark a discussion about.
9535180	9538900	Twitch posted a social eating FAQ, which I linked to above, that guides the users of
9538900	9541800	Twitch on what they can and cannot do with social eating.
9541800	9545140	It's one of those things Twitch tells its users it cannot do that I have a question
9545140	9546140	about.
9546140	9551300	Quoting from the post, examples of what you cannot broadcast on social eating, feeding
9551300	9565500	others, such as pets or babies.
9565500	9573060	So parents cannot feed their babies on Twitch as part of social eating.
9573060	9574060	Why?
9574060	9575140	What is the legitimate reason for this?
9575140	9579860	I can understand Twitch not wanting users to drink alcohol as part of social eating,
9579860	9583580	which is something else they expressly forbid, but why not feed a baby?
9583580	9588460	But see, something that I think would be kind of cool, as far as feeding other people, what
9588460	9591460	if someone's blindfolded and you feed them stuff and try to get them to guess what it
9591460	9592460	is?
9592460	9593460	That sounds like fun.
9593460	9596180	You can take that shit to fucking YouTube.
9596180	9600580	It just sounds like a fun usage of it.
9600580	9601580	No.
9601580	9607700	I think there's a greater problem in our society as it goes with the whole breastfeeding in
9607700	9613580	public and how people are shamed and it really shouldn't like any mom I know that's done
9613580	9619840	it uses the blanket or covers up, you know, so that it doesn't like at the dinner table,
9619840	9622500	you know, sitting there topless at the table.
9622500	9627100	But even if she wanted to sit there topless at the table and feed the baby, you know what?
9627100	9628180	Baby's got to eat too.
9628180	9630060	And that's kind of a woman's choice.
9630060	9635740	So I just, it may not necessarily be something that's appropriate for streaming on the Internet.
9635960	9637860	Is that Twitch is a video game.
9637860	9641860	Like I just I don't understand why this competitive eating or the eating sorry thing is even on
9641860	9643360	Twitch to begin with.
9643360	9647140	So I just I feel like they kind of had to arbitrarily draw a line.
9647140	9650940	But it's one of those things where it's like, I don't know, for Twitch's sake, it's just
9650940	9652900	not really worth arguing about.
9652900	9657400	I mean, I just it's it to be honest, I think the question has to be addressed at a much
9657400	9658660	higher level than Twitch.
9658660	9662220	Well, to be honest, that's my point cares if they don't like to do it on their platform.
9662220	9666180	There are other streaming platforms out there like YouTube live where I guess, could you
9666180	9667660	drink alcohol live on the air?
9667660	9669700	I mean, were there any rules against that?
9669700	9670700	I don't think so.
9670700	9674620	A fifth dream in chat says, you know, the second the mom is paying too much attention
9674620	9679180	to chat and pokes her baby in the eye with a spoon, Twitch would get destroyed.
9679180	9681340	So they're making sure to nip that in the bud.
9681340	9682340	I don't know.
9682340	9685580	I don't know if you intended that pun, but that's good.
9685580	9689220	Are we going to have like swatting during some of these like food eating events and
9689220	9690220	stuff like that?
9690220	9694500	No, because only trash people do that.
9694500	9700060	Or could it be like, instead of swatting, they'd be like, I don't know, pizza pie ordering.
9700060	9701980	It's like, what?
9701980	9702980	Who's at my door?
9702980	9704980	I didn't order these 20 pizzas.
9704980	9707100	God damn you, internet.
9707100	9710140	Akuma JP says, we see that everywhere here.
9710140	9712160	What's with the West with breastfeeding?
9712160	9716940	This topic is way larger than what our video game podcast can cover, but in a nutshell,
9716940	9724020	like the, our nation has an obsession with heaven forbid somebody see a titty, even though
9724020	9726780	boobs are like everywhere.
9726780	9729500	Heads can explode, but you put a titty out there.
9729500	9731300	Oh shit.
9731300	9734340	It's one of those things that I think is just going to have to change with time.
9734340	9741400	Even though Game of Thrones is the highest rated show on TV, it has exploding heads and
9741400	9742400	titties.
9742400	9743400	Anyhow.
9744080	9750840	But only the Japanese have exploding heads being caused by titties.
9750840	9756880	And SSJ 100 Matt says, blame Janet Jackson or blame Justin Timberlake who ripped the
9756880	9759480	top off yet got away scot-free.
9759480	9765240	That is something that I will never understand in my lifetime about our culture is that why
9765240	9770520	was she crucified for that yet Justin Timberlake, Oh, I'm going to sing another song and so
9770520	9774100	millions and billions of albums, like it's fucked up.
9774100	9778240	Like there's just, I don't mean to get all like social justice warrior on you, but come
9778240	9779240	on.
9779240	9780240	That's fucked up.
9780240	9782800	Like it's just, there's this things in our culture that don't make sense.
9782800	9786720	And titty police is one of them.
9786720	9787720	That's it.
9787720	9791680	All right, let's move on and we're going to get to the F you of the week.
9791680	9793920	What a, what an appropriate segue to make here.
9793920	9794920	I don't know.
9794920	9795920	I'm pretty forward to the police.
9795920	9799160	I mean, I think I have a different thing in mind.
9799160	9819080	I think you're defining it a little differently than I am damn.
9819080	9820920	Loki wants you to start tonight.
9820920	9821920	Okay.
9821920	9828920	So big fuck you to the stupid Sacramento County law that they put in the place effective today
9829280	9836280	or not today, July 1st, where basically they have eliminated plastic shopping bags because
9836800	9838480	I don't know why the fuck they did.
9838480	9840080	Oh, we're good for the environment.
9840080	9841080	Fuck you all.
9841080	9843320	Seriously is a fucking inconvenience.
9843320	9847720	If I want to be environmentally friendly and buy those fucking bags, the reusable ones,
9847720	9851480	I will, but I don't, I don't give a shit because it doesn't matter.
9851480	9854980	So what I'm going to do, I'm going to pour extra fucking oil into all the rivers and
9855020	9858620	streams to offset all the good that this shit is doing.
9858620	9862500	You're such an asshole.
9862500	9863500	But you know what?
9863500	9869460	I look, I am, I'm pretty fucking liberal, but I would say if I were to become governor,
9869460	9871700	I would overturn that fucking bag ban day one.
9871700	9872980	I'm I'm with you.
9872980	9878240	I don't, it doesn't like I, you recycle the bags and use them for other things and I do
9878240	9884240	all the time, all the time anyway, too, too many political discourse on tonight's show.
9884760	9885760	My FU of the week.
9885760	9886880	I don't, I don't know.
9886880	9888000	I don't really have a lot.
9888000	9892960	So my FU of the week goes to my lazy ass not being, being motivated enough to exercise.
9892960	9897160	Uh, I need, I need to get up off my ass and do more exercise, especially if I do want
9897160	9900280	to wear better cosplay at a dragon con.
9900280	9901280	So who knows?
9901280	9904440	Maybe in the next next day or two, I'll finally get started with that.
9904440	9905440	Flaco, how about you?
9905440	9907040	And now I talked about how much I love them.
9907040	9908040	I don't care.
9908040	9913400	F U S G D Q because you didn't accept my submission.
9913400	9917760	Oh, I can be Minneapolis right now, but I'm on Rob's couch.
9917760	9919960	Hey, wait a minute.
9922600	9923600	That's it.
9923600	9925960	I still love them for not accepting.
9925960	9927600	Minneapolis isn't that great anyway.
9927600	9928600	All right.
9928600	9930160	Practicing PT in the back room.
9930160	9932360	Just don't, don't hate me.
9932360	9933560	Minneapolis, St Paul people.
9933560	9934560	I'm just telling a little joke.
9934560	9935560	All right.
9935560	9937360	Uh, Shane, last but not least.
9937360	9941120	If you to being tired, cause I'm really tired and didn't take a nap today and I went to
9941120	9943760	bed at like four and got up at nine.
9943760	9944760	Yeah.
9944760	9947880	If you to lack asleep, but that was my own fault.
9947880	9949840	I will say this though.
9949840	9954080	Shane stayed on the phone with me the entire drive home so that I wouldn't fall asleep
9954080	9955080	on the road.
9955080	9959640	And so that was, that was pretty awesome thing that Shane did pretty awesome.
9959640	9963680	As much of a jerk as he has to me, sometimes he'll do things like that that make me want
9963680	9964680	to keep him around.
9964680	9965680	So there you go.
9965680	9966680	All right.
9967000	9971080	I started seeing like a lullaby where he would, he, you and I both know that would never fucking
9971080	9972080	happen.
9972080	9974880	Like why do we even have these scenarios that are just untrue?
9974880	9975880	Yeah.
9975880	9982300	I, he wouldn't even do it for, even as a goof, he wouldn't even do it for, for his boyfriend.
9982300	9985200	He wouldn't do it for a child that he had.
9985200	9987200	Would you, would you sing a lullaby for your child?
9987200	9988200	No.
9988200	9989200	No.
9989200	9993760	Why would I want to go outside of the backyard to sing to the kid that's trying to go to
9993760	9994760	sleep?
9994760	9997880	Cause that's where they're going to stay in their pen.
9997880	10004000	And let's all be, let's all be thankful for a minute that Shane doesn't have kids and
10004000	10009200	I'm not sure if they thankfully is gay and is very, very unlikely to be having kids.
10009200	10013560	I like, I don't know if they'd have a pen cause I think I just tie them to a tree so
10013560	10014840	they can't get away.
10014840	10016880	It's way cheaper and easier.
10016880	10019800	You don't let him babysit, do you?
10019800	10021120	His kids kind of love me.
10021120	10022120	Yeah.
10022120	10023120	He's actually great with our kids.
10023720	10024720	It's all lies.
10024720	10025720	He loves our kids.
10025720	10027280	He's great with the idea of the tree.
10027280	10028800	I would imagine they would.
10028800	10033040	They'd tire themselves out trying to run around the tree, but they'd also choke themselves.
10033040	10034040	So it's a win-win.
10034040	10038480	Now that fifth dream that is false advertising, chicken wire cages are where kids belong.
10038480	10041840	It's actually has to be kid wire cages.
10041840	10043680	Chicken wires for chickens.
10043680	10046080	You guys all need therapy.
10046080	10049180	Let's, we got a couple more stories for you guys and we're going to open up the skype
10049180	10052780	line at orange lounge radio on skype, uh, Loki.
10052780	10056880	So this is the weirdest news I think we can be reporting today.
10056880	10064720	And that is first off, well, crystal Pepsi is coming back again, again, apparently people
10064720	10065720	get it this time.
10065720	10066720	Yes.
10066720	10067720	A limited time.
10067720	10072920	It will be in stores on July 7th in Canada and July 8th in us, I thought it was August
10072920	10073920	for us.
10073920	10074920	Nope.
10074920	10075920	It's July.
10075920	10079700	And apparently along with that, uh, we're going to be getting a game.
10080620	10089680	It is a similar area spoof of the Oregon trail called the crystal Pepsi trail.
10089680	10092400	Yes.
10092400	10095640	The crystal Pepsi trail.
10095640	10096640	You can check it out.
10096640	10097640	Oh my gosh.
10097640	10099840	I just remember when that came out last time it was on Amazon.
10099840	10101660	It was all sold out in like five minutes.
10101660	10105360	But now it's on the eighth so I can go get my Cali Marie amiibo and crystal Pepsi in
10105360	10106360	the same day.
10106360	10107360	It'll be amazing.
10107360	10108360	Yeah.
10108360	10111900	I want to see how this is going to happen now, but Oh, crystal Pepsi will try to like,
10111900	10114860	now I remember why I hated that.
10114860	10116460	I didn't remember what it tasted like.
10116460	10122140	I don't remember either, but I remember liking it as a sweetie with aspartame.
10122140	10126020	Oh, so it's diet was always diet.
10126020	10128180	I don't feel like it tasted like a diet soda.
10128180	10129180	It was sweeter.
10129180	10130180	I remember that.
10130180	10131220	Uh, maybe it's a mix.
10131220	10133340	Do these sell surge at the stores yet?
10133340	10134900	I know it's on Amazon.
10134900	10135900	Surge was okay.
10135900	10139280	I miss Citra.
10139280	10140280	That's what I want.
10140280	10141280	Surge.
10141280	10146200	I want to get some crystal Pepsi and see if it's, I liked it when I was younger, but everybody
10146200	10148160	says it's not as good as you remember.
10148160	10149540	Yeah, probably.
10149540	10150540	So we'll see.
10150540	10151540	We'll see.
10151540	10152540	I think I just liked it cause it was clear.
10152540	10156080	I was like, Ooh, like Coke zero and shit like that now.
10156080	10157520	So maybe it'll be popular.
10157520	10160800	I just remember the Saturday night live commercial they had that was crystal gravy.
10160800	10162800	Did you ever see that?
10162800	10164520	I think it's on YouTube.
10164520	10165520	I do remember that.
10165520	10166520	All right.
10166520	10171660	Oh, act depth and chat says, sky, buy a crystal Pepsi and stream it on Twitch.
10171660	10176220	I fucking could now, but just don't put any alcohol in it and don't fucking, don't give
10176220	10177220	it to a baby.
10177220	10180020	Don't feed it to a baby while I'm on the street that do a baby anyway.
10180020	10181020	All right.
10181020	10187900	If it's in a baby that kind of looks like an adult moving on, uh, last story tonight
10187900	10192040	has to do with an NES emulator and this is what we've actually talked about before.
10192040	10198720	It is an NES emulator that turns games into 3d, not like the way you would see it like
10198720	10203420	on a 3ds or something, but it actually will turn the game into looking like, like it's
10203420	10207300	like a rotatable type of like 3d play field.
10207300	10211540	Um, apparently this software is available now and you can actually get it through itch
10211540	10215100	IO, which seems weird cause it's an emulator, but okay.
10215100	10217600	Uh, but you can get it as a free download.
10217600	10222540	You can chip in optionally for 99 or more for access to the latest build as soon as
10222540	10223540	it was released.
10223540	10228420	Uh, previously this was going for $30 and if you did buy that for that price, you're
10228420	10229940	going to get refunded the difference.
10229940	10235500	Although I'm surprised he's allowed to charge any money for it at all when you, I guess
10235500	10239820	you don't get the ROMs and I guess that's the difference, but like you can get an idea
10239820	10240820	what this looks like here.
10240820	10244460	Uh, I'm, I'm looking at a video here in studio where somebody is playing balloon fight, which
10244460	10248320	you know, ought to be a pretty simple NES game to emulate cause there was one of the
10248320	10249320	earlier titles.
10249320	10253440	There's not a whole lot going on, but you kind of get the sense that it looks like,
10253440	10258020	you know, when a child would make a diorama and a shoe box, like that's the type of thing
10258020	10260440	that balloon fight kind of looks like here.
10260440	10261440	It's cool.
10261440	10262440	It's a really cool effect.
10262440	10264800	Put together with the Perler beads or something like that.
10264800	10269280	Yeah, it's, it's a really cool effect, but um, yeah, it's uh, you know, again, I don't
10269280	10272000	know how well this would work in every Nintendo game.
10272540	10275980	Some folks in chat kind of echoing something I concluded there.
10275980	10280180	Stoppy says emulators are legal, licensed ROMs are not.
10280180	10286260	I still am a little surprised that it is allowed to exist on this store, but I suppose the
10286260	10290300	patent would be, you know, on the Nintendo hardware would be expired by now.
10290300	10292540	So maybe that's, that's why they're able to get it.
10292540	10295860	That's why you have all the knockoff Nintendo things that you can buy now.
10295860	10300940	Um, so maybe that's, that's why, but yeah, the ROMs certainly would not be included.
10300960	10303040	Are there any public domain NES ROMs though?
10303040	10304840	I don't know if there are any out there.
10304840	10308760	If there could be home brew stuff that people make, yeah, I guess only the home brew stuff
10308760	10313000	would work because anything that was actually in a cartridge, Nintendo would have rights
10313000	10314000	over that cartridge.
10314000	10316920	I think, I think again, I'm not a lawyer.
10316920	10319120	I'm just speculating, I suppose.
10319120	10322940	Anyway, that is going to do it for the stories tonight, but we are going to open up the Skype
10322940	10327120	line for a little bit here for any of you, the one to get through orange lounge radio,
10327120	10328120	all one word on Skype.
10328120	10331820	If you want to give us a call since we are already after nine o'clock, I'm only going
10331820	10334100	to leave a little room here opportunity to call it.
10334100	10335100	Oh, good.
10335100	10337420	It is ringing already, so we'll get to it.
10337420	10338420	Hi.
10338420	10339420	You're on orange lounge radio.
10339420	10340420	Who is this?
10340420	10341420	Hey, this is Act Deft.
10341420	10342420	Hey Act Deft.
10342420	10343420	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10343420	10351820	Well, I'm kind of tired, but, but, uh, I want to talk about, uh, Kirby Pen and Robobot.
10351820	10352820	Yes.
10352820	10356060	Uh, we started to talk about this a little bit at the end of last week's show, but, uh,
10356060	10359120	uh, what's your thoughts on this?
10359120	10365680	Well, the last time I talked to, oh Lord, I hadn't, I hadn't played it, but right now
10365680	10375340	I am only 2% of 100%, uh, sorry, of having a file with 100%.
10375340	10382480	That game is probably the best Kirby I have ever played.
10382480	10386420	That is quite some praise there, Act Deft.
10386420	10394300	And, and you know me, everyone that's been listening to the show quite, sorry, quite
10394300	10402780	some time, knows I love Kirby and, and I have said that Kirby Superstar is probably the
10402780	10412460	best there is, and, and Robobot, I don't know if I didn't expect that much.
10412460	10420960	Or, uh, I, well, I said, it's a Kirby game, I have to play it, but it really blew me away.
10420960	10424840	It's like, wow.
10424840	10430320	It's so, basically I can define it like so much fun.
10430320	10440340	Having the robot, uh, well, destroying everything, uh, in your path, uh, the bosses, even playing
10440340	10446360	as regular Kirby and, and having the abilities, uh, like the new ones, especially the, the
10446360	10452520	psychic, the ESP one, like, oh my God, that's the, that, that one is so broken, but it's
10452520	10461520	so much fun to use, and, and all the other modes in the game are also so fun.
10461520	10470160	My, probably my only complaint is the multiplayer game it has, uh, Kirby's Team Clash.
10470180	10472820	It's pretty short.
10472820	10474220	That's, that's my only complaint.
10474220	10481380	I, I, I, I played it yesterday or last night with some friends, uh, and there's only like
10481380	10487340	six quests, and they're pretty much like boss battles with four people.
10487340	10495460	Uh, they're fun, they're fun, but yeah, it took, it took us like probably half an hour
10495460	10497720	to beat them all.
10497720	10505120	And we tried, uh, the last one twice because we died and all that stuff, but other than
10505120	10509880	that, I really, really cannot recommend this game enough.
10509880	10515200	It's probably heading to, towards my game of the year of, uh, 2016.
10515200	10516680	That's some, some pretty high praise.
10516680	10520560	Are you sure now, just to ask a tough question, cause that's what I do, are you sure that
10520560	10526220	you actually, you know, you're not just kind of blinded by, it's the new car smell, basically.
10526220	10530780	The fact that it is a new Kirby game, like is that, you think, influencing your opinion
10530780	10537380	or, or no, this really does hold its own compared to these Kirby games of the past that you,
10537380	10538380	you love so much?
10538380	10539380	Okay.
10539380	10543600	How do I know that this game is like legit?
10543600	10545700	I don't complete games.
10545700	10552040	I don't do 100 completion or a hundred percent completion on games, like there are only a
10552040	10553040	few games.
10553040	10556600	Uh, do I do something like that last year?
10556600	10557600	It was undertale.
10557600	10564520	Uh, the year before that it was the solo night, which were both my games of the year of those
10564520	10567240	years, respectively, and so forth.
10567240	10575000	Uh, and even Kirby games, if I like the game enough, I'll, I'll beat it like regularly,
10575000	10580620	not complete it, uh, uh, like get all the collectibles and all the secrets.
10580620	10587140	Like, for example, uh, last year that we got, uh, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, that game
10587140	10596540	was fun and, uh, but I haven't even finished that game and I liked it, but I haven't even
10596540	10598100	finished it.
10598100	10603220	And there are, there are other games that I like, but I don't go to the extreme to,
10603220	10608920	oh, I have to get all the things, I have to complete it 100%, get all the secrets.
10608920	10613780	And this game made me do it because it was so fun.
10613780	10616040	It's really fun.
10616040	10621960	And like, I'm gonna make this example, like, oh, like a person like Bobby Blackwolf that
10621960	10629400	doesn't play hard games or, uh, games that are too difficult, like, Kirby Planet Robot
10629400	10634580	Bot is like the whole game, well, not the whole game because it has some challenging
10634580	10642620	parts later on, but it felt like it was God Mode and playing Kirby, if anyone has played
10642620	10648540	a Kirby before, at least one, you're basically play, you're basically playing God Mode already,
10648540	10653000	but the, uh, in Planet Robot Bot, it definitely feels like it.
10653000	10656380	It feels like an, uh, a fresh new Kirby.
10656380	10663280	That's probably my point here, like, and here's coming from the fan, I felt that the
10663280	10669960	Kirby franchise had gotten a little stale, maybe Planet Robot Bot brought new life to
10669960	10670960	it.
10670960	10678940	Like, really, it's, I seriously need to tell everyone that this game is freaking awesome.
10678940	10684000	Those are quite some strong words of support there, um, yeah, I mean, I think one of the
10684000	10687980	things that you mentioned there that I actually totally get is the fact that there's very
10687980	10691140	few games that you will sit there and play to completion.
10691140	10694240	So it's like when you do sit there with a game and play all the way to completion, you
10694240	10697880	know it's something that you really, really like, or you wouldn't have done that because
10697880	10701180	I'm kind of the same way and I joke about it on the show all the time that I have like
10701180	10702180	gamer ADD, right?
10702180	10707080	And I bounce from one game to another, like, yeah, if I actually sit there and beat the
10707080	10711820	game or like the entire trilogy, as was the case of Mass Effect, I must really enjoy that
10711820	10712820	game.
10712840	10717040	That is, that is a high recommendation, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to really consider
10717040	10720940	checking that out, although I just, oh my god, the gaming backlog just grows and grows
10720940	10721940	at Deft.
10721940	10722940	It grows and grows.
10722940	10728260	I know, I know, mine too, it's like, oh my god, I have too many games to play.
10728260	10731140	Well, um, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?
10731140	10737340	Well, I'm also really sad that Flatfist, uh, are ending, but, well, at least we all have
10737340	10741380	still the online component, so.
10741380	10745700	But, uh, I'll end my call with this, go Team Cali!
10745700	10749980	Alright, go Team Cali in case Flaco's on the fence about who he's gonna pick.
10749980	10752300	Alright, take care my friend, thanks for the call.
10752300	10753620	Hey, thanks for having me.
10753620	10754620	Anytime, bye-bye.
10754620	10760740	187 Game OLR or you can call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,
10760740	10763180	but we have another call coming in right now, so let's get to it.
10763180	10764700	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10764700	10769300	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10769300	10770300	We can't hear you.
10771300	10774300	One more try, if you're there.
10774300	10775300	Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.
10775300	10776300	I hear a distinct ringing sound.
10776300	10780300	I know, I feel like I hear, like, uh, like something might not be connected all the way.
10780300	10781300	It's a robot.
10781300	10782300	Or something, yeah.
10782300	10786300	I don't know, maybe it was, uh, maybe it was a subliminal message, I don't know.
10786300	10790300	Anyway, uh, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to, uh, give us a call.
10790300	10793300	Loki, check in real quick to see if there's any last minute stories from you.
10793300	10796300	Um, no.
10797300	10800300	Alright, I'll leave the phones open for just a little bit longer.
10800300	10803300	Alright, let's, uh, see if we can get to it.
10803300	10805300	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10808300	10810300	Hello, Rob, it's me.
10810300	10811300	No, same caller.
10811300	10814300	Sorry, buddy, looks like Skype's not gonna work for you tonight.
10814300	10818300	Alright, I guess that's a sign to probably close it down, because it's already, uh,
10818300	10822300	I don't see any other, anybody else trying to get through, and it's, uh, already
10822300	10826300	9.15 here on the West Coast, which means after midnight on the East Coast,
10826300	10829300	so we probably should wrap things up, because I know Flocko probably needs to get back to the kids.
10829300	10830300	Uh, thank you for being here.
10830300	10831300	If you're sleeping, thank God.
10831300	10832300	Oh, thank God.
10832300	10833300	I want to get back to hanging out.
10833300	10834300	The summer game's done quick, yeah.
10834300	10836300	Yeah, gotta do that.
10836300	10840300	I guess I can't livestream for a week, because I'll have to go against that stuff, we'll see.
10840300	10843300	Um, thank you for being here tonight, Flocko.
10843300	10845300	Mario Kart Double Dash right now, just so everybody knows.
10845300	10847300	Yeah, I saw that, I just looked at that too.
10847300	10848300	Worst Mario Kart game ever.
10848300	10849300	I was gonna say, that's what it is.
10849300	10850300	No, you love that game.
10850300	10851300	You guys all suck.
10851300	10852300	I love that game so much.
10852300	10854300	That's the game that gave us toe depth, barf.
10854300	10855300	I love that game.
10855300	10857300	Uh, anyway, I've-
10857300	10859300	Thank you for being here.
10859300	10860300	You're welcome.
10860300	10861300	You know what's contributing.
10861300	10862300	You're welcome.
10862300	10863300	I'm gracing you with my presence.
10863300	10864300	Yes.
10864300	10865300	No, it's, it was super fun.
10865300	10866300	I laughed a lot.
10866300	10867300	I always laugh a lot.
10867300	10869300	I'm like the OLR laugh track.
10869300	10872300	Well, that's good that somebody's laughing.
10872300	10874300	Because lately I just cry.
10874300	10875300	I'm laughing with you, not at you.
10875300	10876300	Or both, I don't know.
10876300	10877300	Maybe both.
10877300	10878300	I was at you with that password thing.
10878300	10880300	Oh, that was great.
10880300	10883300	Or when you were picking which Pokemon Rob would be.
10883300	10884300	Yes.
10884300	10886300	It's like a flashback episode where we're flashing back to the current episode.
10886300	10887300	Yeah, to three hours.
10887300	10888300	These shows are so fucking long.
10888300	10889300	This is like Clerks now.
10889300	10891300	This is like Clerks animated series.
10891300	10896300	But yeah, I love being here and I'm glad I can be back after such a long break off.
10896300	10897300	All right.
10897300	10899300	Well, do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?
10899300	10900300	Any websites?
10900300	10901300	Oh, gosh, I didn't even look.
10901300	10903300	Did you put my new article up yet?
10903300	10904300	Not yet.
10904300	10905300	It'll probably go up tomorrow.
10905300	10908300	Oh, if it goes up tomorrow, if you listen to the podcast, look at my new article.
10908300	10909300	It's movie preview part two.
10909300	10911300	I have a few things in queue and luckily...
10911300	10912300	Never mind.
10912300	10913300	No, no, I'll get them all up.
10913300	10916300	I'll get them all up tomorrow because I have the day off work tomorrow.
10916300	10917300	At some point you can actually listen to this podcast.
10917300	10919300	Know in the future that that article will be up.
10919300	10920300	Awesome.
10920300	10921300	Part two.
10921300	10922300	Summer part two.
10922300	10925300	And all right.
10925300	10926300	Thank you.
10926300	10927300	Come back again soon.
10927300	10928300	I'll try.
10928300	10929300	All right.
10929300	10931300	Unless there's really good stuff on TV.
10931300	10934300	Shane, you're okay.
10934300	10935300	Thanks for...
10935300	10936300	Super tired.
10936300	10937300	...kind of being here in between shiny hunting.
10937300	10938300	What are you talking about?
10938300	10939300	I talked a whole lot.
10939300	10940300	No, you did.
10940300	10941300	You did a good job on the show tonight.
10941300	10943300	I actually neglected shiny hunting a lot.
10943300	10946300	Do you want to promote anything like your podcast or anything like that?
10946300	10947300	Ranger pride.
10947300	10948300	All right.
10948300	10949300	You're very good at promoting your stuff.
10949300	10951300	I'm super tired.
10951300	10952300	All right.
10952300	10955300	Then I guess it's time for us to go around and give everybody's final thought.
10955300	10958300	But I do want to say real quick, thank you as always for listening to and supporting
10958300	10960300	Orange Launch Radio.
10960300	10963300	All we ask at the end of every episode, tell a friend or two about the show.
10963300	10964300	Help spread the word.
10964300	10967300	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only put those voices out there
10967300	10968300	when they're here.
10968300	10970300	So again, please help us spread the word.
10970300	10975300	A nice five-star review wherever you found this show, such as like iTunes or Google Podcasts,
10975300	10976300	wherever you found the show.
10976300	10978300	It goes a long, long, long way.
10978300	10979300	We really appreciate it.
10979300	10982300	If you haven't done that yet, if you could take five seconds to do that, we'd really
10982300	10984300	appreciate it.
10984300	10987300	Okay, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10987300	10994300	My final thought is that I need to find a place to take my son for fireworks tomorrow.
10994300	10996300	That's not going to be super crowded, which I think is impossible.
10996300	10997300	Good luck.
10997300	10998300	I may just give up.
10998300	11004300	I live in Atomas and they did it like on Friday night and I didn't know this was going on,
11004300	11006300	but it was like right down the street from where we live.
11006300	11009300	And so we just heard the explosions going off at 930.
11009300	11010300	So my son was still up at the time.
11010300	11011300	We just went outside and watched it.
11011300	11012300	It was awesome.
11012300	11013300	That's awesome.
11013300	11014300	I was like, oh my gosh, they're right there.
11014300	11016300	And it was a 10-minute show.
11016300	11017300	It was fantastic.
11017300	11018300	Just get the lawn into it.
11018300	11020300	Just get the lawn chairs out and watch your neighbors.
11020300	11022300	That's what we're going to do.
11022300	11023300	We're going to do tomorrow night.
11023300	11027300	We just buy the crummy ones and we just light them up on the street.
11027300	11028300	The kids love it.
11028300	11029300	Maybe we'll see.
11029300	11035300	My niece's birthday is tomorrow, so we're going to go for her party and everything.
11035300	11037300	She's turning one.
11037300	11041300	And so we're going to do that and they'll barbecue and stuff.
11041300	11042300	But I don't know.
11042300	11043300	We'll see.
11043300	11044300	Awesome.
11044300	11047300	And my final thought is I don't have any Fourth of July plans at all.
11047300	11051300	So happy Independence Day, though, for everybody here in the States.
11051300	11057300	And I hope everybody has a happy Canada Day belated to our Canadian friends because that was just a couple days ago.
11057300	11059300	But I hope everybody has a safe holiday.
11059300	11064300	And I'm going to use tomorrow to get some work done and play some games.
11064300	11066300	I think will be a good thing to do.
11066300	11067300	So that's it.
11067300	11069300	That's going to do it for this episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11069300	11070300	Thank you guys for tuning in.
11070300	11073300	We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.
11073300	11075300	Have fun watching those gaming marathons.
