00:00.000 --> 00:18.520
This week, US Dave and Busters in Round 1 locations will be receiving DDR Ace! Fingers

00:18.520 --> 00:21.800
crossed that there's one coming near you! And that's just the tip of the iceberg for

00:21.800 --> 00:26.060
this week's gaming news. This and more starts right now on the show, where every gamer has

00:26.060 --> 00:41.980
a voice.

00:41.980 --> 00:49.940
This July the 3rd of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie.

00:49.940 --> 00:53.360
And joining you live here at the Voice of Geeks Network, where we do tape live every

00:53.360 --> 00:56.980
Sunday night. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

00:56.980 --> 01:02.100
show VOG Network dot com. That's V-O-G Network dot com. We are here based out of Sacramento,

01:02.100 --> 01:06.980
California in Studio N7, talking about the latest and greatest in video games, gaming

01:06.980 --> 01:11.820
culture, the gamer lifestyle. Again, I'm Rob Roberts. Not joining us tonight, unfortunately.

01:11.820 --> 01:16.040
DarkSakura not in studio tonight. She is off. Lots of people doing stuff for the holiday,

01:16.040 --> 01:20.580
obviously with American Independence Day tomorrow. So she had a conflict this week and couldn't

01:20.580 --> 01:27.420
be here. But joining us tonight is Techmaster Loki. Hello, Loki. How are you doing?

01:27.420 --> 01:28.420
Fine.

01:28.420 --> 01:33.100
Okay, Loki is completely distracted. He's just his head is down looking at his phone

01:33.100 --> 01:36.940
while he's going tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. What the hell's going

01:36.940 --> 01:37.940
on over there, Loki?

01:37.940 --> 01:41.540
I'm playing the new tap my Katamari game.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.500
So what is tap my Katamari?

01:43.500 --> 01:49.300
It's the unholy alliance of a Katamari game mixed with a cookie clicker type game.

01:49.300 --> 01:52.420
Yeah, that sounds that sounds bad. I think the only thing that could be worse would be

01:52.420 --> 01:55.860
like a Final Fantasy cookie clicker game. That would be like right up my alley. But

01:55.860 --> 02:00.420
Katamari is pretty, pretty close. It's Yeah, yeah. What do you do you think you're gonna

02:00.420 --> 02:02.180
be able to put that down long enough to read some stories?

02:02.180 --> 02:05.540
Oh, yeah, I don't even need the clicker game. It plays by itself.

02:05.540 --> 02:09.860
So yeah, I just I'm just gonna sit here and kind of kind of make my fingers kind of run

02:09.860 --> 02:15.460
on the screen while I'm reading a story. Oh my god, Loki. All right. Yeah, SSU 100

02:15.460 --> 02:21.340
Matt is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Oh, dear, that is a bad combo. And

02:21.340 --> 02:26.300
fifth dream says I use eight fingers to play the Katamari game. Yes, you can join our live

02:26.300 --> 02:29.740
chat room. Again, we are live on Sunday nights at six Pacific nine Eastern at vog network

02:29.740 --> 02:36.260
and you can join chat live.vognetwork.com. If you want to chat along with the show, stop

02:36.260 --> 02:41.460
me in chat saying tap my Katamari is something you don't say in an international airport

02:41.460 --> 02:47.140
TSA check. Yes, probably probably not something you're gonna want to explain in a sealed off

02:47.140 --> 02:52.480
room. We do have some guests in studio filling in tonight. Since we are down a dark soccer,

02:52.480 --> 02:57.360
we brought some of our longtime friends of the show in to help fill the space tonight.

02:57.360 --> 03:02.940
So say hello over there is Shane from Ranger pride joining us the studio again, two weeks

03:02.940 --> 03:08.580
in a row. Yeah, I don't know why. Yeah. Except he's not really on the show because he keeps

03:08.580 --> 03:13.660
looking over again. We have lots of distractions going on. So no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

03:13.660 --> 03:19.380
no, no, no, no. You're about to say something that's not true. Big surprise. Okay. It is

03:19.380 --> 03:23.180
true. He's watching the summer games done quick, which I know. No, no, no. That's not

03:23.180 --> 03:27.520
what's on my screen. And you're, you're, you're doing that with your eyes and your hand is

03:27.520 --> 03:32.020
moving around and yes, capturing show. Tell me that's a lie. Well, no, cause I haven't

03:32.060 --> 03:37.100
got a shiny for a little bit here. So yes, my hands are playing Pokemon right now trying to

03:37.100 --> 03:42.100
catch a shiny, but no, I am reading dialogue from the classic game of the week for this week. And I

03:42.100 --> 03:47.300
am laughing because of some of these things I forgot and am now remembering. Oh, okay. All

03:47.300 --> 03:51.500
right. But, and so good. As soon as you're done with that, you'll go right back to watching the

03:51.500 --> 03:55.580
summer games done quick. Well, technically there's a little window over here that see,

03:55.580 --> 04:00.620
oh, you're, oh, you got one of those picture in picture, one of those fancy iPads that does the

04:00.620 --> 04:06.460
multiple apps. He's got the fancy one that can do that. So I get, I can't be mad though. The summer

04:06.460 --> 04:10.820
game's done quick and you know, awesome games. They do those things twice a year and it's for

04:10.820 --> 04:14.580
charity and it's everybody loves it. It's just Metroid Prime right now. So I really don't care

04:14.580 --> 04:20.660
that much, but it's also summer games done quick. So I have to watch it anyway. You still have to

04:20.660 --> 04:25.660
watch it a little bit. Of course, of course. And yeah, vidpower in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

04:25.660 --> 04:30.540
says the gaming multitasking of everyone on the show tonight is strong. Yes, it really is. All

04:30.540 --> 04:34.660
though we do have another guest here joining in studio and I got to give him props because I don't

04:34.660 --> 04:39.740
see him. He is, he is ready to go and he has a phone in his hand. You know what's on that phone

04:39.740 --> 04:44.940
is tonight's show roll. Well, he's ready to go. If I double click my home button, I can get right

04:44.940 --> 04:49.500
back to the show. Whatever, whatever. Say hello everybody to Flaco Jones. Hello everybody. Hey,

04:49.500 --> 04:53.460
how you doing? I'm doing great. How are you doing? Good. Good to have you back. Thanks. I like,

04:53.460 --> 04:57.020
it's been a while, but it's like there's always so much TV on Sunday night. Like I can't be on

04:57.140 --> 05:02.060
OR till all my shows are over. They're all over. They're all over. No Walking Dead. No Fear the

05:02.060 --> 05:07.900
Walking Dead. No Game of Thrones. Sunday's boring. I'm glad we're the fourth or fifth priority. Yeah,

05:07.900 --> 05:12.340
Big Brother. See, look, I picked you over Big Brother. Oh, that's so sweet. That's not like

05:12.340 --> 05:17.260
three times a week. I can go without. You can read the live feeds. I can watch After Dark every night

05:17.260 --> 05:21.460
too. And you need to get Davon's Diary Rooms on the CBS website. It's all you need. That's the

05:21.460 --> 05:25.020
only reason to watch the actual show is to see your diary. Which by the way, I will say this,

05:25.020 --> 05:29.140
if you are a fan of that show, um, I don't know if you guys on the show is bad. We've been on a

05:29.140 --> 05:33.380
really schedule on guys on the show, but like expert was sick, like really super sick. So we

05:33.380 --> 05:36.780
had to take a couple of weeks off, but we came back this week and we did a Big Brother themed

05:36.780 --> 05:40.940
episode with our pal. I haven't listened to our pal Ronnie, who was a contestant years ago. So

05:40.940 --> 05:45.380
it was a really fun show. So if you like that show, it was good. Check that out. Oh, that's cool.

05:45.380 --> 05:50.900
Logie doesn't even watch that garbage. I have no idea. I know of Big Brother. I've not watched.

05:50.900 --> 05:54.340
He was a great guest when he was on Hoard House. So yeah. And I tried not to repeat,

05:54.340 --> 05:59.380
I tried to repeat a lot of the same stuff, some of the, but like most of it was kind of new

05:59.380 --> 06:03.420
information. I, the big, I will say this, the biggest shot, I shouldn't ruin this. You should

06:03.420 --> 06:06.620
go listen to it. But I will say the biggest shocking thing that came out of that for me is

06:06.620 --> 06:12.020
that there, the little intros, when they get their keys, totally staged stuff, right? Of course. No,

06:12.020 --> 06:18.220
it's not. What? I don't believe you. I don't believe Ronnie either. That's such a lie. Did

06:18.220 --> 06:22.740
he watch this season? Maybe when he did it. Maybe back when he did it like 20 years ago

06:22.740 --> 06:28.500
when he was on Big Brother. It's like, how, how did you get like a bag of bread that has a key

06:28.500 --> 06:32.340
in it? What do you have a whole camera crew watching them for? The trick is they put keys

06:32.340 --> 06:38.380
in all of them. They're like going, go listen to the guys on the show this week and form your own

06:38.380 --> 06:41.340
opinion. Listen to your own lies. But I got to bring it back to video games. I got to bring it

06:41.340 --> 06:46.140
back to video games. I love that you dressed up for the radio show wearing your Splatoon shirt.

06:46.140 --> 06:53.180
It's Splatoon mashed up with Powerpuff. Oh my God. It is Powerpuff Splatoon. This has to have

06:53.180 --> 06:55.900
come from the internet. Where else do you find this? This is like T Fury, I think. Or yeah,

06:55.900 --> 06:59.580
I think it's T Fury. I don't know. I like that. But yeah, it's from the internet. Of course. Of

06:59.580 --> 07:04.060
course it is. I'm pretty sure because we got Shane like an early birthday present, a Silent Hill shirt

07:04.060 --> 07:06.780
from there too. It's like a Silent Hill, was it Fighting Game? I don't even remember. I want to

07:06.780 --> 07:10.380
say that. Mario Kart. Oh, Mario. It's like Silent Hill Kart. That's right. That's hilarious. One of

07:10.380 --> 07:13.900
those other sites. What is it? Redbubble? Is that the name of it? Yeah, they're a good one. I got

07:13.900 --> 07:19.420
that. It's the Kermit the Frog mashed with Bayonetta. And so I wear that to all. Yeah,

07:19.420 --> 07:23.020
it's Kermit. It's Kermitetta. It's Kermit the Frog mashed with Bayonetta. I can't even imagine

07:23.020 --> 07:26.300
what that looks like. It's fucking amazing. I'm imagining it and you don't want to.

07:27.340 --> 07:31.740
Like I'll go get the shirt in a minute here, but I wear it to all the Ingress events since I play

07:31.740 --> 07:37.420
on Green Team. So we're frogs. So I wear my Kermitetta shirt. And like most people just

07:37.420 --> 07:41.580
kind of like don't even like get it. They're just like, what a weird thing on his shirt. But like

07:41.580 --> 07:47.100
once in a while, somebody will look at it and go, is that Kermit and Bayonetta? And I'm like,

07:47.100 --> 07:51.980
you're cool. Yes, it is. I just got back from a trip to Seattle, you know. Oh, you saw Splatoon

07:51.980 --> 07:56.140
on this shirt. That's the first thing you saw. Well, I was going through TSA and the guy saw

07:57.180 --> 08:03.100
Powerpuff Girls. And he was, you know, very, I don't know what to say, but he was like,

08:03.100 --> 08:08.940
he was like, whoa, I think you're the first man I've ever seen walking through here wearing a

08:08.940 --> 08:14.380
Powerpuff Girls shirt on. It's like, oh, okay. You should have been like, I wore it for my

08:14.380 --> 08:19.900
little girl. It was her one wish today, asshole. I know he just had to be like, he's like, oh,

08:19.900 --> 08:24.540
I wore pink before. I wear pink camo, breast cancer awareness month when I'm in the army.

08:25.100 --> 08:30.940
Of course. Oh my God. Like I want to go to that airport right now because I am wearing my pink

08:30.940 --> 08:37.340
Kim Chi from RuPaul's Drag Race shirt. And it's like, like this is a screaming homosexual t-shirt.

08:37.420 --> 08:40.700
I'm just wearing a purple shirt, man. And it's got Powerpuff Girls on it.

08:41.740 --> 08:45.020
I don't get why the TSA people try to talk to you anyway, cause you don't want to be there.

08:45.020 --> 08:49.980
Cause to be honest though, that shirt looks like it could be a brat shirt. So it's really hard to

08:49.980 --> 08:57.500
say it does look like a brat shirt. I'm just saying, you know, it could be some confusion

08:57.500 --> 09:01.180
there. Yeah. We got to kick out of it though. It's like, really? That guy was that when I went

09:01.180 --> 09:07.180
through the airport recently, I was wearing my Popplio shirt and the chick at the end was like,

09:07.180 --> 09:10.620
Oh, I love Pokemon. I love Bulbasaur. I'm like, thank you. Let me get my shoes and leave.

09:12.620 --> 09:16.940
I did not care to talk to her about that. Like don't come at me with Bulbasaur when I'm wearing

09:16.940 --> 09:20.780
Popplio. I don't care about your Bulbasaur. I can't believe that somebody like tried to

09:20.780 --> 09:26.700
talk to Shane about Pokemon and he just like shot it down when like, I don't like it anymore.

09:26.700 --> 09:32.300
No, it is not Bulbasaur. If she didn't call it Bulbasaur. If she did, I would have smacked her.

09:33.260 --> 09:38.060
Yeah. Okay. But here's, here's the thing. If, if I were to call Shane and be like,

09:38.060 --> 09:41.820
Shane, I'm really upset right now. Cause I had to take Alan to the hospital today. He would be like,

09:41.820 --> 09:46.780
well, did you play Pokemon in the waiting room? That's pretty right. Actually, I would say

09:46.780 --> 09:52.380
something like that. And he'd be like, cause I caught three shinies today. Have you even gotten

09:52.380 --> 09:57.820
a badge yet? And I'd be like, I'm in a moment of personal crisis, but I'm in a moment of personal

09:57.820 --> 10:01.740
crisis because you're not playing Pokemon. Yeah. That's how it is. Exactly. It had to

10:01.740 --> 10:04.460
arrange who's going to go out there and hack my portal for the day.

10:06.780 --> 10:12.780
Kind of get that done until September, until yeah, September. And then, then I'm free.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.860
Then you're free. No way you think you're free, by the way, Loki's referencing Ingress in which

10:16.860 --> 10:24.140
there is an achievement or a badge for how many you have to hack once a day for 360 days to get

10:24.140 --> 10:30.780
a particular badge. But my counter, like, even though I have that badge is almost up to 500.

10:30.780 --> 10:37.180
I keep saying I'm going to get to 500 and then uninstall just in time for Pokemon go.

10:37.980 --> 10:42.460
Yeah, they might, it might time out that way. We'll see. Oh, sure. That'll stop you from playing

10:42.460 --> 10:48.140
both or not. We'll see. We'll see. I already have my strategy for how to play Pokemon go when it

10:48.140 --> 10:53.100
launches. You don't really need to go anywhere. Cause the book might come to you. Well,

10:53.900 --> 10:59.500
keep in mind in the beta, they were feeding people coins. So, and that's the pay currency.

10:59.500 --> 11:04.220
So I figure you're probably going to have to drop 10 or 20 bucks, like just to load up on some of

11:04.220 --> 11:08.700
the items. Like again, if, if you want to, if you want to really be the very best that no one ever

11:08.700 --> 11:13.580
was, of course, they're going to make you pay money. You can buy her fee the very best. Yeah.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.780
But you're not going to be able to buy Pokemon balls on a whim. You're going to have to hack

11:16.780 --> 11:20.380
them. So you're gonna have to find where all the pokey stops are. So I'm going to have to go to

11:20.380 --> 11:25.500
one of the parks where there's a ton of today, Ingress nodes, where there'll be Pokemon go stops

11:25.500 --> 11:29.340
and like, just basically walk around for an hour and just hack, hack, hack.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.540
I just wish they would just stop, you know, working on another game and just maybe,

11:32.540 --> 11:37.020
I don't know, update the portals that they have out right now, because I swear to God, like,

11:37.660 --> 11:41.340
a vast majority of them are just like non-existent anymore. It's like, yeah,

11:41.340 --> 11:45.740
this is for this church, which has been torn down or, Hey, this is for this mural. That's

11:45.740 --> 11:52.140
now painted over. I don't know. In, in general, I have issues with some of the ways Ingress has

11:52.140 --> 11:56.060
been moderated. Like there's, there's a lot of like rampant cheating going on,

11:56.060 --> 11:59.900
which is kind of shitty and kind of ruins it for everybody. And it's like, it's like people

11:59.900 --> 12:02.460
like right now, I don't know how much I should say on there, but there's,

12:02.460 --> 12:06.460
there's a lot of issues. Like multiple accounts will say that like, there's like well-known

12:06.460 --> 12:11.900
people that are carrying more than one account. And it's like, like one or two people with eight

12:11.900 --> 12:15.180
accounts in their back pocket. So they can build whatever portals they want. It's like,

12:15.180 --> 12:20.940
kind of ruins it for everybody else, you know, silly. Anyway. I was going to ask you quickly

12:20.940 --> 12:24.700
about your shirt, Shane, cause you have an escape room shirt on. Oh yeah. Cause I love talking about

12:24.700 --> 12:27.500
the escape room stuff. I know. So I'm trying to think of something we haven't talked about.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.780
You should get a shirt that says, ask me about escape room. Well, why haven't we done one in

12:30.780 --> 12:35.340
SAC yet? I don't understand. Shane's been home for like two weeks and we still have not done,

12:35.340 --> 12:38.780
and this is very unlike Shane. And I think it's only because he's distracted with the

12:38.780 --> 12:41.900
Pokemon shiny collecting thing. I really am distracted by Pokemon. He'll be the only guy

12:41.900 --> 12:46.540
in the escape room with his DS playing Pokemon at the same time. They probably wouldn't let me

12:46.540 --> 12:56.060
play it. Yeah, exactly. No, I don't know why we haven't. I suggested doing it on a whim one time

12:56.060 --> 13:02.220
and then we didn't. And so like whatever, because you suggested doing it on a whim when I couldn't

13:02.220 --> 13:07.580
do it. And I also think it was father's day that day. It was father's day, but escape room is

13:07.580 --> 13:16.300
better than father's. Well, you haven't done an escape room. I have done fatherhood.

13:17.260 --> 13:21.420
You know what we should do Flaco, but we should go to an escape room without Shane

13:22.220 --> 13:26.300
and it would be like the nastiest prank. Yeah, but you know what? You wouldn't win cause I wasn't

13:26.300 --> 13:31.740
there. Yeah. I don't think I'd be good at those. I really don't. I don't, I don't, I don't know.

13:31.740 --> 13:35.340
Do you download any of those phone apps? I never know. Are the escape room? Cause you know,

13:35.340 --> 13:38.220
they, they try to kind of put that in the gaming space for people that enjoy that.

13:38.220 --> 13:41.900
I don't think it would be as fun to be quite honest. I think it's one of those things that

13:42.780 --> 13:48.620
I'll try it. You were talking a lot about like the, the decor of the place does a lot. Like if

13:48.620 --> 13:54.460
you have like bookshelves that actually flip around slides that you slide down, like crazy,

13:54.460 --> 13:58.460
double dare shit in the escape room, big hamster wheel that we had to run around,

13:59.580 --> 14:09.180
slid down like a mouth with teeth. Yeah. Double dare escape room. I could just,

14:09.180 --> 14:14.620
I could just see Shane dragging us all to the super slimy double dare escape room or something.

14:14.620 --> 14:19.100
It was like, yeah, I just, I'm always gaming. I could see you would be able to do a lot,

14:19.740 --> 14:25.500
like possibly in a sense, cooler things because it's not physical and real. But I think there's

14:25.500 --> 14:31.020
something to be said that when we unlocked that bookcase to slide over, that was an amazing moment

14:31.020 --> 14:35.020
in, in playing that escape room. So I just don't think that would translate well to a game.

14:35.820 --> 14:39.020
But I'm not opposed to trying a game when I just, I haven't sought that out because

14:39.020 --> 14:42.220
I'd rather do the real experience. What about a VR escape room?

14:43.500 --> 14:48.300
That could be cool. I would, I would try that. I would probably run into things on accident

14:48.700 --> 14:52.540
and hurt myself, but. Isn't that just going to be like

14:52.540 --> 14:56.460
Resident Evil 7 on VR or some of those types of games? Because aren't those kind of like escape?

14:57.420 --> 15:03.260
The room in what Silent Hill, Silent Hill is gone. It's silent Hills is done. You can't,

15:06.780 --> 15:11.980
like stop wanking on the show because it's not going to happen. Hold on. Now we were just going

15:11.980 --> 15:17.420
to get a persona. We were just talking about a mate and you made for TV silent Hill movie. So

15:17.420 --> 15:22.300
yeah, we were, it's not gone. Yeah. They're still trying to beat. They're trying to reanimate the

15:22.300 --> 15:27.020
core. But again, I want you to, I want you to examine what you just said. It's a silent Hill

15:27.020 --> 15:33.340
made for TV movie. Okay. Made for it's probably not made for TV is made for streaming networks

15:33.340 --> 15:38.380
movie. Like the last made for, you know, who else does, you know, who else does streaming

15:38.380 --> 15:45.340
movies for Netflix is Adam Sandler. Oh, he does. He has quite a lucrative career doing that with

15:45.340 --> 15:50.060
none of which I've watched. I'm like, damn, he's making a lot of movies. Cause you apparently the

15:50.060 --> 15:54.460
whole thing is that you can, you can kind of watch those. You can hate, if you can, you can

15:54.460 --> 15:58.940
have a hate boner and watch those movies without anyone knowing. And you know, that's, that's

15:58.940 --> 16:02.460
basically the thing is that you can watch those movies and nobody will ever know you watch them,

16:02.460 --> 16:06.780
except for the people you share your Netflix account with. They should publish at like

16:06.780 --> 16:11.660
Netflix, the list of people who watch Adam Sandler movies. And Netflix shame. What the hell are you

16:11.660 --> 16:17.420
watching? What was it? The, what was it? The, I kind of can't remember all his stupid movies.

16:17.420 --> 16:22.540
He has, he shouldn't do over. I know that Jack and Jill was the one that I'm talking about.

16:22.540 --> 16:30.060
Like the made for, we all know that the racist Indian one, the race people thought it was like

16:30.060 --> 16:36.780
ridiculous six or something like that. I think that's what it was. Act Def points out Netflix

16:36.780 --> 16:40.940
has a Facebook sharing feature. Remember when no one's going to use, remember when Netflix was

16:40.940 --> 16:45.500
still new and on the three 60, you could do like Netflix party and everybody could actually watch

16:45.500 --> 16:49.580
the same thing together, like through the three 60 and you could kind of like chat about it.

16:49.580 --> 16:53.420
And then Netflix got rid of that for some reason. I mean, and it's not like it's stopping people

16:53.420 --> 16:58.300
from just getting on Skype and doing that. Right. It's cool. We'll just create a new app

16:58.300 --> 17:02.620
that people can come together and just chill while they watch some movies. We'll call it Netflix,

17:02.620 --> 17:08.780
Netflix and chill the app. Love it. All right. We need to get back into some video game talk.

17:08.780 --> 17:13.100
So let's start off tonight's show talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

17:13.100 --> 17:17.580
that we've been playing this week. Loki, we'll start with you tonight. So, uh, let's see this

17:17.580 --> 17:23.740
week. I kind of can't remember which week was what. Um, I did finish playing South Park. I

17:23.740 --> 17:28.940
finished that game and that's is hilarious. Absolutely awesome game. Worth a replay even.

17:28.940 --> 17:36.220
Um, just, it's like watching an episode of the show. It's just that well done. And so definitely

17:36.220 --> 17:40.540
recommended if you haven't tried it out yet, still get it on the steam sale, which is, you know,

17:41.500 --> 17:48.300
I think it's still eight bucks. So definitely check that out. Um, what else? I also played,

17:48.300 --> 17:54.460
um, this stupid Katamari game that I am still tapping on. Um, Ingress, I played a little bit,

17:54.460 --> 17:59.500
uh, Pokemon Go just because there's a couple of days left. So I, you know, tried it a little bit.

17:59.500 --> 18:04.540
They had, I don't know if it was intentional or if they just fucked up the coding because

18:04.540 --> 18:09.100
a lot of that shit was pretty fucked up anyways in the app. But for some reason,

18:09.180 --> 18:14.780
one of the last days of Pokemon Go, they had like, I don't know if it was like no spawn delay or if

18:14.780 --> 18:20.460
they were just spawning the whole day's worth of Pokemon at once. So you'd load into the game and

18:20.460 --> 18:26.220
all of a sudden it's like, Hey, there's 30 Pokemon standing right at my feet. So that was kind of

18:26.220 --> 18:33.260
interesting briefly. So we did that and, um, yeah, that's pretty much it. Oh, and I raised a Ferrari

18:33.260 --> 18:37.340
and a Lamborghini. So that's non gaming, but it was fun. How briefly tell us about that. Cause you

18:37.340 --> 18:42.860
were hyping that on the show last week. Awesome. So it's basically this, um, I don't know. It's

18:42.860 --> 18:48.620
a company. They have like a, like six exotic cars and they do these different, like you can either

18:49.820 --> 18:55.340
rent them and go like on a trip, like you go down, you know, Napa and you're driving the highways

18:55.340 --> 19:00.300
and stuff that, or they have what they call like the autocross challenge thing. So basically it's,

19:00.300 --> 19:09.100
they set up this course in a parking lot at the San Joaquin fairgrounds. So it's a parking lot

19:09.100 --> 19:15.100
and then you drive through the course in one of those cars. So you don't get really fast because

19:15.100 --> 19:21.100
think of it like, um, you go to one of those indoor go-kart tracks. It's like that, you know,

19:21.100 --> 19:25.500
it's a lot of turns and stuff, but you're in a Ferrari instead of, you know, a go-kart. So

19:26.380 --> 19:31.660
it's, you're basically in second gear the entire time, but you still feel the power from those

19:31.660 --> 19:36.060
cars. It's just ridiculous. So I got to do that and it was a lot of fun. I started off with the

19:36.060 --> 19:41.820
Lamborghini and, um, I mean, that was just incredibly fast. And then of course I couldn't

19:41.820 --> 19:47.900
get enough of that. So I also, um, decided to do the Ferrari that they had there as well.

19:47.900 --> 19:53.580
And I actually liked the Ferrari a little bit more because it felt like it kind of kind of

19:53.980 --> 19:58.780
kind of drifted a little bit more. Um, I mean, they were pretty much so low the ground and,

19:59.660 --> 20:03.740
you know, they have the traction control and everything or all wheel drive on the Lamborghini.

20:03.740 --> 20:09.740
So you're not really skidding too much, but you can hear it. I did make a really cheesy music

20:10.540 --> 20:14.540
video thing, you know, kind of showing the footage. Cause I was actually doing Periscope,

20:14.540 --> 20:19.180
um, at least for some of those. In fact, the, when I did the Ferrari, I had the guy who was

20:19.180 --> 20:23.660
the instructor kind of guy holding my phone and Periscoping the whole thing. So that was kind of

20:23.660 --> 20:28.780
cool cause I don't normally do that. And so I kind of cut some stuff from that, but you can hear it.

20:28.780 --> 20:33.100
Like you can hear the tires squealing as you're like turning and stuff, but it was fun. I mean,

20:33.100 --> 20:37.340
I'd totally do it again. It's just incredibly expensive. You know, what's open now that we

20:37.340 --> 20:41.500
need to do is the indoor skydiving place. That would be fun. I would be down with that, but yeah,

20:41.500 --> 20:45.420
that is like, it's something like you're all, you know, racing the car. This would be kind of fun,

20:45.420 --> 20:50.460
but man, you get in that thing. It's just like, you're not ever going to be able to do this

20:50.460 --> 20:55.580
normally. I mean, it's just, these are expensive cars that you'll never be able to buy. Yeah. And

20:55.580 --> 21:01.020
just getting to actually drive them. I mean, that's, it was just awesome. It was really fun.

21:01.020 --> 21:05.900
Uh, SSG100Matt says, uh, in chat over at live.vognetware.com, I kind of want to do this

21:05.900 --> 21:10.380
myself with my dad also. I'll have to look into this. It sounds like great father-son bonding

21:10.380 --> 21:17.500
things. I mean, I don't know how they're in LA and I think I know in Stockton, but I think

21:17.500 --> 21:23.500
they've got some maybe elsewhere in other States, but definitely don't buy it straight from the

21:23.500 --> 21:28.140
website. Cause it's like 200 and some dollars to just do the autocross thing, which is not worth

21:28.140 --> 21:32.700
it, but you can get group on deals. I think my dad, cause he was the one that kind of treated

21:32.700 --> 21:38.620
for it since it was like a father's day gift. He, I think paid 105 and then they offer you,

21:38.620 --> 21:42.300
if you want to drive the second car, you just pay an additional 65 to do it.

21:42.300 --> 21:48.060
So I paid an additional 65 to drive the car. I thought it was worth it. I mean,

21:48.060 --> 21:51.740
especially now he was talking about like going to the indoor, um, go-kart tracks.

21:52.380 --> 21:57.580
They're just as expensive to drive those shitty things. I did do that once I did the indoor and

21:57.580 --> 22:01.260
it was like Mario Kart in real life. Yeah. Those are fun because those things, those suckers like

22:01.260 --> 22:05.580
drift around the corners and stuff. I mean, and I would have loved, they had like different setups

22:05.580 --> 22:10.460
and I think it based, it depends on how busy they are. Cause they had two tracks set up on this one,

22:10.460 --> 22:14.620
but I watched their little commercial thing on YouTube and they have a different track set up

22:14.620 --> 22:18.380
that's a lot bigger and a lot more straightaways. And I would've liked to do that a little bit more

22:18.380 --> 22:24.540
cause you get more speed on that, but I had fun. I mean, it was fun. Just like, it's like Forza,

22:24.540 --> 22:29.100
but you're doing it in real life and it's just totally different. It was a lot of fun.

22:29.660 --> 22:32.700
All right. Well back to video games, I'll talk about my gaming week, which is actually pretty

22:32.780 --> 22:37.580
busy. This, this live streaming thing I've actually been doing, like I kept talking about

22:37.580 --> 22:40.940
in the past. I want to get into doing it more, but as of the past couple of weeks,

22:40.940 --> 22:44.780
I have actually been doing more live streaming. So if you're not following me on Twitch,

22:44.780 --> 22:48.380
please consider following me on Twitch. I'm Rob Roberts on Twitch. And I did some game streaming

22:48.380 --> 22:53.500
this week because I hooked up the Wii U in my office. So I was doing some virtual console. I

22:53.500 --> 22:59.500
did Super Mario Brothers 2. I did Super Mario RPG, which just came out on virtual console this week.

22:59.500 --> 23:04.300
And that was a lot of fun. Um, and then, uh, I was doing like a random Final Fantasy 14 stream.

23:04.300 --> 23:09.420
And I feel like I did something else this week, but what do you use to put your setup

23:09.420 --> 23:14.220
together there? Um, well, they're not paying me to give this shout out and I hope I'm not missing

23:14.220 --> 23:20.140
out on a referral bonus, but it's, uh, it's, if there is a referral bonus, please consider using

23:20.140 --> 23:25.660
my email or ask me on Twitter. Um, but it is a website called game show. Uh, and they were at

23:25.660 --> 23:31.740
Twitch con when Jason, our voiceover guy had me go to Twitch and I got a demo of it. And I liked,

23:32.620 --> 23:37.020
you know, I really like open broadcast source, but I could not for the life of me figure out

23:37.020 --> 23:41.340
how to do a lot of like the overlay stuff, you know, that they show like the followers and all

23:41.340 --> 23:45.420
that stuff. Well, game show has it all built in. Oh, that's cool. And so you build your shot kind

23:45.420 --> 23:49.420
of like you do an open broadcast source, but then you can have different shots in the bottom and you

23:49.420 --> 23:54.620
can mix them. So that's what I have is I have like my game and cam shot, and then I have my game cam

23:54.620 --> 23:59.580
chat follower, all that stuff. So I can kind of switch back and forth. I thought it was pretty

23:59.580 --> 24:04.700
cool. And you can assign it with hotkeys too, but I use, I still use my mouse to do all that. So,

24:05.260 --> 24:08.540
um, yeah, I mean, it can kind of be distracting. It was, you're kind of like trying to play your

24:08.540 --> 24:13.020
game. You're also keeping one eye on chat. So it's, it's tricky, but, um, yeah, that's,

24:13.020 --> 24:17.020
so that's my shout out to them. Cause that was the software that kind of, I will say though,

24:17.020 --> 24:22.620
it does have some drawbacks because like in order to change the game that I'm pushing to Twitch,

24:22.860 --> 24:27.820
like a couple of weeks ago, I did a Overwatch stream, but it was labeled final fantasy 14.

24:27.820 --> 24:33.580
Well, that's because I just used my shot construction from Final Fantasy 14, but just

24:33.580 --> 24:38.780
changed the window to Overwatch to save like a new project. Yeah. Yeah. You have to like save it.

24:38.780 --> 24:44.300
You have to edit the file as a text file to go in and change the setting for what game it's telling

24:44.300 --> 24:49.580
Twitch you're playing into the right game. So there are some weird quirks that they still

24:49.580 --> 24:54.060
need to work out. The PS4 never gets that right anyway though. Yeah, that's always one stream

24:54.060 --> 24:59.340
behind. It's always whatever you last ran. Right. Yeah. Even if you change it, it will still show.

24:59.340 --> 25:04.060
What I have to do is log into Twitch on a computer and then tell it right then what game I'm going

25:04.060 --> 25:07.900
to. Oh yeah. That's what I always do. I didn't know that that's the way, but it's annoying

25:07.900 --> 25:12.380
because my computer sucks. So I don't want to turn it on and wait like 10 minutes to

25:12.380 --> 25:17.820
get it to go. Cause I have my computer's like seven years old or something. Yeah. And Bobby

25:17.820 --> 25:23.900
says it also used your camera mic that one time. That was kind of my bad because, um, again, when

25:23.900 --> 25:29.740
I set up the shot originally, I was playing around with the camera mics that you guys could hear Alan

25:29.740 --> 25:32.780
in the background. Cause you'll notice when I stream, you can't really hear him, but I thought

25:32.780 --> 25:38.700
the camera mic would pick him up, but it sounded like crap. But for some reason I copied that into

25:38.700 --> 25:42.380
what I ended up really using. And then I went back to my Final Fantasy 14 shot and it was,

25:42.380 --> 25:46.700
wasn't fixed, blah, blah, blah. But yeah, the camera mic thing was awful, but that was kind

25:46.700 --> 25:51.580
of my fault and not the programs. Um, okay. So yeah, I've been doing more live streaming. So

25:51.580 --> 25:55.020
that was, that was cool. But I've also been playing other games too. I went back to round

25:55.020 --> 26:00.380
one yesterday, uh, over in San Jose. And so I got to play some music games. Um, and you're here,

26:00.380 --> 26:05.740
you guys go, some of you guys that, uh, have been sad that I have fallen out of love in many ways

26:05.740 --> 26:09.500
with music games. I don't follow them as much as I used to in the early days of OLR, but obviously

26:09.500 --> 26:12.700
I've been getting back into it. Thanks more and more to round one. I think you guys will get a

26:12.700 --> 26:17.580
kick out of this. I bought an EMUs card, so I actually have an EMUs. Yeah. And you played it

26:17.580 --> 26:22.460
on 2DX and what songs did you play on 2DX? Old songs. So you're still out of it. Well,

26:22.460 --> 26:27.420
hold on though, because I got like a bonus thing at the end that was like, what was it called?

26:27.980 --> 26:30.860
The music game fans are going to laugh at me because I don't follow this stuff as much as

26:30.860 --> 26:38.380
I used to. It was something like, um, it was like a train, like, like a bonus train stage

26:38.380 --> 26:43.580
came up at the end and I played that and it was one of the new songs because I was like,

26:43.580 --> 26:47.180
Ooh, what's this special thing that I'm sure if you had your choice, you would just be like,

26:47.180 --> 26:51.820
I'm going to go play spooky or something. They took spooky out of the game. I don't know what

26:51.820 --> 26:56.140
the old songs that they have anymore because they're old and nobody plays whatever, whatever.

26:56.140 --> 27:00.940
Um, so yeah, I was playing that musica and, uh, you know, just, just some random stuff that at

27:00.940 --> 27:06.300
round one. So, um, I'm sure Shane didn't go yesterday because he was doing other stuff,

27:06.300 --> 27:10.300
but, um, I'm sure, well, I still have like 20 bucks worth of credits left on my card,

27:10.300 --> 27:13.580
so we're going to have to go back so I can spend that $20. Right.

27:14.300 --> 27:20.540
Oh, you know what? I just decided I'm going to go there on August 15th.

27:21.260 --> 27:24.300
Why that particular day? Am I out of town that day or something? And I'm just not remembering

27:24.300 --> 27:28.620
in the moment. No, but I will be coming back from Power Morphicon and I have to make a stop

27:28.620 --> 27:34.380
in San Jose anyway. Okay. And it sounds like that stop is not going to be extended to round one.

27:34.380 --> 27:37.900
Okay. That works, I guess. So you can meet me down there.

27:37.900 --> 27:42.940
Maybe. I don't, I have, I have to look at my calendar, see if I'm busy that weekend.

27:42.940 --> 27:47.420
It's not a weekend. Oh, well then that's going to make it really hard to get over there.

27:47.420 --> 27:53.740
It's like a Tuesday. Yeah. It's about that. Anyway. Um, and then, uh, on the mobile,

27:53.740 --> 27:56.780
I want to make sure I mentioned this game as well because there's a new free to play.

27:56.780 --> 28:00.540
You know, um, Loki was talking about the Katamari thing. He's still playing at the moment by the

28:00.540 --> 28:06.380
way. Uh, and I checked out a new free to play game called Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, which

28:06.380 --> 28:10.300
just came out on mobile. Um, I think this past week in the US. You have to try that too.

28:11.020 --> 28:15.660
Yeah. It's, um, it's another fine. It's, it's different than record keeper though. Record keeper

28:15.660 --> 28:19.340
keeper is I think a little bit more of the traditional Final Fantasy kind of looking thing.

28:19.340 --> 28:26.540
This one has like, it looks like the traditional battles, but you, you just tap the, um, units and

28:27.020 --> 28:31.500
they go attack. So it almost sounds like that horrible active time battle game, but it's,

28:31.500 --> 28:35.260
it's actually nothing like that. I hated that active time battle game. And I really liked this

28:35.260 --> 28:40.220
one. Um, because not only like you can hold your finger down instead of just tapping and you can

28:40.220 --> 28:47.180
swipe to the right to use magic limit breaks, espers that you fuse with the units and all that

28:47.180 --> 28:52.300
stuff. So it has a lot of that like traditional Final Fantasy six stuff, but it is a free to play

28:52.300 --> 28:57.980
games. There's a lot of grindy stuff in it. Cause they want you to spend the currency that they

28:57.980 --> 29:02.540
give you a little taste of for free, but you know, to, to get all the good stuff, you have to use

29:02.540 --> 29:08.060
that currency, but I'm still enjoying it. And I don't, I don't play any huge marathon sessions

29:08.060 --> 29:12.220
and I get enough bonus energy from completing quests and stuff that it hasn't really been a

29:12.220 --> 29:18.940
problem for me yet. So, um, yeah, I'm enjoying the Brave Exvius. That's for sure. Um, I'm getting

29:18.940 --> 29:22.940
asked a question about my gaming week and chat over at live.vog network.com. Vid power says,

29:22.940 --> 29:29.260
I assume it's beat media 2d X 23 copula at round one. Yes it is. Yeah, it is. I could, again,

29:29.260 --> 29:32.940
sound Voltex was busy the entire time. I couldn't get on that one. That's like the most popular,

29:32.940 --> 29:37.020
but wanting you to play it last time either because it was really fun all the time. It was

29:37.020 --> 29:41.740
pretty fun. Um, let's see. And then Kaijuto talking about the, uh, PlayStation four streaming

29:41.740 --> 29:47.340
says, once you switch a game on PlayStation four, you have to reset up the broadcast. At that point,

29:47.340 --> 29:51.260
you change the name to what you're currently playing. That doesn't work.

29:52.540 --> 29:56.380
Uh, I don't, I don't know. I haven't streamed. Does he mean like start it and then stop it and

29:56.380 --> 30:00.140
then start it again? Cause I guess that could work. Cause I would think that would technically

30:00.140 --> 30:04.940
work, but that seems really ridiculous. I feel like I've tried that before. It didn't work,

30:04.940 --> 30:09.660
but I don't know. Yeah. I I've just, I always fill in the thing. And then when I go to look

30:09.660 --> 30:14.060
at my stream efforts of an archive, it's the previous game I played. This is I've always

30:14.060 --> 30:17.900
done what you did, but the like having it on the computer and updating it there.

30:17.900 --> 30:21.660
But the reason why I did that is so that I could have the chat room up on the computer in case

30:21.660 --> 30:26.460
somebody had to be kicked or banned from chat. I can't do that from PlayStation four, but I could

30:26.460 --> 30:31.020
excuse my, I could excuse myself to go to the restroom, boot the person from chat and then

30:31.020 --> 30:36.140
come back. Yeah. So there's always that, but that's why I always set it up that way. So,

30:36.140 --> 30:39.660
all right. That's pretty much it for my email. We have a, Oh no, I need to mention this one more,

30:39.740 --> 30:44.380
one more because, um, uh, Loki last week got me some awesome birthday presents. And one of

30:44.380 --> 30:49.180
the games he got me was grand theft auto five. I did play grand theft auto five today, and I beat

30:49.180 --> 30:53.260
the prologue part of the game, which is the little, like, you know, uh, escape sequence

30:53.260 --> 30:57.900
in the beginning. And then you race some cars and, and, uh, yeah, I played through that. Um,

30:57.900 --> 31:01.420
I would have played more of it, but when I first went to go play at Thursday night,

31:01.980 --> 31:06.700
it had to install and it was very, very slow. And then I had to download a patch. So it was like

31:06.700 --> 31:12.620
at least 10 gigs, if not more. So I was just like, all right, I guess I'm not playing tonight.

31:12.620 --> 31:16.220
I'm sure when I go back to play that, I'm going to have to do that as well. Well, not the install,

31:16.220 --> 31:22.300
but the patching, cause they release a ton of content on the line. So my advice to y'all,

31:22.300 --> 31:27.180
if you're gonna play grand theft auto five, start the night before. So it can update everything and

31:27.180 --> 31:32.300
then come back the next day. Yeah. And the same thing happened. Like, Oh, I can't play for like

31:32.300 --> 31:37.020
hours. Oh yeah. That's. And when you start the game, that's a really funny way to just,

31:37.020 --> 31:40.940
it's not even like the, the, the whole PlayStation network installing in while you could do other

31:40.940 --> 31:45.260
things. It's, I started the game and then it had like some kind of install on a loading screen

31:45.260 --> 31:50.700
forever. A lot of PS four games are like file four. I felt was the same way. Dragon age

31:50.700 --> 31:55.820
Inquisition, I think did that. They do that because they're streaming the way they do it

31:55.820 --> 32:00.220
so fast as they put part of the game on the hard drive. Part of it stays on the desk and they

32:00.220 --> 32:06.300
stream it from both. So it's reading off the hard drive and the Blu-ray at the same time. So they,

32:06.300 --> 32:10.380
they're able to, you know, stream faster that way. At least that's what they need to do with

32:10.380 --> 32:15.660
the older consoles. Not sure if that's necessary, the new ones, but that's, I know at least the only

32:15.660 --> 32:20.860
game that I've had to do that with. So that's an interesting way to fuck over the red box people

32:21.420 --> 32:25.260
is to like make the game install take all night. So now that the game's installed,

32:25.260 --> 32:30.620
got to take it back. Sucka. Anyway. Uh, that's about it for my gaming week. So we'll go over to,

32:30.620 --> 32:34.380
uh, Flaco Jones. How was your gaming week? What did you play? It was pretty good. I played, uh,

32:34.380 --> 32:38.460
I played Splatoon because I hadn't logged on since the new weapon. I don't know when the new weapons

32:38.460 --> 32:42.780
came out. They came out a couple of weeks ago or whatever, but the last round of weapons came out.

32:43.340 --> 32:48.940
So I tried each one of them out. It was pretty cool. Uh, I wasn't a big fan of any of the new

32:48.940 --> 32:55.900
weapons, maybe the new and zap, but it's tough to learn new combinations, especially when you're

32:55.900 --> 33:02.140
used to the old ones. So I, I, I, I give them some, another chance or two. So, and then I played

33:02.140 --> 33:09.580
a lot of Hearthstone on my phone and Marvel puzzle quests on my phone and Overwatch tons and tons of

33:09.580 --> 33:14.060
Overwatch because I didn't even mention Overwatch, but yeah, I've been playing that too. Did you play

33:14.060 --> 33:19.100
the new, uh, competitive mode? No, I don't play that much Overwatch. I'm not ranked 25. You're

33:19.100 --> 33:25.900
not 25. So I was 24 and three quarters. So I got on and one night and I did, I only needed to win

33:25.900 --> 33:32.140
like a couple more games and I got up to 25. So then I did the, I think this was Friday night.

33:33.420 --> 33:38.060
It was the main cause it wasn't working the next day. So yeah, Friday night I did the placement

33:38.060 --> 33:44.300
deal. So you have to play 10 games in the new competitive mode format. And after that,

33:44.300 --> 33:49.100
they give you, based on, I guess your win and loss ratio, I guess it's always really based on,

33:49.100 --> 33:56.220
you get a, I figured what it's called like a rating. So I did terribly, I lost my first game,

33:56.220 --> 34:01.500
then I won my second while I was playing with extra for, and then I lost like, I want to say

34:01.500 --> 34:09.580
the next six in a row or maybe five in a row. And then I won three of my last four to get to

34:09.580 --> 34:15.580
a semi-respectable four wins out of 10. So I got a 39, which I was actually fine with. It was like,

34:15.580 --> 34:19.180
I was like, you know, it sucks to lose since I actually lost a couple of them really close,

34:19.180 --> 34:28.060
like very near wins. And then I, uh, I, um, got on there and I got a 39, but I was like, you know,

34:28.060 --> 34:32.860
it's not too bad because I want, I'd rather be up against weaker competition anywhere,

34:32.860 --> 34:36.460
but it's not weaker. It's probably more of my, it seems to make sense. That's probably the people

34:36.460 --> 34:41.020
that should be up against. I will be that loser that gets zero wins out of 10 in the placement

34:41.020 --> 34:44.780
and I will fucking rage and throw my keyboard against the wall. But then you don't have to

34:44.780 --> 34:49.020
play against this hardcore people. I guess that's the bonus. That's, that's the bright side I took.

34:49.020 --> 34:52.380
I even was like, man, I kind of wish I'd won three. Like we did one of those, you know,

34:52.380 --> 34:56.060
those ones where it's like 50, 50, I call it 50, 50. I don't know what it's called, but it's like,

34:56.060 --> 35:00.700
you have to have the percentage go to a hundred first for the other side. We won the first round

35:00.700 --> 35:05.500
of that and it's best out of five as opposed to best out of three, what it is in quick play.

35:05.500 --> 35:11.740
And then the other team, three people just dropped or four people dropped. So then it was the rest

35:11.740 --> 35:16.780
of our team, six people against two and they still make you play the whole thing out. I felt so bad

35:16.780 --> 35:22.620
for those two people. I've heard that the really toxic, gross part of the community is coming out

35:22.620 --> 35:29.020
in that competitive match. I wouldn't know, but, but blizzard has also said, if you drop too many

35:29.020 --> 35:32.940
matches, you're going to get banned from the competitive mode. Yeah. Blizzard said they're

35:32.940 --> 35:36.620
watching it. And if you drop too many matches, you, you get kicked out of competitive mode and

35:36.620 --> 35:41.660
they'll get the rewards. Wow. So yeah, we basically just two poor guys, but they stuck through it.

35:41.660 --> 35:46.700
I felt bad for them. Like, should they, so they get a loss then on their placement, right? That's

35:46.700 --> 35:51.820
just feels so unfair. Yeah. Cause they had no chance that he was only one loss when, um,

35:51.820 --> 35:57.740
when I play Overwatch, I'm like that GIF of Ron Swanson with the headphones on just kind of

35:58.460 --> 36:04.540
bobbing back and forth because I just don't ever turn on my voice chat. I ignore everything in

36:04.540 --> 36:09.340
party chat. I'm like, can't hear you. I don't, I don't give a fuck what any of you have to say.

36:09.340 --> 36:13.420
That lets me mute it. So they can't hear me, but I turn it on, but I've never heard anyone. I have

36:13.420 --> 36:17.980
team chat auto join. I've never heard a single soul on the way to say like four people in team

36:18.060 --> 36:24.620
chat. I suppose it's unfortunate because there's probably people that actually want to help and

36:24.620 --> 36:28.780
like help people do better. Maybe that's why I leave it open just in case somebody actually

36:28.780 --> 36:32.220
has something constructive to say that I'll, I would chime in, but I've never had to. Yeah.

36:32.220 --> 36:36.060
That's why I would get zero out of 10 placement, but it's like, I'm not going to put up with the

36:36.060 --> 36:40.620
toxic garbage. Anyway. Um, Alan walked into studio and I know Alan's been playing a crap ton of

36:40.620 --> 36:44.860
Overwatch as well. So you, you have something to say on this clearly. Hello. Hi. How are you doing?

36:44.860 --> 36:50.380
Um, yeah. So for the 10 evaluation rounds, yeah. If you drop out of those, cause a lot of people

36:50.380 --> 36:54.300
want to game the system and get as many wins as possible. Yeah. If you drop out of those,

36:54.300 --> 36:58.860
then you can possibly be banned from the season altogether. But once you do the 10 evaluation

36:58.860 --> 37:04.380
rounds and you are in the actual season competitive mode with everyone that has their rank,

37:04.380 --> 37:09.820
if you drop, and I have a complaint about this in a minute, if you drop your other teammates will

37:09.820 --> 37:15.260
be like, you lost a person and they haven't signed back on. If you wait 90 seconds, you can all leave

37:15.260 --> 37:20.140
this round without a penalty. So if someone drops. Oh, so that's why everybody else left.

37:20.140 --> 37:27.900
Yeah. So it kind of, yeah. Okay. So there'll be a notice that says like, cause also I've disconnected

37:28.540 --> 37:33.020
not on purpose, just because lag spike or internet went down and I'm not sure if this is working as

37:33.020 --> 37:39.180
intended, but I was able to reload the Blizzard client, get back into the game, click play, or

37:39.180 --> 37:43.340
actually put me right back into the match. So I was in, but because I disconnected and was out

37:43.340 --> 37:48.060
for a minute, even though we won, it counted as a loss to me personally. And my rank went down by

37:48.060 --> 37:55.580
one. Oh, wow. And that's awful. And actually, and cause you know, in chat is saying if they ban

37:55.580 --> 37:59.420
people, they better refund their money too. Well, I don't think people that are getting banned are

37:59.420 --> 38:04.460
getting banned for the entire game, just from the season, just from the, the rank play or whatever.

38:04.540 --> 38:07.580
Yeah. You can still do play the normal game. You can do quick play. You can do. Yeah.

38:08.220 --> 38:12.940
Um, but you, it is possible to get banned from normal play too, but you have to be one of those

38:12.940 --> 38:17.660
like really toxic assholes to get that happen. Um, and then I got four out of 10 for my evaluation

38:17.660 --> 38:22.140
rounds. Yay. Uh, what, what did you get for it? Yeah. What was it? What would the number they

38:22.140 --> 38:26.300
gave you? 46 or 47. Well, how does that part work? Cause I was like, shouldn't I just be a

38:26.300 --> 38:30.540
40? I was a 39. That's like, what did they, how did they decide I was a 39 and not a 40?

38:30.540 --> 38:36.220
I think it goes by how many like, cause a lot of, a lot of the escort, the vehicle ones are escort,

38:36.220 --> 38:41.420
the payload. There are checkpoints. So if you get all five checkpoints, that's more points.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.860
All right. That makes more sense. So yeah. Oh, so I probably got a really good boost from that one

38:44.860 --> 38:49.660
wherever he left. Cause we won three to nothing. Two or three of my losses ended in sudden death

38:49.660 --> 38:55.100
where it was tied. And then we lost. It was so fun. I should be like seven to 10, but yeah, no.

38:55.900 --> 39:02.220
Um, yeah, so I was given a 47 rank, but because of disconnects and losses,

39:02.220 --> 39:09.180
I'm now at like 44. So I'm going down, down, down. But yeah, if you get to level 25,

39:09.180 --> 39:11.900
you can do your 10 evaluation matches. I don't know if I can help you though.

39:12.540 --> 39:16.540
Yeah, probably. You probably can't do the evals with me. It's fine. I just need to suck it up

39:16.540 --> 39:21.100
and play more Overwatch. It was kind of cool. Like I sit up till almost two in the morning

39:21.100 --> 39:24.220
at like one 30 in the morning, I think just playing that. Cause it's like, I just want

39:24.220 --> 39:27.100
to finish it. I know I'm doing terribly, especially when I was on the bad streak,

39:27.100 --> 39:32.140
but you know, I ended well, so it was fun. I just want to be that guy that gets zero of 10.

39:32.140 --> 39:37.340
The competitive matches are actually a lot longer because yes, you do a full match. And then the

39:37.340 --> 39:40.940
other than it's flipped where if you're escorting the payload and you're on defense, then you're on

39:40.940 --> 39:47.420
attack. And um, though actually they can be shorter. Yeah. Cause if you don't meet the

39:47.420 --> 39:51.260
criteria that the other team met, it just ends. It does. It's like, there's no point now. Yeah.

39:51.260 --> 39:59.260
Like, um, we got our payload in like with like three minutes to spare. So the other team had

39:59.260 --> 40:04.540
to do it in that time or less. So their timer was adjusted to buy what our score was. So they

40:04.540 --> 40:09.020
had to basically do it better than we did. So yeah, it adjusts. Um, or you only, we only had

40:09.020 --> 40:12.140
to make it to the second checkpoint on one. You didn't have to make it all the way to the end of

40:12.140 --> 40:15.500
the map. You just get, you just had to beat the other team and then you, then it's over.

40:16.300 --> 40:19.580
But yeah, otherwise it's like, if it's like you said that that contributes to your rating,

40:19.660 --> 40:23.820
wouldn't that hurt your rating then you couldn't get the max points. Like say if you went first,

40:23.820 --> 40:29.580
you can go down anywhere from a half to a whole point. Like I've gone down three quarters of a

40:29.580 --> 40:33.740
point before. Okay. So yeah, I still haven't played since doing my placement actually,

40:33.740 --> 40:37.340
but cause I've been busy. Yeah. So they're really long cause it could be upwards of three

40:37.340 --> 40:42.220
whole matches. Yeah. It's an investment. It makes you do best of five instead of best of three,

40:42.220 --> 40:46.780
which what it is on quick play. Yeah. So they changed that too. So that's all Overwatch,

40:47.180 --> 40:50.140
Overwatch. It's what a lot of people are playing right now. So

40:50.780 --> 40:54.780
I've had a blast. You guys have more experience with it than me. Although I feel like I've been

40:54.780 --> 40:59.900
playing enough, you know, but I thought I was so surprised. Like I feel like I've been playing

40:59.900 --> 41:05.420
a lot and then I log out. I'm like, I'm not 25. Okay. My name is Splatoon. Splatoon. You'll

41:05.420 --> 41:09.420
need to get to 10 to play ranked mode. I don't know. I don't think time comparison wise. I

41:09.420 --> 41:12.700
don't know if it's similar or not. I think, I think it's a lot faster to get a 10 in Splatoon

41:13.020 --> 41:17.340
25 in Overwatch. But I agree with that. Anything else for your gaming week?

41:17.340 --> 41:20.060
I think that's pretty much it. All right. Let's go to Shane. Shane, how was your gaming week?

41:20.060 --> 41:26.060
What have you been playing? I played Pokemon. That's literally it. Um, I know I did play

41:26.060 --> 41:29.420
the Final Fantasy game on mobile, but I've already uninstalled it. I don't like it.

41:30.060 --> 41:37.420
Not a fan. It's not very fun to me. So Pokemon. How's your, uh, shiny decks going?

41:37.420 --> 41:45.260
55 is my current total now. Yeah, but it's not really when there's 720. Oh my gosh. Which you

41:45.260 --> 41:50.060
can't even get all shiny, but have you caught any shinies during the show tonight? No, not yet.

41:50.060 --> 42:00.700
What one are you working on now? Uh, Ivy soar and, uh, pan Sage and, uh, Quilladon. Those are

42:00.700 --> 42:03.660
the three I'm looking at at the moment. I thought you got one of those last night.

42:03.820 --> 42:10.860
Yeah, I got pan Sage, but I evolved him. So I need to get him again. Oh, got it. Yeah. So

42:12.060 --> 42:19.260
just those lots. You looking forward to Pokemon world? Uh, the worlds. Yeah. I'm so excited for

42:19.260 --> 42:25.340
that. They had the, um, cause it's not in the show at all. Uh, they had the American and Australian

42:25.340 --> 42:31.420
and I believe Hong Kong nationals this weekend. So I was watching, I wasn't watching Hong Kong

42:31.420 --> 42:37.500
cause I don't think there was a stream of it. Um, but American and Australian were both on Twitch

42:37.500 --> 42:41.260
and I watched that and it was a lot of fun. Yeah. Actually vid power and chat over at

42:41.260 --> 42:45.580
live.fognetwork.com says, uh, Pokemon national championships is this weekend. Yeah. I saw some

42:45.580 --> 42:52.300
of the trading card, um, which is, is still fun to watch. I play a little bit on my iPad sometimes.

42:52.300 --> 42:57.740
I didn't watch any of the Pokken. Um, even though that got streamed and I watched a lot of the

42:58.380 --> 43:03.740
actual video game and that was like the best. I cannot wait to watch it in person.

43:04.860 --> 43:09.980
So much fun. All right. Well, uh, let's get to tonight's gaming news. Uh, just some quick

43:09.980 --> 43:14.700
housekeeping. Um, remember to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio.

43:14.700 --> 43:19.100
We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. Um, and as far as our schedule goes,

43:19.100 --> 43:25.260
uh, the next show we will have off for sure is labor day weekend. Um, as I will be at dragon con,

43:25.260 --> 43:29.100
which that, that date is sneaking up sooner rather than later. I got to get my flights

43:29.100 --> 43:35.980
booked this week. Cause uh, yeah. Wow. I can't believe it's the end of next month or no, I guess,

43:35.980 --> 43:39.740
I guess the way the dates fall this year, it's actually the beginning of September with the labor

43:39.740 --> 43:44.140
day kind of got close enough. Yeah, but close enough. Close enough. I've started thinking about

43:44.140 --> 43:48.780
what cosplay I want to do, but I saw my pal Victoria. I haven't seen in like a year and I

43:48.780 --> 43:52.140
feel like she came on this show. Was it, she was on guys on the show. She did the Disneyland

43:52.140 --> 43:56.220
episode of guys on the show. Um, and she does like a lot of super cosplay stuff. She did a

43:56.220 --> 44:00.540
game of thrones character yesterday at Rocky, uh, cause they were doing like a nerd theme.

44:00.540 --> 44:06.620
Uh, so she's, uh, she did, uh, who's the one that shame, shame. Oh, I don't know the nun.

44:06.620 --> 44:11.260
I don't know her name. No, not, not the nun. She was Cersei. Cersei. That's okay. You see,

44:11.260 --> 44:15.260
look, I have a show Sunday nights. I don't get to watch the other one, but you got close. I got

44:15.260 --> 44:21.420
close. I described it. Well, because I know at the very, at the beginning she was dressed and

44:21.420 --> 44:25.180
she was sipping from a wine glass, which I guess is like a big thing. That's all she ever does.

44:25.180 --> 44:30.940
Okay. So she was doing that. And then at the end, apparently she came out and she was not wearing

44:30.940 --> 44:36.060
a lot of clothes and the whole audience was throwing popcorn at her going shame, shame. Yeah.

44:36.060 --> 44:40.220
And that was like the joke. So anyway, um, how do we get on that? Oh yes. Because she said she

44:40.220 --> 44:44.940
would help me do a cosplay, whatever I want to do for dragon con this year. But I'm not,

44:44.940 --> 44:48.300
I'm not sure. Like I could do my joker again, even though the belt broke. So I have to get that

44:48.300 --> 44:51.820
fixed. But then I'm like, well, I kind of want to do something else, but I also really don't

44:51.820 --> 44:57.020
want to shave my beard. So kind of limits what I can do. I don't know. We'll see. Does it,

44:58.140 --> 45:07.020
you could be a Pokemon. I'm going to be a Pokemon. Oh my gosh. Can I really pick? Yes. Pick. Yeah.

45:07.020 --> 45:12.700
What Pokemon? Let me go look, which one I want you to be. Do I get to pick which one I want him

45:12.700 --> 45:20.220
to be all like in your memory? No. Yeah. I have a Pokemon. Cause the one, the one I would like

45:20.220 --> 45:27.100
you to be is goth to tell. I think that would be hilarious. I'll show you in a minute. I'll search.

45:27.100 --> 45:34.700
Um, or you could be, Oh, it'd be hilarious. Like all I'm just trying to think about is,

45:34.700 --> 45:43.820
Oh, you could be, um, a Florges also. So basically I'm picking the female looking one.

45:45.100 --> 45:50.940
Whatever. I, and you know what, for the right, actually, that's not a horrible outfit.

45:51.820 --> 45:59.340
Oh my God. For, for the right, for the right costume, I'll consider shaving my beard.

45:59.340 --> 46:02.780
No, you don't have to shave your beard. You just paint over it. You just cover it. Just cover my

46:02.780 --> 46:08.460
beard. I'm going to find the mustache. And you get to pick which color flower petals for this one.

46:08.460 --> 46:13.100
Goodie. I like how, I like how he's already saying it. Like it's a sure thing. Like what

46:13.100 --> 46:19.420
was the one you played in, in a poke and tournament? Um, it's a Fennekin's evolved form.

46:19.420 --> 46:24.460
Breaks in. Yeah. Breaks you in. Isn't that like a ginger? It's a Fox. I don't know. Fuck off.

46:25.740 --> 46:30.700
Here's the one you could be. Oh, you've shown me that one. That's just a flower.

46:31.420 --> 46:37.820
It's like a drag queen flower. Look, it's got like all these flowery.

46:37.820 --> 46:41.580
Does it even have a face? What is that? It's faces right there. Actually,

46:41.580 --> 46:45.900
I don't understand. You know what? Dark Tetsuya makes an awesome nerd point in our chat room at

46:45.900 --> 46:52.380
live.voggenower.com saying, isn't that what the guy that played Joker in Batman 66 did? He didn't

46:52.380 --> 46:57.100
shave his mustache. Yes. Cesar Romero who played Joker in the old sixties, Batman. He, he never

46:57.100 --> 47:00.780
shaved. That's why his face kind of looked funny. He would not shave his mustache for the role.

47:00.780 --> 47:06.460
They painted over it in the white paint because the older cameras, they didn't really catch it,

47:06.460 --> 47:10.300
but since they have to remaster Batman, like if you go back and watch the Batman 66 movie,

47:10.300 --> 47:15.100
like he's really bad. I have breaking news. What happened? What I have a better Pokemon for you to

47:15.100 --> 47:23.980
do. I hate it when shame breaks. It's not, it's never legitimate. Not going to dress up as yes.

47:23.980 --> 47:29.100
What is that? One is like the old school one that looks like the drag queen basically. Well,

47:29.100 --> 47:35.980
like all the ones I'm picking for your drag queen. I might as well do Mr. Mime. No,

47:35.980 --> 47:40.060
that's not drag. I'll just, I'm just going to wear a pink Snuggie and say I'm a ditto.

47:40.060 --> 47:45.740
That's that'll be it. All right. Stupid. Yeah. Just like your ideas. Not as stupid as being jinx.

47:46.540 --> 47:55.180
All right. Look, I don't even, I think you would do a very good job. I would have to

47:55.180 --> 48:01.020
Orko enjoy. I would have to paint my entire body purple. You know, just your hands and your face.

48:01.020 --> 48:05.100
Oh, well that's all. And, but not your lips. That's some lipstick you could wear. And then

48:05.100 --> 48:10.700
you get a blonde wig and then like the, um, you could just be a Pokemon trainer, get a blow up

48:10.700 --> 48:18.860
doll, dress it up like that. Okay. Now here's the thing. And I could do this. And then we're

48:18.860 --> 48:26.380
getting into gaming news. We're leaving this. I actually, years ago, one Halloween, I dressed as

48:26.380 --> 48:32.300
Ash Ketchum because I have a Pokemon that's like life size, a little Pikachu. And like,

48:32.300 --> 48:38.220
you can kind of put your arm through the tail and it can sit on your shoulder. So I actually did

48:38.220 --> 48:43.660
that one year. So I could do the Ash Ketchum again, except this is like Ash Ketchum pushing 40.

48:45.340 --> 48:50.700
I haven't caught them all yet. This is not a very good life plan.

48:53.020 --> 48:55.660
Which if you think about it with as old as Pokemon is

48:56.380 --> 49:00.380
Ash Ketchum ought to be pushing 40 now. So it's kind of appropriate.

49:01.180 --> 49:04.620
All right. Very best that I could be in accounting.

49:04.620 --> 49:08.700
That was the very best. And then I took an arrow to the knee.

49:08.700 --> 49:11.100
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, found a better one.

49:11.100 --> 49:15.180
Then you got drafted into the war. All right. I'm so done with this topic. We

49:15.180 --> 49:19.100
need to get back into some gaming news. This is all about games right now.

49:19.100 --> 49:23.820
It's it's horrible. I would have unsubscribed hours ago. This is pretty awesome. All right.

49:23.820 --> 49:31.420
Loki get his can be a lot bunny. It's basically, no, it's a bunny. It's like a Playboy bunny.

49:31.420 --> 49:36.220
I a Playboy. Oh my God. Gaming news. Loki started us off tonight.

49:37.340 --> 49:43.420
So Microsoft is getting rid of X-Box fitness. Which is a bummer. I was going to use that to

49:43.420 --> 49:47.420
lose some weight so I could do some slutty cosplay like jinx. That's not going to happen

49:47.420 --> 49:53.100
either. I'm not going to be slutty jinx with that. Um, but yes, apparently, um, you know,

49:53.100 --> 49:57.100
they're going to start to go wind down. So right now you can't buy new content.

49:58.060 --> 50:03.740
And those who have purchased content so far, you can use those up until June 30th, 2017.

50:03.740 --> 50:09.660
And then after that, well, too bad. You don't get free shit anymore. You don't get to, uh,

50:09.660 --> 50:16.940
view your content that you paid for anymore. That kind of sucks. Well, that sucks for you.

50:16.940 --> 50:22.620
If you bought that $60 Jillian Michaels workout video that it's just going to get taken away from

50:22.620 --> 50:29.100
you. I've never, ever even heard of X-Box fitness, like for real. When did that happen?

50:29.660 --> 50:34.460
At the launch of the three or at the launch of the 360 and the launch of the one when the connect

50:34.460 --> 50:40.780
was included with every X-Box and you know, a big part of why the connect took off in the beginning

50:40.780 --> 50:45.660
was what dance games and fitness games. Right. That was like all the connect was in the beginning

50:45.660 --> 50:51.020
for the 360 for the X-Box one. It was never anything. Well, it was an extra thing that

50:51.020 --> 50:55.100
they packaged in with your system that you're paying for. I think it had hoped to continue

50:55.100 --> 50:59.500
the, um, dance game and fitness game trend because, um, there was, there was a dance central game for

50:59.500 --> 51:04.780
a hot minute, but it was like, uh, here's a very bare bones version of it. Now buy all our songs

51:04.780 --> 51:12.460
extra that that doesn't fly usually pretty much. So, and Microsoft still has not said, like,

51:12.460 --> 51:18.300
you're going to get compensated. I mean, this is why people are nervous about buying shit digitally

51:18.300 --> 51:23.180
and they should be, you know, again, it depends how much you're spending, I suppose.

51:23.180 --> 51:28.060
Like, you know, if steam went belly up tomorrow and I can no longer download,

51:28.780 --> 51:33.340
you know, the shower with your dad simulator that I spent 69 cents on, I'm not going to be that

51:33.340 --> 51:37.340
worried about it. You know, when you were saying that you got that game, I confused it with that

51:37.340 --> 51:41.580
other showering game with guys where you actually have to like rub them down. You've seen that game

51:41.580 --> 51:46.380
before I have that game. It's hilarious. No, you're weird. You know, if you saw this game,

51:46.380 --> 51:51.260
you'd be like, why am I not playing it right now? It's by the guy that does the lot of like

51:51.260 --> 51:57.740
the sex games, I guess like, Oh, that guy. Oh no, no. Like he has stuff on steam. It's like,

51:57.740 --> 52:03.180
that's what he's known for. He had the game where you, where you take like penis pictures,

52:03.180 --> 52:08.860
like you were, um, like on, you know, one of those social media things and

52:08.860 --> 52:14.460
Is this guy to steam like that guy on Amazon who writes those books? It's like pounded in the butt

52:14.460 --> 52:22.060
by my butt and like, uh, like, uh, pounded in the butt by the Brexit and like all these like

52:22.060 --> 52:26.620
random things. I mean, please tell me somebody else has heard of this on Amazon. Yes. There's

52:26.620 --> 52:30.860
this author on Amazon who writes all these like crappy. Well, I don't know. I haven't,

52:30.860 --> 52:34.460
I haven't read them. I don't know if they're good or not, but they're, you know,

52:34.460 --> 52:40.220
gay Rodica things that have these like ridiculous names. I don't think they're supposed to be good.

52:40.220 --> 52:47.900
One of them got troll nominated by the CD side of Twitter for a prestigious, like a Hugo award

52:47.900 --> 52:54.620
or something. And it was, it was, um, it was one of this guy's books. So this sounds like that,

52:54.620 --> 53:00.940
but on steam anyway, I don't know how we got from X-Box fitness to pound it in the butt by my butt,

53:00.940 --> 53:05.580
but basically, so the reason that they're terminating the service is because the service

53:05.580 --> 53:11.180
requires regular content updates, given the service, um, relies on providing you with new

53:11.180 --> 53:15.820
and exciting content regularly. Microsoft has given too much or has given much consideration

53:15.820 --> 53:24.220
to the reality, um, updating the service regularly in order to sustain it. And, um,

53:26.380 --> 53:34.540
and that's it. That's like half of a quote. What the hell? Um, we thought about it and that's it.

53:34.780 --> 53:39.500
We're done. Um, we thought about, Hey, yeah, we were going to update that service called

53:39.500 --> 53:45.260
game room too, but those guys. Yeah. That's a sore spot too. Cause I spent money on game room

53:45.260 --> 53:52.060
and it's like, well, that's gone pounded in the butt by Microsoft. Um, looking at the internet,

53:52.060 --> 53:55.980
I found the name of that book that got nominated for a Hugo award. It was space Raptor button

53:55.980 --> 54:02.220
invasion. That's the one that got nominated for you. I hope they get made into a movie.

54:02.220 --> 54:11.100
It'll probably do better at the box office. You know what? You laugh, but I bet space Raptor.

54:11.100 --> 54:17.180
What was it? Space Raptor button vision or space Raptor button vision has more of a story than

54:17.180 --> 54:22.620
Tetris does and Tetris is getting a three movie deals. So why can't space Raptor button vision

54:22.620 --> 54:27.020
get at least one movie? Why not? I never thought Loki would be defending space Raptor button

54:27.020 --> 54:31.740
vision here on the show, but seriously, we are that having a movie would be less ridiculous

54:31.820 --> 54:36.460
than Tetris having a movie. That is how ridiculous that concept is.

54:38.140 --> 54:43.820
Um, all right. Well, one concept, uh, we would like to hear about soon already is the

54:43.820 --> 54:48.860
Nintendo NX and what is the fricking catch with the Nintendo at X? What is the thing?

54:48.860 --> 54:54.140
Uh, apparently in an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto this week talked about that the reason

54:54.140 --> 55:00.220
why the NX has not been unveiled is because there is a secret idea. And, uh, from this

55:00.220 --> 55:06.940
article with big story, uh, that he said in terms of NX, there's an idea we're working on.

55:06.940 --> 55:10.940
This is why we can't share anything at this point. And I don't want to comment on the other

55:10.940 --> 55:15.660
companies. If it was just a matter of following advancements in technology, things would be coming

55:15.660 --> 55:20.380
out a lot quicker. So in other words, what I draw from that is that, look, if we were just bumping

55:20.380 --> 55:25.420
up the specs and putting out like a power console, then, then we would have said it already. But

55:25.420 --> 55:30.460
because there's some type of twist to the system that they don't want other people to steal,

55:31.260 --> 55:38.300
that's why they're not unveiling it. What? This is a stupid fucking reason. I'm sorry.

55:38.300 --> 55:42.700
I want to, I do want to just quickly say though, maybe there's a translation thing going on here.

55:42.700 --> 55:46.940
I do. Cause this has happened a couple of times. That's the case. And then this, I mean,

55:46.940 --> 55:51.900
translators, come on, seriously. But, um, assuming that there's not a translation issue,

55:51.900 --> 55:56.380
I think that is a dumb fucking excuse because seriously, what is two fucking months or how

55:56.380 --> 56:00.940
many months between now and when they're going to announce it, is it going to matter? And they're

56:00.940 --> 56:05.660
going to fucking copy it anyways, if it's a good idea. But it didn't come out right away. Like the

56:05.660 --> 56:10.860
move and the connect weren't a thing that was like out at the launch of the weed. The connect

56:10.860 --> 56:15.980
was sort of like an evolved idea. I wouldn't really consider Microsoft doesn't necessarily

56:15.980 --> 56:19.980
just steal ideas. They steal them and make them better. And that's what they will try to do in

56:19.980 --> 56:25.100
theory with connect that they didn't really, that they didn't really perfect until the Xbox one,

56:25.100 --> 56:29.020
by which point everybody stopped caring to see a trend of Microsoft where they try to steal these

56:29.020 --> 56:33.100
ideas and make them better. They're not really successful with a lot of them. Like the windows

56:33.100 --> 56:43.900
phone, the zoom, the connect, uh, what was that? The, uh, or the, yeah, but then they do something

56:43.900 --> 56:48.860
like a second screen glass crap. Okay. Uh, but then they do something like Xbox live,

56:48.860 --> 56:53.180
which has been like the biggest innovation. So they kind of been doing that for a long,

56:53.180 --> 56:57.260
one could argue that was bitten off. What like game spy servers and things that were already

56:57.260 --> 57:02.060
existed in the PC world. Okay. So fine. They did something right there, but it's been a while

57:02.060 --> 57:07.180
since they've had it hit. But like, I seriously think that as a stupid fucking reason and it's

57:07.180 --> 57:12.300
cause it's, if it is a gimmick of some sort, they're not going to change their game plan.

57:12.300 --> 57:16.460
That, I mean, if it's that significant, I don't think that these companies are a changer game plan

57:16.460 --> 57:21.180
that quickly. And if it is something that they can change that quickly where they're like,

57:21.180 --> 57:26.380
if you announced it now, they're going to be able to steal it by the time that you release this.

57:27.260 --> 57:32.700
Who cares? I mean, it's going to be like, yeah, so it'll delay it a few more months and then

57:32.700 --> 57:38.140
they'll steal it. I mean, what's the big deal? I think I know what it is. It is putting a handle

57:38.140 --> 57:43.340
on your system again, just like they did with the game. Uh, dark to see you in chat says,

57:43.340 --> 57:46.540
well, yeah, I mean, look at the, we, after it was announced and Sony came out and said,

57:46.540 --> 57:50.380
look, our system has motion control on our control. It was fucking so I can see why

57:50.380 --> 57:55.100
Nintendo went that way. They're still using that fucking garbage motion controller. I disagree.

57:55.100 --> 58:01.020
I think the move actually was better. Like it was way more accurate than the we, and it felt,

58:01.020 --> 58:05.260
it just didn't really have, you know, you're right. Yeah. Cause I did use that. I do remember

58:05.260 --> 58:09.500
that now, but like the implementation of it was garbage. Like they didn't have the games

58:09.500 --> 58:15.180
to justify it. But I give Sony massive props that now it's like, okay, well that's coming back. So

58:15.180 --> 58:22.700
like, it's not, it was good back then, but it's not good enough. I think they need to do more

58:22.700 --> 58:28.220
with it. Uh, let's see. And then Stoppy says, uh, because you know, Nintendo doesn't have a legal

58:28.220 --> 58:33.420
arm to go to after companies that copy their idea. Maybe they're all busy going after let's players

58:33.420 --> 58:37.420
and coffee table books. Well, that's a whole nother issue, but yeah. Uh, maybe their legal

58:37.420 --> 58:43.740
arms tied up with that. Although, you know, again, apparently Sony or I'm sorry, apparently, um,

58:43.740 --> 58:50.460
Nintendo couldn't stop the move, but I would bet because the move was based with a camera and the

58:50.460 --> 58:55.980
Wii thing was based on infrared. That's was different enough for it not to be a very different.

58:55.980 --> 59:00.940
Yeah. Yeah. Cause we, you, the, the remotes are looking at a sensor bar. So they're basically

59:00.940 --> 59:06.300
finding like two, two points that are on top of your TV and they're tracking that versus the

59:06.300 --> 59:12.060
camera tracking the actual controllers instead. Well, I mean, they're going to have to unveil

59:12.060 --> 59:17.580
what it is eventually to make people want one. So I, I still kind of agree with the general

59:17.580 --> 59:22.940
consensus that the week before Tokyo game show is when this will be revealed. And the reason why

59:22.940 --> 59:28.300
is not because Nintendo, you know, Nintendo doesn't really do Tokyo game show, but the third

59:28.300 --> 59:33.740
parties that are going to put games out on an X will then be able to, uh, basically promote for

59:33.740 --> 59:37.580
them at Tokyo game show. And I, I, that's why I believe that we will hear about the NX the week

59:37.580 --> 59:42.060
before Tokyo game show. Can we at least all agree that whatever they're hiding right now is probably

59:42.060 --> 59:46.700
insignificant really? Yep. Yep. I don't think it's, I don't think it's something that's so

59:46.700 --> 59:50.540
game changing that they need to hide it. I'm going to agree with it, but not in such a negative

59:50.540 --> 59:54.860
connotation. I think because they're hiding it, it's something that's really easy to copy.

59:55.420 --> 01:00:00.060
So that's why they're hiding it. So we'll see. What's it going to be over your own VR? I mean,

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:04.860
seriously, like, I don't know what they could, well, they've already publicly stated that they

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:09.340
are, you know, they've seen a lot of things that they're thinking about doing things and they have

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.740
projects and ideas. I'm starting to get the impression that they don't know what the fuck

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:17.420
they're going to make that system into that. They're just throwing all these ideas like,

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.100
Oh, maybe we should do some VR. Well, maybe we should do this. Maybe we should do this.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.740
I don't think that's why they're showing it because they don't know what the fuck it is.

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:28.780
Yeah. They don't have anything to show. It's just like, I'm going to throw a wild dart

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:34.780
against the wall. And if this whole handheld and console universe thing, it proves to be true.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:42.620
Nintendo are, I think it has something to do with game streaming. And they're worried that

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:47.980
Sony's going to jack it for PlayStation now. And I don't, I'm sorry. I don't, you know,

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:53.820
if I knew what it was, boy, I'd probably be a lot richer and, uh, you know, be a games analyst full

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:59.580
time. But, um, I have a feeling, I don't know why my gut tells me it seems like a natural evolution

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:05.100
of the fact that the Wii U streams from the countertop box to your device, maybe they

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.940
figured out a way to get that done over the internet or something there. It's something

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:13.340
they don't want Sony to incorporate into PlayStation. Now, again, that's just a wild

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:18.780
guess, but that would strike me as something that's quote unquote, easy to copy. If Sony

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.780
were to dedicate the resources to the copy, because I think they are dedicating the resources

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:27.180
to it. I wish they'd spend those resources on getting backwards compatibility to work instead,

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.780
because I don't believe for a second that they can't get that to run on the PS4.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:35.340
Stop being chat says, I don't disagree with Rob, but game streaming, if that's the idea,

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.420
they're worried if people copying, they deserve all the hate they get. I, here's the thing,

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:44.220
it's not like, like, obviously it's not just game streaming. There's something new there. And if I

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:50.540
knew what it was, then I could steal Nintendo's idea, but I'm speculating. I wonder if, here's

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:54.300
the, here's might be, okay, I'll put out the wild guess that I think it might be.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:02:00.700
Because with PlayStation now you stream games from a centralized server. You don't really stream it

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:06.780
to your place. You don't stream it from your PlayStation four to your Vita, unless you're

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:13.100
in wifi. I think what could be the catch is that Nintendo's figured out a way through low bandwidth

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.860
or something, maybe just for virtual console games, maybe for very, very low bandwidth games

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:22.460
or something. They found a way that you can stream over the internet, over the air from your

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:29.900
NX to your handheld NX, no matter where you are. That's, that's my guess.

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:35.420
It's a crazy guess. I totally admit, but that's, that's what I mean when it's something to do with

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:39.820
game streaming, but it's something we haven't quite seen yet. No, I don't think you could

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:44.700
literally pause your game at home. Get in the, get in the car to go start going to work or the

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.740
train to go to work and pick up right where you left off on your device. The Vita and the

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:55.500
PlayStation four almost do this, but they don't really do it over the internet. I, I don't think

01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:01.180
so. That's just my wild guess. Uh, all right. Anyway, let's, uh, let's move on to some more

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:08.300
stories. Uh, who's going to go next? Jim, it's me. It's me. Uh, I wanted to talk about, uh,

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:13.100
summer games done quick. And I know a lot of this is covered. I heard the tail in the Bobby show,

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:18.700
so, but, um, uh, that's okay. We have podcasters who might listen in reverse. They might listen

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:23.100
to reverse order and listen to Bobby second. So, so the thing that I wanted to open up with

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:28.460
before I get into the summer games done quick was, you know, they were featured, uh, one of

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:33.500
the speed runners is featured on the Colbert show or was it called the late show? It's sad that I

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:37.580
don't know what it's called Letterman's old show. It's the late show because that was Letterman's

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.900
show. It's the late show with Steven Colbert. It was Steven Colbert. They had Mitch flower power,

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:47.420
whose name real name is Mitch Fowler. I'm like, Oh, I get it now. So they had him on and he ran

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:53.180
Super Mario brothers three. And I guess because his, one of his fast times is like three Oh eight.

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:58.940
Then Colbert raced him in like cooking and eating a hot pocket. And then he also had like,

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:05.500
these guys do a relay race from some local track. It was like Columbia. I think so. Yeah. So yeah.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.940
So they did like a three way thing where like these guys were running a relay race and Colbert

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:14.220
was microwaving and eating a hot pocket. And this guy was running some more of a string. Colbert won

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:20.300
because this guy didn't Mitch didn't get his best time, but he did it in like three 35. I think it

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:24.220
was kind of lost in the broadcast because once Colbert finished, they kind of ended this segment.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:28.460
And, but then, you know, he finished his run. I think he got like a three 35 and then like

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:33.180
something he didn't trigger the glitch as fast as you usually get. But he got it. And I saw her,

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:36.300
I saw him walk up to the princess and all that. So he triggered the ending without having to fight

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.900
Bowser. So that was pretty cool. And I just thought it was cool. Cause then at the end,

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.660
they plugged summer games on quick. So they plugged it on national TV. And I know

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:47.500
this marathon has been running for a while every year. They've been making more money,

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.740
except for the last awesome gives. They made less money than the previous one, but I think it'd be

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:56.540
cool to see what kind of bump summer games gets this year. And I like, I've always followed this

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:02.140
a lot. I actually applied to be, or I guess submitted a run to be on this year's summer

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:05.580
games on quick, but I was rejected, but it was a PT. I was going to try to run.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.020
You're going to keep submitting until you get it though, right?

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:10.060
Yeah, I'll keep trying. I don't know if it's a game they would ever want to put on.

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.340
I almost wanted to like promote it as like, cause I was, I was trying to say like

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:20.540
every summer because the S I told you earlier, it's during the awful or during the AGDQ,

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:23.980
they do awful games on quick during the summer. They do silly games on quick starts in S well,

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.820
they also do spooky games on quick every summer. And they usually throw a couple of horror games

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.300
in there. So I thought, Oh, this would be great compliment. Cause it's so short,

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.660
just squeeze it into a spooky games block. But now I'm like, wouldn't it be funny if they did

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:40.460
like a slow games done quick. Cause PT kind of falls into that realm of, I hate to say walking

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.820
simulators, but it's a game where you just pretty much are walking down the hallway, except for one

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:50.220
short segment where you're going fast. But I've also seen speed runs on games like, uh, uh, gone

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.740
home. You can beat in under a minute. Yeah. Gone home is another one. I was playing when I was

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.020
waiting for the grand theft auto installation. I actually played gone home on PlayStation four and

01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:01.340
I re there's a trophy for beating it in under a minute. And I was like, why you can beat the game

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:05.420
in a minute? And I let you go home. You're like, all right, I'm done. No. If you know,

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:11.180
I mean, spoiler alert, but if you know where the secret door is, where the key to the attic is,

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:14.940
which you usually find throughout the discovery, you get kind of get clues to where the secret

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.820
door is. But if you know where it is, you just go right to it, grab the key to the attic,

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:21.420
go to the attic, get the diary and end the game. And you can be, uh, everyone's gone to the rapture

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:26.060
in like a minute because there's a glitch you can do. If you kind of like jump and twirl around

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:30.380
near the start, you can jump a fence. And actually where you start is really close to the place where

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:38.700
you start switches tonight and then you walk up and do the final cut scene. So you can do that.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:43.020
So I was like, Oh, that'd be fun if they did a block of slow games done quick. The S thing,

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:46.780
they're games that are typically slow. Uh, until Dawn is another game where you pretty much walk

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.700
the whole game and there's some glitches in that good game. I don't think you could speed run that.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:56.460
Tiger watch. Yeah. Tiger con chat says you think they will ever do a winner games done quick.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:01.500
That is awesome. That is awesome. Games is in the winter. Awesome. Games happens every January. So

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:05.740
we're speed running until Dawn. Do you just kill everybody off? Uh, there's different categories.

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.780
There are categories for saving everyone. It's just like every speed run. There's categories.

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:12.140
There's any percent and there's, you know, all the, any percent, it doesn't matter what happens.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:16.780
Usually that's the most popular category in any speed run. Uh, so yeah. So yeah, I looked at the

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.980
schedule. I think it's a pretty cool, you know, uh, marathon this year. I kind of like how they're

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:26.060
ending it with super Mario RPG. They've, they've typically ended either with the final fantasy

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:30.620
game or I think a couple of times they've ended with Corona trigger. So this time,

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.060
and I think one time did they end with the Metroid race? I don't know. I don't think they ever have.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:37.740
I think you've always ended with an RPG. Yeah. Metroid's like right before it's usually much

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.100
as right for it. It is again this year. It's like they don't match rated because it's the

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:46.620
big moneymaker to be fair though. Super Mario RPG is another square. Super Nintendo is true.

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:52.220
So it does kind of fit. That's the thing. It just came out recently. Yeah. So Nintendo,

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:55.340
they set this a while ago though. They set the schedule a long time ago, which I think is kind

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.780
of funny. I think it's just a coincidence. I don't think it's because of that, but yeah.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:04.540
Hey, you never know. Nintendo may be looking at it going bump that up or something. Yeah.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:08.860
I don't see anything really great on there, but the one game that stuck out to me,

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:15.020
I think it's during their silly block is a bubble ghost because that's a game boy game that I had

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:19.980
for game boy. It's so cute. I see. I didn't see that. Yeah. What I kind of like about the marathon

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:25.420
is I discover games that I either never heard of or barely heard of or just wouldn't even think

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:29.180
about watching. And I see them and they're really funny. Like, you know, I actually discovered,

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:35.740
uh, roundabout on there and I thought that was so good. And I first saw it on, uh, games on quick.

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:39.740
And then I went and I bought it. I was like, let me look at this game. And it happened to be on

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:43.500
sale when I looked it up. It's like, I'm going to buy that. So I bought that right away. And, uh,

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.100
gosh, what was that Western game they did? Yeah. I was just thinking about that. I don't know what

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:52.460
really bad, but hilarious, like old, old PC Western game, the teaser classic game of the week.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:57.340
I saw that one as well on there. And so we'll see more of that later. But, um, yeah, there's,

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.420
I, that's, that's why the scene, the schedule doesn't really bother me. You see the ones that

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:04.780
are there that are always there. The mega man games is of course the Metroid race and all

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:11.580
that stuff. The Mario block is always, I love the Mario 64, like the, the minimum stars run,

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:15.100
whatever that is. I love that every time I watch, I love watching them run backwards.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:19.100
So I'm, I'm a big portal runs. Yeah. The portal runs are good. I don't think those are on this

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.660
year. I saw, I saw with a tear in my eye, the spooky games block. It's not much of a block.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.300
It looks like, I don't know if there's a scheduling issue, but it looks like they broke

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.660
up the games cause they're doing the amnesia on one night and the next night they're doing like

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.260
silent Hill three and like resident evil. Maybe they just don't think amnesia is scary.

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:38.940
Spooky games like near Halloween or anything like that. No, no, no. They just have a spooky block

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.500
during the summer. Cause of the, yes. You know, uh, they just, they usually, you know, confine

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.620
it to sometime after midnight and they throw those in there. The block that amnesia is in,

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:53.260
it has like Wolfenstein and Dishonored too. So maybe it's some sort of like first person.

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:57.340
I think that's part of a first person block. Yeah. But it may, and maybe the guy that runs it,

01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.700
it looks like the person that runs silent Hill three is the exact same person. Yeah. Running

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:05.980
resident evil two. So the spooky games block, so to speak, it's just silent Hill three resident

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:10.220
evil two and little big planet and little big planet. That could be spooky. Yes. Um,

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:14.620
I do want to point this out. It's kind of related is that humble bundle tends to do a themed

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:19.180
bundle for the, um, summer games, no quick and awesome ways to quick. They just released the

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:23.980
summer games bundle. Um, but what's interesting about it is that the minimum is 15. There is no

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:28.460
games that you just get for like a dollar. So you have to pay at least 15 or more there. It's, it's,

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:34.300
I think it's some you kind of seen before, like super meat boy and VVVVV, which I mean are great

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:39.260
games, but they're kind of in every pack, but there's also, I have like most of these, uh,

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:44.300
there's serious Sam, double DX XL and serious Sam, the random encounter. There's freedom planet,

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:49.420
escape goat to Guacamelee and dust forest DX. So the other games that I'm pretty sure I have

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:55.340
almost all of these with the exception of maybe escape go to with the rest. I know I have,

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.380
yeah, I don't. Are these all games that are actually featured this year? They're not

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:02.140
featured this year. I don't see them are maybe meat boy is that's, that one's a pretty mean,

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.460
that's a mainstay. I think it might not be VVVV maybe. I don't think that one is on this year.

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:10.220
I didn't see that one, but I thought I saw meat boy. Now that I'm more awakened, looking at this

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:19.020
list, there looks to be a, like a Disney Capcom, any S block that block looks like DuckTales.

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:25.100
Disney's little mermaid, Mickey mouse, capade. They almost always do a Disney block. Ship

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.860
and Dale rescue Rangers too. Oh yeah. Rescue Rangers too. That's the way. Yeah. Like I want

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:34.060
to watch that. All right. I can't because I'll be, I've had it on all day. Like it started at

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.340
10 AM. It's been on that. It's probably still play. Well, you know, it's probably not playing

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:42.460
now because Catherine just started and my wife hates that case. I hate that game. So

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:47.260
you hate it cause it has sheep when she was pregnant with our son, I believe I was playing

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:51.820
it like crazy and she just was, you know, anything she relates to all that sickness for me and

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:56.380
pregnancy. She's just like, I don't like it. Except Taco Bell. Well yeah, she still is Taco Bell.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.900
Isn't it like a puzzle game or something? It is pretty much a puzzle game. Yeah. But there's also

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:06.460
like a whole, like a dating SIM almost thing in the middle of it or not really a SIM, but there's

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.740
like, when you go to the bar, there's like all these social things you have to do. And that

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:15.020
unlocks kind of how the story unfolds. Beating the puzzles is one thing, but yeah, I played on

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.460
easy mode cause I, I'm not good at those puzzles, but I beat the game and it was really fun. I

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:23.740
thought, but yeah, it was, it was weird. He had really good anime cut scenes and what's

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.180
interesting about that run, which I have to watch it later because I do actually want to watch it

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:32.380
because the guy who's running it is playing co-op mode, but he's playing it himself with two

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:36.780
controllers. So it's one player with two controllers. That's awesome. I'm like, that sounds

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:41.660
amazing. So I wish I got one of his controllers is a fight stick. Okay. So that makes it easier then.

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.660
Wow. I didn't see that. See, I haven't seen it. So Shane's watching it right now. One controller is

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:52.380
a dance pad. That'd be cool. That'd be awesome. All right. Let's, let's move on with some other

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:56.620
news. I'm sure a lot of people are multitasking with the summer games done quick, but they do,

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.860
they put everything on YouTube anyway. So if you miss something.

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:02.060
Yeah. They're really good archiving. If you, if you don't watch it on YouTube,

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.420
sometimes you take a little longer. Are you that one? You're not getting picked up. Oh,

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:08.220
sorry. You might not be like, no, just, just right then.

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:14.780
Okay. Anyway. Yeah. They, uh, if you go on, uh, usually the Reddit thread that references

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:21.180
summer games on quick, they'll usually have links to the, what I want to say, like the time code,

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:27.580
the splits or whatever in their Twitch stream. That's faster way to see the archives. If you

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:32.780
don't want to wait for YouTube and if you're new to it, I highly suggest watching any of the relays

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:37.420
because the relays are always fun. There's, they did a donkey Kong country, tropical freeze one

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:43.580
today, Canada versus USA. And there's a super Mario maker blind custom team relay race,

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.740
which they did that in, uh, awesome games. And that was really fun to watch.

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:51.020
And so they'll be doing it again. And also don't forget it is for charity.

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:55.420
So donate to the French doctors without borders. I don't know what that is.

01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:00.860
It's doctors borders, but they're, they're like, uh, things in French. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:06.220
that many sounds on frontiers or whatever. I don't speak French, obviously. Wow. You sound

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:10.620
like me trying to do Japanese release dates. That's great. All right. Uh, let's get to some

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:14.300
other news though, for a time. Cause we, uh, are running a little long, but that's all right. Uh,

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:21.820
Loki. So there's a key reseller, um, G2A, which most people don't like because they're also known

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:27.420
for people that, you know, they hack people's accounts and steal codes or, you know,

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:33.260
fraudulently obtain keys and resell them on their market. Um, but now, Hey, they're trying to get

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:41.340
on the good side of developers by offering up to a 10% royalty and for keys sold on their platform.

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:46.860
However, it is up to the developers to set that royalty, which will be applied on top of the

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:52.620
prices set by third party sellers. And in order for the developers to take advantage of that,

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:59.980
they need to partner with the site. So they will need to register their products with G2A

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:08.460
and acknowledge owned intellectual property in games. Hmm. Um, yeah. In fact, I mean,

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:12.700
there's been some developers that have come out and said basically, Hey, we'd rather you

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:17.500
pirate our game than the purchase from this website. They're not very liked.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:23.180
No, they're not. Well, I mean, yeah, there's, there's, you know, allegedly stolen credit cards.

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:28.140
I don't think it's alleged be like they have had instances where people have purchased stuff off

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:35.340
of that site and it's been with a stolen account and the keys get revoked. So you just gotta be

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:42.140
aware or, you know, wary of where you purchase things. Yeah. I don't know if that's a site that

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:45.740
can really redeem itself. And were there ones that were also like reselling the humble bundle

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:49.900
keys and stuff like that? Was that them? The dollar keys? I want to say it was them. I don't

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:56.540
know. That's shady too, though. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange

01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:03.500
Andradeo at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SOFA. All right. Well, uh, let's move on to

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:07.820
something. Uh, I know I'm really looking forward to it because I love this series of games. Um,

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:13.180
and that's Diablo. And apparently, uh, there's rumblings that there is something new coming

01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:18.060
out in the Diablo universe, which in a way is kind of a duh because, you know,

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:22.460
Blizzard just released Overwatch and they're, they've got Heroes of the Storm going and

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:25.660
Hearthstone, which, you know, they're still supporting those games. World of Warcraft

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:30.140
has an expansion that's just about to come out. So what's left? Starcraft and Diablo. Well,

01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:36.380
Starcraft 2 just kind of, they just finished that trilogy, right? That, that last game, uh,

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:40.860
what the hell is it? There was the Heart of the Void Swarm. Wings of Liberty or something.

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:46.060
Whatever the last one. Starcraft something of something. That just came out not that long ago.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.220
And so Diablo is kind of the game that hasn't seen a little love in a couple of years. Um,

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:55.580
because, well, they had the expansion for Diablo 3 or the game that fixed Diablo 3,

01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:01.900
Reaper of Souls, but then that's kind of it. And if you've played the game and you beat,

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:06.940
uh, Reaper of Souls, you kind of know that the game is wide open for another expansion.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:11.740
And so it seems very likely that this is going to happen, but, uh, apparently a Blizzard's

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:18.860
career page now has a job posting relating to the future of Diablo. It's a game director to lead the

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:25.020
quote, unannounced project for Diablo. It's just talking about leading the Diablo series into the

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:30.140
future. So it is showing up, uh, on their jobs page. They're definitely still recruiting for

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:34.700
Diablo's future. I think this is much more than just patches because they're still, I mean,

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:39.580
they're doing seasons in Diablo, they're doing patches, but you know, it's that, that, that's

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:45.580
starting to run out of steam. Like I love Diablo. I played this season long enough to get the banner

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:51.260
and the rewards. And then I stopped, like I haven't been hitting it as hard as I did some of

01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:56.940
the previous seasons. So, um, I'm assuming it'll be another expansion and not a Diablo 4. Diablo

01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:02.540
4 is going to take a lot of time, but, uh, we'll see. What if it's some sort of like competition

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:06.780
game since that's what all their games are now at this point? Well, I'd be, I don't see how Diablo

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:11.660
really works in that universe. They, they technically, there is a PVP mode in Diablo.

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:15.980
It's just, they kind of just threw it away. I mean, there's, you can't really do a lot with

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:22.460
it to be honest. Did they actually put anything you got put in it? You, you can enter, uh, with

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:26.460
a friend of yours and there's an MPC that you can talk to and you can go to a Coliseum where you can

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:30.620
like kick each other's butt, but that's it. Like there's no matchmaking. There's originally,

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:34.460
they said there was going to be an arena in Diablo. That's never happened. None of that's there.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:38.540
There's just, you can go and you can BBB, but I think a good thing to put in the next expansion,

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:43.420
if that's what they're working on that, that might be it. Who knows? So, uh, we'll see.

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:49.420
I would assume though that there's going to be, you know, uh, a new act, a new class,

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:54.300
you know, uh, 10 more levels, all that stuff too. But yeah, we'll see. Shane, what do you have for

01:18:54.300 --> 01:19:00.460
us? I have Pokemon. So, um, for the past few weeks, the Pokemon company has been teasing

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:07.820
that we were going to get some new news on July 1st, but some crazy thing happened. And, uh,

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:16.460
the morning, early, early morning of June 30th on YouTube, there were leaks for random Pokemon.

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:20.140
Couldn't tell if they were real or not, but they came from a Russian something or other,

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:25.580
cause it looked like, like a Russian ESRB sort of, uh, splash screen at the beginning,

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:31.500
but they were real. And so we got seven new Pokemon. We got a fish that looks like a drag

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:39.500
queen named Bruxish. We got an adorable, uh, bee fly named Cutiefly. We have an old grandpa dragon

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:49.340
named Drampa. We have the Pikachu clone for the new, uh, region, uh, Togedemaru. We have Grubbin's

01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:54.620
evolution, uh, charge a bug, which looks like to me a bus. And I think it's adorable, but it's

01:19:54.620 --> 01:20:00.140
apparently a battery, whatever. Uh, and that evolves into a Vic Viper looking thing from

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:08.300
Gradius called Vikavolt. Um, and then we also finally got the English names. Oh yeah,

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:14.220
the English names for the koala Pokemon called Komala and the puppy Pokemon called Rockruff.

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:20.300
And then finally we got a, um, what we kind of guess might be a legendary, um, for one of the

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:28.220
islands that you start on. Um, his name is, uh, Tapu Koko. It's awesome. I mean, the Vikavolt

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:33.500
thing seriously looks like Vic Viper from Gradius. It's really cool. Rockruff is a really cute name.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:40.300
It's adorable. It's my, like, we didn't have any footage in what they gave us on, on the first,

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:47.980
but at the Hong Kong nationals, uh, they showed the first in-game footage of Komala and Rockruff,

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:55.820
and I will have all the plush toys of Rockruff possible. Now you, you said that there was like

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.820
a Pikachu clone in this game. What was the name of the Pikachu clone? Togedemaru. But it's not,

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:04.380
it's not Pikachu. No, every, um... It looks more like a Marill to me than a Pikachu. Every

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:12.300
generation has an electric Pokemon, like, in the same vein as Pikachu. So, and we had Pikachu in

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:16.780
the first generation. We had its pre-evolution in the second, Pichu. Then we had Plusle in

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:23.100
mine and in the third. We had Prachirisu in the fourth, Emolga in fifth, and then Dedenne in the

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:29.100
sixth, and now the Steel Electric. I think it's actually a Hedgehog. It has little spikes,

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:34.860
and it's a Steel Electric. It's super cute. I would like a plush toy of that as well.

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:39.100
Actually, there are a lot of these I want plush toys of. Not the Drag Queen Fish, though.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:44.620
I'm okay with it, but it's kind of frightening, and, uh, I don't know.

01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.380
Fifth Dream in chat at live.bogonetwork.com says,

01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:53.340
Beautyfly and Cutiefly should get married. Do you ship Pokemon?

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.860
No. I was just curious. Well, ditto in everything when I'm making eggs.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:03.980
When you made 5,000 oshawott in your quest to get a shiny one.

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:10.460
Yes, five years of hatching oshawott. So many people got winter coats because of that.

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.500
All right, we're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.620
that you can play a lot sooner than Shane can play Pokemon Sun and Moon.

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:19.340
Why would you have to rub that in?

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.460
Because it makes me feel better because you're mean.

01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.220
All right, Loki, what's coming out of the US this week?

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:29.180
We have Fury, which is coming out on PC and PlayStation 4. It's also part of

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:35.500
the PlayStation Network, you know, the free games that you get for PlayStation Plus.

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.740
So that'll be coming out this week.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:42.060
Mega Dimension Neptunia 7. That's on PC.

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.860
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 13 on PC and PlayStation 4.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.220
The Banner Saga 2 is coming to PlayStation 4.

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.700
Inside on PC.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:57.980
Carmageddon max damage on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.980
And Hawken on PlayStation 4.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.340
Carmageddon's coming back?

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.780
Yeah, they got a new Carmageddon.

01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:03.260
All right.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.340
And it's very offensive to people because they've got, you know,

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.940
people in wheelchairs and stuff that you're destroying.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.120
Wow.

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:15.020
All right.

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:19.180
Traveling over to Japan and checking out what's coming out on the PlayStation 4 over there.

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:24.140
This week on July 7th, you can get price reductions on Tales of Zestiria

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.540
and Sengoku Basara for Sumogari.

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:32.380
There is a new game called Shin Hairagami 2 comes out this week in Japan.

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:38.300
It looks like it might be like a mystery anime type of thing that is based on.

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.780
So that's what you have to look forward to on the PlayStation 4.

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.740
Uh, I don't believe the Wii U has anything this week.

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:50.460
Oh no, they are getting a, um, like a Splatoon bundle with the system in Japan.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:53.820
It's like, I guess that's Splatoon, but it has the new Amiibo with it.

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:54.380
So that is...

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.060
I forgot that's coming out pretty soon.

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:57.180
Those Amiibo, aren't they?

01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.180
In Japan, we're out this week.

01:23:59.180 --> 01:23:59.900
One week?

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:00.400
Yes.

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:02.460
So that makes sense that we would be getting...

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:03.900
Squid Sisters and Recolors.

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.700
Very soon as well.

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:10.540
That Shin Hairagami 2 comes out on the PlayStation Vita as well.

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:13.100
And then lastly on the 3DS this week.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.460
Ooh, Cold Sept Revolt comes out on the 3DS.

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.020
I...

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.620
This is one of those games that I really wish had done better in the US.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.420
It's like a trading card game meets Monopoly.

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:24.700
I think these games are rad.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.700
They're like, they're really hard to master and I'm really terrible at them,

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:29.660
but they're fun to play.

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.860
But I don't think the series did very well here.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.140
So I highly doubt this game.

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:38.700
I'd have to import this game if I want to play it and play it on Shane's Japanese 3DS.

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:42.140
But since I can't read Japanese, I'm not going to do me a lick of good.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:42.860
But if you're a Cold Sept...

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:46.700
And that's a Pokemon 3DS that only plays Pokemon, really.

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.780
So nothing else can go in there.

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:53.180
When he's not looking, I'll grab it and put Cold Sept in there.

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.980
It's also blue, so you have to pry it from my dead hand.

01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:59.500
I tainted your 3DS with another game series.

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:01.500
All right, how about the UK?

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.740
I believe Flaco Jones is filling in for the UK releases this week.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.180
Yeah, I got it right here.

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:10.300
The first game is a PC game I've never heard of called Bum Rush.

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.620
So that sounds weird.

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:15.500
Like maybe it's a sequel to that Raptor butt.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:19.500
What I was going to say is the American version called Butt Rush because they call them bums.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:25.180
Anyway, that's on July 6th and July 7th.

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.060
PC game Inside.

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.540
That's the Xbox game that we have over here, right?

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:31.740
Is it also on PC over here?

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.780
Everything is on Xbox and PC now, right?

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:35.900
Yeah, it was on PC over.

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:40.700
Yeah, anyway, I heard about that from Extifer actually, and he said it's really awesome.

01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:41.820
I think he only played the beginning.

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:44.940
And then Lion's Song on PC, also July 7th.

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.860
All right, that's it for Europe.

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.380
That's it, that's all I got.

01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.820
There's just a couple more stories for you guys,

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:54.540
then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.500
But first, Loki.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:01.180
All right, so we got some cool news regarding upcoming movies.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:04.300
I'm pretty excited about the sequel, The Wreck-It Ralph,

01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:06.620
which will be coming out in 2018.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.420
And yeah, they haven't really said...

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.220
Oh, March 9th, 2018 is when that'll be coming out.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.260
Nice to have that confirmed,

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:20.300
even though I think some of the voice actors had already spilled that they were working on it.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:21.180
Right, yeah.

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:25.500
And then the live-action Minecraft movie has a release date now as well.

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:31.340
And that's coming out May 24th, 2019.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.820
I still can't believe that's being directed by the guy from It's Always Sunny.

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:37.340
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.900
I don't know, like, I don't know that it sounds awesome.

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.020
It's Mac, it's Mac, yeah.

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.340
Yeah, it sounds incredibly awesome.

01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:43.740
I just...

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:45.900
I'm curious to see what's going on.

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:51.180
I mean, Marvel gets a lot of guys that aren't necessarily super experienced at the big budget

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:51.580
movies.

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:52.700
I think it'll be great.

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.500
So Marvel gets to get a bunch of guys from TV to do their movies.

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.980
I just can't imagine a live-action Minecraft.

01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:58.940
I have no idea.

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.300
But hey, you mean the live-out?

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.380
I think it's supposed to be CG.

01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:04.540
Like, I thought it was supposed to be like a CG movie.

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.900
It probably has a lot of CG.

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:09.660
If they pulled off that Minecraft story mode, like, it's gonna be like that.

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.540
Minecraft story mode was, like, done with, like, in-game graphics.

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:15.580
Like, I can't imagine a live-action movie, like, with people.

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:16.700
I don't see that.

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:20.380
Like, it has to be, like, an animated movie.

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.620
Or, like, some kind of combination or something like that.

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:26.300
Speaking of which, I really want to see the Lego Batman movie when that comes out.

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:27.820
Yeah, that trailer was hilarious.

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:28.320
I love it.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.880
All right, um...

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.400
Going back to Wreck-It Ralph 2 really quick.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.200
Yeah, go for it.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.640
Does anybody else, like, think it's kind of...

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.800
I mean, I haven't read any of the details on it.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.480
But the image is him, like, over all these, like, internet parody sites.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.560
Like, they have Google, but spelled with a U.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.000
So is he just invading the internet?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:44.500
Like, Google?

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.520
Is it not gonna be so...

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.320
Well, yeah, but it has, like, a thing over it.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.200
I don't know.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.320
Anyway, so, yeah, I was like, so is he just gonna be going...

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.520
Is it not really gonna be about gaming?

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.280
Is it just gonna be about him invading the internet?

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.280
Or is it gonna be on a gaming app?

01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:57.920
Like, I don't know.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.520
It's all browser games.

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.960
I just hope it doesn't get too far away from the video game thing.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.800
I know the first movie kind of did that, but...

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.720
It could be more contemporary games, as opposed to, like, throwback references.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.440
But, yeah.

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:10.480
Shiny, yay.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.800
Well, they still were pretty contemporary.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.600
I mean, they have, like, a Call of Duty-type parody and Mario Kart and that type of stuff.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:17.840
True.

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:18.320
Yeah.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.720
By the way, I'm surprised he didn't make me play the breaking news bumper.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.600
No, because I was like, I have to say it now.

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.280
I didn't have time for a breaking news...

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.280
It's an Ivysaur, so it's cool.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.680
Anyway, that was the only thing that kind of concerned me.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.280
I was like, oh, I do want to see more Wreck-It Ralph,

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.240
but I hope it's not just, I don't know, him just invading different websites or whatever.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.280
Did they announce who's, like, signed on for it so far?

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.880
I think it's the original cast that's coming back.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.160
Like, all of them?

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.080
I guess there'd be, like, four real ones.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.880
It's not a huge cast, but I'm pretty sure all the main, all the principles...

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.120
Yeah, Sarah Silverman doesn't have a TV show anymore.

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:51.920
She's, what's she doing?

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.400
Well, on the poster, it's him and Sarah Silverman's character, right?

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.160
So, I'm sure they got the two mains back.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.080
And I'm sure they'll also get Jack McBrayer.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.000
Yeah, what, 30 Rock's been cancelled for years?

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:00.640
What's he doing?

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.480
He just does Conan bits now.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.240
Does he really? That's it?

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.120
He makes cameos as that same guy, like, for the rest of his life.

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.640
That's because he is that guy.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.880
Jane Lynch, what she did, does she still host the Hollywood Game Night thing,

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.000
or did that cancel?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.400
I stopped watching it, but I was watching it.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.520
But I think that's still going.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.840
I think they just drop it in whenever they got room on the NBC schedule,

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.640
because it's cheap to produce.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.840
You'd think I'd be more excited about game shows making this huge comeback on TV,

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:26.560
and I guess I am.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.680
But, you know, Sunday night is now when they've got Family Feud,

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.080
$100,000 pyramid match game are all on Sunday night.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.400
And everything I'm hearing about match game is that it's really good.

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.360
I know I need to watch it.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.840
I didn't watch it last week because all games are and stuff, but yeah.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.040
Yeah, so anyway.

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.480
Well, maybe one reason I don't watch as much TV is because I'm watching live streaming.

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:46.880
And, you know, a lot of that is probably coming from Twitch.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.640
But if you have ever streamed from your PlayStation 4,

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.960
you know that you have several options when it comes to live streaming.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.000
You can stream.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.440
You can do YouTube live as well now, right, on PlayStation 4.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.080
Yes, you can.

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:01.600
Is Daily Motion live or is that just an export video thing?

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.160
I don't know.

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.000
But I don't think they have a live component.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.320
Ustream is the other one that you can stream to, but not for much longer.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:12.800
Sony is going to be revoking support for the Ustream service,

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:15.600
and that's going to end on August 1st, 2016.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.840
So this means that you will no longer even be able to view the Ustream stuff

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:22.720
from live from PlayStation or the Vita or anything.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.080
Does anyone still use Ustream?

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.440
I think that's probably why.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.840
Well, yeah, there's no reason for the termination.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.960
Maybe there's some contract agreement or something like that.

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.000
I wonder if it has to do with the fact that Ustream is the only network

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.320
that will accept the Playroom anymore.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.280
And that's where...

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.840
Remember when PlayStation 4 streaming first started?

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.320
Playroom was hilarious when it first started.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.400
That was where you would see the nastiest shit was on those Playroom streams.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.040
Funniest.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.840
And they're still kind of like trash if you go in there and look.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:52.080
Come on, they're doing strange shit now on Twitch, too.

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:54.560
I read something where they're like watching people eat.

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.880
Yeah, that's funny.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.640
What I learned from watching Playroom on there, other than the obvious stuff,

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:07.520
was that everybody that does that on there has a long couch.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:12.000
One of those ones that does the corner couches that takes up the entire living room,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.160
and they always have a big dog wing on it.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.720
Every time, there's always a big long corner couch and a big old dog sitting on the end,

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.000
and there's whatever going on.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.440
They're smoking and doing whatever.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.760
I'll never forget the night I got the PlayStation 4,

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.080
and I think Shane was living here or something at the time,

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.320
and was like watching, we were just watching some of the streams,

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.880
and like some chick just took her top off, right?

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.040
And like, this is awesome.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.320
Shane was just horrified.

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.680
And I was laughing so hard that I was like crying because I'm like,

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.640
oh my God, these people are drunk and they're going to regret this.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.160
Yeah, people are always drunk, too.

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.000
I remember.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:45.680
All right.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.040
So yeah, no more you stream.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.280
So sadly, this means the end of the play.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:56.960
I feel like there ought to be like one more like great Ustream dumpster fire stream day.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.160
Looks like that's on you, Rob.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.520
On the last day of July.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:00.800
Fire it up.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:07.760
They should just offer streaming for the game or playroom to Chatterbait instead now.

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.600
You know, you think Pornhub ought to get on this, right?

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.080
I'm sure Sony wants that partnership.

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:14.960
I mean, I know.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.720
I'm assuming.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.400
What doesn't Pornhub have?

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.080
They do have a lot of affiliate sites.

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:20.960
They probably own them.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:24.560
I mean, I think the most hilarious thing I saw was that screenshot from

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:31.280
Pornhub that said something like hot British blonde fucks 15 million people all at once.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:33.040
And it's that guy talking about the Brexit.

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:35.840
That was funny.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:38.960
Anyway, let's let's you know what?

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.160
Let's go to a simpler time.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:44.640
Let's take a step back into a time when we didn't we didn't have streaming pornography.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:48.000
If you wanted to if you wanted pornography, you had to wait for like

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:54.480
the lingerie catalogs to get delivered in the mail or a dirty magazine because there

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.920
was no such thing as streaming pornography.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:00.000
It's a simple time where we take a step back and look at a classic video game.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.240
And usually Dark Sakura will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.600
is worthy of your attention.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.360
However, she's not here this week.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.040
So we have an OLR first, I believe.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.440
I don't think this has ever been done before.

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:20.000
We have a joint choice for Classic Game of the Week between Flaco, Jones and Shane have

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:20.720
both yet.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:25.360
And I'll have you know that I did petition for a certain game, but was unfortunately

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:28.880
denied despite the fact that we had a perfect scenario here.

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.000
So blame it on all them.

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:31.760
Tough.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.080
What is the classic game of the week?

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.040
Flaco and Shane.

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.960
We didn't even rehearse how we're going to do.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.400
No, we really didn't talk.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.080
So you go, Shane.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.440
I talked last on UK.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.200
So, OK, I'll say the name of the title.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:46.480
Totally rad for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:54.560
Oh, there's the music from 1990 Japan and in Europe in 1991 in North America.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.280
Yeah.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:00.160
I like how the release date, at least on the wiki, says that Europe just got it in 1990.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.440
It's not more specific.

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.240
Yeah, that's funny.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.320
Sometime in 1990, they got it.

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.520
This nebulous year.

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:09.520
All right.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.960
So what are we talking about?

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.440
I don't know.

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.280
I first found out about this game on Games Done Quick.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.360
And I think it was Awful Games Done Quick.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.520
Did I say that we should watch it?

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.160
Because this is a game from my.

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.760
We always watch the Awful Games Done Quick.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.200
And you had actually said you played this game.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:25.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.200
This is a game from my childhood.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.760
I played the heck out of this game when I was younger.

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.680
And I remember it being really fun.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.520
But my memory was clearly tainted.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.560
Or I was just remembering the dialogue.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.560
Because when we watched it on Awful Games Done Quick, it was pretty awful.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.000
It's a terrible game.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.240
But the cutscenes alone, I think Rob's watching them right now, are so hilarious.

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:47.680
It's what makes it a classic game.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.200
So we don't have to respect the guys giving the week this week.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.880
You can all rip on it and say how terrible it is.

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.160
Yeah, it's not a good game.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.800
We are literally picking this because it is a funny, funny, funny dialogue.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:02.000
Dark Soccer does not always pick games that she thinks are good.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:02.480
That's true.

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.840
She just thinks they're noteworthy.

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.000
Yes.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.400
So you can go for this game.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.080
Maybe you guys should read some dialogue.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.760
Well, no, we'll do that.

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.360
Yeah, let's talk about what it is.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.960
Talk about what it is and you can describe it.

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.640
So it's just a somewhat typical side scroller.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.760
You play as Jake in the American version.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:28.560
And basically, you know this crazy magician guy who's training you to use magic.

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.400
And all of a sudden, your girlfriend gets kidnapped.

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.600
And other people get kidnapped.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.200
And you're on a quest to save them all.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.640
In Japan, it was called Magic John.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:41.840
I don't know why we didn't keep that name.

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.880
It's pretty good.

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.680
I'm going to assume it has to do with the basketball player Magic Johnson, who they

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.960
didn't want confusion.

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:49.680
I don't know.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.440
I just thought it's not a magic toilet.

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:52.800
I guess that would make sense why they would change it.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.600
Just a lucky guess.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.080
And he is learning magic in the game, in the plot of the game.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:56.400
Yeah.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.040
From Zebediah, who has a P on his hat.

01:35:59.040 --> 01:35:59.200
Yeah.

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.400
Which stands for Zebediah.

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:00.720
Yeah.

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.720
To Zebediah, the P-acyllic.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.680
And it's not a very good game.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.360
You get different power-ups, so you can become like an eagle thing.

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.880
You can become like a lion thing.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:15.920
It's not good.

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:16.160
Yeah.

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.520
It's like a bad kind of Mega Man-ish rip-off.

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.600
It really does look like shit.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.200
Like, it gets worse.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.960
Because you're just looking at the first stage.

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:25.200
Yeah.

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.120
It gets way, way worse.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.920
But some of the designs are hilarious.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.640
There's this punk popcorn boss thing.

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:41.120
It's a stick of corn that's in a late 80s, early 90s biker gang.

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.920
It's got a mohawk and piercings.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.880
But it is a big ear of corn.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:50.320
And this guy right now that's on the video, he's throwing pizzas at you.

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.360
I don't know what they are.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.800
Maybe they're supposed to be boulders.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.200
I'm sure the Japanese game makes a lot more sense.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.880
Because they did not translate it word for word.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.560
Instead of getting a story, I'm guessing the Japanese had.

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.360
They kind of stuck with the premise.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:11.520
But all the dialogue is in surfer lingo and late 80s speak.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.120
And it is so funny.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.320
Sorry to interrupt, but here it is.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.680
This is the best line in the game.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.040
Jake, they're like, stealing me or something.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.360
And that's the female damsel in this dress after she gets kidnapped.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.400
She says, Jake, they're like, stealing me or something.

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.840
There are so many best lines in this game.

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.800
That's the best line.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.480
They're like, stealing me or something.

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.040
Wait, wait, wait.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:31.600
I'm going to count it.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.640
Because there's a game.

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:34.400
Jake was attacked by surprise.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.880
Which is like, oh, surprise is attacking me.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.960
There is a fact on Game Facts that just has the dialogue.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.520
So something that I really like.

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:46.720
Let me pull it up here.

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.280
And the music right now while you're pulling that up.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.320
I love this music the most.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.520
Can you turn this up just a little?

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.920
It's like a weird twist on the circus theme.

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.200
Well, that doesn't sound the same as what I heard yesterday.

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.320
Anyway, it was more like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.360
Good job, Flago.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:05.680
I know.

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.320
I blew that one.

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.560
But I swear it was different when I listened to it the other day.

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.360
So this is the dialogue in Act 2-3 according to the fact I'm reading.

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.320
And I remember this dialogue.

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.000
I just don't know if that's the right way to categorize it.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.160
So the characters are Jake and Allison.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.080
So it looks like you've already rescued Allison.

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.440
So here's what she says.

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:26.480
Jake, I'm like, really nervous.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.240
Because I think that that typo is in the game.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.000
Like, my dad tried to save me.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.600
And now they've got him too.

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.280
I don't know what they've done with him.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.800
Jake, no way.

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.680
He's the gnarliest professor on the coast.

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.880
So it's your dad they really want, Allison.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:45.440
Jake, I kind of want my dad back, you know?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.800
Jake, that's totally understandable.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.400
Wow, how about if I save him?

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.960
He's such a take charge hero.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.640
I really respect that about him.

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:55.360
So good.

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.200
I mean, I love this game and the cutscene so much.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.040
This is like, if you follow me on Twitter,

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:04.240
at Flaco Jones, this is my avatar is Jake from Totally Rad.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.880
And my name is like Totally Flaco on there.

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:10.640
So this is like actually the showgirls of video games, it seems.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.280
Probably.

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:11.600
Maybe.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:12.160
It's so bad.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.680
Because the dialogue's so shitty.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:16.960
Excuse me, we just talked about how great it was.

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:18.720
Well, you don't know shit.

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.040
Also, one thing to mention.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.920
Weirdly enough, when they brought it over also,

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.440
um, the character models in the,

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:30.240
I guess what you would call cutscenes, look different.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.040
So in the Japanese one, they're very like Japanese animation style.

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.680
But in the American one, I'm guessing in the European one,

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.360
that's really sometime in 1990, according to legends,

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.880
they redid them to look older.

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:51.120
And it's, I guess, just like typical, like, like Allison looks like,

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.640
you know, kind of like she talks like a valley girl.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.480
She kind of looks like the typical valley girl.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.160
I don't know about Jake though, his hair's kind of weird.

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.000
I don't know what he's supposed to look like.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.040
I think it's almost like because it's drawing so much,

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.360
it's almost like they combined Bill and Ted into one person.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:06.720
Yeah, yeah, I would say that's an accurate representation.

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.640
Oh, there's the corn cob guy.

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:13.120
Yeah, see, he is an ear of corn that is also like in a biker gang.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.200
He's got little tight pants on.

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:15.680
It's great.

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:18.560
And high heels.

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:22.800
I think this might, it might be a feminine character, actually.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.280
I don't know.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.760
No, it's wearing like a vest and nothing else.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.000
What? I don't want to, I don't want to sit here and try to decide.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.440
Why?

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.040
Were there any of the great lines you can remember?

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.760
I know like there was a point where, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:38.800
They, the professor and Allison just show up out of nowhere.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.680
And Jake's like, how did you get here?

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.680
And they're like, oh, we took the Hollywood freeway.

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.960
Are they in a spaceship or something?

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:45.840
They're underground.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:46.560
They're underground.

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.360
But in the original game, I believe they're in a spaceship.

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:51.920
That's the other thing.

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:52.480
It's kind of funny.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.440
They say they're underground.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.160
It's like, there's really like aliens and stuff involved.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.600
And it's great.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.480
And at the end, when Zebediah leaves you, he says, Jake, you've been most excellent.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.120
By now, you know, I'm one of the underground people.

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.160
I don't know if this is a typo.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:08.800
A doggy.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.200
I don't know.

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:10.640
That was the bad guy.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:10.960
Yeah.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:11.920
Has been destroyed.

01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.240
So I'm going back, back to my own people, back to my own world.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.640
You've been a totally decent apprentice.

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.560
Maybe we can do lunch sometime.

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.200
Later, dude.

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.720
And then Jake's like Zebediah, dude.

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.120
Oh yeah.

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.440
And Alison constantly like locks herself in the trunk.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:35.840
Because she's learning magic as like, like almost like a magician's assistant locking

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.800
herself in a trunk.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.120
Yeah.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.440
And then he talks about like copacetic.

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.040
He's like talking here.

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.600
He's like, it's totally tranquil, Alison.

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.160
I love this game.

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.000
So yeah, I think that's, I think that's about it.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:50.880
Yeah, that's really it.

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.360
Everybody should go like, you know, watch a let's play.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:53.600
What?

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.960
No, they should watch the AGDQ version.

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:00.720
Yeah, because they actually, they called it cut scene percentage on AGDQ.

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.400
So they didn't, even though it was a speed run, they left all the cut scenes intact so

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.360
you could watch them.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.480
They kind of read along with it.

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.040
Yeah, they do.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:07.360
Yeah.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.800
So there's kind of like a laugh track going on.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:09.440
It's fun.

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.000
It's funny.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.720
I would recommend people watch that because the actual gameplay stuff they get through

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:14.480
quickly and then the cut scenes, they read them.

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:18.480
And you can see how bad the game is because they, they like point out like where like

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.560
it just drops to like one frame a second.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:23.200
Basically it's, this is a bad game.

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:28.320
It's a classic classic game of the week.

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:31.040
Totally rad, which is totally bad.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.520
And that makes me totally sad.

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.680
Again, you weren't listening to anything we said.

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.960
No, it's bad as in good.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.640
Cause that's what they said back then.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:41.920
That's right.

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.320
I can reread that dialogue, Shane.

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:44.820
All right.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.960
We're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, there is more news to come.

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:52.400
And there's also some rapid fire news and some emails as well.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:57.440
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:10.240
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, July the 3rd of 2016 with episode

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:16.640
number 648 of our show already in progress, joined in studio tonight by our pals, Flaco

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.480
Jones and Shane here in studio.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:22.480
Of course, myself and Loki not here tonight, Dark Sakura, you know, something I forgot

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.640
to talk about during my gaming week that I did play this week.

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:27.440
Cause I talked about how I went to round one again this week and I was kind of like, Oh,

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:28.160
music games.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.120
I'm like 25 again.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.160
This is so fun.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:36.880
But one of my pals, um, actually owns at her house, a dance maniacs machine and which was

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.840
the classic game of the week.

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:41.520
Like last week or two weeks ago, last week was, was actually dance maniacs.

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.600
So I actually got to play that game again last week.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.160
And you know, you know what my impression was after I played the game.

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.320
I want one of those machines.

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.440
Like, I think that is the Bemadi machine I want to have in my house.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.160
And to be honest, those are really cheap too.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.080
I can't, you gotta help me find one Loki.

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.280
Cause I don't even know where I can find one right now, but that's, I just joined the Facebook

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.320
group that I'm on and they put all sorts of stuff up there.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.840
They list all the different Craigslist ads.

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:04.560
Maybe I'll do that.

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.200
Alan's in the kitchen.

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.120
Alan, can you, can you not wait for me to buy a dance maniacs machine to put in this

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:09.680
house somewhere?

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:12.400
He just gave a very fake.

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.320
I still want a DDR machine.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.800
I know there is no way the wife's gonna allow that to happen.

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.040
No, you'll never, you'll never get one of those.

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:20.080
You could store it here though.

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.520
Just put a blanket over it.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.880
She'll never know.

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.720
She will know cause she goes in the garage.

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:28.800
But like, um, or at least I've rebuilt my pants.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:34.720
I have stuff like I bought sheet metal like years ago at this point to redo them.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.520
And I have like parts for it, but I just never got around to it.

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.920
I was going to move my arcade cabinet to the garage too.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:43.600
Well, you know, what's also interesting is that she also owns the, um, para para machine

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:48.640
that used to be at arcade infinity years ago, years and years ago that they, they own it

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.200
now.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.880
Um, so I thought that was pretty cool.

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.720
And they, they did something, they switched something in it.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.240
So it doesn't run off a hard drive anymore.

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.680
It runs off a flash card.

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.440
And so it loads like instantly, like it's like way faster than those machines used to

01:44:59.440 --> 01:44:59.760
be.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.960
So it's kind of interesting how some of the advances in technology actually affect these

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:04.560
arcade games from like 15 years ago.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.160
It's kind of, kind of awesome.

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:12.240
So yeah, now I'm on that kick where I'm like, I could, I could buy an arcade game for the

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:12.640
house.

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.280
I'm worth it.

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:13.840
Right.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.920
I can get my baby Pac-Man machine someday.

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:18.880
Cause I always said I would buy that machine at some point.

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:27.440
So we'll see, um, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, um, act deft, uh, saying

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.280
dark soccer would be sad because rageinator clearly didn't know, uh, the classic game

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.040
of the week last week.

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.320
Uh, and uh, yeah, Akuma JP saying, oh, it's 4th of July here.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.840
So it's, it's early cause he's over in Japan.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.680
So it's early 4th of July there.

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.720
Uh, probably not the day off like everybody has here tomorrow.

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:44.400
It's kind of, I don't have the day off.

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.000
Well, sucks to be you.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.600
Uh, yeah, me too.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.280
Uh, I had a four day weekend.

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:49.760
That's fine.

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.160
I'll just get paid basically double time and a half.

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:53.760
So whatever, whatever.

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:57.680
Um, one other thing I want to bring up, speaking of like money type stuff, uh, steam sales

01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.400
still going on.

01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.680
And during the break, we were briefly talking about it because Loki was like, when's that

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:02.160
thing over?

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.160
And it is over 10 o'clock AM our time on the 4th.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.760
So it's pretty much in its last hours.

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.160
There's probably like 14 hours left in the sale.

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:14.560
Uh, I have yet to buy a game in the sale, which is kind of surprising for me, but I

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.200
feel like everything that's on my wishlist that I'm considering buying is like, it would

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.560
be nice to have.

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:25.760
But then I look at my gaming backlog and I'm like, uh, you got to play that stuff first.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:29.520
You, you literally just got grand theft auto five and fallout four for plays.

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.520
Like you don't need to buy more fucking steam games right now.

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.640
Pokemon.

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:32.960
Yeah.

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:34.880
See, then I have to hear that too.

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:38.240
If I end up buying grim Dawn or one of those games that's on my list that I actually want

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:38.560
to play.

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.840
So I, yeah, I keep buying stuff anyways.

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.880
Like some things like are really cheap and it's just impulse buys.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.800
Like, especially when stuff gets down to like $10 on PlayStation four or something like

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:52.640
that, it's like, you know, I want to play need for speed or dragon Asian acquisition.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.480
I probably won't get around to it right away, but I went ahead and purchased those anyways

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.480
cause they were cheap.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.120
So why not?

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:01.440
Well, we'll see.

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:04.800
We'll see if I can go 14 more hours without making a purchase or if I finally crack and

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.760
buy something tonight.

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:11.200
Although to be fair, dark Sakura bought me the shower with your dad simulator game because

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.560
it was not even a dollar.

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.040
And so that was a part of the steam sale.

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.840
She bought me for my birthday, but she also bought me, I should mention this, the steam

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.720
controller.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:21.760
Um, and I just picked that up yesterday, so I haven't been able to play a game with it

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.200
yet, but I've just been kind of like touching the controller and I kind of like it, but

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:28.000
it appears I'm the only one in studio that really likes the controller.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:28.560
Okay.

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.920
It's, it's neat, I guess.

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.440
Not if I just would have to try it out.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.480
I mean it, I don't know.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:33.040
It's different.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:33.200
Yeah.

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.240
I don't want to, I don't want to give like a final say until I actually play some games

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:38.000
with it, but I like, I like the way it feels.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.360
I like the big disc great.

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.400
I liked all the buttons.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:41.520
It's very clicky.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.240
I just, I mean, I'm just not sure about those giant pads and it's nice that it still has

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:50.320
the analog stick and the regular buttons on it too, but they're very pushed to the inside

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:52.880
because of the giant, like touch pads.

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.880
And so that part isn't super comfortable.

01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.320
I'd be curious to see how it could, I think it'd be kind of neat.

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:02.400
I mean, it just, I just have to see how it plays out in the game.

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:04.400
Well, it's kind of a really nice feel to it.

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.200
I like it a lot.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:05.440
All right.

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:08.480
We are going to be welcoming your phone calls this segment as well, a little later, not

01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:11.600
just yet, but you can give us a call on Skype, orange lounge radio.

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.120
All one word is our username on Skype.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.640
That's orange lounge radio.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.960
If, um, you know, if you're using, uh, Skype on your computer, as opposed to a smartphone

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.480
or something like that, you might want to call echo one, two, three first to make sure

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:23.440
your connection works.

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.520
Before you give us a call, we'll be opening that up on about 30 to 45 minutes, but first

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:28.640
we have some news to get through.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.840
We'll start with Loki.

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:33.600
Um, yeah, so this was something that's been teased to be coming out for a while now.

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.480
Um, at least people finding different retail list listings and whatnot, but, um, now they

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.400
finally announced that the BioShock, uh, collection will be coming out and it's going to be BioShock

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:51.680
one, two, and infinite, and that's going to be coming out pretty soon here.

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:57.920
Uh, they were going to be remastering BioShock one and two, and what's kind of a nice, um,

01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:01.800
and I think they did this with Skyrim, you know, or they will be doing this with Skyrim

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.720
when it comes out later on this year.

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:09.320
Um, if you already own BioShock one and two, you get that free remaster or you get a free

01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.280
remaster once these come out.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.840
So that's going to be pretty awesome.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.560
Um, the only thing it does not have is the multiplayer from BioShock two.

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.960
So they're not going to be bringing that, but who gives a shit?

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:21.960
Yeah.

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.480
I said all single player DLC and I think that's all.

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:27.360
And I never played the Minerva's den for BioShock two, which I never did that.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:34.200
And I never finished the, the one burial at sea for BioShock infinite, which it was really

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:38.080
good, but I just, I moved the PS3 to the back bedroom TVs and I was nice back there.

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:39.080
So I never finished it.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.080
I never finished two.

01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.520
I just didn't get really drawn in.

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:44.000
Two is really good towards the end.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.680
Like I know it's kind of repetitive early on, but two gets really good.

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:49.560
The last like third of the game is amazing.

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.560
Yeah.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:55.960
So that'll be coming out later, um, on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC again.

01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:01.840
Um, but like I said, you know, a night might be a good idea since if maybe you're not interested

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.800
in purchasing this all over again and say you own infinite and not the other two, I

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.640
bet the other two are on sale right now in the steam store.

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:12.280
So if you want to get that on PC, now might be the time to do that.

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.280
You get that free upgrade.

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:17.600
So I want this on PS4, I'm very excited that it's coming out.

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:18.600
Yeah.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.080
I'd like to play through BioShock one again.

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.080
Infinite was great.

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.080
Infinite was good.

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.280
I never played one cause it scared me.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.280
I did.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:28.280
And I own one and two on PS3 like cause they were PlayStation plus games I think at some

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.280
point.

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.280
They were all PlayStation plus games.

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:31.280
Infinite was too?

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.280
Infinite was too.

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:33.280
Yeah.

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.280
That's hilarious.

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.280
That's why I bought a burial at sea cause I'd only originally rented infinite, but then

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.280
when it was free, I bought it.

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.280
I mean, I didn't buy it.

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:40.920
I downloaded it and then I bought the DLC cause I'm like, well, I should buy the DLC

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:46.080
since they're giving it to me for free and uh, but I still never finished it.

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:47.080
All right.

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:51.600
And then, um, let's see here on top of that, if you're not looking to necessarily purchase

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:57.800
new games, but you have a subscription to either PlayStation plus or Xbox live, um,

01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:01.040
gold, you can look forward to some new games this month.

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:06.120
So starting off with, um, Xbox live, you're going to be getting, um, let's see in the

01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:11.200
beginning of the month, the bear saga two on Xbox one and tumbles.

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.200
Let's see.

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.320
That's going to be the first half of month or actually the whole month, July 1st through

01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:18.840
July 31st and then tumble stone will be July 16th through August 15th.

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:22.720
That's weird how they kind of offset those and then Xbox three 60 you'll be getting rainbow

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:27.640
six Vegas two for the first half of the month and try on evolution for the second half of

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:28.640
the month.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:31.700
And remember those are going to be backwards compatible as well with the Xbox one.

01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:36.040
So I don't have yet to play Toronto evolution, but I think I have the disc on three 60.

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:39.480
This was kind of interesting that it's coming out now for, actually I think I have it on

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.680
PlayStation, not three 60 because I borrowed it from you and I beat it.

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.680
Oh, there you go.

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.680
No, I have it on PlayStation.

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.680
Yeah.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.680
It was actually pretty fun.

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:50.800
I mean, it wasn't great, but it was fun to play for free on PlayStation plus.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:55.800
Um, as I mentioned in our games that are coming out this week, fury is a game that's coming

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:58.180
out, which looks pretty fantastic.

01:51:58.180 --> 01:51:59.840
So definitely check that out.

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:04.540
I'm also on PlayStation four gain saints row got out of the hell.

01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:08.520
So if you played through, you know, saints row four and that type of stuff and you're

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.020
looking for another game, it was all right.

01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.860
I played through the whole thing.

01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:13.500
Um, it's different.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:16.080
I guess at least it was a new map.

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:17.080
So I give them that.

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:20.700
But you know, it's basically just another re-skin of saints row the third.

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:23.440
I had a quick question on that one for people that might know better.

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.660
Is that, so that's just a standalone, you know, it is a standalone game, but they never

01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:28.660
made four free.

01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:34.220
Did they, or they did on Xbox, funny enough, um, saints row, saints row for you was a free

01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:39.420
on, on Xbox, saints row four was, um, maybe he's on PS three.

01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:40.420
It was free or something.

01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:43.060
It was on, it was free for, it was on PS three.

01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:45.780
I know at one time, I think I know it's in my library.

01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:50.920
I purchased the bundle together because they had got out of hell and saints row four remastered.

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.220
So that was something that was being sold.

01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:56.220
I was hoping it was the collection together, but it's still just a standalone, just a standalone

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.860
game, um, which is fine.

01:52:57.860 --> 01:52:58.980
Maybe they'll do that another month.

01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:01.820
It'll be saints row four or something, but got a hell is not bad.

01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:03.580
I mean, I check it out.

01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:04.980
It's, you know, it's free.

01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:09.140
Um, so aside from PlayStation four though, they have call Juarez bound in blood on PS

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:15.580
three fat princess on PS three and then on the Vita, um, or a Sheikah or was it array

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:21.300
Sheikah Sheikah, uh, tainted bloodlines and Prince of Persia revelation.

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:29.100
So those would be for July and finally a doom is getting an update.

01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:30.100
That's right.

01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.100
The brand new doom.

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:35.940
And one of the cool things that they're adding to that is the gun placement will be in the

01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:39.120
center of the screen or classic doom weapon placement mode.

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.180
They have that.

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.180
So that's kind of neat.

01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:43.320
It kind of a little bit of a throwback there.

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:49.340
They've also added photo mode to the game as well so you can take pictures of stuff.

01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:50.340
Cool.

01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:51.340
That might be one of those games.

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:54.540
I try the steam controller with cause I have do you know, photo modes, one of the things

01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:57.660
you can do in grand theft auto, you can take selfies and stuff and take pictures of your

01:53:57.660 --> 01:53:58.660
camera phone in there.

01:53:58.660 --> 01:53:59.660
Awesome.

01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:02.620
You can like murder somebody and take a picture of the corpse and they have all the like tumbler

01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:05.340
filters and everything in there, like all sorts of cool stuff.

01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:06.340
All right.

01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:07.340
I'll get to that eventually.

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.340
I enjoyed what I played.

01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:12.180
It's just, you know, unfortunately, uh, if the game hadn't taken like 20 hours to install,

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:14.620
that is unfortunate, but yeah, it'll be worth it though.

01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:16.340
The game was fantastic.

01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:20.860
Uh, let's, uh, talk about metal slug because it seems like, boy, these games get re-released

01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:25.140
all the time and uh, sure enough, here comes another release of metal slug.

01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:29.120
The metal slug anthology is coming to the PlayStation four.

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:34.120
It's part of the PlayStation two classics that will be available on PlayStation four

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.160
that is being released on Tuesday.

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:38.280
Uh, so you can check that out.

01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:43.680
And there's also a Vita PSP version that you can get for $20 that has already been out.

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:49.720
But this, uh, this anthology that has the first six games and metal slug X, uh, that

01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:54.820
was out for PS2, the Wii and PlayStation portable in 2007, uh, that is going to be, uh, coming

01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:55.820
out this Tuesday.

01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:59.740
So for you metal slug fans, uh, hooray, get excited.

01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:06.500
Uh, also as mentioned in the opening by Jason, uh, dance, dance revolution, a or ACE, uh,

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:09.980
is, uh, going to be apparently coming out pretty soon.

01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:15.300
Um, United States based round one locations are going to get DDR ACE this month.

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:20.460
Uh, apparently Dave and busters will also be getting this game.

01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:27.460
Uh, they are saying that it was as of July 1st making its way out to the stores.

01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:31.580
So Dave and busters may be starting to install these games already as they are making their

01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:35.300
way from, uh, the Los Angeles port where these things are delivered.

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:37.620
Uh, so you can check that out.

01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:40.980
Uh, apparently there will be more information on EMUs and what to look forward to with all

01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:42.340
that later this week.

01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:46.460
So next time we go to round one, Shane, they'll probably have DDR ACE there, which probably

01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:50.420
won't play it now, which I don't know what's in it that it will be very exciting, but it

01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:51.500
will, you never know.

01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:54.900
There might be, there might be a new smile, DK song I hadn't heard yet.

01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.900
So we'll see.

01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:58.860
I, I will pass on that when I go back to round one.

01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:00.860
Is the new thing they're adding pachinko slots?

01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:06.380
No, I don't, I think music games are like one of the few things that Konami oddly enough

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:10.820
after all these years and all the shit we've given them about missteps in the past, the

01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:14.340
music game seems to be kind of the one thing that they're kind of like, they're still gung

01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:15.340
ho for.

01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:16.340
Yeah.

01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:17.380
They're kind of not fucking with the formula there.

01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:22.340
So, and, and they have newer, like they have this sound voltex and music, like they're

01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:23.580
doing new things with it.

01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:29.060
So it's kind of hard to complain, I suppose, uh, street fighter five, which, you know,

01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:33.940
just recently had the story mode patch has had a deep discount, no, not deep discount,

01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:35.900
but discount enough for a new game on steam.

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:39.260
And I think on a recent PlayStation sale, they really want you to buy street fighter

01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:40.260
five.

01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:43.540
Well, uh, no more and more eyes are going to be on street fighter five.

01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:50.600
That's because on Sunday, July 17th, ESPN two is going to be televising Evos street

01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.180
fighter five world championship.

01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.860
And that's going to be at seven o'clock Pacific on Sunday, July 17th.

01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:59.860
Again, that's live from Mandalay Bay where Evo is happening.

01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:04.900
So, um, that's pretty exciting that it's going to have that type of coverage on television.

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:05.900
It's not even on the Ocho.

01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:07.580
No, it is not on the Ocho.

01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:08.580
It's on ESP.

01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:09.580
It's on the dose.

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:10.580
Number two.

01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:11.580
Uh, let's see.

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:12.580
We have a couple on the number two.

01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:17.300
Which I don't, some fighting game fans kind of feel that street fighter five is number

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:20.020
two, but that's, some people also really like it.

01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:21.020
So we'll see.

01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:22.020
All right.

01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:23.140
Uh, we got a couple more stories here.

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:24.140
I think Shane first.

01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:25.140
Yep.

01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:31.060
So, uh, poke in tournament in Japan, uh, they have an arcade version of it and on July 20th,

01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:34.360
they are getting, um, some characters we already have on the Wii U version.

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:38.420
They're getting Garchomp, Brakeson and shadow Mewtwo.

01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:42.120
However, they are also getting a brand new character.

01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:45.160
It's going to be a real full-fledged character, not just like support.

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:53.760
Um, there is rumors, uh, of who it could be because the Wii U had an update that had some

01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:55.320
files data mined.

01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:04.000
So right now people believe it's either going to be Scizor, um, Darkrai or Empoleon, uh,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
but we're not sure.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.720
And we will find out, uh, on July 14th, um, through a live stream on NicoNico if you're

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:11.720
in Japan.

01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:13.720
I'm sure it'll leak to the web everywhere.

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:19.300
So you can probably expect that character to become DLC for the Wii U one.

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:24.180
It is very interesting how Pokken will bring a lot of these lesser known Pokemon to people's

01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:27.300
attention other than like the base 151.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:28.300
You know what I mean?

01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:29.300
Thank God.

01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:34.540
I was expecting it to be possibly somebody from the new generation, but, and before I

01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:38.080
heard the whole, Oh, we data mined these things here.

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:41.120
So I'd be fine with either of those three.

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:47.440
My gut, if it is one of those three is it's going to be Scizor, but I would prefer Empoleon

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:48.980
or Darkrai.

01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:53.800
Do you think maybe one of those is the fighter and then the other two are like a new support

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:56.200
bracket that's coming out?

01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:04.080
I guess it could, but out of those three, I would only see really maybe Darkrai being

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:07.720
a support character, but stranger things have happened.

01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:10.920
I guess, uh, we'll find out on the 14th.

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:11.920
All right.

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:13.440
Uh, Flaco, how about you?

01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:14.440
Yeah.

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.440
Uh, let's see here.

01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:22.440
The Nintendo, my Nintendo is adding new rewards and discounts to their whatever you'd call

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.560
it, like refresh service.

01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:30.240
It's you know, it's the old way you would open up the package and you have like a code

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.840
in there and you'd put it in and you get the, you get free stuff.

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:35.280
Now it's based on what you buy.

01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:39.260
The problem I have with it is like, I've been supporting the Wii U pretty well, so I have

01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:41.420
most of these games already.

01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:45.180
And the, the one thing that kind of stood out to me is I'm not going to read down this

01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:46.180
whole list.

01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:50.660
We can go check them out, you know, somewhere, but uh, no free game for silver.

01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:51.660
This time.

01:59:51.660 --> 01:59:52.660
Last time they had that one pick cross game.

01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:53.660
I don't have a 3DS.

01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:57.580
I didn't get to play it anyway, but they had that this time.

01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:04.640
The only free ones are, are with gold coins, uh, Metroid 2, 3DS, Wario Land 3, 3DS, Super

02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:10.440
Mario 3 Wii U, Donkey Kong 3, 3DS, Super Mario Kart Wii U, Virtual Console and Mario Kart

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:13.200
8 DLC pack one.

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:16.120
So those are all the ones that are free and then there's a bunch of discounts too.

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:20.520
But again, most of the stuff I already own or just don't care about and I feel like the

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:23.080
service is really going to shine when the next system comes out.

02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:26.400
It's just weird that they implemented it while the Wii U is pretty much done.

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:31.480
You get this for buying new games, by the way, there's no new games coming up and like

02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:33.000
you get it by buying digitally.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.080
Well if you have a Wii, that's kind of hard sometimes.

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:36.560
Yeah, yeah, and it's only for digitally.

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:40.120
So if you go buy disc games and say you really want to get Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.000
on disc, you're not going to get any points for it.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.720
I think it was launched more for Miitomo's benefit.

02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:45.720
Yeah.

02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:46.720
So once more these mobile games.

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:47.720
So what do you do with Miitomo?

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.720
Cause I see the coins.

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:51.560
They have like a separate thing from Miitomo.

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:52.560
They count as silver coins.

02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:56.140
They still count as silver coins, but silver coins only get you discounts in that one game

02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:57.680
they gave out the first time.

02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:59.260
So you can earn that with Miitomo.

02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:00.260
And they have a couple of crappy themes.

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:02.520
So what do you get platinum coins from?

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:07.200
Well, I guess from doing little quests and stuff, like if you go to the My Nintendo website,

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:08.200
there's hidden things.

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:09.320
There's like a, there's like a question.

02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:10.600
There's like a coin block at the bottom.

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:12.000
If you tap on it, you'll get some coins from that.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.400
But those are, those are still silver coins.

02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:14.400
That's the thing though.

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:15.400
Those are silver.

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.400
I thought you said.

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.400
Oh, platinum?

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.400
No, yeah.

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.400
There's no platinum.

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:20.400
There's no platinum anymore.

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:21.400
It's just gold or silver.

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:22.400
Sorry.

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.400
I thought I had platinum and gold.

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:24.400
It was like gold slash platinum.

02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:25.400
I think I'm logging in right now.

02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.400
I think platinum and silver are the same thing.

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.940
It's just we're calling them different things here in the room.

02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:30.200
There's Miitomo.

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:31.360
There's Miitomo coins.

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:32.720
There's silver coins.

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:33.720
And gold.

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:34.720
And gold.

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.720
That's it.

02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:36.720
Yeah.

02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:37.720
Okay.

02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:38.720
Yeah.

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:39.720
There's no platinum.

02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:40.720
Platinum was in the old way.

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:41.720
Yeah.

02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:42.720
I missed.

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:44.640
They need an app or something for that thing because like I can't remember the login on

02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:45.920
their stupid website for it.

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:46.920
Yeah.

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:47.920
You just have to go to the web.

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:48.920
Mobile web works fine.

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:49.920
It works fine on mobile web.

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:50.920
It's a good thing.

02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:51.920
Yeah.

02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.200
Sometimes it doesn't work the same on here as it does on my PC though.

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:56.960
Like I can't, I don't get a lot of the secrets on mobile that I would on PC.

02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:57.960
Interesting.

02:01:57.960 --> 02:01:58.960
I've noticed.

02:01:58.960 --> 02:01:59.960
My little guy is holding a question block.

02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:00.960
Okay.

02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:01.960
Rapid fire.

02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:02.960
So next story.

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:03.960
Oh, sorry.

02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:05.960
Well, I was just gonna say, I really wish we could just have Club Nintendo back.

02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.280
I really do not like my Nintendo whatsoever.

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:11.120
But I think this will be better when the next system comes out.

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.120
Yeah.

02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:13.120
I'll wait for edX before I-

02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:15.840
But I want like physical cool goods like you got from Club Nintendo.

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:16.840
That was so neat.

02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:17.840
Yeah, that was true.

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:18.840
That was kind of cool.

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:19.840
I still use like five pouches.

02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:20.840
I'd prefer games but-

02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:21.840
I don't know.

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:25.160
I got way more free games with Club Nintendo than I could ever get or even want to get

02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:26.160
from this one.

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:27.160
Yeah.

02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:28.160
So it's kind of sad.

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.160
The rewards are not as good here.

02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:31.040
And they'll get better when the next system comes out.

02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:35.880
The story I really want to talk about at the next one, the final Splatfest has been announced.

02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:36.880
I'm sad.

02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:40.040
And I know it's going to be Callie versus Marie.

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.040
Also sad.

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:47.120
And I think everybody made the same like summation I did when they wrapped up the previous Splatfest

02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:50.720
and they kind of ended it with, you know, well, next time we're playing for keeps.

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.720
I didn't know it meant the last one.

02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:53.640
I just thought, oh, because their amiibo are coming out.

02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:57.000
So the final Splatfest will be Callie versus Marie, but they'll do more after that.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.440
But no, they've announced like, this is it.

02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:03.600
This is the final Splatfest, which is like, how hard is it to just put two topics up like

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:08.280
once every two months and pick two colors, like, is it really that much to code?

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.280
But I guess it is.

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.720
And the team is obviously working on a Splatoon 2 or a Splatoon remaster for the next Nintendo

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:14.720
system.

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.680
So maybe that's when Splatfest will come back if there's like a remaster, obviously a sequel.

02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:24.600
So it's a little sad to see it going away, but I'm excited to play it.

02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.640
I still don't know which team to pick.

02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.480
It's like, uh, with, well, it's going to be purple and green, right?

02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:31.480
Yeah.

02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:32.480
Purple.

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:33.480
Easy.

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:34.480
That's it.

02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:35.480
I thought you like greens.

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:36.480
My favorite color.

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:37.480
I don't like the, I don't like the green.

02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:39.800
And I don't like the green and splatoon neon yellow.

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:40.800
It's not green.

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:42.440
I like, like dark green forest green.

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:43.440
Fine.

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:46.240
I like, I like a lot of shades of green, but not like baby poop green.

02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.240
Yeah.

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.240
I don't understand why they use that.

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:49.240
It's neon.

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:50.720
It's I think they even literally call it the game neon green.

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:52.440
It's like, oh, it's gross.

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:53.880
Looks more like neon yellow to me.

02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:55.360
So yeah, I don't know which team I'm going.

02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:58.000
I think I'm going to go Marie cause she's kind of mean.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Yeah.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
She's the sassy one.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
That's for sure.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.120
Uh, Callie's one more splat fest.

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.120
She's one.

02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:05.120
Ooh, gosh.

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.120
I don't know.

02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.720
Like over 50% of them definitely.

02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.720
She's one.

02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:09.720
I think she's won a huge market.

02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:10.720
I think Marie.

02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:11.720
Wait.

02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:12.720
Yeah.

02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:17.720
I think Marie is only one, like five in North America and I think just as many in Japan.

02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:21.600
So fucking Marie, I'm excited though.

02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:26.000
I just, I really love splatoon and I, it's going to be sad to see splat fest go, but

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.200
at least I don't have to play till like, don't the amiibos unlock splat fest mode or something

02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:31.200
like, or the splat fest.

02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:32.200
They just do songs.

02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:33.200
Yeah.

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.400
They just perform songs and like a concert stage or something.

02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:36.400
Yeah.

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.720
But I love their songs, so I'm happy about that and I'm definitely getting this amiibo

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.720
when they come out.

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:43.120
I think on the eighth, sometime next week, I don't know, maybe 12th.

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:44.120
All right.

02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:47.280
Well, sadly my dumb ass forgot to do a Fugu question of the week this week, but that's

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.680
okay because we're running a little long.

02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:53.560
I might need to outsource that segment to somebody else cause um, it's, I keep, I haven't

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:58.440
been slipping too much lately, but you know what, somebody else can start posting.

02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:01.400
I wonder why it might be an age thing.

02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:02.400
It is.

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.400
It is.

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:04.400
It's old.

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:05.400
Yeah.

02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:06.400
Super old.

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:09.840
I hope, I hope, uh, Julian's ready to take over the show soon cause I might not make

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:10.840
it.

02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:11.840
We'll see.

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:12.840
All right.

02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:15.900
Uh, so we do have some more news stories though, a little more long form.

02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:18.820
We do have the mailbag FUs of the week still coming up as well.

02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:22.540
And then, uh, we also are going to get to your calls at orange launch radio on Skype,

02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:23.540
but first Loki.

02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:24.700
All right.

02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:31.180
So we've been kind of covering the saga of Vivendi trying to take over Gameloft and Ubisoft.

02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:40.100
So now, um, Gameloft has announced that the new executive or new CEO is going to be, um,

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:45.260
coming from Vivendi and let's see.

02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:51.660
They are going to basically be adding five of their own, um, executives to, I guess,

02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:56.700
the shareholders group or their publishing board.

02:05:56.700 --> 02:06:05.380
Um, so they've got, you know, four, five members from Vivendi and yeah, I don't know.

02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:07.660
Basically just trying to complete their takeover.

02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:14.280
They basically own, uh, 95.77% of Gameloft's voting rights.

02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:18.840
So yeah, that hostile takeover is kind of happened.

02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:22.040
I'm curious to see what's going to happen with Ubisoft though, because now they've got

02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:26.320
Gameloft is like, how, how far away is that?

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:29.480
And can they really get less or more terrible?

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:35.600
I mean, I don't know if that's something you really want to, uh, question that can actually

02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:36.600
happen.

02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:39.320
You did see their press conferences E3 this year, right?

02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:40.320
Watch all our students.

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:41.320
Okay.

02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:42.320
I give them that.

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:43.320
Don't really give a shit about the rest of it.

02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:44.320
And the South Park game.

02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:46.840
Oh, and the South Park game is going to be fantastic.

02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:48.720
That last South Park game was awesome.

02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:51.200
Seriously, go play that if you have not played it yet.

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:55.240
Uh, William Murderface in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com suggests they could acquire

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.240
Zynga.

02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:58.760
That sounds like it could get worse.

02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:01.120
Yeah, I guess, I guess so.

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:02.120
All right.

02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:05.760
Uh, let's, let's do some Twitch news because there are some updates on the Twitch fronts.

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.440
In fact, one of them, I think Loki kind of referenced earlier.

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:15.680
Uh, there is a new category on Twitch, which is watching people eat.

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.680
That's right.

02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:21.720
It's a new category called social eating and, uh, you can watch people eat.

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:25.360
That is a fucking, I am blaming fucking millennials for this shit.

02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:26.560
I'm sorry.

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:27.560
This is such...

02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:29.960
Okay, grandpa, why?

02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:30.960
It's stupid.

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:33.480
It is absolutely stupid.

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:38.360
Listen, I get it that you want to be, you know, social with your shit and you want to

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:42.680
share everything that you're doing because you're so fucking entitled that you feel that

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:46.040
everybody gives a shit about that.

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:50.000
I mean, like, it's bad enough that you take pictures of the food you eat and shit and

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.560
my wife is fucking guilty of this shit and I call her out on that and I'm like, what

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:54.560
the fuck are you doing?

02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.680
Just eat that fucking food.

02:07:56.680 --> 02:08:01.640
Anyways, but fucking live streaming yourself eating food.

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:05.840
The only excuse I would give to this, if you're fucking building a hamburger that's

02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:11.200
the size of like a couch or something, you know, a la epic meal time, that is okay shit

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:16.360
to fucking stream, but I don't give a shit about you eating your fucking mac and cheese.

02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:20.680
For what it's worth, it seems like that actually may be the case is this is, this is really

02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:25.640
born out of a trend of people eating a lot and apparently it may be actually South Korea's

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:30.400
fault because this is actually something that gets a big audience in South Korea where they

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:35.480
call it mukbang and I'm probably mispronouncing that, but, uh, you have a host who eats a

02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:39.320
lot of food and you can see this gallon, this live stream has about seven different dishes

02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:44.120
in front of her that she's currently eating while she just talks with the audience.

02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:50.200
So she knows it's impolite to talk with your mouth full of this is what I'll allow because

02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:53.000
this is, I, this goes back to like a fourth of July tradition for me.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.240
I will allow competitive eating is this, does it talk about competitive eating?

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:04.040
So my fourth of July tradition, which is coming up tomorrow, is I always watch the Nathan's

02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:09.280
famous hot dog eating contest every morning at nine o'clock on ESPN, just like, you know,

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:10.280
all these great sporting events.

02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:11.960
Like, uh, what'd we talk about?

02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:12.960
Uh, Evo Evo.

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:13.960
Yeah.

02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:14.960
Stuff like that.

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:17.440
And, uh, here's the storm or the dorm and, uh, yeah.

02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:21.040
So I get to watch, uh, somebody, someone took down Joey chest out last year, so I'm super

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.400
excited tomorrow to watch that.

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:24.840
So if it's competitive eating on Twitch, I'll watch that.

02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:25.840
I'm sure, sure.

02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.240
Joey chest with the Twitch account now.

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:29.240
I don't think it is.

02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:31.280
I just think it's people that he's more like foodstagram.

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:35.040
I think it's, it's more of just like people go because don't get me wrong.

02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:39.520
I don't have a problem with you streaming that stuff mainly on YouTube, I think is a

02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.800
better format of that.

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:49.160
But like, I guess it's just people will watch, you know, what they'll watch on there and

02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:50.680
whatever becomes popular.

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:51.680
That's what it is.

02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:57.080
I don't think it's a thing, but then again, people watch Bob Ross forever on there and

02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:58.080
it was really fun to watch.

02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:59.080
Bob Ross was fucking awesome.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.080
He's so fucking awesome.

02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:01.080
The chat made that.

02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:05.080
And, and, and I, and I still watch it on Netflix now that it's on there.

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:06.080
I enjoy that.

02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:07.440
My kids love it.

02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:08.440
It's fantastic.

02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:13.960
I'm glad to be able to share that with them, but I don't give a fucking shit about people

02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:15.280
eating food.

02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.400
I would never want to broadcast myself eating food.

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:18.400
That's stupid.

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.680
Even if I have a lot of food and trust me, all the meals I make for myself are usually

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.680
pretty large.

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:22.680
Loki does eat a lot.

02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:26.680
Uh, look in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com William Murderface getting a little heated

02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:31.760
saying, uh, blame it on gluttons all you want, but that blaming millennial shit is bullshit.

02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:35.320
But to be fair, you said your wife does this shit too, and she's not a millennial.

02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.480
So you're, you're blaming more.

02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.520
You're blaming Instagram, foodstagram culture is what it is.

02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:47.120
I'm blaming people that are way too involved in social media.

02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:49.360
Like they want to share everything about their lives.

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:52.840
And trust me, not everything about your life is fucking interesting.

02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:58.280
I know that social media, that's why I'm very minimally on Facebook.

02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:00.820
I'm very minimally on Twitter.

02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:02.440
It's usually to complain about something.

02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:05.960
And that's usually the Twitter's for complaining about video games and talking about video

02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:06.960
games.

02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:09.720
Facebook is for sharing pictures of my kids when my wife tells me to upload a picture

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:11.000
of my kids.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.320
That's usually what it's for.

02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:13.320
It's all right.

02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:17.520
Look, I have other Twitch news that maybe it'll be less controversial, maybe more.

02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:18.960
I don't know.

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:25.020
But there's a new thing that's being experimented with, with some of the top streamers on Twitch

02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:26.180
right now.

02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:30.200
And what you can do, you can get this currency called bits.

02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:33.600
And you use these bits in a feature called cheering.

02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:39.000
So you buy the bits for like, you can get 100 bits for $1 and 40 cents.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.560
And then what you do, you use this cheer, which is an animated chat emote.

02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:49.620
So like if you type cheer one, a little gray triangle comes up and you just spent 1.4 cents

02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:54.880
to cheer that streamer with a little animated emote icon.

02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:01.520
And apparently that streamer will get one cent and Twitch gets the other 0.4 cents or

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:02.520
whatever it is.

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:07.280
So this is a way, I guess, where the whole tipping thing that's on Twitch is now built

02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:09.200
because Twitch wants a cut of that.

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:10.200
That's what this boils down to.

02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:14.880
And Twitch sees that all these live streamers are like, you know, tip me, tip me, tip me

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.280
on the, on the screen there.

02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:18.200
Those are, yeah, those, those are the emotes.

02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:19.320
That's fucking stupid.

02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:23.600
Well, keep in mind that if you get into the subscription program or whatever, you can

02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:27.040
design your own emotes that go with a subscription to your channel.

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:29.400
But, and don't get me wrong, I understand you.

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:30.520
It's not about the emote.

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:32.120
It's about the penny you get with it.

02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:35.480
So what's up with the star David being, I know why is one of them like a sideways star

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.480
of David?

02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:38.080
I that's really, is that offensive?

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:39.080
I think it might be offensive.

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:41.360
I think that might be if that's the most expensive.

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:42.360
Is that the red one?

02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:43.360
Yes.

02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:44.360
Yeah.

02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:45.360
Turn your head sideways.

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:46.360
It's a red David.

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:48.940
It kind of, it kind of, yeah, I guess it looks like what Donald Trump just got in trouble

02:12:48.940 --> 02:12:49.940
for tweeting.

02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:50.940
Maybe.

02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:54.480
Um, I don't know.

02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:59.080
I don't know if I see it that same way, but, um, I guess I, I wouldn't know.

02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:04.400
So uh, I'm sure it fucking be like, it's going to get to the point where I hate to have the

02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.640
reference chatter bait again in twice in one episode, but it's going to be like, okay,

02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:12.120
yeah, well I'm not going to play this level in the game until I get enough of these bits.

02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:17.260
You know, technically though, if a streamer wanted to do that, they already could with

02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:18.400
that whole tipping thing.

02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.200
Cause I can't tell you how many streams I've watched where they have the little tip counter

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:26.800
and you know, all these people paid and I'm always, I, I'm going to dig myself a hole,

02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:29.720
but I just, I'm going to say it because it's fucking honesty and that's what I give you

02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:30.720
on this show.

02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:33.800
I, I've been getting more and more into live streaming lately.

02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.440
Um, it really doesn't cost anything to live stream.

02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:38.840
Granted I did buy the capture card.

02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:42.400
So I mean there are some expenses there where I guess you could buy a new microphone or

02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:50.320
maybe a better card for your computer and stuff, but I just don't understand why people

02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:55.220
beg for money to play video games on the internet.

02:13:55.220 --> 02:13:57.980
Like it, I just, I don't know.

02:13:57.980 --> 02:14:02.440
I would be grateful if somebody wanted to tip my stream or whatever, but I'd kind of

02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:06.480
be like, you know, but here's some awesome charities that really need the money.

02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:08.200
Cause me, I would have bought that stupid capture card.

02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:09.600
It's because they're entertaining you.

02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:14.280
It's like saying, why do we pay movie stars to act in movies?

02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:18.160
But then, okay, but they're working at something to give you an experience.

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:19.160
Okay.

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:21.300
But honest talk, is it really, I'm not saying I agree with it.

02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:23.940
Is it really just the person playing the game?

02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:26.980
Shouldn't the game maker get a little bit of that?

02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:30.900
And yes, I know this ties into the YouTube argument and I'm getting going down a slippery

02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:36.780
slope here, but I do kind of feel like the game makers deserve a little bit, but it kind

02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:37.780
of depends.

02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:41.460
I guess it really depends on what you're doing with your stream.

02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:46.280
Like there's some Twitch streams where literally the person is just sitting there with their

02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:50.980
little head in the box playing the game and all they ever say is thanks for subscribing

02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:52.980
so and so thanks to the donation.

02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:54.500
So that's all they ever say.

02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:55.500
That's it.

02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:58.260
And when it's that stream, I kind of look and go, you know what?

02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:01.180
The person who made the game is doing more than you did.

02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:04.660
But then there's other streams where there's banter going on.

02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:05.660
They're talking.

02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:06.780
They're being funny.

02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:07.780
And it's like, okay.

02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:08.780
Awesome games done.

02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:09.780
Quick streams.

02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:10.780
Yeah.

02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:11.780
That's different.

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:14.220
But who says this is this and this is that?

02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:15.220
I would disagree.

02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:17.100
They're getting publicity for their game.

02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:18.100
People are watching.

02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:21.840
I mean, they may be tuning in for the person that's streaming, but they're also seeing

02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:27.300
this game that they're playing and that is free publicity for that game.

02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:32.860
So I don't really think that the company necessarily needs to get paid on top of already, you know,

02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:36.660
that game was purchased by whoever's streaming it, I would assume.

02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:40.560
So they may get sales off of that person streaming it, but I don't see why they should get a

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:45.940
cut of that person, you know, whatever they make from streaming that game because they

02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:47.480
could be streaming any other game.

02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:49.820
They're trying to sell themselves, not the game.

02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:51.820
The game is like a side thing for it.

02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:52.820
Well, I don't know.

02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:55.820
You know, this is one of those things where maybe the further down the rabbit hole I go

02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:58.580
with live streaming, then I'll finally kind of get it.

02:15:58.580 --> 02:16:01.680
And then people are going to be like, Rob, you fucking hypocrite, you settle that thing

02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:02.680
on OLR.

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:03.680
Then now you're asking for money.

02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:07.720
But as it stands right now, I feel like if people were to be kind enough to donate these

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:12.060
things on my stream, I would just put them back into Steam to buy games to stream.

02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:16.380
Like I just, you know, it just kind of, that's how I'd spend it.

02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:21.460
I don't feel like I'm going to make a living off Twitch streaming or any of that stuff

02:16:21.460 --> 02:16:24.380
because I kind of like the job I do have right now.

02:16:24.380 --> 02:16:32.580
So anyway, let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:16:32.580 --> 02:16:37.420
Let's see, Tiger Claw says, if you think about it, that whole social eating thing is pretty

02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:39.820
much product placement.

02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:43.900
Stoppy in chat says, just wait for Rob to become the next booby streamer.

02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:44.900
Be careful what you wish for.

02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:47.740
I got a really nice top in the closet.

02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:51.900
Let's see, Fifth Dream says, it's like saying if you watch a movie you bought a lot, you

02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:54.060
should pay more for it.

02:16:54.060 --> 02:17:00.740
Well, I know movies like the Rocky Horror Picture Show say that I had on VHS back in

02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:03.340
the day, DVD, Blu-ray, iTunes.

02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:07.300
Wait, wait, wait, perfect example then, here you go.

02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:12.060
So all the people that go watch a performance of Rocky Horror, that movie is playing in

02:17:12.060 --> 02:17:17.380
the background, should the people that made Rocky Horror get a cut of that money?

02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:21.140
The people, okay, the people that made Rocky Horror are getting all the money.

02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:22.500
The cast doesn't get anything.

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.540
They just go straight to whoever made the movie?

02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:30.900
Well, it depends on a variety of factors, but I'm going to keep it simple and say, believe

02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:35.460
me, 20th Century Fox gets a cut even to this day every time that movie is shown.

02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:37.020
That's why you actually still have to get the rights.

02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:41.500
You can't just show that in a theater and act, you still have to go through 20th Century

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:42.500
Fox and get the rights.

02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:44.900
That's pretty stupid, I'm just going to say.

02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:45.900
That's really stupid, actually.

02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:46.900
Just letting you know.

02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:51.740
All right, well anyhow, let's move on, we could probably talk for another hour about

02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:54.500
this, but we do have some other gaming news we want to get to and we might have some calls

02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:55.860
on this later, we'll see.

02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:57.660
But anyway, for now, Shane, what do you have for us?

02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:04.020
So Capcom released that Resident Evil 7 teaser.

02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:08.640
People couldn't figure out what some of the items were for, specifically the finger that

02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:11.860
you could pick up, and everybody was going crazy for it for like a week.

02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:15.140
I can't believe they didn't understand that Capcom was giving you the finger.

02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:20.740
Basically, yeah, because recently, if you had signed up for their ambassador program,

02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:28.540
they sent you some email touting how many times the demo's been downloaded.

02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:34.000
They actually make reference to the finger, and they say in a picture that the path is

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:38.640
closed for now, but patience, dot dot dot.

02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.020
So maybe there'll be some sort of update or a new demo where you can use that finger.

02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:46.320
But basically, the demo's garbage now.

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:48.900
There's no real secrets to it.

02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:54.640
I think it really tried to evoke that spirit of P.T. and...

02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:55.640
But without the payoff, really.

02:18:55.640 --> 02:18:58.980
Yeah, without any sort of payoff.

02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:01.380
It makes me less excited for the game now.

02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:05.460
Well, so since they said the game, I mean, I know they said this about P.T. as well,

02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:08.900
but P.T. stood on its own, but they said, like, oh, it's not going to really be anything

02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:09.900
like this demo.

02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:11.600
Yeah, they were just going for the atmosphere.

02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:14.620
But I did read an article with one of the guys that said it is still going to be in

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:15.620
first person, though.

02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:16.620
Oh, I didn't see that.

02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:17.620
That's interesting.

02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:23.180
Well, when it's going to be a VR game as well, that kind of seems like a given sense.

02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:24.180
Do you think that...

02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:25.180
Who cares?

02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:28.660
OK, remember when P.T. first came out, the fact that it was a Silent Hill game was a

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.220
surprise at the end.

02:19:30.220 --> 02:19:37.680
Do you think if Capcom had put out the demo as, you know, new Capcom VR demo, it didn't

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:40.740
tell you what it was, and at the end you found out it was Resident Evil 7, do you think that

02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:41.740
would have had a greater impact?

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:45.700
It might have had a greater impact, but it still wouldn't have been as good of an impact

02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:51.300
just because of how lame, really, overall that demo actually is.

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:53.740
I think people would have been like, that's Resident Evil?

02:19:53.740 --> 02:19:56.420
It wasn't like, you know, people wanted a new Silent Hill game.

02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:00.420
I think some people wanted a new Resident Evil, but it's kind of like, well, they already

02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:01.420
have like seven of them.

02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:03.380
Yeah, well, you know they're going to crank them out every couple years.

02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:06.980
I mean, it's just like, it was just like, oh, that didn't really seem like a Resident

02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:09.220
Evil game to me, but OK.

02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:13.140
It wouldn't have been just like, holy shit, this is Resident Evil!

02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:14.180
It just doesn't have the same effect.

02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:21.300
All right, let's get through a few stories here, and then we'll get to tonight's mailbag.

02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:22.300
Loki.

02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:24.020
All right, so this is kind of cool.

02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:28.020
There's a brand new Kickstarter for a System Shock remake.

02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:33.460
It's being remade in Unity, and I think they're probably, well, they're probably going to

02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:39.940
hit their goal already, because they've already, they're looking for 900,000, and I think the

02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:45.340
last time I checked it, it was already 600,000 something, so, and it was still with like

02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:48.660
almost 30 days left.

02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:49.820
It looks pretty awesome.

02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:50.820
You can check it out.

02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:57.140
If you want, you can actually pick up a demo on Steam, Good Ol' Games, or the Humble Store,

02:20:57.140 --> 02:20:59.420
if you want to check out and play the actual demo.

02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:07.340
Yeah, they're up to $773,206, and they have 24 days to go, so most likely they're going

02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:12.300
to hit it, and it looks like it's pretty good so far, so I would definitely, you know,

02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:16.700
I'm kind of, I didn't really know too much about System Shock, but I mean, it looks something

02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:20.380
like they could be pretty good to back, but definitely go check out the demo and see what

02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:24.380
you think.

02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:26.420
Are you, are you going to back this, Loki?

02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:27.420
I don't know.

02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:28.420
You don't really back any Kickstarters.

02:21:28.420 --> 02:21:32.020
I am not backing that many kicks, oh, I'm probably not backing any Kickstarters right

02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:37.820
now unless it's going to be like some hardware thing or something that I really want, but

02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:39.100
just PC games, man.

02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:42.600
Like the last few Kickstarters I backed, I did Shadowrun and everything, and I was so

02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:47.060
gung ho about those, and then I completely forgot they came out and I didn't play them.

02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:51.020
Like I can't say there's a Kickstarter game that I have played now in there, and I've

02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:55.780
got like, you know, that, Among the Sleep, it's just a bunch of games that just sit at

02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:57.820
my backlog.

02:21:57.820 --> 02:22:03.380
Some folks in chat responding positively to this, vidpower in chat at live.vognetwork.com

02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:06.780
says, played the System Shock demo, it was pretty fun.

02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:10.280
When Dungeon Buster says, yeah, the demo was really good, I backed it, I still have the

02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:15.900
original around here on all nine three and a half inch floppies.

02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:20.200
Some folks very excited for this new Kickstarter.

02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:24.100
Let me talk about this because this is very interesting where there was actually a Ford

02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:25.100
commercial.

02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:28.940
It was an advertisement that was, I think it was specifically from a dealer.

02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:30.260
I don't think it was from like Ford Central.

02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:32.780
It was just a print ad, not a commercial.

02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:36.540
It was, no, there was actually a YouTube as well that was out there.

02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:37.540
There was.

02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:42.020
And this was like an email, and what it was, it was the Ford Freedom Event, but here's

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:47.900
the problem is that all the artwork that was on it was lifted from the game Firewatch because,

02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:54.360
you know, the whole thing is a SUV go off in the wilderness or whatever, then the Firewatch

02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:58.400
art kind of has all that wilderness element to it.

02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:04.700
So yeah, a lot of people on Twitter kind of call in Ford out on this and what the hell's

02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:05.700
going on.

02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:10.600
Apparently, the dealer was contacted and the dealer was kind of, you know, like they were

02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:15.840
kind of a little shifty about it, apparently hanging up on some people and not really commenting

02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:16.840
to others.

02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:20.940
But apparently, there was an email that got, went back to one of these sites like Game

02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:26.160
Informer or something saying that the art was taken from a DMCA compliant site when

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:28.540
getting images.

02:23:28.540 --> 02:23:32.500
But apparently, when they went and looked on the site, they didn't see anything like

02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:33.500
that.

02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:38.140
And actually, one of the folks behind the game Firewatch even called from Campo Santo

02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:44.180
actually called and said, there's no way that the image came from that site because there

02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:47.600
were images on there on the company's website that don't appear elsewhere.

02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:52.160
So I mean, this just, it sounds straight up like the dealer took the art.

02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:57.280
But I'm going to throw out the theory, here's what really happened because I don't, here's

02:23:57.280 --> 02:23:59.720
what I don't think happened.

02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:04.880
I don't think the dealer was like, oh, this video game, I really like this art.

02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:08.200
I'm going to steal this art for the email.

02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:12.360
I think what the dealer did, the dealer did a Google image search and just took the image

02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:16.640
from Google image search, had no fucking idea it was from a game until Twitter alerted them

02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:17.680
to the fact.

02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:20.920
And that's why they're like, oh, well, the site we use is usually DMC, not, they use

02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:23.400
Google image search and that got them in hot water.

02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:25.680
That's what it is.

02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:29.960
I would, I would bet money on that being exactly what happened is that the dealer used Google

02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:30.960
image search.

02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:35.740
So lesson learned, if you do anything that's out there in print or that stuff, do not use

02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:36.740
Google image search.

02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:41.480
I even, I create learning courses that go online for my, as part of my job and you know,

02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:47.120
something I did at my former employer and I would specifically use public domain clip

02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:48.120
art sites.

02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:49.120
I was very cautious.

02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:50.120
I never used Google image search.

02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:55.280
I would use public domain sites to get whatever art I wanted to use, which, you know, there's

02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:56.280
a few of them out there.

02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:00.360
If you had to know where to look, um, that, that have a very generous license.

02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:07.640
So anyway, uh, and act-deft in chat says, uh, pretty much they were lazy.

02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:08.640
Yep.

02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:13.320
And JD in our chat says, sure, but if you're using Google image search for business reasons,

02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:14.940
it's on you to get right clearances.

02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:16.480
That's absolutely right.

02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:19.800
The whole fact that I found it on a Google search that ain't going to save you or this

02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:23.760
dealer in this, in this circumstance, you still have to get the rights clearance.

02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:27.900
I think there is a, I think, don't quote me on this, but I feel like there is a button

02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:30.840
you can use on Google.

02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:33.560
Maybe it's being actually, I can't believe I'm going to fucking reference being, but

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:34.560
I am.

02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:37.760
I think there's something that you can actually specifically find images that are like creative

02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:42.240
commons or you can find images under certain licenses on some of those search engines,

02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:44.520
but you just kind of like, you can't be lazy about it.

02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:45.920
You have to kind of think about that.

02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:47.600
So there you go.

02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:50.560
Um, I believe we are going to go to the mailbag now.

02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:58.280
I think it's time to get in the mailbag.

02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:03.760
Every week you guys email us, participate at orange lounge, radio.com and send us your

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:08.240
emails and we read a few of our favorite emails here on the air.

02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:11.920
Uh, but I believe when I last checked the mailbag, there was only one email to read

02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:14.400
tonight.

02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.760
So I'm going to actually open up the mailbag right now.

02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:19.480
Does it qualify as one of your favorites though?

02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:22.080
Cause you just said you only read a few of your favorites.

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:25.940
Well, anytime somebody takes the time to email us, it makes me happy.

02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:32.760
So yeah, by default, by default, yeah, it doesn't sound like a favorite by default.

02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:38.400
Except now for some reason, I can't remember the password to get in our fucking email.

02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:39.400
Shit.

02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:40.800
This is embarrassing.

02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:41.800
So old.

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:43.160
Let's have dark soccer to call in.

02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:47.280
No, like I'm positive.

02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:48.280
That's it.

02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.640
What am I doing wrong?

02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:53.640
This is so funny.

02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:54.640
Since you're too busy to run the soundboard.

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:55.640
I'll do that.

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:56.640
Fuck.

02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:57.640
Fascinating.

02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:08.080
You're going to get locked out and like a 30 minute wait before you can try to get an

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:09.080
email.

02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:13.880
Somebody's like, someone's trying to hack your account under lock until you can call

02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:15.880
us to verify.

02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:16.880
Well he's doing that.

02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:20.120
I forgot to mention something in my gaming week cause it wasn't a video game, but I just

02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:22.680
played today exploding kittens.

02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:23.680
The card game.

02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:26.120
It is really fun.

02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:27.120
Is it?

02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:28.120
Cause it sounds sad.

02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:29.120
No, it's funny.

02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:30.120
And it's fun.

02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:33.640
I mean, we played the clean version, so I don't know how, if people prefer the dirty

02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:39.360
version or whatever, but it was just like a really fun, fast to play like little card

02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:40.360
game.

02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:43.480
So I don't know if anybody in here bought that game or not, but it's Rob did.

02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:44.480
Oh, Rob bought it.

02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:46.680
Oh, but Rob's busy.

02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:48.600
I did buy it and it's still in the box.

02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:49.600
You haven't played it?

02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:50.600
Did you unwrap the box?

02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:51.600
Okay.

02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:53.880
I just want to point out, I logged in on my phone.

02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:54.880
With the same password.

02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:55.880
With the same password.

02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:00.480
Did you keep the caps lock key on, on accident?

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:02.600
I hope that's, but usually they warn you.

02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:03.600
I don't know what the hell.

02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:04.600
Sometimes.

02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:05.600
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:06.920
Did you try turning it off and then on again?

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:07.920
Yeah.

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:08.920
Try turning it on and off again.

02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:09.920
Oh Jesus.

02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:10.920
Now there's like a ton of emails too.

02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:11.920
This is the best thing.

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:14.920
And I got to read them off my phone.

02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:16.920
This is such a train wreck.

02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:17.920
Oh, that's so great.

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:18.920
Ah, fuck off.

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:19.920
All right.

02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:22.960
Uh, let's get to our first email tonight with all this tiny print I'm going to have to read

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:23.960
here.

02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:26.160
Old people glasses to read it.

02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:28.160
Can someone send me my glasses?

02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:29.160
Oh God.

02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:30.160
My focus.

02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:36.480
Uh, this email comes to us from James Nighthawk starting us off this week.

02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:38.680
Hello boys and girls of OLR.

02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:41.760
James Nighthawk here emailing from across the pond in England.

02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:44.360
Firstly, a belated happy birthday to the show.

02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:48.960
I've been on board for over a year now and I've become a weekly listener via the podcast.

02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:52.080
I'd love to listen live, but hey, time zones are a bitch.

02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:53.600
I'd like to talk about music games.

02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:54.920
Always a favorite topic with you all.

02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:56.600
I have two questions.

02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:59.200
Question one, what is it about music games that you love?

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.260
What drew you in and kept you playing?

02:29:01.260 --> 02:29:06.120
As a musician myself, games like rock band never drew me in as a way to pretend to play

02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:07.120
guitar.

02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:11.140
For me, it was the way the reward systems and skill systems were tied to the music tracks

02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:16.720
that kept me playing and wanting to improve my skills to replay levels and score higher.

02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:22.440
I will admit, however, that rock band drums are pretty cool for a non drummer as at times

02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:27.600
it does offer a damn good approximation of actually playing the drum track.

02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:28.600
Let's start with that.

02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:29.720
What about music games do you guys love?

02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:31.120
Shane, you want to start?

02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:33.120
The music.

02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:35.680
Well as silly and sarcastic as that is.

02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:37.000
No, it's not really sarcastic.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
It's just true.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.720
Yeah, no, it is kind of for me as a big motivator as well.

02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:43.160
The music usually is pretty good.

02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:48.080
And sometimes the gameplay that goes with it will make me like the music more or even

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:49.080
at all.

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:54.280
The music I may not have liked, but if it's in a game that I enjoy playing, then that

02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:59.240
music gets elevated to maybe I could download this and listen to it and it'll like bring

02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:01.260
back those memories of playing the game.

02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:04.720
Like that happened a lot in Elite Beat Agents, like there are a lot of songs I would never

02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:08.960
listen to outside of Elite Beat Agents until I played the game.

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:10.520
And now I'm like, oh, that song's cool.

02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:11.520
I like it.

02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:15.840
I think too, even though you might not be accurately making music, like you're playing

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:19.240
the guitar and it's not like actually playing an actual guitar.

02:30:19.240 --> 02:30:23.560
You are still interacting with the game where you're making music through whatever the game's

02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:24.560
system is.

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:27.920
And that goes as far back as say, Parappa the Rappa, which was one of the earliest music

02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:32.700
games where you could do like freestyle segments where you kind of hit the buttons in whatever

02:30:32.700 --> 02:30:33.700
order you wanted.

02:30:33.700 --> 02:30:37.360
And that was, for me, that was always something I really liked about music games and like

02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:43.440
say a game like BeatMania 2DX is that, okay, it's not actually DJing, but it's kind of

02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:46.200
cool that the key presses do affect the music.

02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:48.920
And when you play like shit, you're going to get shitty music.

02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:53.080
But when you're playing in rhythm and at end time, you're creating these really awesome

02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:54.680
trance or dance songs.

02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:57.280
That was always part of the charm for me.

02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:00.640
Loki or Flocko, want to chime in on this before I move on?

02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:01.640
I always like the music.

02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:02.640
Yeah.

02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:06.200
And that's really, you know, kind of what drew me in is just museums plus, you know,

02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:07.740
they'd be fun.

02:31:07.740 --> 02:31:11.520
And VidPower in chat says, yeah, it was the butterfly song that first drew me into DDR.

02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:14.120
And to be honest, that was kind of a big part of it for me too.

02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:18.520
But I had already had played like Bust a Move, Bust a Groove, you know, that series before.

02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:21.960
And so when I first saw that in the arcade, I was like, oh, it's like that.

02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:25.120
But with your body, even though those of you that have played both know they're actually

02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:28.600
not that similar, but I was like, it's like that, but you use your entire body.

02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:32.480
And that was actually part of the real kick in the beginning was that DDR was something

02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:34.380
you actually controlled with your body.

02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:36.360
So it didn't play like any other game.

02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:40.520
And I think that's a big draw of the music games too, or the peripherals, I suppose.

02:31:40.520 --> 02:31:46.040
One more comment in chat where JD it says, yeah, key sounding is a big factor in my enjoyment

02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:47.040
of music games.

02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:48.040
Absolutely.

02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:50.720
Anyway, moving on with James's email.

02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:58.380
Question two, can you think of any great games which tie music-based gameplay to a more traditional

02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:00.240
gaming system?

02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:04.320
Games that come to mind for me are the bit trip games, as they do exactly that.

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:07.020
One is a runner where your actions time with the beat.

02:32:07.020 --> 02:32:10.820
One is a pong clone with timing based on the song and so forth.

02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:15.660
I've recently downloaded but have yet to start Rhythm Thief for the 3DS, thanks to the awesome

02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:17.400
Nintendo Humble Bundle.

02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:19.740
This sounds like it might be exactly what I'm looking for.

02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:24.420
I find I'm now intrigued by the idea of games where the gameplay is music-based, but the

02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:27.540
progression is more story or video game-based.

02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:30.020
The theater rhythm games tried this.

02:32:30.020 --> 02:32:35.660
Alas, while I enjoyed the mechanics, the RPG part is very lacking and largely ignorable.

02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:38.900
I have high hopes for Rhythm Heaven on the 3DS once it comes to Europe.

02:32:38.900 --> 02:32:43.180
I hated the DS version, as the stylus is not a way to play that style of game.

02:32:43.180 --> 02:32:46.140
Although you were not impressed by the new Rhythm Heaven game, were you?

02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:50.900
I am warming up to it, especially because I heard remixes are coming.

02:32:50.900 --> 02:32:52.340
I just have to unlock them.

02:32:52.340 --> 02:32:53.980
Do you have to use the stylus to play it?

02:32:53.980 --> 02:32:58.980
No, but honestly, to counter what he just said, I was playing the game with just using

02:32:58.980 --> 02:33:03.020
the A button, because that's what you would be using, and the directional pad.

02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:08.420
And I was doing fine at it, but then when I switched over to stylus, I found it to be

02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:12.460
a lot easier and a lot more fun.

02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:20.540
The first game that comes to my mind is Crypt of the Neko Dancer, that's the one that comes

02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:21.660
to my mind first.

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:29.940
I would say Rez, because it's a shooter, an on-rails shooter, and it has a story, and

02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:32.820
it's all musical-based, and it's going to be VR.

02:33:32.820 --> 02:33:36.220
Pick anything Mizuguchi was involved with.

02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:37.220
You know what?

02:33:37.220 --> 02:33:41.620
James, follow this guy, Mizuguchi, because everything he did is these types of games

02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:42.940
you're looking for.

02:33:42.940 --> 02:33:45.660
Space Channel 5 would be another game, right?

02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:46.860
Right up the alley.

02:33:46.860 --> 02:33:48.900
Luminous, one of the best puzzle games.

02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:50.660
It's a puzzle game, but I don't know how...

02:33:50.660 --> 02:33:56.220
But it uses music, because the sweeper is in time with the music, so that is very important.

02:33:56.220 --> 02:33:59.020
That's a good use of that, Rez.

02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:00.020
I just said Rez.

02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:01.340
Yeah, it was literally just said.

02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:02.340
No, it's alright.

02:34:02.860 --> 02:34:03.860
Child of Eden.

02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:06.940
Child of Eden, the sequel-esque type of thing.

02:34:06.940 --> 02:34:11.460
Meteos didn't use music as much, but I did feel like, you know, another Q Entertainment

02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:14.140
game where I feel like music was kind of a part of it.

02:34:14.140 --> 02:34:15.140
Every Extend Extra.

02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:16.140
That's the other one I was trying to think of.

02:34:16.140 --> 02:34:19.500
I also kind of want to warn about Rhythm Thief.

02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:24.660
It starts out kind of fun, but I felt like it got old pretty quick.

02:34:24.660 --> 02:34:28.140
I know you got it as part of a bundle, so maybe it won't be so bad, but I paid full

02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:32.300
price for that game when it came out, and I was not very happy with that purchase.

02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:38.180
Alright, finishing up this email from James Nighthawk, thanks once again for the podcast.

02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:39.580
Much love from the UK.

02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:40.580
P.S.

02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:45.180
I have no idea how the American media is covering the British referendum result.

02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:49.140
Please please, listeners of OLR, be aware we are a nation torn by this.

02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:51.980
Half of us did not want the result we ended up with.

02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:56.820
Well, that feels just like in line with where we're at right now with the presidential election,

02:34:56.820 --> 02:35:01.700
and I'm probably sure more than half of us don't like the result, or the choices we have

02:35:01.700 --> 02:35:02.700
available to us.

02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:08.440
I do feel like the biggest narrative we've been getting with Brexit is that, yes, Donald

02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:13.020
Trump could be elected president if we don't fucking watch it.

02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:17.980
That's kind of the sense I've been getting from the media and Facebook and all that stuff

02:35:17.980 --> 02:35:18.980
here.

02:35:18.980 --> 02:35:19.980
So your vote counts.

02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:21.620
Yeah, I guess that's a nicer way to put it.

02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:22.940
Think back to the 2000 election in Florida.

02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:26.780
That's a more non-partisan way to put it, yes, that's very good, I like that.

02:35:26.780 --> 02:35:28.260
Every vote counts.

02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:30.380
Even some for people that aren't alive.

02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:31.380
Yeah.

02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:36.980
Okay, I will tell you the other thing we saw with the Brexit, where it's like, good lord,

02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:40.880
we always thought British people were smarter, but they're really not when you get that guy

02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:47.860
on TV that says, well, I didn't think it would actually pass, so I voted for it.

02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:50.540
I thought, is that like-

02:35:50.540 --> 02:35:54.540
That's like, okay, I'm gonna fucking dig some dirt here, you ready?

02:35:54.540 --> 02:36:02.820
That's like my fucking ex-boyfriend, ex-boyfriend, who voted for Prop 8 just because everybody

02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:08.660
was pressuring him to vote against it, and he felt like he had to vote against it, and

02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:10.580
he had no will.

02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:12.140
Wow.

02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:19.100
There's a reason we use the word ex in that title.

02:36:19.820 --> 02:36:31.100
Anyway, moving on to YYR, who sent us a couple emails this week, saying, first email, hello

02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:35.940
LR, happy 14th birthday, Rob, hope you enjoyed yours as well, sorry that I couldn't be around,

02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:38.100
but driving home from a convention took precedence.

02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:41.460
I wanted to follow up on what was obviously the most important thing you talked about

02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:42.820
on last week's show.

02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:46.620
Yes, there is a place where RC Cola is on tap.

02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:51.100
It is none other than the famous eight on the break arcade in Dunlin, New Jersey, where

02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:56.220
they also serve the break steak special, a semi-famous break steak cheesesteak, a side

02:36:56.220 --> 02:37:01.540
of fries, and a drink of your choice, perhaps even RC Cola, for just five bucks, and he

02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:02.900
gives a link to their menu.

02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:05.780
Oh yeah, and they have a ton of music games there too.

02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:07.700
We'll be running the yearly tournament soon.

02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:09.300
Not too late to hop on a plane.

02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:13.000
Not that I expect you guys to fly out just for that, but suggestions can't hurt, right?

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.020
Now that we've established all of that, we can move on with our lives.

02:37:16.060 --> 02:37:18.460
Thank you for that incredibly crucial update, YYR.

02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:23.460
Actually that was good to know that RC Cola can be found on tap, and at a arcade that

02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:28.100
music gamers, certainly the ones on the East Coast, have certainly heard of.

02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:31.020
By the way, YYR sent us a second email.

02:37:31.020 --> 02:37:34.540
I don't usually send two emails, but I've been listening to last week's show while doing

02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:38.180
some summer cleaning, and Dance Maniacs happens.

02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:42.620
Rob, while you were at MAGFest, did you happen to play on the Dance Maniacs that was there?

02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:44.220
No, I did not.

02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:47.880
If you only walked past it, you might not have noticed, but if you played, you might

02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:52.460
have seen that it had a lot more songs on it than your typical Second Mix Append J Paradise.

02:37:52.460 --> 02:37:57.300
That's because it was running a new custom version of the game, built from scratch, with

02:37:57.300 --> 02:38:03.260
many new songs added, but still looking and feeling just like Second Mix Append J Paradise.

02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:06.220
Of course, all the old songs were retained as well.

02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:10.100
It won't make for great radio, but here's a video of this version running on the cabinet.

02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:14.140
Anyway, the reason I wrote about this is that the creator is really cool, and would almost

02:38:14.140 --> 02:38:18.060
certainly share this version with anyone who purchases a cabinet and expresses interest.

02:38:18.060 --> 02:38:22.620
You may need to purchase some additional hardware, though, and have a spare computer lying around.

02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:24.460
Hit me up if you need more information.

02:38:24.460 --> 02:38:27.820
I'm going to send this to my friend with the Dance Maniacs machine that I talked about

02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:31.100
earlier, because I bet she would be all over that.

02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:34.940
So thank you very much for that, YYR, and someday when I get a Dance Maniacs machine,

02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:36.860
I might want that too.

02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:40.580
And now that I know there is a special Dance Maniacs machine at MAGFest, I'm going to be

02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:43.740
on lookout next year.

02:38:43.740 --> 02:38:46.740
Last email tonight from Redertainment, hello peoples.

02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:50.300
As you may have already covered, this week Twitch launched a new category called Social

02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:51.620
Eating.

02:38:51.620 --> 02:38:55.180
There's something about this new category I'd like to spark a discussion about.

02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:58.900
Twitch posted a social eating FAQ, which I linked to above, that guides the users of

02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:01.800
Twitch on what they can and cannot do with social eating.

02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.140
It's one of those things Twitch tells its users it cannot do that I have a question

02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:06.140
about.

02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:11.300
Quoting from the post, examples of what you cannot broadcast on social eating, feeding

02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:25.500
others, such as pets or babies.

02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:33.060
So parents cannot feed their babies on Twitch as part of social eating.

02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:34.060
Why?

02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:35.140
What is the legitimate reason for this?

02:39:35.140 --> 02:39:39.860
I can understand Twitch not wanting users to drink alcohol as part of social eating,

02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:43.580
which is something else they expressly forbid, but why not feed a baby?

02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:48.460
But see, something that I think would be kind of cool, as far as feeding other people, what

02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:51.460
if someone's blindfolded and you feed them stuff and try to get them to guess what it

02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:52.460
is?

02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:53.460
That sounds like fun.

02:39:53.460 --> 02:39:56.180
You can take that shit to fucking YouTube.

02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:00.580
It just sounds like a fun usage of it.

02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:01.580
No.

02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:07.700
I think there's a greater problem in our society as it goes with the whole breastfeeding in

02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:13.580
public and how people are shamed and it really shouldn't like any mom I know that's done

02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:19.840
it uses the blanket or covers up, you know, so that it doesn't like at the dinner table,

02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:22.500
you know, sitting there topless at the table.

02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:27.100
But even if she wanted to sit there topless at the table and feed the baby, you know what?

02:40:27.100 --> 02:40:28.180
Baby's got to eat too.

02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:30.060
And that's kind of a woman's choice.

02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:35.740
So I just, it may not necessarily be something that's appropriate for streaming on the Internet.

02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:37.860
Is that Twitch is a video game.

02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:41.860
Like I just I don't understand why this competitive eating or the eating sorry thing is even on

02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:43.360
Twitch to begin with.

02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:47.140
So I just I feel like they kind of had to arbitrarily draw a line.

02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:50.940
But it's one of those things where it's like, I don't know, for Twitch's sake, it's just

02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:52.900
not really worth arguing about.

02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:57.400
I mean, I just it's it to be honest, I think the question has to be addressed at a much

02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:58.660
higher level than Twitch.

02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:02.220
Well, to be honest, that's my point cares if they don't like to do it on their platform.

02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:06.180
There are other streaming platforms out there like YouTube live where I guess, could you

02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:07.660
drink alcohol live on the air?

02:41:07.660 --> 02:41:09.700
I mean, were there any rules against that?

02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:10.700
I don't think so.

02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:14.620
A fifth dream in chat says, you know, the second the mom is paying too much attention

02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:19.180
to chat and pokes her baby in the eye with a spoon, Twitch would get destroyed.

02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:21.340
So they're making sure to nip that in the bud.

02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:22.340
I don't know.

02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:25.580
I don't know if you intended that pun, but that's good.

02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:29.220
Are we going to have like swatting during some of these like food eating events and

02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:30.220
stuff like that?

02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:34.500
No, because only trash people do that.

02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:40.060
Or could it be like, instead of swatting, they'd be like, I don't know, pizza pie ordering.

02:41:40.060 --> 02:41:41.980
It's like, what?

02:41:41.980 --> 02:41:42.980
Who's at my door?

02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:44.980
I didn't order these 20 pizzas.

02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:47.100
God damn you, internet.

02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:50.140
Akuma JP says, we see that everywhere here.

02:41:50.140 --> 02:41:52.160
What's with the West with breastfeeding?

02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:56.940
This topic is way larger than what our video game podcast can cover, but in a nutshell,

02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:04.020
like the, our nation has an obsession with heaven forbid somebody see a titty, even though

02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:06.780
boobs are like everywhere.

02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:09.500
Heads can explode, but you put a titty out there.

02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:11.300
Oh shit.

02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:14.340
It's one of those things that I think is just going to have to change with time.

02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:21.400
Even though Game of Thrones is the highest rated show on TV, it has exploding heads and

02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:22.400
titties.

02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:23.400
Anyhow.

02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:30.840
But only the Japanese have exploding heads being caused by titties.

02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:36.880
And SSJ 100 Matt says, blame Janet Jackson or blame Justin Timberlake who ripped the

02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:39.480
top off yet got away scot-free.

02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:45.240
That is something that I will never understand in my lifetime about our culture is that why

02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:50.520
was she crucified for that yet Justin Timberlake, Oh, I'm going to sing another song and so

02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:54.100
millions and billions of albums, like it's fucked up.

02:42:54.100 --> 02:42:58.240
Like there's just, I don't mean to get all like social justice warrior on you, but come

02:42:58.240 --> 02:42:59.240
on.

02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:00.240
That's fucked up.

02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:02.800
Like it's just, there's this things in our culture that don't make sense.

02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:06.720
And titty police is one of them.

02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:07.720
That's it.

02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:11.680
All right, let's move on and we're going to get to the F you of the week.

02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:13.920
What a, what an appropriate segue to make here.

02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:14.920
I don't know.

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:15.920
I'm pretty forward to the police.

02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:19.160
I mean, I think I have a different thing in mind.

02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:39.080
I think you're defining it a little differently than I am damn.

02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:40.920
Loki wants you to start tonight.

02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:41.920
Okay.

02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:48.920
So big fuck you to the stupid Sacramento County law that they put in the place effective today

02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:56.280
or not today, July 1st, where basically they have eliminated plastic shopping bags because

02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:58.480
I don't know why the fuck they did.

02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:00.080
Oh, we're good for the environment.

02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:01.080
Fuck you all.

02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:03.320
Seriously is a fucking inconvenience.

02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:07.720
If I want to be environmentally friendly and buy those fucking bags, the reusable ones,

02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.480
I will, but I don't, I don't give a shit because it doesn't matter.

02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:14.980
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to pour extra fucking oil into all the rivers and

02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:18.620
streams to offset all the good that this shit is doing.

02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:22.500
You're such an asshole.

02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:23.500
But you know what?

02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:29.460
I look, I am, I'm pretty fucking liberal, but I would say if I were to become governor,

02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:31.700
I would overturn that fucking bag ban day one.

02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:32.980
I'm I'm with you.

02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:38.240
I don't, it doesn't like I, you recycle the bags and use them for other things and I do

02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:44.240
all the time, all the time anyway, too, too many political discourse on tonight's show.

02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:45.760
My FU of the week.

02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:46.880
I don't, I don't know.

02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:48.000
I don't really have a lot.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:52.960
So my FU of the week goes to my lazy ass not being, being motivated enough to exercise.

02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:57.160
Uh, I need, I need to get up off my ass and do more exercise, especially if I do want

02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.280
to wear better cosplay at a dragon con.

02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:01.280
So who knows?

02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:04.440
Maybe in the next next day or two, I'll finally get started with that.

02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:05.440
Flaco, how about you?

02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:07.040
And now I talked about how much I love them.

02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:08.040
I don't care.

02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:13.400
F U S G D Q because you didn't accept my submission.

02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:17.760
Oh, I can be Minneapolis right now, but I'm on Rob's couch.

02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:19.960
Hey, wait a minute.

02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:23.600
That's it.

02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:25.960
I still love them for not accepting.

02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:27.600
Minneapolis isn't that great anyway.

02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:28.600
All right.

02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:30.160
Practicing PT in the back room.

02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:32.360
Just don't, don't hate me.

02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:33.560
Minneapolis, St Paul people.

02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:34.560
I'm just telling a little joke.

02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:35.560
All right.

02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:37.360
Uh, Shane, last but not least.

02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:41.120
If you to being tired, cause I'm really tired and didn't take a nap today and I went to

02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:43.760
bed at like four and got up at nine.

02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:44.760
Yeah.

02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:47.880
If you to lack asleep, but that was my own fault.

02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:49.840
I will say this though.

02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:54.080
Shane stayed on the phone with me the entire drive home so that I wouldn't fall asleep

02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:55.080
on the road.

02:45:55.080 --> 02:45:59.640
And so that was, that was pretty awesome thing that Shane did pretty awesome.

02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:03.680
As much of a jerk as he has to me, sometimes he'll do things like that that make me want

02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:04.680
to keep him around.

02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:05.680
So there you go.

02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:06.680
All right.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:11.080
I started seeing like a lullaby where he would, he, you and I both know that would never fucking

02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:12.080
happen.

02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:14.880
Like why do we even have these scenarios that are just untrue?

02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:15.880
Yeah.

02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:22.300
I, he wouldn't even do it for, even as a goof, he wouldn't even do it for, for his boyfriend.

02:46:22.300 --> 02:46:25.200
He wouldn't do it for a child that he had.

02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:27.200
Would you, would you sing a lullaby for your child?

02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:28.200
No.

02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:29.200
No.

02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:33.760
Why would I want to go outside of the backyard to sing to the kid that's trying to go to

02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:34.760
sleep?

02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:37.880
Cause that's where they're going to stay in their pen.

02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:44.000
And let's all be, let's all be thankful for a minute that Shane doesn't have kids and

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:49.200
I'm not sure if they thankfully is gay and is very, very unlikely to be having kids.

02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:53.560
I like, I don't know if they'd have a pen cause I think I just tie them to a tree so

02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:54.840
they can't get away.

02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:56.880
It's way cheaper and easier.

02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:59.800
You don't let him babysit, do you?

02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:01.120
His kids kind of love me.

02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:02.120
Yeah.

02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:03.120
He's actually great with our kids.

02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:04.720
It's all lies.

02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:05.720
He loves our kids.

02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:07.280
He's great with the idea of the tree.

02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:08.800
I would imagine they would.

02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:13.040
They'd tire themselves out trying to run around the tree, but they'd also choke themselves.

02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:14.040
So it's a win-win.

02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:18.480
Now that fifth dream that is false advertising, chicken wire cages are where kids belong.

02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:21.840
It's actually has to be kid wire cages.

02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:23.680
Chicken wires for chickens.

02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:26.080
You guys all need therapy.

02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:29.180
Let's, we got a couple more stories for you guys and we're going to open up the skype

02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:32.780
line at orange lounge radio on skype, uh, Loki.

02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:36.880
So this is the weirdest news I think we can be reporting today.

02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:44.720
And that is first off, well, crystal Pepsi is coming back again, again, apparently people

02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:45.720
get it this time.

02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:46.720
Yes.

02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:47.720
A limited time.

02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:52.920
It will be in stores on July 7th in Canada and July 8th in us, I thought it was August

02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:53.920
for us.

02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:54.920
Nope.

02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:55.920
It's July.

02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:59.700
And apparently along with that, uh, we're going to be getting a game.

02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:09.680
It is a similar area spoof of the Oregon trail called the crystal Pepsi trail.

02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:12.400
Yes.

02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:15.640
The crystal Pepsi trail.

02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:16.640
You can check it out.

02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:17.640
Oh my gosh.

02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:19.840
I just remember when that came out last time it was on Amazon.

02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:21.660
It was all sold out in like five minutes.

02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:25.360
But now it's on the eighth so I can go get my Cali Marie amiibo and crystal Pepsi in

02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:26.360
the same day.

02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:27.360
It'll be amazing.

02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:28.360
Yeah.

02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:31.900
I want to see how this is going to happen now, but Oh, crystal Pepsi will try to like,

02:48:31.900 --> 02:48:34.860
now I remember why I hated that.

02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:36.460
I didn't remember what it tasted like.

02:48:36.460 --> 02:48:42.140
I don't remember either, but I remember liking it as a sweetie with aspartame.

02:48:42.140 --> 02:48:46.020
Oh, so it's diet was always diet.

02:48:46.020 --> 02:48:48.180
I don't feel like it tasted like a diet soda.

02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:49.180
It was sweeter.

02:48:49.180 --> 02:48:50.180
I remember that.

02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:51.220
Uh, maybe it's a mix.

02:48:51.220 --> 02:48:53.340
Do these sell surge at the stores yet?

02:48:53.340 --> 02:48:54.900
I know it's on Amazon.

02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:55.900
Surge was okay.

02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:59.280
I miss Citra.

02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:00.280
That's what I want.

02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:01.280
Surge.

02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:06.200
I want to get some crystal Pepsi and see if it's, I liked it when I was younger, but everybody

02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:08.160
says it's not as good as you remember.

02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.540
Yeah, probably.

02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:10.540
So we'll see.

02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:11.540
We'll see.

02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:12.540
I think I just liked it cause it was clear.

02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:16.080
I was like, Ooh, like Coke zero and shit like that now.

02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:17.520
So maybe it'll be popular.

02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:20.800
I just remember the Saturday night live commercial they had that was crystal gravy.

02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:22.800
Did you ever see that?

02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:24.520
I think it's on YouTube.

02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:25.520
I do remember that.

02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:26.520
All right.

02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:31.660
Oh, act depth and chat says, sky, buy a crystal Pepsi and stream it on Twitch.

02:49:31.660 --> 02:49:36.220
I fucking could now, but just don't put any alcohol in it and don't fucking, don't give

02:49:36.220 --> 02:49:37.220
it to a baby.

02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:40.020
Don't feed it to a baby while I'm on the street that do a baby anyway.

02:49:40.020 --> 02:49:41.020
All right.

02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:47.900
If it's in a baby that kind of looks like an adult moving on, uh, last story tonight

02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:52.040
has to do with an NES emulator and this is what we've actually talked about before.

02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:58.720
It is an NES emulator that turns games into 3d, not like the way you would see it like

02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:03.420
on a 3ds or something, but it actually will turn the game into looking like, like it's

02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:07.300
like a rotatable type of like 3d play field.

02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:11.540
Um, apparently this software is available now and you can actually get it through itch

02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:15.100
IO, which seems weird cause it's an emulator, but okay.

02:50:15.100 --> 02:50:17.600
Uh, but you can get it as a free download.

02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:22.540
You can chip in optionally for 99 or more for access to the latest build as soon as

02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:23.540
it was released.

02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:28.420
Uh, previously this was going for $30 and if you did buy that for that price, you're

02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:29.940
going to get refunded the difference.

02:50:29.940 --> 02:50:35.500
Although I'm surprised he's allowed to charge any money for it at all when you, I guess

02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:39.820
you don't get the ROMs and I guess that's the difference, but like you can get an idea

02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:40.820
what this looks like here.

02:50:40.820 --> 02:50:44.460
Uh, I'm, I'm looking at a video here in studio where somebody is playing balloon fight, which

02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:48.320
you know, ought to be a pretty simple NES game to emulate cause there was one of the

02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:49.320
earlier titles.

02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:53.440
There's not a whole lot going on, but you kind of get the sense that it looks like,

02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:58.020
you know, when a child would make a diorama and a shoe box, like that's the type of thing

02:50:58.020 --> 02:51:00.440
that balloon fight kind of looks like here.

02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:01.440
It's cool.

02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:02.440
It's a really cool effect.

02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:04.800
Put together with the Perler beads or something like that.

02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:09.280
Yeah, it's, it's a really cool effect, but um, yeah, it's uh, you know, again, I don't

02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:12.000
know how well this would work in every Nintendo game.

02:51:12.540 --> 02:51:15.980
Some folks in chat kind of echoing something I concluded there.

02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:20.180
Stoppy says emulators are legal, licensed ROMs are not.

02:51:20.180 --> 02:51:26.260
I still am a little surprised that it is allowed to exist on this store, but I suppose the

02:51:26.260 --> 02:51:30.300
patent would be, you know, on the Nintendo hardware would be expired by now.

02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:32.540
So maybe that's, that's why they're able to get it.

02:51:32.540 --> 02:51:35.860
That's why you have all the knockoff Nintendo things that you can buy now.

02:51:35.860 --> 02:51:40.940
Um, so maybe that's, that's why, but yeah, the ROMs certainly would not be included.

02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:43.040
Are there any public domain NES ROMs though?

02:51:43.040 --> 02:51:44.840
I don't know if there are any out there.

02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:48.760
If there could be home brew stuff that people make, yeah, I guess only the home brew stuff

02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:53.000
would work because anything that was actually in a cartridge, Nintendo would have rights

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.000
over that cartridge.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.920
I think, I think again, I'm not a lawyer.

02:51:56.920 --> 02:51:59.120
I'm just speculating, I suppose.

02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:02.940
Anyway, that is going to do it for the stories tonight, but we are going to open up the Skype

02:52:02.940 --> 02:52:07.120
line for a little bit here for any of you, the one to get through orange lounge radio,

02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:08.120
all one word on Skype.

02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:11.820
If you want to give us a call since we are already after nine o'clock, I'm only going

02:52:11.820 --> 02:52:14.100
to leave a little room here opportunity to call it.

02:52:14.100 --> 02:52:15.100
Oh, good.

02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:17.420
It is ringing already, so we'll get to it.

02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:18.420
Hi.

02:52:18.420 --> 02:52:19.420
You're on orange lounge radio.

02:52:19.420 --> 02:52:20.420
Who is this?

02:52:20.420 --> 02:52:21.420
Hey, this is Act Deft.

02:52:21.420 --> 02:52:22.420
Hey Act Deft.

02:52:22.420 --> 02:52:23.420
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:52:23.420 --> 02:52:31.820
Well, I'm kind of tired, but, but, uh, I want to talk about, uh, Kirby Pen and Robobot.

02:52:31.820 --> 02:52:32.820
Yes.

02:52:32.820 --> 02:52:36.060
Uh, we started to talk about this a little bit at the end of last week's show, but, uh,

02:52:36.060 --> 02:52:39.120
uh, what's your thoughts on this?

02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:45.680
Well, the last time I talked to, oh Lord, I hadn't, I hadn't played it, but right now

02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:55.340
I am only 2% of 100%, uh, sorry, of having a file with 100%.

02:52:55.340 --> 02:53:02.480
That game is probably the best Kirby I have ever played.

02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:06.420
That is quite some praise there, Act Deft.

02:53:06.420 --> 02:53:14.300
And, and you know me, everyone that's been listening to the show quite, sorry, quite

02:53:14.300 --> 02:53:22.780
some time, knows I love Kirby and, and I have said that Kirby Superstar is probably the

02:53:22.780 --> 02:53:32.460
best there is, and, and Robobot, I don't know if I didn't expect that much.

02:53:32.460 --> 02:53:40.960
Or, uh, I, well, I said, it's a Kirby game, I have to play it, but it really blew me away.

02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:44.840
It's like, wow.

02:53:44.840 --> 02:53:50.320
It's so, basically I can define it like so much fun.

02:53:50.320 --> 02:54:00.340
Having the robot, uh, well, destroying everything, uh, in your path, uh, the bosses, even playing

02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:06.360
as regular Kirby and, and having the abilities, uh, like the new ones, especially the, the

02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:12.520
psychic, the ESP one, like, oh my God, that's the, that, that one is so broken, but it's

02:54:12.520 --> 02:54:21.520
so much fun to use, and, and all the other modes in the game are also so fun.

02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:30.160
My, probably my only complaint is the multiplayer game it has, uh, Kirby's Team Clash.

02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:32.820
It's pretty short.

02:54:32.820 --> 02:54:34.220
That's, that's my only complaint.

02:54:34.220 --> 02:54:41.380
I, I, I, I played it yesterday or last night with some friends, uh, and there's only like

02:54:41.380 --> 02:54:47.340
six quests, and they're pretty much like boss battles with four people.

02:54:47.340 --> 02:54:55.460
Uh, they're fun, they're fun, but yeah, it took, it took us like probably half an hour

02:54:55.460 --> 02:54:57.720
to beat them all.

02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:05.120
And we tried, uh, the last one twice because we died and all that stuff, but other than

02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:09.880
that, I really, really cannot recommend this game enough.

02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:15.200
It's probably heading to, towards my game of the year of, uh, 2016.

02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:16.680
That's some, some pretty high praise.

02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:20.560
Are you sure now, just to ask a tough question, cause that's what I do, are you sure that

02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:26.220
you actually, you know, you're not just kind of blinded by, it's the new car smell, basically.

02:55:26.220 --> 02:55:30.780
The fact that it is a new Kirby game, like is that, you think, influencing your opinion

02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:37.380
or, or no, this really does hold its own compared to these Kirby games of the past that you,

02:55:37.380 --> 02:55:38.380
you love so much?

02:55:38.380 --> 02:55:39.380
Okay.

02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:43.600
How do I know that this game is like legit?

02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:45.700
I don't complete games.

02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:52.040
I don't do 100 completion or a hundred percent completion on games, like there are only a

02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:53.040
few games.

02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:56.600
Uh, do I do something like that last year?

02:55:56.600 --> 02:55:57.600
It was undertale.

02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:04.520
Uh, the year before that it was the solo night, which were both my games of the year of those

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:07.240
years, respectively, and so forth.

02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:15.000
Uh, and even Kirby games, if I like the game enough, I'll, I'll beat it like regularly,

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:20.620
not complete it, uh, uh, like get all the collectibles and all the secrets.

02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:27.140
Like, for example, uh, last year that we got, uh, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, that game

02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:36.540
was fun and, uh, but I haven't even finished that game and I liked it, but I haven't even

02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:38.100
finished it.

02:56:38.100 --> 02:56:43.220
And there are, there are other games that I like, but I don't go to the extreme to,

02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:48.920
oh, I have to get all the things, I have to complete it 100%, get all the secrets.

02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:53.780
And this game made me do it because it was so fun.

02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:56.040
It's really fun.

02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:01.960
And like, I'm gonna make this example, like, oh, like a person like Bobby Blackwolf that

02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:09.400
doesn't play hard games or, uh, games that are too difficult, like, Kirby Planet Robot

02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:14.580
Bot is like the whole game, well, not the whole game because it has some challenging

02:57:14.580 --> 02:57:22.620
parts later on, but it felt like it was God Mode and playing Kirby, if anyone has played

02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:28.540
a Kirby before, at least one, you're basically play, you're basically playing God Mode already,

02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:33.000
but the, uh, in Planet Robot Bot, it definitely feels like it.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:36.380
It feels like an, uh, a fresh new Kirby.

02:57:36.380 --> 02:57:43.280
That's probably my point here, like, and here's coming from the fan, I felt that the

02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:49.960
Kirby franchise had gotten a little stale, maybe Planet Robot Bot brought new life to

02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:50.960
it.

02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:58.940
Like, really, it's, I seriously need to tell everyone that this game is freaking awesome.

02:57:58.940 --> 02:58:04.000
Those are quite some strong words of support there, um, yeah, I mean, I think one of the

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.980
things that you mentioned there that I actually totally get is the fact that there's very

02:58:07.980 --> 02:58:11.140
few games that you will sit there and play to completion.

02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:14.240
So it's like when you do sit there with a game and play all the way to completion, you

02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:17.880
know it's something that you really, really like, or you wouldn't have done that because

02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:21.180
I'm kind of the same way and I joke about it on the show all the time that I have like

02:58:21.180 --> 02:58:22.180
gamer ADD, right?

02:58:22.180 --> 02:58:27.080
And I bounce from one game to another, like, yeah, if I actually sit there and beat the

02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:31.820
game or like the entire trilogy, as was the case of Mass Effect, I must really enjoy that

02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:32.820
game.

02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:37.040
That is, that is a high recommendation, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to really consider

02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:40.940
checking that out, although I just, oh my god, the gaming backlog just grows and grows

02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:41.940
at Deft.

02:58:41.940 --> 02:58:42.940
It grows and grows.

02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:48.260
I know, I know, mine too, it's like, oh my god, I have too many games to play.

02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:51.140
Well, um, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?

02:58:51.140 --> 02:58:57.340
Well, I'm also really sad that Flatfist, uh, are ending, but, well, at least we all have

02:58:57.340 --> 02:59:01.380
still the online component, so.

02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:05.700
But, uh, I'll end my call with this, go Team Cali!

02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:09.980
Alright, go Team Cali in case Flaco's on the fence about who he's gonna pick.

02:59:09.980 --> 02:59:12.300
Alright, take care my friend, thanks for the call.

02:59:12.300 --> 02:59:13.620
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:59:13.620 --> 02:59:14.620
Anytime, bye-bye.

02:59:14.620 --> 02:59:20.740
187 Game OLR or you can call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,

02:59:20.740 --> 02:59:23.180
but we have another call coming in right now, so let's get to it.

02:59:23.180 --> 02:59:24.700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:29.300
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:59:29.300 --> 02:59:30.300
We can't hear you.

02:59:31.300 --> 02:59:34.300
One more try, if you're there.

02:59:34.300 --> 02:59:35.300
Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:36.300
I hear a distinct ringing sound.

02:59:36.300 --> 02:59:40.300
I know, I feel like I hear, like, uh, like something might not be connected all the way.

02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:41.300
It's a robot.

02:59:41.300 --> 02:59:42.300
Or something, yeah.

02:59:42.300 --> 02:59:46.300
I don't know, maybe it was, uh, maybe it was a subliminal message, I don't know.

02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:50.300
Anyway, uh, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to, uh, give us a call.

02:59:50.300 --> 02:59:53.300
Loki, check in real quick to see if there's any last minute stories from you.

02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:56.300
Um, no.

02:59:57.300 --> 03:00:00.300
Alright, I'll leave the phones open for just a little bit longer.

03:00:00.300 --> 03:00:03.300
Alright, let's, uh, see if we can get to it.

03:00:03.300 --> 03:00:05.300
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

03:00:08.300 --> 03:00:10.300
Hello, Rob, it's me.

03:00:10.300 --> 03:00:11.300
No, same caller.

03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:14.300
Sorry, buddy, looks like Skype's not gonna work for you tonight.

03:00:14.300 --> 03:00:18.300
Alright, I guess that's a sign to probably close it down, because it's already, uh,

03:00:18.300 --> 03:00:22.300
I don't see any other, anybody else trying to get through, and it's, uh, already

03:00:22.300 --> 03:00:26.300
9.15 here on the West Coast, which means after midnight on the East Coast,

03:00:26.300 --> 03:00:29.300
so we probably should wrap things up, because I know Flocko probably needs to get back to the kids.

03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:30.300
Uh, thank you for being here.

03:00:30.300 --> 03:00:31.300
If you're sleeping, thank God.

03:00:31.300 --> 03:00:32.300
Oh, thank God.

03:00:32.300 --> 03:00:33.300
I want to get back to hanging out.

03:00:33.300 --> 03:00:34.300
The summer game's done quick, yeah.

03:00:34.300 --> 03:00:36.300
Yeah, gotta do that.

03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:40.300
I guess I can't livestream for a week, because I'll have to go against that stuff, we'll see.

03:00:40.300 --> 03:00:43.300
Um, thank you for being here tonight, Flocko.

03:00:43.300 --> 03:00:45.300
Mario Kart Double Dash right now, just so everybody knows.

03:00:45.300 --> 03:00:47.300
Yeah, I saw that, I just looked at that too.

03:00:47.300 --> 03:00:48.300
Worst Mario Kart game ever.

03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:49.300
I was gonna say, that's what it is.

03:00:49.300 --> 03:00:50.300
No, you love that game.

03:00:50.300 --> 03:00:51.300
You guys all suck.

03:00:51.300 --> 03:00:52.300
I love that game so much.

03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:54.300
That's the game that gave us toe depth, barf.

03:00:54.300 --> 03:00:55.300
I love that game.

03:00:55.300 --> 03:00:57.300
Uh, anyway, I've-

03:00:57.300 --> 03:00:59.300
Thank you for being here.

03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:00.300
You're welcome.

03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:01.300
You know what's contributing.

03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:02.300
You're welcome.

03:01:02.300 --> 03:01:03.300
I'm gracing you with my presence.

03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:04.300
Yes.

03:01:04.300 --> 03:01:05.300
No, it's, it was super fun.

03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:06.300
I laughed a lot.

03:01:06.300 --> 03:01:07.300
I always laugh a lot.

03:01:07.300 --> 03:01:09.300
I'm like the OLR laugh track.

03:01:09.300 --> 03:01:12.300
Well, that's good that somebody's laughing.

03:01:12.300 --> 03:01:14.300
Because lately I just cry.

03:01:14.300 --> 03:01:15.300
I'm laughing with you, not at you.

03:01:15.300 --> 03:01:16.300
Or both, I don't know.

03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:17.300
Maybe both.

03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:18.300
I was at you with that password thing.

03:01:18.300 --> 03:01:20.300
Oh, that was great.

03:01:20.300 --> 03:01:23.300
Or when you were picking which Pokemon Rob would be.

03:01:23.300 --> 03:01:24.300
Yes.

03:01:24.300 --> 03:01:26.300
It's like a flashback episode where we're flashing back to the current episode.

03:01:26.300 --> 03:01:27.300
Yeah, to three hours.

03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:28.300
These shows are so fucking long.

03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:29.300
This is like Clerks now.

03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:31.300
This is like Clerks animated series.

03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:36.300
But yeah, I love being here and I'm glad I can be back after such a long break off.

03:01:36.300 --> 03:01:37.300
All right.

03:01:37.300 --> 03:01:39.300
Well, do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:40.300
Any websites?

03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:41.300
Oh, gosh, I didn't even look.

03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:43.300
Did you put my new article up yet?

03:01:43.300 --> 03:01:44.300
Not yet.

03:01:44.300 --> 03:01:45.300
It'll probably go up tomorrow.

03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:48.300
Oh, if it goes up tomorrow, if you listen to the podcast, look at my new article.

03:01:48.300 --> 03:01:49.300
It's movie preview part two.

03:01:49.300 --> 03:01:51.300
I have a few things in queue and luckily...

03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:52.300
Never mind.

03:01:52.300 --> 03:01:53.300
No, no, I'll get them all up.

03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:56.300
I'll get them all up tomorrow because I have the day off work tomorrow.

03:01:56.300 --> 03:01:57.300
At some point you can actually listen to this podcast.

03:01:57.300 --> 03:01:59.300
Know in the future that that article will be up.

03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:00.300
Awesome.

03:02:00.300 --> 03:02:01.300
Part two.

03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:02.300
Summer part two.

03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:05.300
And all right.

03:02:05.300 --> 03:02:06.300
Thank you.

03:02:06.300 --> 03:02:07.300
Come back again soon.

03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:08.300
I'll try.

03:02:08.300 --> 03:02:09.300
All right.

03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:11.300
Unless there's really good stuff on TV.

03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:14.300
Shane, you're okay.

03:02:14.300 --> 03:02:15.300
Thanks for...

03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:16.300
Super tired.

03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:17.300
...kind of being here in between shiny hunting.

03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:18.300
What are you talking about?

03:02:18.300 --> 03:02:19.300
I talked a whole lot.

03:02:19.300 --> 03:02:20.300
No, you did.

03:02:20.300 --> 03:02:21.300
You did a good job on the show tonight.

03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:23.300
I actually neglected shiny hunting a lot.

03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:26.300
Do you want to promote anything like your podcast or anything like that?

03:02:26.300 --> 03:02:27.300
Ranger pride.

03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:28.300
All right.

03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:29.300
You're very good at promoting your stuff.

03:02:29.300 --> 03:02:31.300
I'm super tired.

03:02:31.300 --> 03:02:32.300
All right.

03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:35.300
Then I guess it's time for us to go around and give everybody's final thought.

03:02:35.300 --> 03:02:38.300
But I do want to say real quick, thank you as always for listening to and supporting

03:02:38.300 --> 03:02:40.300
Orange Launch Radio.

03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:43.300
All we ask at the end of every episode, tell a friend or two about the show.

03:02:43.300 --> 03:02:44.300
Help spread the word.

03:02:44.300 --> 03:02:47.300
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only put those voices out there

03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:48.300
when they're here.

03:02:48.300 --> 03:02:50.300
So again, please help us spread the word.

03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:55.300
A nice five-star review wherever you found this show, such as like iTunes or Google Podcasts,

03:02:55.300 --> 03:02:56.300
wherever you found the show.

03:02:56.300 --> 03:02:58.300
It goes a long, long, long way.

03:02:58.300 --> 03:02:59.300
We really appreciate it.

03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:02.300
If you haven't done that yet, if you could take five seconds to do that, we'd really

03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:04.300
appreciate it.

03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:07.300
Okay, Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:14.300
My final thought is that I need to find a place to take my son for fireworks tomorrow.

03:03:14.300 --> 03:03:16.300
That's not going to be super crowded, which I think is impossible.

03:03:16.300 --> 03:03:17.300
Good luck.

03:03:17.300 --> 03:03:18.300
I may just give up.

03:03:18.300 --> 03:03:24.300
I live in Atomas and they did it like on Friday night and I didn't know this was going on,

03:03:24.300 --> 03:03:26.300
but it was like right down the street from where we live.

03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:29.300
And so we just heard the explosions going off at 930.

03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:30.300
So my son was still up at the time.

03:03:30.300 --> 03:03:31.300
We just went outside and watched it.

03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:32.300
It was awesome.

03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:33.300
That's awesome.

03:03:33.300 --> 03:03:34.300
I was like, oh my gosh, they're right there.

03:03:34.300 --> 03:03:36.300
And it was a 10-minute show.

03:03:36.300 --> 03:03:37.300
It was fantastic.

03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:38.300
Just get the lawn into it.

03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:40.300
Just get the lawn chairs out and watch your neighbors.

03:03:40.300 --> 03:03:42.300
That's what we're going to do.

03:03:42.300 --> 03:03:43.300
We're going to do tomorrow night.

03:03:43.300 --> 03:03:47.300
We just buy the crummy ones and we just light them up on the street.

03:03:47.300 --> 03:03:48.300
The kids love it.

03:03:48.300 --> 03:03:49.300
Maybe we'll see.

03:03:49.300 --> 03:03:55.300
My niece's birthday is tomorrow, so we're going to go for her party and everything.

03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:57.300
She's turning one.

03:03:57.300 --> 03:04:01.300
And so we're going to do that and they'll barbecue and stuff.

03:04:01.300 --> 03:04:02.300
But I don't know.

03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:03.300
We'll see.

03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:04.300
Awesome.

03:04:04.300 --> 03:04:07.300
And my final thought is I don't have any Fourth of July plans at all.

03:04:07.300 --> 03:04:11.300
So happy Independence Day, though, for everybody here in the States.

03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:17.300
And I hope everybody has a happy Canada Day belated to our Canadian friends because that was just a couple days ago.

03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:19.300
But I hope everybody has a safe holiday.

03:04:19.300 --> 03:04:24.300
And I'm going to use tomorrow to get some work done and play some games.

03:04:24.300 --> 03:04:26.300
I think will be a good thing to do.

03:04:26.300 --> 03:04:27.300
So that's it.

03:04:27.300 --> 03:04:29.300
That's going to do it for this episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:30.300
Thank you guys for tuning in.

03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:33.300
We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.

03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:35.300
Have fun watching those gaming marathons.

03:04:35.300 --> 03:04:36.300
Good night.
