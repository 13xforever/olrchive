0	28000	This week Valve releases a statement about its role in the CSGO gambling controversy denying any benefit of describing its impending involvement. This is just one of many reveals in this week's gaming news. Join us for all the details of your comments and more right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, July the 17th of 2016 with episode number 650 of our show. A nice round number there.
46000	60000	Welcome. Thank you for your support whether it's been for 650 weeks or if this is your very first week listening to Orange Lounge Radio. All about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, the place where every gamer has a voice.
60000	73000	And joining you in studio are three of those voices. Myself, Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter as Skie and joining me as she does just about every week on this program. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
73000	88000	Hi. How are you? I'm a little high. You had surgery this week, right? Yeah, I just took my Norco. I'm actually kind of surprised you're here to be honest. I kind of figured you wouldn't be here after having that surgery.
88000	106000	She didn't have her organs taken out or anything. I had something taken out. It was on your hand so it wasn't totally invasive. I had a ganglion sister move from my right hand. I'm not going to tell you what it is. Go look it the fuck up. That's what Google's for. If you can spell it, good luck.
107000	124000	Ganglion. G-A-N-G-L-I-O-N. Push the Siri button and then rewind the episode. Right, or whatever. But the thing is that since I'm right handed, I keep forgetting about a lot of stuff and reaching for stuff with my right hand or doing things. So I'm like, fuck that hurts.
125000	133000	Not very good for gaming either, I bet. I've actually been playing a lot of Sims, but we'll go into that later. Sure, sure. I'm just worried about what it's going to be like when I have to use a regular mouse.
133000	141000	Well, I remember when there was a good six month period where you were having some serious wrist problems and when we would go to your gaming week you'd be like, shrug, too hard to play anything because of my wrist.
141000	158000	Well, it has to do the same thing, the ganglion cyst. Right around about 2006 it got so bad I would do everything on keyboard commands. I wouldn't hold a controller. And finally, they changed my mouse at work to a thumb trackball, which they don't make that mouse anymore.
159000	170000	It's just like my Microsoft thumb trackball. And like, seriously, if you find people selling it, I bought mine for 14 bucks. People are selling them for like 100, 200 bucks because you can't get them anymore.
170000	174000	I'm surprised if people still have a need for them. They don't make them.
174000	183000	Logitech had one similar, but I don't think they make theirs anymore. So it's really annoying. And of course, work won't let me bring mine. Weird. I guess some liability.
183000	198000	But anyway, so now having used a regular mouse for two years, the cyst has started to grow again. So finally, I'm like, just screw it, cut it out. And the doctor's like, well, it's not cancerous if you've had it for this long. So let's just get rid of it.
198000	206000	So now I'm like, ow. So Norco. I love Norco. It makes me not give a fuck.
206000	211000	So Dark Soccer Tonight will not be giving any fucks. But I mean, you usually don't.
211000	218000	No, I might give a fuck here or there. But today, like, I'm not giving fucks. I'm taking them.
218000	225000	Once in a while, I might say Mass Effect and you might be like, oh, I have a fuck for that. Yes, I do. I have one fuck to spend on Mass Effect news.
225000	229000	And you know what I have, though, that makes life wonderful? Cinnabon Delights.
229000	231000	Which I've never had one. I want to try one.
231000	232000	Girl, eat one right now.
232000	244000	I got to introduce our chat room. And of course, our third host here is due. But our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
244000	253000	And some comments on Dark Soccer being on pain meds. Breakman is starting to sing that song because Dark Soccer got high. I guess changing lyrics here a little bit.
253000	261000	I was gonna play Pokemon Go, but then I got high. Actually, you probably would play Pokemon. Anyway.
261000	265000	Raginator says, how high Dark Soccer? Like listening to Cypress Hill high?
265000	266000	No.
266000	268000	Are you insane in the membrane?
268000	272000	You know what's funny is I'm allergic to pot.
272000	273000	Oh, yeah.
273000	277000	I'm allergic to the smoke. I've eaten it before, but I'm allergic to the smoke.
277000	280000	Dark Soccer was gonna host the show.
280000	283000	But then I took Norco.
283000	288000	Brad from Pod Culture suggests you are on Fuck It All. Perhaps, perhaps. Anyway.
288000	293000	Not drugged tonight. Say hello to our third host here in studio. It's Techmaster Loki.
293000	294000	Hi.
294000	295000	How are you?
295000	296000	I'm fine.
296000	299000	Yeah. You are not powered by Norco. You are powered by hamburgers.
299000	301000	Yeah.
301000	302000	Fair statement.
302000	303000	How are you doing?
303000	310000	I'm doing okay. I feel that I should have either suffered Slurpee or Milkshake, being that I wasn't in and out, so I should have got Milkshake.
310000	318000	Oh, let's talk about Slurpees for a minute. Because last night, okay, so we were in Old Sack playing Pokemon Go until 1 AM. Don't you fucking judge me.
318000	327000	We were out playing Pokemon Go until like 1 AM in Old Sack. There's tons of people around because there's bars down there that are open until 2. So, I mean, it's pretty safe.
327000	333000	So, we left, and I was like, you know what, I kind of like, like, Fatty wants a McFlurry, right? I wanted to go get a...
333000	340000	But McDonald's conveniently closes at 1 AM. So, I was like, damn it. Now I have like, you have that taste for sugar. It's like, I got to get something.
340000	351000	And then I remembered, oh, aha, 7-Eleven will have Slurpees. So, and imagine my surprise and excitement when I saw that they have a new special flavor right now.
351000	353000	Birthday Cake Slurpee.
354000	359000	Yeah, my son got that. And I'm like, no.
359000	362000	It's kind of like, it is kind of a train wreck of a flavor.
362000	368000	It's basically like Birthday Cake Soda, but frozen. And it's just, it just sounds terrible.
368000	373000	But that's like my favorite yogurt, is like Birthday Cake Yogurt, which is so weird.
373000	376000	I'll just stick to like the Cherry or the Blue Raspberry.
376000	378000	You're a traditional kind of guy.
378000	380000	Exactly. Or Cola.
380000	387000	Speaking of your son, I saw your wife posting photos on Facebook that I guess you are teaching your son how to play Pokemon Go or something.
387000	389000	You got your son on the tablet.
389000	397000	He's interested. And my coworker, she gave me like an old prepaid phone that she had that she's not using anymore because she got a nicer Samsung phone.
397000	405000	So, it doesn't run Pokemon Go, or at least it's not supposed to, but then I rooted it and got it to run.
405000	414000	So, it is running on there and he's able to play it and he's enjoying it, but she hates the idea of him playing it because she thinks he's in front of the screen too much as it is.
414000	426000	Which, I mean, yeah, he plays video games for like three hours on the weekends because that's when we're really tired and my other son goes to sleep and we're just like, we don't want to fucking deal with you right now.
426000	432000	Just go in your room and just play the Wii U until that battery runs dead.
432000	438000	And that's what he does. He plays it until the battery runs dead and then he brings the tablet back and starts bothering me again.
438000	446000	You know, that's kind of how I started when I was five years old. It was just like, I'll just go play on the Commodore 64 until I'm tired. I'm ready to go to bed.
446000	456000	Yeah, so he'll start off with Minecraft today and then I think he played probably some Smash Brothers and then he watched YouTube videos.
456000	460000	So, he'll watch the Diamond Heart and stuff like that.
460000	465000	Interesting. Alright, well that's cool. But yeah, at least Pokemon Go kind of gets you out in the real world.
465000	470000	Yeah, he liked it. I mean, he had fun with it. He got very excited about it. I told him, like, this is not an everyday thing.
470000	477000	This is sometimes. We're not bringing it to the park every single time because you don't play on the playground when you have this.
477000	483000	You just stare at the screen. So, you're not going to do this all the time, but this will be like a treat.
483000	491000	Yeah, this is when you get an A. I guess he's not old enough to get A's yet because in kindergarten everybody gets good grades, right?
491000	500000	They don't really grade you. Yeah, alright. Let's see, going to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
500000	507000	I did not realize what a freaking response Birthday Cake Slurpee was. I got like a full page of Birthday Cake Slurpee comments in our chat.
507000	514000	JD is like, Birthday Cake Slurpee, I need this. I'm assuming, since it's some type of, look at this, they didn't pay me to even pitch this.
514000	519000	They had their free Slurpee day, but I totally avoided that place, you know, on the day.
519000	523000	I'm pretty sure every 7-Eleven has it right now. And 7-Eleven's on the west coast.
523000	529000	They also have, what is that, they have like a sour one too. Like Sour Patch Kids.
529000	532000	I found something I like better than Slurpees. What's that?
532000	540000	Again at Taco Bell. They have the orange crush cream slushy thing.
540000	546000	When are they going to get horchata at Taco Bell? Actually, I shouldn't ask that because if you're going to get horchata, you gotta go to one of those hole-in-the-wall joints.
546000	550000	Taco Bell is not Mexican food. Taco Bell is Taco Bell.
550000	558000	This makes me, it makes me happy, but it's like immediate brain freeze. So eat one of these things.
558000	566000	I hear you. Let's see. Also, Stoppy says, don't get birthday cake pop tarts. They suck. I didn't realize that was a thing.
566000	573000	I had red velvet cupcake pop tarts. They were pretty good. I even sent some to Sil, who is occasionally on the Geek Card show.
573000	580000	I sent her in a box of treats last year or the year before. I sent her some red velvet pop tarts and I think she enjoyed those.
581000	586000	Let's see. SSG100Matt says, birthday cake flavoring so people can have a birthday every day.
586000	597000	And Breakman says, lol the Wii U is parenting Loki's kids. But follows that up with, woah woah woah, Loki tells his kids no. How dare he be a good parent.
597000	601000	Those comments again in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
602000	608000	Because he requests shit way too much. He doesn't know how to save up for that thing that he really wants.
608000	617000	I can tell when he's looking to bother me about something. It's like, you know what, I wish I had a blah blah blah. No thank you.
617000	625000	I wish I had like a Slurpee. Can we go get a Slurpee? We should have a Slurpee. I told my friends that I'm getting a Slurpee today.
625000	634000	And if we don't get a Slurpee, I'm lying to them. He uses that on me a lot. I'm like, that's too bad. That's not my fault.
634000	635000	That's clever.
635000	639000	And he gets really upset about it too. I'm like, sorry, no.
639000	648000	Here's the lesson I learned. You need to tell him this little saying. Tell him this comes from Uncle Rob. You ready? Don't write checks your ass can't cash.
649000	654000	Oh my God. You should have seen it like earlier today or something. Like he was just pissing off everybody.
654000	663000	And like, I'm just sitting there like, you know, they're watching TV or something. And my wife's like, shut up.
663000	668000	And she's like, oh wait, that wasn't in my head. And I said that. Oh crap.
670000	671000	He's like, you shut up.
673000	675000	I'm like, look what you did.
676000	680000	William murder face and chat says your child is trying to guilt trip already. Lol.
680000	681000	Right. He learns that from his mom.
681000	688000	Well, I do. I guess we could tease this a little bit, but this is going to be coming at some point in the next couple months.
688000	696000	We don't know when, but I, this, I almost think this is too big to tease, but we're going to, here it is. We're gonna drop the bomb.
696000	702000	Loki's kid will be on OLR in the next couple months. We're making plans to make that happen.
702000	710000	I would love it even more if it could be both Julian and Loki's son. Maybe we can talk to Julian's mom and make that happen.
710000	715000	Maybe we'll just let them have the show for the day. We'll see what that is coming.
715000	720000	We'll see. Maybe we can have the podcast for kids by kids.
722000	728000	When I think of orange zones radio, I don't think of four kids, dark soccer. We have real potty mouth problems on the show.
728000	732000	I know I meant their own podcast for kids by kids.
732000	736000	Why not everybody starting a podcast? And if you already have a podcast, podcast, start another one.
736000	740000	We still need to discuss intervention.
740000	749000	Project number five. All right. Anyway, um, some other comments here. Uh, Loki's kid is learning to be sneaky. This from brave man.
749000	752000	Loki's kid is learning to be sneaky. It's like he's learning from one of the best or something.
752000	756000	Uh, as Joanna and Matt says, seriously hit record and give the kids the show.
756000	763000	Like, yeah, I had no problem, you know, letting him play Pokemon go. My wife's the one that has the problem with it and whatever, you know,
763000	770000	I understand wanting to limit it to because he gets cranky and annoying if, you know, you give in to him too much.
770000	777000	But like, I don't know. I don't have a problem with him playing it sometimes. So I think it'd be fun.
777000	781000	All right. Let's get into some kickoff topics tonight. I have two things I want to talk about.
781000	787000	First off, since we're already kind of talking about it, I want to do something a little bit rare for Ensemble Radio.
787000	796000	I don't think we do this a lot ever since we started the kickoff topic as a way to not start every show with talking about the video games that you've been playing this week.
796000	804000	Which, by the way, is why we do a kickoff topic. But I want to do a kickoff topic that is essentially the exact same thing we talked about last week.
804000	815000	But I think it is merited for once in the show's history, and that is to talk more about Pokemon Go and the cultural revolution that this game is becoming.
815000	822000	You know, this is a really good, cheap opportunity for me to plug my brand new podcast, Wink, Nudge, Smile, available on iTunes.
822000	826000	The PokeStop podcast is a brand new podcast, I'm hoping, with Shane.
826000	832000	Even though you might think so from the name, it is not only about Pokemon Go because, you know, Shane loves the handheld games.
832000	838000	So he talks a lot about his shiny hunting adventures continue on there. He caught one during the show we taped last night.
838000	846000	And then we talk about the handheld games as well. We talk about Poke, and it's really something for everything Pokemon, although obviously Go is the huge thing right now.
846000	853000	So, cheap plug, Wink, Nudge. It's available exclusively at vognetwork.com, and you can go right to the landing page for it.
853000	862000	PokeStopPodcast.com, but available on iTunes, Google Play Store, and soon everywhere else that I can think of to submit it. But those are the big two.
862000	870000	But anyway, obviously the impact of Pokemon is still huge. In fact, looking at the news this week, I gotta be honest, you guys.
870000	876000	There's not a lot of gaming news right now. I mean, we're kind of at a low point in the cycle anyway.
876000	886000	Because, you know, in the about six weeks following E3, you kind of get in that summer slump where a lot of people go on vacation because E3 is such a huge thing to prep for.
886000	894000	So we're kind of in a little bit of a slump anyway in gaming news. But like seriously, go to your favorite gaming website. Half of the news articles this week are about Pokemon Go.
894000	903000	I'm not even joking. Like some of the ones I read, what, like VG247, you go to their front page, like half Pokemon Go stories, which I get it.
903000	911000	I'm not accusing or criticizing at all. Like that's just where everybody's at right now because the impact this game is having is huge.
911000	920000	For example, I'm sure you all have seen the videos on Facebook by now. Have you seen the video from Central Park where the Vaporeon spawns?
920000	926000	And all these people like stampeding. It's almost a wonder that nobody got hurt.
926000	928000	It's like E3 in the Wii or something.
928000	940000	And it's dark outside, so you know it's after 9, 10 o'clock at night, you know, just all running to Central Park to catch this Vaporeon. It's like, what the hell? This is nuts.
941000	951000	There was an article that just came up and I wasn't going to do it as like an after show thing. I wanted to mention it because when we were talking to Bob, you were talking about going to graveyards.
951000	952000	Sure.
952000	967000	And as a thing for you from folks in Ohio that said that they were hearing about a gem being in a particular graveyard and they had lost a family member a few years ago, 20 year old buried there.
967000	981000	And they said, wouldn't it be funny if the gem was on top of his grave? And it was. So they actually left a sign there that said all are welcome to play on this grave. He would have liked it.
981000	983000	So I just thought that would have been...
983000	994000	It just gets you in the feels too. Like it's such like little things like that. And especially, you know, and we were talking a little bit about this with Bobby, but I think you guys are also seeing these stories all over social media, Facebook, Twitter, wherever.
994000	1006000	Is that people that have had anywhere from mild to serious mental health issues, whether that be social anxiety, which I'm learning is way more common than I originally thought it was.
1006000	1017000	Or just, you know, I don't want to necessarily say a fear of the outdoors, but there's certainly a lot of fucked up shit in the world right now. Like there's a lot of fucked up shit happening in the world.
1018000	1032000	And this game is causing people to be able to mentally put that aside and go outside, you know, and go on a walk, which for many people is something they maybe wouldn't have otherwise done.
1032000	1041000	And to hear things like that, especially when video games get such a bad rap in our culture sometimes, right? When some of those fucked up things do happen in the world.
1041000	1049000	A lot of people want to look at, it was the movies, it was the games, it was, you know, the violence and the games so forth, you know, games often take a lot of that blame.
1049000	1059000	But here's a great example of, okay, well, wait a minute, if you're going to report on all the bad, you should report on some of the good too, because there's a lot of good that's coming from this particular game.
1059000	1071000	But no, the media continues to focus on the bad about, oh, these people fell off a cliff while they were playing Pokemon Go because they weren't paying attention to signs or in general paying attention whatsoever.
1071000	1080000	But it's just amazing. And to expand on one other thought that I was talking a little bit about on PokeStop that I wanted to kind of expand on here.
1080000	1093000	You know, we've done this show for 14 years, and we were born of an arcade gaming community. This show was born of an arcade gaming community that doesn't exist in the way it used to anymore.
1093000	1107000	It's more of a niche thing, I would say these days. But you know, Dark Soccer, myself, Loki, I've told this story a million times, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution, which was like, that was the game, that was our Pokemon Go.
1107000	1119000	We would meet up at Roseville Golf Land once a week, usually a lot more, three times a week, to play this game and related music games like BeatMania, Guitar Freaks and all that stuff.
1119000	1131000	We would play all these games. But somewhere along the way, because of the internet, probably, because of Xbox Live, because of the rise of these things that allowed us to stay indoors.
1132000	1139000	So those of us that did have a little more social anxiety and those sorts of things, we had a way to play video games without going out into the real world now.
1139000	1156000	And so arcade culture kind of has died a lot. Now, believe me, I fully realize, and I've talked about on this show, there are places like Round 1, Dave and Busters, you know, there are still some places that are starting to gain a little steam.
1156000	1163000	But, and you may disagree with me on this, but I would still say a lot of that is very niche. A lot of that is still a little bit more in that cult department.
1163000	1170000	It's growing, but it's not mainstream like arcades were in the 80s and 90s just yet.
1170000	1185000	But now, with Pokemon Go, it's almost flipped things on its head, because we all came back home to play games, and now Pokemon Go is saying, you need to leave home again to play games.
1185000	1197000	And so it's almost like it's bringing arcade culture back, but not to an arcade. It's bringing arcade culture to your parks. It's bringing arcade culture to downtown.
1197000	1204000	It's bringing arcade culture to wherever these Pokestops and Gyms are, which is basically everywhere.
1204000	1216000	And it's quite something to behold, but I mean, you know, if it wasn't for arcade culture, would I have ever walked up to Dark Soccer and said, you know,
1216000	1222000	oh, you play this video game, I play this video game too, although that's not how the conversation went, I just don't remember, it was a long time ago.
1222000	1231000	But would Loki and I have ever had something to talk about? Would we have ever talked about insane edits that he was making on DDR? Would we have had those things to talk about?
1231000	1238000	Who knows? Arcade culture is what made this show. And now, it's happening again because of Pokemon.
1238000	1245000	Strangers are talking to each other, you know, about, oh, did you see there's a Rapidash over there at that Pokestop, you gotta go over there and get it.
1245000	1253000	And people have these things to talk about again, and friendships are being formed. Rivalries too, and some people take that shit a little too far,
1253000	1259000	but, you know, there's always an ugly side of every culture, and arcades sometimes had toxic people as well.
1259000	1266000	And looking at all that aside, I think there's been a lot more good stuff than there's been bad stuff. I don't know, do you guys have any thoughts on that?
1266000	1270000	The arcade culture coming back again because of Pokemon Go?
1270000	1273000	I don't know, it's just people going to the park.
1273000	1276000	And it doesn't matter what park, it's every park.
1276000	1278000	Right.
1278000	1293000	I wouldn't necessarily call that arcade culture. I would actually say it would be, because the arcades for us were more of a, it was like bars when you're dating.
1293000	1300000	I mean, if you think about it, traditionally, I don't know, my dates were never really at bars.
1300000	1304000	Well, I think of Cheers, when Norm would walk into the bar and everybody went,
1304000	1309000	Norm! I remember when I used to go to DDR and walk through the big castle doors at Roseville Golf Land. Rob!
1309000	1325000	It's where, it's your pub. It really is. So, when you find other people that are doing the same thing that you are, it's an immediate bonding.
1325000	1332000	I'm sorry, I am not as articulate as I would like to be tonight. So, I hope that my words are making some sense.
1332000	1334000	They are, don't worry. Push through that Norco.
1334000	1336000	You use words, they're the best words.
1336000	1338000	I'm really good at words.
1338000	1340000	You are wording all the things very well tonight, Darzagra.
1340000	1342000	Oh, girl.
1342000	1349000	But at any rate, I wouldn't, because the arcade culture, I think, is dependent on having an arcade.
1349000	1361000	And having, being in that type of environment. What this is doing is it's just more facilitating the same type of, of social interaction.
1361000	1369000	It is a catalyst for people to actually, as I'll tell you, this is a big, probably a California thing, I don't know.
1369000	1376000	But when I moved out here, and it's still like this, people, for example, if you've got someone standing in the middle of the aisle and you're trying to get around them,
1376000	1384000	people will try to squeeze past without saying, excuse me, or, sorry, would you mind stepping aside so I can get past you?
1384000	1390000	No one will talk to another person. You won't have chatter in the line at the grocery store.
1390000	1394000	You won't randomly say hi to a stranger.
1394000	1403000	Now, this is sort of removing that barrier to participating in society.
1403000	1410000	Instead of, it's me and there's all these other people, it's, it's us and we are.
1410000	1416000	And that is the big thing. Am I, by the way, am I wrong about that observation about California?
1416000	1430000	No, but I would say that's almost more small town versus large town. Not that I'm necessarily calling Mobile a small town, but I do think there's kind of that and the southern culture in a way, you know, I think does play into that.
1430000	1435000	So I don't know if that's necessarily specifically California, because I think if you went to New York City, you'd probably find something similar. You know what I mean?
1435000	1440000	I think that's just large town versus small town. But you, you're not wrong in your observation.
1440000	1442000	I'll say that.
1442000	1468000	And, and people get so surprised when you actually, oh, excuse me, you know, but this, the same thing, instead of us having this barrier between people where no one wants to speak to another person or no one wants to interact, either for this perceived notion of convenience or inconvenience or for...
1468000	1471000	Maybe, maybe, I don't know.
1471000	1485000	Well, let me, I just want to say, you know, because I want to get to some comments here in the chat room as well. But I think, I think you're right. And when I talk about arcade culture, I don't, I don't think I literally mean the cult like that, that arcade magic is just unfortunately, it's never coming back.
1485000	1495000	That's just something folks our age will remember forever. And I just don't, well, never say never, I suppose. But that's just something that is is not what it used to be.
1495000	1512000	But you're right when you say there's that, that particular magic where you and I have something in common now. And it's this game. We have, the door is open for us to talk. And it's not weird if I like come up to you and just be like, you know, because sometimes people walk up to you like, hey, how you doing? How's your day?
1512000	1524000	And maybe that's why that that tends to happen in bars, because alcohol loosens you up a little bit. But usually, especially in big cities, like that story you're telling about the grocery store, people tend to clam up a little bit. And it's like, why is this person talking to me?
1524000	1536000	But when it's about Pokemon, like, hey, did you see the Clefairy that just spawned over there? Now? That's not weird at all. It's not weird at all to ask somebody, have you seen my Jigglypuff?
1536000	1563000	When I was in line at Taco Bell, because when I can't get out and walk, if I'm in a place where I'll be driving slowly or, you know, like in a parking lot, I'll turn on the game so that it counts my distance when I'm moving slowly. And so she just happened to see it in my car. And just like, if you go like a couple of blocks down, we saw this over there, which I didn't stop. I was like, Oh, thank you. You know, just random.
1564000	1591000	Oh, yeah. And I heard a girl, we were walking through the park, we were walking to get to this Thai restaurant, we want to eat too. And there's tons of people at this park playing, right? And this girl's like, I got to find the Pikachu I got. Where's the Pikachu Pikachu? And I looked, I yelled Pikachu in the parking lot, diagonal from the park. And she goes, Thank you so much and runs off, you know, and it's, you know, and Alan and I were talking over dinner. I hope that girl got her Pikachu. She really wanted it. I got one right here. Yeah, apparently that park is like a Pikachu. Stop it.
1591000	1609000	I need to catch a Raichu. But I'm starting to find more evolved ones around too. But I mean, this is why I was even thinking of like, trying to get friends for like a, you know, a weekly pokey walk. Just, you know, pick a neighborhood, have people together and do a night walk.
1609000	1630000	Which is funny, because and I don't mean to like be an ass, but this is just the reality of the situation. You've talked about doing a weekly walk before like, oh, we're gonna go do on a walk just for our health and for our sanity. We're gonna go walking. And I don't think that idea really ever got off the ground more than one or two weeks. But Dark Sakura, now the Pokemon are involved. It'll happen.
1630000	1631000	Let's do it.
1631000	1633000	It'll happen. Absolutely.
1633000	1634000	You know,
1634000	1635000	isn't that interesting?
1636000	1645000	You know, I think, you know, even like, you know, like, maybe if we want to do like a club night or something, go walk downtown, you know, power numbers safe, safe enough.
1645000	1649000	That's right. Stop in. That's why I'll go to Old Sack because I don't go alone.
1649000	1657000	Stop in, go, you know, go to a couple clubs, have drink. Keep walking. Stop for dessert. Keep walking.
1657000	1661000	ActDeft in chat says, Dark Sakura, my friends and I are doing that. We chose Thursday nights.
1661000	1670000	SHA100Matt says, I'm just surprised by the huge response and the amount of people playing it. My small hometown tracks in a local park has been getting 50 people a night.
1670000	1673000	They don't get that many people a day with regular events.
1673000	1677000	Some other comments about the whole like arcade culture thing I wanted to get to in chat.
1677000	1684000	JD in our chat at live.vognetware.com says, I feel like arcade culture went away largely for financial reasons.
1684000	1689000	I don't really see Pokemon Go changing the financial picture there, even with its popularity.
1689000	1695000	You know, that's, that's an interesting point. I, because Pokemon Go, it's making money.
1695000	1699000	You know, I realize they do give out free lures and free, you know, some of these.
1699000	1703000	But you know, people are buying them. Look, guilty. I dropped $20 on it.
1703000	1706000	You know why? Because I wanted to support the game's development.
1706000	1709000	I've been a Niantic fan for years because of Ingress.
1709000	1714000	I knew day one I was going to drop 20 bucks just because I wanted to show a little love to the game.
1714000	1717000	And you know, some more XP eggs are nice too.
1717000	1720000	But I bought some incubators.
1720000	1725000	And it adds up, people. All those people in Central Park running to get the Vaporeon.
1725000	1729000	If they all spend $5, you know, Niantic's making money.
1729000	1735000	Apple's making money because they get, what is it, 30%? Google's making money because they get 30%.
1736000	1745000	The amount of money that they're receiving per user is higher than like even, well it's, it's double what most games are.
1745000	1747000	It's slightly higher than like Candy Crush Saga though.
1747000	1753000	I mean, they're, they're estimating, I mean, it's like a quarter per person per day.
1753000	1759000	But a quarter times, you know, a billion, quite a few million people, then that's still quite a bit of money.
1759000	1764000	More people than were playing Candy Crush at its peak, which officially happened in the last week.
1764000	1766000	Eat another one of these because I don't want to eat them all.
1766000	1770000	Those Cinnabon things are amazing. And I don't feel guilty because I'll walk it off.
1770000	1776000	I'll work off this Jigglypuff a little later. I'm just going to put the box here for a moment while I finish a couple other thoughts.
1776000	1777000	But the precious.
1777000	1779000	So I have a couple other thoughts and then I want to move on.
1779000	1784000	So one, the inevitable knockoff games. It's coming.
1784000	1791000	Because if you're a gaming company and you're not, you know, they're all thinking, they're everybody's seeing Pokemon go.
1791000	1796000	Employees at game companies are all playing Pokemon Go. I mean, that's a given.
1796000	1802000	I don't have to tell you that I know people that work in the gaming industry and fuck yeah, they're all playing Pokemon Go just like the rest of us are.
1802000	1811000	The problem is, though, it's going to be, you know, coming up with the infrastructure for all that because they've had this being built by the community for years now with Ingress.
1811000	1814000	And now you can't just jump into that.
1814000	1815000	Yeah, no.
1815000	1824000	So if somebody is going to, quote unquote, knock off Pokemon Go, they're going to have to figure out where are they going to get that network from.
1824000	1829000	But then again, there's other location based games. I just haven't played any of them. So I don't know how those work.
1829000	1834000	You know, and some would argue, Rob, did you ever play a Vita game called Invisimals?
1834000	1839000	Because that is a lot of, you know, what you see in Pokemon Go is in this Invisimals game.
1839000	1841000	No, I did not play that game.
1841000	1844000	And I'm going to give you my honest reason that you don't want to hear.
1844000	1846000	I didn't play that game because it wasn't Pokemon.
1846000	1851000	And I didn't play that game because, you know, on the Vita, you're kind of constricted to your house.
1851000	1863000	So it was just, and I mean, in the way, I kind of felt that, oh, well, isn't that similar to just the face Raider game or whatever that is that's built into the 3DS?
1863000	1868000	I mean, it's, you know, so there's a lot more that I think Pokemon Go does.
1868000	1871000	But I'm sure other companies are going to try to rip it off.
1872000	1875000	I'm sure, in fact, I think I even read a story out there.
1875000	1878000	There's already Chinese games being made that, you know.
1878000	1882000	Although just straight up rip Pokemon Go and call it something else and it will be Pokemon Go.
1882000	1890000	You know what, when Flappy Bird came out, there was a million clones, including Flappy Vog, playable at vognetwork.com, wink.
1892000	1897000	But what's going to be the first real challenger that steps up?
1897000	1899000	And I'm curious what gaming company is looking at it.
1899000	1906000	And if you follow me on Twitter, I've been saying a lot that I fully predict it's going to be Disney.
1906000	1912000	And because who's got the characters that can compete with Pokemon? Disney.
1912000	1913000	Monster Hunter?
1913000	1920000	I don't, this is not going to be popular, what I'm about to say. This is a hard truth.
1920000	1924000	Not nearly as popular as Pokemon. It's kind of a niche thing.
1924000	1926000	And Digimon already had it ages ago.
1926000	1930000	And Digimon, not as well known as Pokemon. I know you don't want to hear that.
1930000	1932000	Already had it ages ago.
1932000	1937000	Yeah, well it's kind of, Digimon, have they done anything recent with it?
1937000	1942000	Well there's Digimon Adventure Try, is the series that's out right now.
1942000	1946000	Which basically is a continuation of the first two series.
1946000	1959000	But keep in mind, Digimon existed before Pokemon as little items that you would carry around on these little things that you could put them together and battle against each other.
1959000	1963000	Wasn't it kind of a derivative, not directly, but a derivative of Tamagotchi?
1963000	1968000	Actually the same company, Tamagotchi was the precursor to Digimon.
1969000	1977000	You know who's really big into mobile gaming? They have a franchise called Elibits. That's as close as I can get.
1978000	1980000	Konami, that would be funny.
1980000	1987000	ActDeaf says Disney Infinity rebranding, Disney Infinity and beyond. You know what, you should trademark that title because it's pretty good.
1987000	1992000	Too bad they should have just done what they were planning on doing Disney Infinity and I think that would have been great as it was.
1992000	2000000	But sure, if they want to try doing this, that's cool. It won't make any sense, but you know, neat.
2000000	2011000	I do feel like there are other public source, open source geocaching websites. There are other databases that a competitor could choose to pull from.
2011000	2017000	Or they could just be really generic and just split the world into tiny little squares and do something with that.
2017000	2023000	I'm not saying whatever the ripoff game is going to be literally the same thing as Pokemon Go with different characters.
2023000	2025000	In fact, I would be very disappointed if that was the game.
2025000	2035000	But I think you will see somebody try to push the get out in the real world and look for our characters type of game before the holidays.
2035000	2037000	So we'll see what happens with that.
2037000	2042000	And I had something else I wanted to talk about. Oh yeah, one other thing. Let me ask you guys about this.
2042000	2045000	And I'm curious what chat thinks about this too.
2045000	2047000	How long is this going to go on?
2047000	2055000	Like, I kind of don't believe that six months from now I'm still going to go to old sack and there's going to be hundreds of people on the pier trying to catch a horsey.
2055000	2061000	How long? What's the endgame here with Pokemon Go? What's this going to look like a week from now?
2061000	2063000	There is no endgame right now. There's no game.
2063000	2070000	So there can't be an endgame. It's just catching Pokemon and then you fill up your Pokedex and then you're done.
2070000	2075000	Then by the time most people are getting close to doing that, they'll release more Pokemon and it'll be never anything.
2075000	2082000	Trying to answer the question why people are attached to certain brands, it makes no fucking sense.
2082000	2087000	I mean, why do people play Candy Crush Saga? Who the fuck knows? Who the hell cares?
2087000	2092000	But they're making money off of it. This is the fad that's going to be popular right now.
2092000	2095000	And eventually another fad will come along and it'll be that.
2096000	2102000	JD in chat theorizes a competitor could use the Foursquare or Facebook databases. LOL.
2102000	2108000	Mega Man X 400 says it will die down but there will be people always playing the game.
2108000	2114000	That's how I kind of feel too. Is that you might not have 500 people in Old Town but you might have five.
2114000	2116000	Right, just like with Ingress.
2116000	2119000	We're dozens strong.
2121000	2123000	That's true. It'll become a cult thing like Ingress.
2124000	2130000	Let's see. Dungeon Buster says it will eventually plateau but in the meantime everyone's enjoying the ride.
2130000	2131000	That's for sure.
2131000	2137000	William Murface says I think it depends. If you keep updating mechanics and adding Pokemon and having events, maybe years.
2137000	2141000	You know, to be fair to Niantic and Ingress, and we've mentioned this on the show before,
2141000	2150000	Niantic has not shied away from changing the game as it's going and putting new things out there and new items and changes to basic game mechanics.
2150000	2158000	When they introduced the pay store in Ingress, it really changed the way that people farmed for gear.
2158000	2167000	Because it used to be like you'd have to have a bunch of portals that you could just either drive through or walk through really quick and hack repeatedly.
2167000	2172000	But then they added, I want to say they added glyph hacking for one. I don't think that was in the game in the very beginning.
2172000	2177000	So where you could do a longer hack and you drew pictures, a Simon Says type game, and you got more gear.
2177000	2184000	And then when they opened the pay store there was frackers which would double the gear output and it changed the way that people get their gear.
2184000	2191000	Because Niantic split from Google and when they split from Google that's when they opened the cash shop because they had to substantiate themselves.
2191000	2194000	They didn't have unlimited Google money anymore.
2194000	2202000	But those of you that are worried that the game is never going to get changed or upgraded, I think to be fair to Niantic,
2202000	2205000	now granted they have a lot of server issues and all that stuff to work out right now.
2205000	2212000	But once they work that stuff out, I really do think Niantic will change and upgrade the game and all that stuff.
2212000	2215000	So I think that is coming.
2215000	2219000	Anyhow, that's I guess all I want to say on Pokemon Go.
2219000	2222000	Let me get a couple more comments in chat over at live.vognetware.com.
2222000	2226000	Kaijuto in chat says it won't be Disney, they're kind of over video games.
2226000	2230000	It's probably going to be something like the Smurfs or Treasurer trolls.
2231000	2237000	Kaijuto, I see your point with Disney but I kind of don't think it's accurate when it comes to mobile.
2237000	2241000	Look on the mobile store right now because there's still a lot of Disney games on mobile.
2241000	2247000	I get what you're saying with consoles, especially what we saw with Infinity, but I feel like in the mobile space Disney ain't done.
2248000	2259000	You know what, I was actually just thinking that I like what some of those like Pounds are doing,
2259000	2263000	where you walk their dogs and you can do it while you're playing Pokemon.
2263000	2270000	And I sort of see like having charity walk apps and things like that become more popular as a result,
2270000	2274000	especially things that you can run in conjunction with Pokemon Go or other apps like that.
2274000	2280000	And Dutch blockbuster says it's interesting to think that Pokemon Go is probably their bare bones foundation for much larger changes later.
2280000	2289000	They've really only started out with a relatively small pick of Pokemon and there's the entire history of the series to draw on for special events, mechanics and so forth.
2289000	2294000	And you know, you bring up a good point because we're talking about will this thing be dead next week, next month?
2294000	2301000	Niantic hasn't even announced a live event for Pokemon Go yet. It's coming.
2301000	2310000	You saw the trailer with Mewtwo in Central Park and we know damn well there's about five Pokemon in the game right now you can't catch.
2310000	2316000	If you see pictures of people with Mew or Mewtwo, they are fake. Niantic is saving those for these live events.
2316000	2321000	And so that whole piece of the puzzle has yet to unveil itself on what that's going to look like.
2321000	2326000	Is that going to involve battling for gyms and only one team will be able to get the Pokemon?
2326000	2332000	I actually think that would be really shitty because there's a lot of kids playing this game so they're going to need to open it up to everybody somehow.
2332000	2335000	I realize it's very hippy dippy but it's the honest to god truth.
2335000	2339000	We'll see how that's going to work in the coming weeks.
2339000	2347000	So I expect we're going to have regular Pokemon updates on this show because the game will continue to evolve.
2347000	2354000	It'll just be interesting how many people are still with it when the live events and those things start to come out.
2354000	2366000	Anyway, I do want to get to our gaming weeks but before we do, I want to ask DarkSakura about this because you got to the show just in the nick of time tonight because you were at another event right up until five o'clock.
2366000	2368000	You want to tell us about where you were at today?
2368000	2383000	I was at a game developer jam done by IDGA Sacramento, the independent game developer association.
2383000	2390000	I can't make my brain work right now.
2390000	2395000	What was the other one? I totally can't think of it.
2395000	2398000	I think it's like Girls Do Code, something like that.
2398000	2402000	I'll have to look it back up again because like I said, I'm not thinking very clearly.
2402000	2408000	I was a judge on the panel with two other brilliant ladies.
2408000	2421000	And basically they had two days to put a working game demo or at least enough of the game that would give you a minimal amount to get it working and fine.
2421000	2430000	So they had some great games there and there's actually another one that I really wanted to bring up too.
2430000	2432000	But I'll go through the recap.
2432000	2436000	There was one that was called Battle Arena and they they went our runner up.
2436000	2446000	That's basically a combination of having like a PvP arena matches and real time strategy on the overworld maps.
2446000	2448000	And it wasn't it was neat concept.
2448000	2455000	There was our winner, which was Overtime, which was sort of like Silent Hill in an office.
2455000	2465000	And they just, you know, had enough to show us practical gameplay, but it's definitely going to be more of a psychological type of scare as opposed to, you know, jump scary.
2465000	2470000	Well, I know I find the office place to be very scary, so a lot of people can relate.
2470000	2485000	Well, this really it really you know, there's another one then that was called Wybrick, which is Kirby backwards, where instead of you eating things, you're a piece of pizza that gets eaten by people.
2485000	2493000	And then you have to go through like different worlds inside of these people and you till you're vomited or excreted or something.
2493000	2496000	That's interesting, but I like that.
2496000	2497000	It's an interesting concept.
2497000	2499000	It's pretty creative. It's clever, though.
2499000	2501000	And then there was another one.
2501000	2507000	I don't remember that it had a name, but it was done with the what's it called the pulse band.
2507000	2516000	It's used for meditation that, you know, you have to get your your alpha waves into a particular line.
2516000	2522000	And but they were going to do like an infinite runner type.
2522000	2528000	But when you get your mind into this certain set, then you can fire because it'll read the alpha waves.
2528000	2534000	And they're supposed to work with like different waves that you get different buffs for powers as you go through the game.
2534000	2542000	It was a neat concept. But the thing to me is that it's also, I think, generally requires one to be neurotypical.
2542000	2554000	You know, I think that people who are who are atypical would definitely have some trouble with that because mindsets are much harder to control based on other things.
2554000	2559000	I don't know how I feel about reading people's minds and stuff, although I think it's a cool concept not to not to.
2559000	2563000	But I'm just like, oh, the mind control gaming is a really scary kind of exciting thing.
2563000	2567000	I got to mention this. You're getting a shout out in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2567000	2571000	An anonymous chatter says, hey, that's us over time. Thanks again for coming out.
2571000	2572000	You must have left an impression.
2572000	2580000	Well, I did hang out and talk with those guys and I was just I was super, super impressed with what they had there.
2580000	2591000	I think, you know, definitely, you know, more it was it was, I think, pretty bare bones as far as the the renders.
2591000	2595000	They definitely, you know, needed some some texturing and some work going in it.
2595000	2596000	But it was two days.
2596000	2601000	It was, I would say, impressively polished for what it was.
2601000	2605000	You know, everything worked. Sound effects were there were music.
2605000	2614000	It was I was really impressed with the the the other thing that really impressed me about them was how cohesive they were.
2614000	2617000	Everyone in their group was on the same page.
2617000	2626000	There was another thing and they won our honorable mention is a concept for a game.
2626000	2634000	Now, they didn't have the demo or anything like that because they're actually looking for for people to help them develop it.
2634000	2637000	They've just got mock ups and writing done.
2637000	2651000	So I said I would give a shout out, you know, but the game is called Daddy's Tiny Girl, where through a series of misfortunes, a six year old girl is adopted by a giant.
2651000	2657000	And so the game is her exploring a giant's world.
2657000	2664000	And she has like giant magic that gives her more strength and the ability to eat like a giant and all kinds of things.
2664000	2669000	But you play through a little girl's eyes, trapped in giant's world.
2669000	2675000	And I thought that the concept was in the story that what I heard of it so far was really good.
2675000	2678000	They just need people to help them design and code.
2678000	2685000	So if anyone is out there who would love to help these girls out, send me a line.
2685000	2690000	You can email me through the show, participate at Twitter is a good way to.
2690000	2693000	Yeah, you can get me a Twitter at at Dark Sakura.
2693000	2696000	But you can also email our our line here.
2696000	2704000	But I said I would put the word out there, see if anyone might be able to help them with with coding or different things that they need, because the concept is really solid.
2704000	2708000	Well, and those folks that do overtime that are listening, you know, first, I want to check out the game.
2708000	2710000	How come Dark Soccer got to see all these games?
2710000	2713000	Because I have boobs.
2713000	2714000	That's not fair.
2714000	2716000	And they're amazing.
2716000	2719000	Well, I guess I should have just hauled my ass to the event.
2719000	2720000	I'm a lady in gaming.
2720000	2729000	But B, when you guys get something together that you might put out there for public consumption or something, by all means, our couch is open.
2729000	2731000	So we'll get you guys on the show to talk about it.
2731000	2733000	Well, I definitely will.
2733000	2742000	And as I brought up to the guys behind overtime, I would love to have them on the show for sure to talk about it, because I really think that, you know.
2743000	2745000	I really want to see the finished product.
2745000	2746000	Yeah.
2746000	2749000	I would play the shit out of it.
2749000	2752000	Sometimes developers just need a little motivation.
2752000	2756000	You guys all remember, do we all remember when YYR came on this show?
2756000	2764000	And I read him up and down saying, if you do not make this game, I will sell it for millions of dollars because you were too lazy to do it.
2764000	2767000	And now, and he just got on Steam Greenlight.
2767000	2769000	Not to say I told you so, but.
2769000	2771000	You told him so.
2772000	2773000	Girl.
2773000	2784000	There's enough jaded BS that's happened gaming commentating for the past 14 years that we tend to know a pretty good idea when we see one that, you know, you just got to sometimes really apply yourself.
2784000	2791000	Also, since Dark Sakura has been taking Norco, I decided I would drink some wine that I started on the Pokestop podcast last night.
2791000	2793000	So now my thoughts are being in it a little bit.
2793000	2794000	I'm going to have wine coke.
2794000	2795000	But I'm serious on what I said.
2795000	2799000	But these, by the way, completely unintentional endorsement.
2799000	2806000	Fuck you Taco Bell for making the cinema and delights absolutely amazing.
2806000	2807000	Yeah.
2807000	2809000	I think Rob and I finished the box together.
2809000	2810000	There's still a couple more left, so you might want to have one.
2810000	2811000	They're going to go in my mouth.
2811000	2812000	All right.
2812000	2813000	Anyway.
2813000	2814000	OK, so that's great.
2814000	2815000	It sounds like that was a lot of fun.
2815000	2820000	And we love SAKI GDA and Bri and Gabe and everybody involved with them.
2820000	2824000	So I'm really glad we were able to do something outside just the one event a year.
2824000	2825000	So I'm really ecstatic that you went to that.
2825000	2826000	So that's great.
2826000	2827000	I was glad to be invited.
2827000	2828000	I was super happy.
2828000	2829000	Yeah, that's awesome.
2829000	2830000	So.
2830000	2831000	All right.
2831000	2837000	Well, let's move on to how was our gaming week and what types of video games have we been playing this week?
2837000	2840000	I guess since Dark Sakura tends to go first, she'll go first again.
2840000	2842000	What have you been playing?
2842000	2843000	Cinema Bond Delight to the game.
2843000	2848000	How was your gaming week outside of the fine game jam developed things?
2848000	2852000	I have been playing some Pokemon Go and I can get out of the house to walk.
2852000	2854000	I've hatched a few eggs.
2854000	2858000	They've had shit in them.
2858000	2866000	I also have been playing a lot of Sims 4 because I have to ice my hand a lot.
2866000	2870000	So I will just put an ice pack on and leave it over my little immobile mouse.
2870000	2875000	And I've just been going nuts building tree houses and building things.
2875000	2881000	I really super love The Sims 4.
2881000	2883000	And I think that's really it.
2883000	2884000	Oh, yeah.
2884000	2888000	And I'm still on Miitomo because I like Miitomo.
2888000	2894000	Although I curse loudly playing the stupid Miitomo drop.
2894000	2899000	Do you still get enough of a supply of tickets and things where you're not really having to pay for that?
2899000	2900000	You're given a lot more tickets now.
2900000	2901000	Oh, that's good.
2901000	2904000	Like in the last month, I've gotten like a ticket like practically every day.
2904000	2907000	I would imagine that's because a lot of that has slowed down maybe.
2907000	2908000	Yeah.
2908000	2913000	And you can get tickets as redemption prizes for your mission points.
2913000	2921000	But, you know, me, I mean, the other thing I like about The Sims is dressing people up and designing my characters.
2921000	2924000	So sort of had the same thing in Miitomo.
2924000	2928000	And right now I have my little me in an all vinyl bodysuit.
2928000	2934000	So I have to admit, I kind of finally fell off the Miitomo bandwagon, but I do need to fire it up.
2934000	2940000	And I partially blame Pokémon Go for that, but I also blame that fucking Tap My Katamari game that Loki got me into to do.
2940000	2942000	Which, by the way, he's playing right now.
2942000	2946000	And I know it because I keep seeing his finger going tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
2946000	2947000	Exactly.
2947000	2949000	There's nothing you tap on your phone that much.
2949000	2950000	I am totally not.
2950000	2951000	I'm very impatient.
2951000	2952000	I'm just tapping.
2952000	2954000	Hurry up and finish your gaming week.
2954000	2956000	No, he's playing Tap My Katamari.
2956000	2958000	I'm totally not going to play that.
2958000	2960000	Yes, please don't.
2960000	2961000	That is a good life choice.
2961000	2965000	Oh, I did play something else because I found out I can use it in dual monitor mode.
2965000	2969000	It was, um, cat lateral damage.
2969000	2970000	Oh, really?
2970000	2972000	I fucking love cat lateral damage.
2972000	2977000	I mean, it's not easy and the controls are kind of not responsive in the way that I'd like for them to.
2977000	2980000	And also it's really hard to play when you're on Norco.
2980000	2984000	Um, but, uh, I, I've, it's cute.
2984000	2986000	I had fun with it.
2986000	2990000	And basically you were literally playing an asshole cat.
2990000	2993000	Not sweet happy cat or mischievous cat.
2993000	2997000	You were destroying things because you hate the family.
2997000	2998000	It says it in the game.
2998000	3001000	You're doing this because you hate everyone.
3001000	3002000	I was like, okay, I'm going to do that.
3002000	3003000	Well, that's just a cat.
3003000	3004000	I mean.
3004000	3005000	Well, no, Midna doesn't.
3005000	3006000	Midna doesn't.
3006000	3009000	She's just luring you into a false sense of security.
3009000	3010000	Midna is a good cat.
3010000	3012000	Of course she strikes for the kill.
3012000	3014000	No, Midna loves me.
3014000	3019000	Um, so that's pretty much been my, my week.
3019000	3022000	Is just building houses in the Sims.
3022000	3023000	And then wrecking them with a cat.
3023000	3027000	No, I did tear down a house that I just made and started a new one.
3027000	3030000	Cause I was like, I'm going to tell you something.
3030000	3034000	Big houses are great in the Sims and they'll look nice and everything,
3034000	3036000	but they are a fucking pain in the ass to play through.
3036000	3040000	Make yourself a small house with a big yard and you will be very happy.
3040000	3042000	It's a good, it's a good life lesson.
3042000	3044000	Just keep it, keep it, keep it small.
3044000	3046000	The stuff you own, owns you.
3046000	3047000	All right.
3047000	3049000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
3049000	3052000	Um, honestly, it's pretty much the same as last week.
3052000	3058000	Um, you know, I played Pokemon Go a bit, uh, when it was working and then, um,
3058000	3062000	Ingress just a bit, just to keep my daily stuff going on.
3062000	3064000	I think I may have captured a portal through here or there.
3064000	3067000	Um, and then tap my Katamari.
3067000	3070000	I've been playing way too much of that just because, I don't know,
3070000	3074000	that's about all of the brain activity I have in the evening is just for that.
3074000	3079000	I mean, like, I was trying to research voxel engines and stuff like that
3079000	3083000	and just reading through the code, my eyes just get so blurry and stuff
3083000	3085000	just because I'm so tired.
3085000	3088000	But tapping my Katamari requires no brain power whatsoever.
3088000	3091000	It's pretty much just tapping the screen, so I'm able to play that just fine.
3091000	3094000	And then, of course, just so that I could say I played a game,
3094000	3096000	aside from the crap that I played last week,
3096000	3099000	I did fire up a little bit of Burnout Paradise on Steam
3099000	3103000	and played through a little bit of that, uh, today, but it's all right.
3103000	3106000	I didn't get a chance to play anything on the PlayStation 4
3106000	3109000	because my fucking wife is still watching Grey's Anatomy
3109000	3111000	and I'm still very unhappy about this.
3112000	3115000	I need some sort of external mod.
3115000	3117000	Yeah, and that's the other thing, too.
3117000	3120000	It's like, none of the fucking streaming options work.
3120000	3123000	It's like, oh, hey, yeah, you can stream your PlayStation 4 to your laptop.
3123000	3125000	No, I can't.
3125000	3127000	It doesn't fucking work.
3127000	3128000	At all.
3128000	3132000	Which makes no fucking sense because I'm on, like, wireless AC.
3132000	3135000	My laptop should be able to run that shit,
3135000	3138000	and the router is literally fucking six feet away from me,
3138000	3141000	so there's no reason that that shouldn't work.
3141000	3143000	I want to say I even tried a wired connection as well,
3143000	3145000	and I don't think it's working either.
3145000	3146000	I don't know why.
3146000	3147000	It could be because fucking Netflix is going,
3147000	3151000	and that shit's a network hog, so that could be it.
3151000	3154000	But I would think that, you know, it does have Wi-Fi Direct for the PlayStation.
3154000	3157000	I wish it could just connect directly to the PlayStation,
3157000	3160000	you know, cut out the whole middleman of the router and everything,
3160000	3164000	but whatever, I guess it's just not going to work,
3164000	3168000	and I'm going to be stuck with my computer full of, like,
3168000	3171000	oh, by the way, I did surpass 500 games in my Steam library now,
3171000	3174000	so I have nothing to play.
3174000	3177000	I literally have nothing to play.
3177000	3181000	There should be a video game called I Have Nothing to Play.
3181000	3182000	It's on Steam for 99%
3182000	3184000	Yeah, it's like I was looking through my Steam library,
3184000	3186000	like, I don't know what any of this is,
3186000	3189000	but I'm going to buy some more.
3189000	3190000	Because it's cheap.
3190000	3194000	I got, like, there was a bundle with Skullgirls in it for, like, $3.99,
3194000	3197000	and then something else that was, like, on the same page for $2.99.
3197000	3202000	I'm like, oh, Surya Being Hunted was in another one that was, like, $2.99.
3202000	3204000	I'm like, eh, six bucks for, like, 20 games?
3204000	3205000	I can't beat that.
3205000	3206000	That's pretty good.
3206000	3209000	So I bought it and probably won't play them ever.
3209000	3210000	All right.
3210000	3211000	Fair enough.
3211000	3214000	And I keep going through these stupid, like, PlayStation sales.
3214000	3218000	It's getting as bad as, like, Steam now, and it's like, ooh, that's $5.99.
3219000	3221000	Maybe I will just pick up a copy of Knack.
3221000	3222000	No.
3222000	3225000	MegaManX400 in our chat says, Loki is a digital hoarder.
3225000	3226000	Yes.
3226000	3227000	I am a digital hoarder, yes.
3227000	3228000	At least you admit it.
3228000	3229000	I am.
3229000	3230000	All right, anything else for your gaming week?
3230000	3231000	That's it.
3231000	3232000	My gaming week.
3232000	3233000	Honestly, a lot of the same types of stuff.
3233000	3235000	I mean, I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Go,
3235000	3241000	and because of that, my interest in the main Pokemon games is kind of back.
3241000	3243000	I'm still playing Pokemon Alpha Sapphire,
3243000	3245000	making my way through that.
3245000	3247000	And so I played a little more of that this week.
3247000	3251000	And I've been playing Overwatch, which has been fun.
3251000	3253000	I'm challenging myself to try new characters,
3253000	3257000	and I actually have found that I love playing Pharah.
3257000	3259000	And that was something, like, when the game first came out,
3259000	3262000	I couldn't really get into, and all I could play was support characters,
3262000	3263000	like Lucio and Symmetra.
3263000	3269000	But I love playing Pharah, because she flies, and she has a rocket launcher,
3269000	3272000	and who doesn't love a rocket launcher?
3272000	3273000	So I'm having a lot of fun playing her.
3273000	3275000	Even though her ultimate leaves her so vulnerable,
3275000	3277000	it is so frustrating sometimes.
3277000	3278000	But that's been fun.
3278000	3280000	I've been playing a little bit with Allen.
3280000	3281000	I've been playing with one of our listeners,
3281000	3284000	who has done some of the artwork for some of the other shows,
3284000	3286000	Codeman.
3286000	3288000	He's a pretty good Junkrat.
3288000	3290000	He got to play the game with Junkrat, and he plays D.Va.
3290000	3292000	I mean, it's easy to get to play the game as Junkrat, though.
3292000	3294000	But he plays a good D.Va.
3294000	3296000	So when we team up, we actually tend to win a lot of games.
3296000	3298000	So I do Pharah, or I might heal.
3298000	3300000	So I've been playing a little bit of that.
3300000	3302000	That's been a lot of fun.
3302000	3305000	There's only really been one new game that I've played this week,
3305000	3310000	and it is a free game with gold game that came out on Xbox One,
3310000	3315000	because those games flip out, what, on the 1st and the 15th, right?
3315000	3320000	So the new games came out on, I think, July 16th is when it came out.
3320000	3324000	The game is called Tumblestone that's out on the Xbox One,
3324000	3327000	and I think regularly this game would cost you $20,
3327000	3330000	but now it is free with games with gold.
3330000	3334000	And if I had paid $20 for this game, I would have been so fucking mad,
3334000	3339000	because it's something that's like an iPhone game
3339000	3341000	that's kind of put on the Xbox One.
3341000	3343000	It's a puzzle game.
3343000	3346000	Basically, you have a well of falling bricks,
3346000	3350000	and you want to just move back and forth to catch.
3350000	3352000	I guess it's kind of like magical drop.
3352000	3354000	You want to catch, like, three in a row,
3354000	3356000	but you don't necessarily have to throw them back up.
3356000	3358000	It's just that you pull them down in three in a row.
3358000	3362000	But the way the well is designed, sometimes you may screw yourself over
3362000	3365000	so that if you pull the wrong three bricks down,
3365000	3368000	you can't pull three more bricks down at the same color,
3368000	3369000	and you're going to instantly lose.
3369000	3373000	So, okay, from a puzzle game aspect, I guess that's a decent concept,
3373000	3377000	but all you get in the games with gold is the story mode.
3377000	3379000	And I kind of have an issue with this,
3379000	3383000	because I think it's a little shady for Microsoft to release this under games with gold,
3383000	3387000	because all you get is the story mode of the game,
3387000	3391000	which, okay, fine, it's competent for a puzzle game, little story mode.
3391000	3396000	I mean, the graphics are what you would see on an iPad or iPhone or Google game.
3396000	3398000	But, all right.
3398000	3403000	But if you want to do the marathon or arcade mode or whatever,
3403000	3408000	you have to buy the arcade DLC expansion, which is $4.99.
3408000	3412000	Okay, look, that's not really a...
3412000	3416000	I'm sorry, it's not really much of a free game,
3416000	3420000	it kind of is more like a really enhanced demo.
3420000	3423000	Granted, there is a multiplayer mode.
3423000	3425000	I have not been able to explore much of that.
3425000	3429000	That is included in the game, so I should mention that.
3429000	3432000	I don't know if you will find anyone else to play this game with.
3432000	3437000	Maybe Rando's on Xbox Live, but I just don't think the game is that compelling.
3437000	3440000	I've played far better puzzler games in my life,
3440000	3443000	one of them being Magical Drop, which is on Steam.
3443000	3445000	What, Magical Drop 5 or something is on Steam.
3445000	3447000	I would rather be playing that. Sorry.
3447000	3450000	I'm sure people worked hard on this game, but it's not...
3450000	3452000	I guess it might work better as a Go game.
3452000	3455000	I might play this on my iPhone or my iPad.
3455000	3457000	I mean, it is a competent enough puzzler in that regard,
3457000	3460000	but I was just a little irritated with the fact that
3460000	3464000	you don't really get the full game with the games with gold.
3464000	3466000	So I'm calling you out, Microsoft.
3466000	3469000	That is a shady release on games with gold.
3469000	3472000	I kind of don't think enough people are actually going to bother
3472000	3475000	to check out that game to realize what is happening,
3475000	3478000	because Tron also came out, and there's probably more people
3478000	3481000	that are curious on picking that game up and seeing what they missed.
3481000	3486000	But I don't think it's really worth your time.
3486000	3487000	Brad from Paw Culture says,
3487000	3491000	Sky, it's a free game. No reason to complain.
3491000	3496000	Is it, though? Because I do have to be a paying gold subscriber
3496000	3498000	and maintain that subscription to play it.
3498000	3500000	To play Devil's Advocate, though,
3500000	3502000	maybe that's just how they have their normal game set up.
3502000	3505000	It's not like that they did this just because it's going free and,
3505000	3507000	hey, we need to get some more money out of you.
3507000	3510000	It's just the developer is just stupid,
3510000	3513000	and they decided that this is what they want to cordon off
3513000	3516000	with another piece of DLC, which I think for that type of game,
3516000	3520000	20 bucks being the entry point, that's kind of dumb.
3520000	3523000	I see your point, Brad. I acknowledge your point.
3523000	3525000	But at the same time, I just look at this and I go,
3525000	3527000	this is just a poor release.
3527000	3532000	Yeah, it's free, but when you are competing against the PlayStation Plus games,
3532000	3536000	you still have to make sure that the games are of a quality level
3536000	3538000	to make it worth it because not a lot of people are necessarily
3538000	3540000	going to subscribe to both.
3540000	3542000	Breakman in Chat says,
3542000	3545000	I downloaded this game. Should I just delete it, Sky?
3545000	3549000	I guess play it once to see for yourself if you already downloaded it,
3549000	3551000	but you will probably end up deleting it.
3551000	3553000	So, there it is.
3554000	3556000	All right.
3556000	3558000	I'm sorry, I'm scrolling back up in chat.
3558000	3562000	AkumaJP says, Sky is rubbing it into us Japanese
3562000	3564000	because we don't have Pokemon Go yet.
3564000	3567000	I'm sorry, AkumaJP, but the reality is,
3567000	3571000	every time they launch a game in a new country, it crashes.
3571000	3575000	They released in Canada today, it crashed.
3575000	3578000	Canada apologized for that. I'm just kidding.
3578000	3582000	But in all seriousness, every time they release a game,
3582000	3587000	Did you see the tweet from the guy that's like the head of Amazon,
3587000	3589000	the web services or whatever?
3589000	3591000	Yeah, who's like offered to help.
3593000	3596000	You might want to take advantage of that, but here's the thing.
3596000	3600000	They know it's going to be, look, Ingress was already big in Japan.
3600000	3604000	So, Pokemon Go really, it's going to be, let me put it this way,
3604000	3608000	it will be really weird if Pokemon Go isn't successful in Japan.
3608000	3610000	I mean, I suppose that could always happen,
3610000	3613000	but I fully anticipate Pokemon Go is going to be fucking huge in Japan
3613000	3615000	just like it is everywhere else.
3615000	3619000	So, they kind of need the servers to stabilize everywhere else
3619000	3623000	before they give it to Japan because Japan will break the game.
3623000	3627000	Love you guys, and I do think you should be able to play,
3627000	3630000	and I know it's got to be super frustrating to see all these other people playing.
3630000	3634000	I mean, even for those 12 hours when Australia was in and we weren't in,
3634000	3637000	it was very frustrating, and for Japan, it's been going on for weeks.
3637000	3640000	But, it will break when it's released in Japan,
3640000	3642000	and it's just going to be frustrating for everybody.
3642000	3646000	So, there is that. Anyhow.
3646000	3649000	Alright, that's all I wanted to say about my gaming week.
3649000	3652000	So, let's move on. Just some quick housekeeping.
3652000	3656000	Please follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
3656000	3659000	We are also on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,
3659000	3665000	and we will not be here Labor Day weekend because I will be at Dragon Con.
3665000	3671000	That is, as far as the calendar for conventions and things for the rest of the year,
3671000	3674000	I will be at Dragon Con, I will be at Gamer X4,
3674000	3679000	and I will be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest.
3679000	3681000	That's my plans for the rest of the year.
3681000	3684000	I'm not thinking I will show up at any other cons,
3684000	3686000	but you never say never.
3686000	3690000	I am starting to think, do I want to go to one day of Twitch Con again,
3690000	3691000	even though it's in San Diego?
3691000	3693000	I am toying with that idea. We'll see.
3693000	3697000	And then there's the PlayStation experience, especially if they do it in San Diego.
3697000	3699000	Sorry, not San Diego. If they do it in San Francisco again,
3699000	3701000	I kind of think I have to go.
3701000	3704000	And Shane is also talking about Pokemon Worlds,
3704000	3707000	which I may drop in for a day, so we'll see.
3707000	3709000	Which one was in San Diego?
3709000	3711000	Twitch Con.
3711000	3714000	If Twitch Con is not in San Diego, I meant San Francisco. That's what I meant.
3714000	3716000	Yeah, maybe PlayStation Experience again.
3716000	3718000	I don't know, because last time they had it in Vegas,
3718000	3721000	but the year before they had it in San Francisco, so we'll see.
3721000	3723000	If it's in San Francisco, I might go to that, so just let me know.
3723000	3725000	Yeah, we'll see.
3725000	3727000	Anyway, let's see.
3727000	3732000	And JD says, I mean, there is a RuPaul's Drag Con in response to what Stoppy said.
3732000	3736000	When Sky says Drag and Con, I hear Drag and Con.
3736000	3738000	I do want to go to Drag Con next year.
3738000	3741000	Drag Con would be fun, but it's one of those things where it's like,
3741000	3744000	I have to pick and choose the cons at some point.
3744000	3746000	I can't go to everything. I don't have that type of limited budget.
3746000	3749000	He has to weigh the pros and cons, if you will.
3749000	3751000	Get out.
3753000	3757000	If I were a Twitch celebrity and could have conventions throwing money at me to attend,
3757000	3759000	this wouldn't be a pick and choose situation.
3759000	3765000	I was at Disneyland the weekend before Drag Con, so I could just make that my birthday present.
3765000	3767000	There you go.
3767000	3770000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
3770000	3773000	It's been a bit of a slower week, but we do have some things to discuss.
3773000	3775000	We'll get to your calls later as well.
3775000	3777000	Loki, what do you have for us?
3777000	3780000	Alright, so there's some Neo rumors that are coming out.
3780000	3782000	These are actually stuff that's been out for a while now,
3782000	3787000	because I want to say that the original specs rumors and everything came from this document,
3787000	3791000	but the document actually hadn't been released or leaked out there.
3791000	3795000	It was just somebody relaying the information that was on it before.
3795000	3800000	It's just basically a lot of the same information we've heard so far,
3800000	3806000	that what they've said is basically the device is going to be coexisting with the PlayStation 4.
3806000	3811000	It's going to have the same application, same online community, stores, etc.
3811000	3815000	They're seeing the output, the 4K is going to be included to it.
3815000	3820000	Spec-wise, it's 2.1 gigahertz or 1.3 times faster.
3820000	3833000	36 CU's at 911 megahertz for the GPU, so that's about 2.3 times faster.
3833000	3837000	And then a little bit higher memory bandwidth, 218 gigabytes per second,
3837000	3840000	which is about a one and a quarter improvement.
3840000	3844000	And it's going to share the same hard drive and that type of stuff.
3844000	3851000	Also, they're basically saying that the games are going to have this Neo mode available to them,
3851000	3858000	so the games that are supporting that will run a little bit better on the Neo versus the actual PlayStation 4.
3858000	3865000	And basically talking about some of the software development kit upgrades and stuff that are going to be coming down the pipeline as well.
3865000	3871000	There's not really a whole lot to gain from this.
3871000	3875000	Basically just a lot of the same information we've heard already.
3875000	3883000	It's supposed to be out around the same time as the PlayStation VR, possibly, so we'll see.
3884000	3890000	I know it's a rumor, but everything in that presentation certainly seems plausible.
3890000	3897000	They really are stressing that the games have to run on the PlayStation 4 as well,
3897000	3902000	and this is just something to get improved frame rate, upscaling the games to look a little better,
3902000	3907000	but it's not like it's going to have this drastic look and feel or anything like that, which is expected.
3907000	3911000	If I don't have a 4K TV, then why would I want this?
3911000	3913000	I just don't understand.
3913000	3917000	And don't get me wrong, there are people that want high-end systems and stuff,
3917000	3925000	but what's exactly going to be the price point of this, and is there really a wide saturation of 4K TVs out right now?
3925000	3929000	I mean, granted, maybe in the future, in a couple of years, it might be a little bit more widespread,
3929000	3935000	but I think with 4K, it seems like maybe not so much on the PC side because people want higher resolutions,
3935000	3941000	but I don't even think graphics cards can use 4K right now and keep a decent frame rate.
3941000	3949000	I think it just seems like a repeat of the whole 3D thing again, where they're pushing the 3D TVs.
3949000	3952000	I just don't know if it's going to be a thing.
3952000	3959000	I mean, eventually we'll get there, but there's not a lot of content for it, the price point's really high,
3959000	3962000	and there's not a lot of software that's going to utilize it,
3962000	3966000	and I really have a hard time believing that these systems are going to pump out games
3966000	3971000	with frame rates that are comparable to their PlayStation 4 counterparts with 4K.
3971000	3978000	Even if the high-end video cards now can't do that, this ain't going to do that.
3978000	3983000	My only concern is the PlayStation VR thing, because we've talked about it before,
3983000	3987000	where it's like, oh, maybe the PlayStation VR will be even better with this,
3987000	3994000	and I really hope the experience on the PlayStation 4 VR as it is is fine.
3994000	3998000	Is that what they're demoing at Best Buy is the current PlayStation?
3998000	4000000	Do we see a current PlayStation out?
4000000	4003000	I think it's either that or a dev kit.
4003000	4007000	See, if it's a dev kit, could it be a Neo? I guess they wouldn't put those out in the wild.
4007000	4008000	No, I don't think so.
4008000	4010000	They'd be fools to do that.
4010000	4013000	I think it's probably the actual system.
4013000	4020000	I have the pre-order in for the VR, but I'm kind of going back on the fence again with them.
4020000	4027000	You know, Res sounds cool and everything, but is it $400 cool? That's the thing.
4027000	4028000	Well, yeah.
4028000	4036000	But with that, though, $400, would it be more advantageous for me to just upgrade,
4036000	4041000	buy a new computer system and get an actual VR, like a Vive or something like that?
4041000	4042000	That might be a better experience overall.
4042000	4045000	Yeah, I'll miss out on Res, but come on.
4045000	4050000	I've played Res already, so it's not like it's going to be a huge improvement.
4050000	4053000	But you've never played Res like this.
4053000	4057000	You know, I just, I don't know.
4057000	4064000	They're going to have it in non-VR too, so you'll be able to play, I don't know, a slightly updated version of it.
4064000	4070000	But it's like, maybe give it some more time.
4070000	4074000	Well, we'll see. I mean, you know, they're going to unveil this at some point,
4074000	4077000	and they're really going to have to sell the reasons why we're going to spend money on it.
4077000	4079000	It's going to have to be soon, like I think at Gamescom or something.
4079000	4081000	Yeah, you think we'll see.
4081000	4087000	Well, many folks in chat are talking about how Star Trek, I see that in chat, but that's about something else.
4087000	4093000	Many people in chat are talking about Street Fighter V and how that is actually showing on EVO right now on ESPN2.
4093000	4098000	But there's, you know, and that's a great thing for the, you know, exposure of the game and so forth.
4098000	4103000	But not all the news about Street Fighter V this week has necessarily been well received.
4103000	4109000	There is a new PlayStation Store listing that is offering up a new Street Fighter V bundle.
4109000	4117000	It's a DLC bundle called the CPT Premier Package, or the Capcom Pro Tour Premier Package.
4117000	4123000	It will include costumes for Chun-Li and Cammy, a mystery CPT costume.
4123000	4127000	There will be a new color pack for all of the 2016 characters.
4127000	4132000	And there will be new titles, including Capcom Cup 2016 and Capcom Pro Tour 2016.
4132000	4141000	And a new stage called the Ring of Destiny for $25 is how much that DLC is going to cost, $24.99.
4141000	4145000	Going back to the old, like, $5 a character nonsense.
4145000	4151000	Now, apparently, some of this money is to fund, I guess, the prize pool for the Capcom Pro Tour.
4151000	4155000	I guess it's the whole thing that's some of the defense I've been reading about it.
4155000	4156000	But, uh...
4156000	4158000	No, that's not a defense.
4158000	4163000	Yeah, I'm kind of like, you kind of need to pony up your own damn money and not ask me for that.
4163000	4165000	No one asks you to do this fucking tour.
4165000	4171000	And actually, it's also been called out, it's just a portion of the proceeds is going to that.
4171000	4174000	Not necessarily, I'm sorry, $25.
4174000	4178000	And it's not part of the season pass or whatever that they've sold for this before.
4178000	4186000	I don't know a nice way to say this, but Capcom is fucking this game with the horrible DLC stuff.
4186000	4191000	And, you know, the fact that the story mode wasn't in the game when it launched was really a screw up.
4191000	4200000	And yes, look, I've heard all the defense about, well, you know, they wanted to get it out so that it was available for the fighting game circuit and all that stuff.
4200000	4207000	And I'm telling you, to catch on with a wider audience, which it needs to do in order to be successful,
4207000	4211000	that was a bad decision. It was a very bad decision.
4211000	4215000	The fighting tour thing could have waited another year, in my opinion.
4215000	4220000	Maybe people who follow that scene more closely or participate in that scene would strongly disagree.
4220000	4224000	But I kind of think Street Fighter V has shot itself in the foot as a result.
4224000	4227000	And this really doesn't help the situation.
4227000	4231000	Are the Street Fighter odd number games just cursed?
4232000	4237000	Is this a Star Trek? Maybe that was a Freudian slip at the beginning there.
4237000	4242000	Is this like a Star Trek thing where the even numbered ones are good and the odd numbered ones...
4245000	4246000	Who knows?
4246000	4248000	Because that's what I'm starting to think.
4250000	4252000	Anyhow, next story.
4252000	4257000	Well, I'm sure everyone has seen this thing going around.
4257000	4260000	I've been calling it the Chibi Nintendo.
4260000	4269000	They're putting out a Nintendo Entertainment System that is small enough to fit easily in the palm of your hand.
4271000	4274000	It has a controller.
4274000	4279000	And it comes with 30 games loaded on it.
4280000	4283000	Dan and I both thought that the game list was kind of odd.
4283000	4286000	Just because there are some definite licenses on there.
4286000	4294000	That I don't know if it's maybe that they still have distribution licenses for those particular titles or what.
4295000	4302000	But it's supposed to be out on November 11th for a suggested retail of $59.99.
4303000	4306000	I'm totally going to have like five of them.
4306000	4312000	Well no, I actually just want one to put on my desk to be a cute Nintendo to be on my desk.
4312000	4314000	Oh, you're going to buy a $60 paperweight.
4314000	4315000	Yeah, why not?
4316000	4317000	I love it.
4317000	4319000	I have a whole room full of expensive paperweights.
4319000	4321000	They're called all of my other consoles.
4321000	4322000	Yeah, I guess I can't talk.
4322000	4327000	I have a Mega Yarn Yoshi and it's not much cheaper than $60.
4327000	4328000	What does it do?
4328000	4329000	It just sits there and looks pretty.
4329000	4331000	It has the functionality of a paperweight.
4331000	4332000	Shut up.
4332000	4336000	Well, some of the games that are going to be on the list.
4336000	4342000	Of course, we have The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, and Kirby's Adventure.
4342000	4343000	Of course, Super Mario Brothers.
4343000	4346000	Some of the other ones that struck me as a bit odd.
4346000	4348000	You've got some Capcom licenses.
4348000	4352000	You have Mega Man 2 and you have Ghosts and Goblins.
4352000	4357000	You've also got some Konami licenses like Castlevania and Castlevania 2.
4357000	4360000	You've also got Super C.
4360000	4363000	Actually, Zelda 2 is on there as well.
4363000	4364000	Tecmo Bowl.
4364000	4369000	We also have Star Tropics, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber.
4369000	4372000	So, Galaga is on the list too.
4372000	4377000	This is the thing that I also think is cool.
4377000	4381000	You get the NES Classic Controller.
4381000	4384000	You can buy a second one for $10.
4384000	4389000	You can also connect it to a Wii Remote.
4389000	4394000	You can use it to play Virtual Console NES games on a Wii U or Wii.
4394000	4399000	That's a little bit of extra incentive just to get the controllers.
4399000	4403000	So, take it what you will, but I think that's pretty cool news.
4403000	4405000	That is pretty cool.
4405000	4407000	I did not realize that whole controller functionality.
4407000	4408000	That's pretty cool.
4408000	4409000	I do like that.
4409000	4410000	I don't know.
4410000	4411000	I'm on the fence with this.
4411000	4414000	When I first heard about it, I admit I wrote a tweet that was like,
4414000	4416000	why do I want this?
4416000	4420000	I have a Wii U and I bought half these games already on Virtual Console.
4420000	4424000	I don't understand why I would want this.
4424000	4428000	But the more I'm thinking about it, there's a couple things with it.
4428000	4431000	A, it is a pretty solid lineup of games.
4431000	4435000	I find it really weird that Nintendo has pretty much come out and even said
4435000	4440000	they're not going to expand on it, which seems like a lost opportunity.
4440000	4441000	Exactly.
4441000	4445000	Why is there no store interface to purchase NES Virtual Console games?
4445000	4447000	With storage on there, I mean.
4447000	4450000	But, here's the other thing that is starting to sway me a little bit.
4450000	4453000	Loki, what's one of the biggest sayings we always say on this show?
4453000	4454000	Hackers gonna hack.
4454000	4455000	Right.
4455000	4456000	Right.
4456000	4458000	So this thing is not going to be limited to just 30 games.
4458000	4459000	Nope.
4459000	4460000	Let me tell you.
4460000	4461000	Not in the least.
4461000	4466000	Well, the other thing I do want to point out is that the games that are on it
4466000	4472000	are going to have multiple suspend points, so you don't need to use your passwords.
4472000	4476000	You can just save your game and walk off.
4476000	4478000	Which Virtual Console will do, to be fair.
4478000	4479000	Now, I will tell you this.
4479000	4481000	You know what I would like?
4481000	4485000	Is the ability. I mean, actually, not just the ability.
4485000	4492000	I would like for all of the games that had been disc-based to have the disc emulation in it.
4492000	4493000	Yes.
4493000	4494000	So that we get, like, the...
4494000	4495000	The extra soundtrack and everything.
4495000	4496000	Exactly.
4496000	4497000	Heck yeah.
4497000	4499000	I mean, I don't know.
4499000	4500000	There's a comparison out there.
4500000	4503000	Like, the difference in The Legend of Zelda music, for example.
4503000	4506000	It's pretty night and day.
4506000	4507000	For people who haven't...
4507000	4509000	Yeah, if you don't mind looking for it real quick.
4509000	4516000	For people who haven't heard the Famicom disc versus the cartridge versions,
4516000	4518000	it really is pretty different.
4518000	4523000	It's sort of like what the Master System music sounded like with the FM chip.
4523000	4525000	Okay, I think this is one...
4525000	4530000	Again, I'm going into these videos blind, which I don't like to do here on OLR, but...
4530000	4532000	Oh, you appreciate your running the risk for it.
4532000	4533000	Let's see what happens.
4533000	4535000	I don't know if this is just somebody talking about it.
4535000	4536000	Let me see.
4537000	4540000	Oh, no, that's the opening on the Famicom.
4550000	4553000	Yeah, you can definitely hear subtle differences in that, right?
4555000	4557000	It sounds more harpsichord-y.
4557000	4562000	Let me see if I can find some other examples there from Zelda.
4563000	4567000	Let's see, there's Final Dungeon.
4567000	4569000	Metroid was also...
4569000	4573000	Let me see if I can find the Metroid one, because Metroid is pretty cool, too.
4573000	4577000	Yeah, but that would be my hope.
4577000	4586000	I mean, probably not going to do it that way, but it's absolutely what I would want.
4586000	4588000	Let's see, here's Metroid on...
4593000	4594000	Familiar.
4594000	4596000	You can hear subtle differences.
4596000	4599000	When you get into the actual melody after this.
4599000	4602000	Let me turn this down a little bit. Sorry, guys, a little loud.
4603000	4605000	Let me see, I'm going to skip ahead a little bit.
4611000	4613000	I mean, but there's not a lot of instruments in this.
4613000	4614000	It's subtle.
4614000	4616000	Let me... I can definitely hear subtleties.
4616000	4620000	Let me go to a different song here.
4623000	4626000	Honestly, this one sounds very similar.
4628000	4630000	That one sounds exactly the same, I gotta be honest.
4630000	4634000	But the biggest one, though, that I knew off the top of my head was Zelda.
4634000	4636000	Yeah, Zelda definitely had the...
4636000	4638000	Fifth Dream says play Kraid. Let me look.
4638000	4640000	Yeah, Kraid I know was different.
4640000	4642000	343, let's try this.
4642000	4644000	Let me just skip ahead a little bit.
4653000	4655000	It sounds very familiar.
4655000	4657000	I don't know if Metroid's the best example.
4657000	4659000	But Zelda definitely is.
4659000	4660000	Yeah.
4660000	4662000	So, um, but anyway.
4662000	4664000	Yeah, definitely the Zelda one, I definitely, definitely heard it.
4664000	4670000	But I would love if it had the Famicon disc music.
4670000	4673000	I know, didn't Castlevania or...
4673000	4675000	Yeah, Castlevania 3, I think, had some...
4675000	4677000	Definitely had some different music to it.
4677000	4679000	Let me see if I can quickly find, um...
4683000	4686000	Oh, you can even hear just, like, the subtle and the triangulation.
4686000	4688000	It doesn't sound exactly the same.
4688000	4689000	Yeah.
4695000	4697000	Yeah, you can definitely hear it in the...
4697000	4698000	This one.
4700000	4701000	Anyway.
4702000	4705000	A little bit of Famicon disc history there, if you didn't know that.
4705000	4707000	It had the extra sound on it.
4707000	4708000	Cool.
4708000	4710000	Totally worth it.
4710000	4712000	Yeah, that would be cool if we could get some of that emulation.
4712000	4715000	Even if it's just a little Easter egg or something like that.
4715000	4718000	But I'm guessing that's not going to be part of it.
4718000	4720000	Anyway.
4720000	4723000	But I think I probably will end up getting one.
4723000	4726000	And looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com
4726000	4727000	Brad from Pop Culture says...
4727000	4729000	I was thinking of Castlevania 2, by the way.
4729000	4732000	I thought that... I know one of them was on, um, disc.
4732000	4734000	Uh, Brad from Pop Culture says,
4734000	4736000	Sky, because it's cute!
4736000	4739000	Yeah, probably it would have to be part of the reason I would have to get it.
4739000	4743000	Darktusuya is pointing out, with Virtual Console, they give you one restore point.
4743000	4746000	This one sounds like it will have more than one.
4746000	4747000	So that's pretty cool.
4747000	4751000	Stoppy said they tease that there could be filter options and that sort of stuff.
4751000	4755000	So maybe there is the chance they'll include extra sound effects.
4755000	4757000	So, who knows. We'll see.
4757000	4761000	Anyway, let's move on with some more news. Loki.
4761000	4764000	It would be kind of cool if they did it with a Game Boy one.
4764000	4767000	Kind of like a portable system that's a Game Boy with 30 games built in.
4767000	4772000	Well, if this does well, I'm sure it's just a matter of time before the Super Nintendo one comes out.
4772000	4774000	Or a Game Boy one comes out.
4774000	4782000	And I gotta say, it is a pretty clever way for Nintendo to still bring in some money this holiday season when the NX ain't happening.
4782000	4789000	So, you know, props to Nintendo for figuring out how to make a quick buck when the NX didn't happen this year.
4789000	4794000	I mean, it's not going to be as much money as the NX, but she said she'd buy five.
4794000	4797000	It's going to be funny when this outsells the NX.
4797000	4798000	Shut up.
4798000	4801000	At least it'll outsell the Wii U or something.
4803000	4807000	So speaking of the little system, you know, there's a lot of people that are interested in it.
4807000	4811000	Including, you know, some people that may have worked out of their game companies.
4811000	4819000	Like, for example, Phil Spencer of Xbox thinks it's absolutely a great idea to have this system and, you know, retro hardware is a cool way to do it.
4820000	4823000	And that's his opinion on it. That's all I've got.
4823000	4833000	Well, you know what's interesting about that whole thing, though, is that Microsoft not that long ago put out the Rare Replay, which was 30 classic games, for 60 bucks.
4833000	4843000	So, and when I, it's funny enough, because kind of reading that and putting it into perspective actually kind of made me go, okay, maybe, maybe this is something I could just carelessly drop the money on.
4843000	4847000	Because I did buy that Rare Replay thing, and it isn't even a cute little thing.
4847000	4852000	At the very least, you get the classic controller that you can go and play your, you know, NES games in.
4852000	4855000	That's true. I didn't realize that at first. I didn't realize that.
4855000	4857000	And if you want an additional one, it's only 10 bucks, so.
4857000	4864000	I'll probably end up getting one, because I'm a consumer whore. So, there it is, going back on my tweet.
4864000	4870000	I kind of want one, but then again, I can't have access to the TV, so I don't know how well that's going to end up working.
4870000	4873000	Well, with an HDMI cable, you can hook it up to a computer monitor.
4874000	4883000	Yeah, I really wish that my laptop, and pretty much any laptop that are out there, had the ability to switch to an external video source.
4883000	4891000	Because that'd be so goddamn convenient. Like, hey, I want to run a video in from my Playstation to my laptop screen. Boom, there, it's done.
4891000	4894000	That'd be awesome. But, no, they don't have that.
4895000	4904000	Well, I'm thinking I'll probably end up getting one, and I think even the perspective on Microsoft and Rear Replay maybe even sold me on that. Who knows?
4904000	4911000	Switching gears here a little bit, World of Warcraft, back in the news again, all these years later. You know, that game's been out quite a while.
4911000	4917000	There's a new expansion for World of Warcraft on the horizon. Legion is out, what, the end of August? Right, Darcyn? Or you can play more?
4917000	4922000	Yeah, I need to, I've actually kind of slacked off on my World of Warcraft, but I need to put in my order.
4922000	4928000	I think I will be coming back to WoW in anticipation of Legion, just because I have to check it out. But, here's where I'm torn.
4928000	4935000	You know I'm still playing Final Fantasy XIV, and they have a mini patch this week, but it's something I've really been looking forward to, and it's called the Deep Dungeon.
4935000	4946000	And I'm really looking forward to that. So, I think it really just depends how much I enjoy that feature will dictate when I come back to WoW, sooner rather than later or later. So, we'll see.
4946000	4958000	Anyway, but speaking of World of Warcraft, they are going to be testing a new silence penalty, which honestly sounds like something they could have used about ten years ago, but better late than never, I suppose.
4958000	4968000	So, here's the deal. Blizzard's going to implement a new silence penalty that will punish users with multiple reports of chat abuse or posting spam.
4968000	4977000	If an investigation by the team finds that the complaints are valid, there's going to be an account-wide silence penalty. They can't just roll into the character and get around it.
4977000	4991000	You will get a notification when you try to send a message in a channel where you're restricted. The silenced player will have limited chat functionality with others in WoW, but you will not be able to talk in instant chat, including Battlegrounds.
4991000	5007000	You can't coordinate with people in Battlegrounds anymore if you get silenced. You can't talk in global channels. You can't create calendar invites, send in-game mail, party invitations, war game invitations, duel invitations, and you can't update a premade group listing or create a new one.
5007000	5018000	So, it sounds like you can join others, but you can't create your own. If you get a silence penalty, you can still whisper your friends and receive whispers from people not on your friends list, but that is that.
5018000	5029000	That is going to be included in the pre-expansion patch for Legion. I think what I heard is that the silence penalty starts at 24 hours, the first defense, and doubles each time you get a new one.
5029000	5045000	So, it will double to 48, then it doubles to 96, then it doubles to 190. It keeps doubling and doubling and doubling, so if you don't shut the fuck up, you're going to be silenced for a very long time.
5045000	5058000	And again, this game needed that about 10 years ago, but better late than never. I'll be curious to see if they can actually police a lot of that silence stuff, or if it's going to be a very automated thing. We'll know.
5059000	5078000	SSG100Matt asking in chat, do we know if this expansion will be the last one? Probably not. They released, what, like 20 expansions for EverQuest, and EverQuest never had an audience as big as World of Warcraft, so I don't see why they won't continue to keep releasing expansions for World of Warcraft.
5079000	5088000	They probably even need to be doing them a little faster, but we'll see. Alright, moving on. Let's get to another story here from Dark Soccer, and then we'll get to release dates.
5089000	5103000	Well, kind of not yet classic, but a good game, is Dead Rising. You know, basically Night of the Living Dead, the game, pretty much.
5104000	5124000	So anyway, the game is being re-released on PS4. They found it by finding the trophy list available, so it was confirmed that Dead Rising 4 is going to be for Playstation 4.
5124000	5136000	Which is also notable that the original was an exclusive to Xbox 360, so this is the first time you're going to see this game on that system. So, pretty cool stuff right there.
5137000	5151000	And of course, we're going to have another Dead Rising game that's going to be coming out later for a limited exclusive on Xbox One, with the PS4 release coming afterwards. So, good stuff.
5152000	5160000	That's kind of fun to have this be good all over again. It also reminds us that the first game was the best game in the series, in my opinion.
5163000	5169000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase KISS.
5170000	5178000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, and some things that are coming a little sooner than this Dead Rising release, or even Dead Rising 4. What's coming out this week in the US, Logie?
5178000	5187000	Not a whole lot, to be honest. This week we've got 10 Second Ninja X on PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Vita.
5188000	5199000	We have I Am Setsuna on PC and Playstation 4. The Assembly on PC, and then also VR platforms, the Rift and the Vive.
5200000	5212000	And that's about it. Oh, actually, no, I am sorry. There's also the Friday releases. Human Fall Flat on PC, and Starbound is coming to PC, Mac, and Linux.
5213000	5224000	Alright, traveling to Japan. In Japan, from Compile Heart on the Playstation 4, Kurobara no Valkyrie is coming out in a regular and limited edition on July 21st.
5225000	5236000	So, I'm sure there will be some folks that are into that. Also, on the Wii U, no release. Actually, Wii U is really a tumbleweed. I don't think there's anything to report in Japan on that system for a while.
5237000	5249000	But on the Playstation Vita, you have Ys VIII. Lacrimosa of Dana comes out this week in regular and premium. Who knew that this game was still fucking going, but it is.
5249000	5257000	Ys VIII is out on the Playstation Vita this week, as well as Gendai Daisenryaku 2016 comes out this week.
5258000	5270000	And Shinshaku Suryugi no Machi no Ihujin Kuro no Kayuden comes out. It's some type of novel bundle set, so I think you get the game and a visual novel with this.
5270000	5281000	So that's, I guess, kind of cool. And then lastly, on the 3DS this week, just one game. Sumiko Gurashimura wo Sukurun desu comes out this week.
5282000	5293000	And I'm not sure what that is. It kind of looks like a cute little animal farm sim type game, but all the art is in the same style as the cat butt game on iPhone.
5294000	5298000	What the hell is that game called? Neko Atsume? Cat butt game?
5298000	5306000	Neko Atsume. Cat collector. This looks like that, but a farming game. It looks really adorable. Look at this box art. Doesn't that look cute?
5307000	5314000	Kitties! Well they're not all kitties, that one's a penguin. I don't care, kitties. It's a fat penguin eating a pickle. It's me.
5315000	5326000	Oh my god, Rob. Are you a fat penguin eating a pickle? I think that is, when somebody asks you what is your spirit animal, I'm just going to point to this box art and be like, it's me.
5326000	5340000	Aww. So there it is. How about the UK? In the UK, just stuff on the 20th, which is Zombie Knight Terror. And that's pretty much it.
5341000	5349000	Guess it's a slow week. Just a couple more stories for you guys. Yep. And then the classic. Sorry, we've got Pokemon to play.
5350000	5356000	They're a little busy with that right now. Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
5357000	5374000	So, Valve has finally responded to the whole controversy with this Counter-Strike GO gambling nonsense. And so there's actually a response from Eric Johnson of Valve, basically saying, you know, in 2011 they added the feature that now enabled people to be able to train in-game items.
5374000	5386000	Since a number of gambling sites are using this Steam trading system, and there's been some false assumptions about our involvement with these sites, we'd like to clarify we have no business relationships with any of these sites.
5387000	5393000	We have never received any revenue from them, and Steam does not have a system for turning in-game items into real world currency.
5394000	5413000	And basically saying that these sites have basically pieced together the operations in a two-part fashion. First, they're using the OpenID API, and then second, you're basically creating automated Steam accounts that make web calls as individual Steam users.
5413000	5426000	And then, along with that, basically saying that, you know, they're going to start striking down on these. They're going to send, you know, basically cease and desist to these sites to kind of curve this thing.
5427000	5432000	Basically, you know, saying that, you know, using this system for that purpose is not going to be tolerated.
5434000	5438000	So, neat. We'll see some sort of response from them, I'm thinking.
5438000	5450000	Yeah, I think Valve was under a lot of pressure to give her an official response to the situation. I'm kind of glad they're really kind of putting out their low tolerance. I don't say zero tolerance, but very low tolerance for this.
5451000	5460000	Stoppy in chat says, I wish YouTube would respond to the CSGO controversy now. That's funny. A human at YouTube. That's good.
5460000	5470000	No, look, I get your frustration. I really do. I'm not laughing at you. It's just that I echo the frustration of YouTube doesn't seem to have live human beings that work at it.
5471000	5473000	That's the perception I have, anyway.
5475000	5485000	Hey, let's talk about Final Fantasy XV, because I know I'm looking forward to Final Fantasy XV. It's not that far away at this point. It's really what? It's less than three months at this point? Getting there?
5485000	5488000	Yeah, it's on the 19th of September, I think.
5489000	5506000	September, so yeah, wow. We're getting there. Anyhow, apparently there were rumors circulating in the past that Final Fantasy XV would be coming out for the NX. However, the director of Final Fantasy XV, Hajime Tabata, has said that they are not considering an NX version of the game.
5507000	5508000	Not surprised.
5508000	5524000	Yeah, but they're not hating on NX. They did say they have high expectations for NX, and they're looking forward to the upcoming Zelda game and all that good stuff, but they did not indicate that Final Fantasy XV would come out for NX.
5525000	5536000	Which, honestly, if the NX is going to be months after XV comes out, I honestly think that's a good thing. What was the Wii U's biggest problem? All the launch games were things that had fucking come out like six months prior.
5536000	5552000	On top of that, though, I have a suspicion that the specs of the NX are still kind of up in the air. I don't think that they know what the specs are on this thing, so how do you develop for a platform that you're not really sure what the specs are going to be?
5552000	5572000	I mean, I guess that's kind of how you do that for new platforms, but at least they have some sort of target. With Nintendo and some of the comments that I'm hearing, how they're like, oh, we're now considering VR and stuff. Do they really have an idea of what this is going to be? Is that why it hasn't been revealed yet? Because it's like, fuck, we don't have, we don't know what, I don't know, it could be an SNES mini inside that thing.
5573000	5596000	And an interesting, speaking of games coming out for the NX, just a very interesting tweet. Somebody had tweeted at Dennis Dyack, who, you know, he's kind of out there commenting on things sometimes, but he's the CCO at Quantum Entanglement Entertainment, and somebody had actually asked him, like, hey, I loved that game, it was awesome. Speaking of Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes HD, could it get remade for Nintendo NX because the GameCube was in HD?
5597000	5624000	And Dennis Dyack responded, thanks for the kind words. If the demand is high enough, I'm sure something could be done, which I'm sure a change.org petition has probably already been made, thanks to that tweet. But to be fair, and you know, no disrespect to Dennis, but that is really the canned answer you give a fan who's asking if X game will end up on Y platform. Well, if there's enough demand for it, I suppose anything's possible. That is, that is the very generic canned, polite response.
5624000	5626000	Fuck, no, you're not getting shit.
5627000	5630000	I don't care if you like it, I don't fucking like you.
5631000	5633000	You get fucking nothing.
5634000	5639000	I think we need a new segment on this show in the near future where Loki translates politically correct tweets.
5642000	5643000	No comment.
5644000	5645000	Shit.
5646000	5652000	We don't comment, we don't comment about our business, our rumors and speculation. Ah, fuck, they found out.
5653000	5656000	Please look forward to it. Buy our games, really.
5657000	5664000	I think, I think on a future episode that's going to be a segment, Loki translates politically correct tweets. What do you guys think?
5665000	5666000	Loki speaks PR.
5667000	5668000	Yeah, Loki speaks PR.
5669000	5670000	Loki speaks PR.
5671000	5672000	I vote for it.
5673000	5674000	Alright.
5675000	5679000	Breakman in chat says Loki is the most politically correct person ever.
5680000	5684000	Dark Tetsuya says fund it. Does that mean we get to launch a Kickstarter for it?
5685000	5692000	Are you, are you saying Dark Tetsuya that we should start a Patreon and only if we get 20 a month will Loki translate the tweets?
5693000	5694000	We should do a Patreon anyway.
5695000	5696000	It's just going to be the Slurpee fund.
5698000	5699000	It all is.
5699000	5701000	Your money will go to fund birthday cake Slurpees.
5702000	5703000	God no.
5704000	5708000	We're gonna, we're gonna have actual Slurpees that are delicious and not this birthday cake abomination guy.
5709000	5711000	Because if the people are like, you know, latching on the birth-
5712000	5716000	If they give like $50 a month, Loki will be forced to like the birthday cake Slurpee.
5717000	5720000	No, I won't. Thank God it's just for limited time. For their stupid anniversary.
5721000	5723000	I just like that stuff I got from Taco Bell.
5725000	5726000	Alright, anyhow.
5727000	5731000	SSG100Matt says we're gonna make Slurpees great again.
5732000	5733000	It's impossible. They're already great.
5735000	5739000	I mean, they're a little less great with the birthday cake flavor, but hey, you have options, so that's fine.
5740000	5741000	You know what's great? It was banana Slurpees.
5742000	5749000	Okay, wait. Okay. Yes, I agree with you and that was the flavor I full on intended getting at 7-Eleven until I saw it had been replaced with a birthday cake.
5750000	5759000	Here's, okay Loki, here's the choice you have to make. You have to drink one. Will you drink the birthday cake Slurpee or the Diet Coke Slurpee?
5759000	5764000	No, I don't think so. I don't even identify that as a Slurpee option.
5765000	5767000	So, the birthday cake Slurpee in that scenario.
5768000	5771000	I guess. I don't know. That's tough.
5772000	5775000	It's like, why Diet Coke Slurpee? That's just stupid.
5776000	5781000	I'm on a diet! I mean, come on. Come on.
5786000	5788000	Let's travel to a time when things were much simpler.
5789000	5795000	You had Coke and Cherry. If you didn't like it, go fuck yourself. Those were your Slurpee options.
5796000	5797000	If you were lucky, you could combine them.
5798000	5809000	It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find the game that she thinks, hey, stop drinking your Slurpee, you're going to get the controller sticky.
5810000	5813000	Which invariably happened with this particular machine at my college.
5814000	5816000	Alright, so what is the classic game of the week?
5817000	5818000	Cyber Sled.
5819000	5824000	No, not Cyber Slut. Rob. Geez, Rob, get your head out of the gutter.
5825000	5826000	Cyber Sled.
5827000	5840000	Cyber Sled. It came out in 1993, done by Numcle, and it was a two-player third-person shooter vehicle game where you played in hovering tanks.
5840000	5855000	And basically, I'd even like to consider this as one of the big inspirations for one of my favorite series, which was Virtual On, where it's just a big arena two-player deathmatch.
5856000	5861000	And you've got all kinds of obstacles to block your path and protect you from other people.
5861000	5874000	And it is a pretty wide, expansive arena that you have as well, but you're also equipped with guns and missiles, and each of the different tanks have different strengths and weaknesses.
5875000	5888000	You of course have one that's very heavily armed and armored, but slow. You have one that's got high armor, high firepower, but might be lacking in another thing.
5888000	5895000	You've got the ones that are really fast, but weak armor and weak, you know, guns, that type of thing.
5896000	5910000	So, this game, okay. When I started at the University of South Alabama in college, this was in our little dinky game room, and we played the shit out of this.
5911000	5914000	This was the game of choice when someone else was on killer instinct.
5915000	5921000	So, you also, the thing I liked is that you do have the twin stick controller.
5922000	5930000	So, you also had a finger and thumb trigger on each of them for your bullets or for your missiles.
5931000	5942000	And the twin analog stick, I think, is a really good method of control for that, because it's really an instinctive type of play.
5942000	5951000	But, you know, other things that you can do is you can get power ups in the game, like an improved radar, extra missiles, shield recharges.
5954000	5966000	You can also, like I said, you can actually get certain obstacles and different things destroyed as well through other things in the game.
5966000	5975000	The cabinet was, for the arcade version, was a dedicated sit down cabinet with a red side and a blue side.
5976000	5989000	It had a seat for each player, and then you had just your view, which you could either change from cockpit to behind the machine.
5989000	6007000	It got, I wouldn't say very great ratings for not being very original, and definitely not being very impressive graphically, but it was a lot of fun to play.
6007000	6024000	It was fast paced, and something that was really good for, I'd say, versus play. So, it definitely took a lot of my cash when I was in college, and cyber slut it is.
6025000	6026000	And that's your game.
6027000	6029000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6029000	6038000	Before I forget, PlayStation release came out in Japan on January 27th, 1995, and in North America October 18th, 1995.
6039000	6042000	Cyber slut it is for the PlayStation 1.
6043000	6048000	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
6049000	6055000	Although, honestly, not as many news stories left, so we're going to get to things like the mailbag a little bit faster, and your calls, which hopefully there will be plenty of tonight.
6055000	6061000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
6062000	6067000	We are going to take a quick break, however, we will be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6074000	6083000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 650 for this July the 17th of 2016, already in progress.
6083000	6092000	Episode 650, my gosh, and it looks like episode 666 may be a real possibility, and it's probably going to be around the holidays.
6093000	6097000	I think it might be around Thanksgiving, it's in November from what I can tell you.
6098000	6104000	Alright, well don't forget it gets bumped back, because I won't be here Dragon Con week, and inevitably we'll miss another week somewhere, you know, things happen.
6105000	6111000	So I wouldn't doubt that we will have the Orange Lounge Radio Satanic Holiday Spectacular.
6113000	6125000	I'm not sure what happens during that, and I've got to be careful that we don't get too crazy and make people think we actually worship Satan, but we can have a lot of fun with it nonetheless.
6126000	6128000	So we'll figure out what we're going to do, because I have no idea yet.
6129000	6136000	Again, I really just want Travis Donovan to record something for the show as DJ Satan, that is my one, that's my Christmas miracle, is what I'm requesting.
6136000	6138000	So we'll see if I actually get that or not.
6139000	6152000	But in all seriousness, 650, I don't know if there is a weekly podcast, I mean there's certainly daily or multi-weekly podcasts, even Critical Myth here on the VOG Network three times a week is way past that at this point.
6152000	6168000	But I'm not sure if there is a weekly podcast out there that is as high as 650 episodes, and just, you know, it's really you guys to thank for that and all the support over the years and giving us that incentive to just keep us going.
6169000	6176000	And I'd also like to thank the wine that's powering my ramblings tonight. Thank you very much. And the Norco that's powering Jamie's thoughts.
6176000	6178000	And the Patreon can go towards the wine account too, you know.
6179000	6183000	That's true. The Norco is making my ass sleepy, so I'm sorry.
6184000	6186000	Try not to do a cat nap during the show.
6187000	6194000	Alright, well we actually have a little less news than usual in this segment just because it's a bit of a slower news week, honestly.
6195000	6199000	So we will get to your calls probably sooner rather than later as well as your emails.
6199000	6214000	I participate at Orange Lounge Radio. Am I really that real housewife of whatever city, state, USA right now that just drinking wine and slurring words? I guess I am.
6215000	6217000	Alright, let's get to some rapid fire news. Loki.
6218000	6225000	So why not? I mean, I guess Twitch has played everything else and they even played Pokemon, so it's only fitting that they play Pokemon Go.
6225000	6234000	And how he made Twitch play Pokemon Go, you might ask, since Twitch is not a human being and we haven't really developed some sort of Android to walk around.
6235000	6243000	But they're doing that with an emulated version of Android and basically, or I'm sorry, it's actually an iPhone.
6244000	6248000	So it's on a real iPhone and it's simulating the touch events based off of the screen.
6248000	6253000	So the screen, they have it broken up into like a grid, kind of like an Excel or something like that.
6254000	6259000	And you would type, you know, tap the coordinates for that or move in a certain direction.
6260000	6268000	And then of course the GPS is being spoofed. They started off in Central Park in New York and it's just kind of going around and doing all that.
6269000	6274000	I do have to criticize something I'm seeing on Twitch though, and that is that Shane was over here last night.
6274000	6283000	We were doing the Pokestop podcast and then we were watching some Twitch streams and I was kind of surprised like, wow, Pokemon Go is like a really popular thing that's being streamed right now.
6284000	6292000	Although I noticed that a lot of the streams, not all, because some people were doing fancy things to their tablets to make it work so that they were out in the real world playing this game and streaming and I think that's really cool.
6293000	6303000	But there were people out there with lots of viewers that were spoofing location, playing on an emulator, fake, and I think Twitch should ban their asses.
6304000	6313000	And I think Niantic should really be banning their asses. And I understand Niantic has server problems to worry about, but these guys are being really fucking bold.
6314000	6323000	Okay, so here's the thing. I love certain YouTube series and everything like that. There's one that I watch frequently called Lion's Tech Tips.
6323000	6329000	I want to say they're Canadians and they're pretty cool guys. They have a lot of cool tech news stuff.
6330000	6339000	But with that, they had a tip section about how to cheat in Pokemon Go and it's talking about spoofing your location.
6340000	6350000	And their thing right now is, yeah, you could get banned, but right now they're trying to put out all the server fires that they're not really paying attention to that right now, so go hog wild while you can.
6350000	6361000	Just so you know, Niantic recently banned a bunch of people from Ingress and even some false flags, unfortunately, for cheating, for spoofing.
6362000	6370000	So if you think you're getting away with it now, I think you're being really fucking bold doing it on Twitch TV and asking for fucking donations while you're doing it.
6371000	6378000	And just because they're not banning you now doesn't mean they're not flagging your account for a ban later on once they do put out all these server fires.
6378000	6388000	Sorry, but I'm sorry. I find that shit to be really disingenuous and it's just really irritating that people are watching it, supporting it, and giving these people money.
6389000	6399000	Right, they have apps on iOS and stuff like that that basically you don't even have to move. It's just like you push a direction on the thing and it'll walk and you can walk around like that.
6400000	6412000	But now people that are out in the real world, I want to make this clear, people that are out in the real world doing a complicated setup with their tablets so they can stream and all that stuff, that's awesome and those are the people that should be watched on Pokemon Go.
6413000	6418000	That's cool. You guys keep doing what you're doing. The fakers, the cheaters, the spoofers, get fucked.
6419000	6435000	I just don't know how, like, I don't get it why that would be entertaining, watching people play Pokemon Go, because I've watched people try to play Ingress like in a YouTube video and stuff that shows people going on, like, we're going on an op or something like that, and it was the most boring shit ever.
6436000	6439000	It's just fucking people sitting in a car playing Ingress and it's just, no, no.
6439000	6455000	I only like the really awkward I'm gonna die of secondhand embarrassment parking lot fight videos from Ingress of the people fighting in parking lots over portals where I'm like, I am fucking embarrassed for both of you right now. It's bad. I'll send you some links if you want to see, it's pretty bad.
6456000	6458000	Yeah, it's just, it's weird.
6458000	6487000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Brakeman says, Sky is an angry drunk loljk. Well, sometimes, sometimes. VxjasonXV, our awesome voiceover guy here at the show says, all the people that played Fallout 4 before Street Date come to mind. That is true. Unless you had permission, and some reviewers and sometimes some high traffic streamers and stuff do get permission to break street from companies, but obviously that was not what it was.
6488000	6502000	That's not one of the cases, and that's a very good correlation, but I do have to point out, sometimes people do get special permission, and if they have that permission, then cool. If any of these Pokemon Go people do have permission to be doing what they're doing, then I'm sorry, I stand corrected, but I really don't think you do.
6502000	6521000	And then let's see, ImmortalKing says, wow, dumb enough to broadcast your cheating. Yeah, right? And I believe it is in the Twitch thing that you can't use, and you're not supposed to use emulators or stream things that you don't legally own. I understand that Pokemon Go is a free game, and so, you know.
6521000	6537000	Yeah, but that's the thing. Granted, yeah, you shouldn't be doing it, but there's not really anything stopping you from doing it. It's a free to play game that you cost no money, the instructions are online to run it on Bluestacks, create a brand new Google account, done.
6537000	6551000	I have a problem when people spoof their location. I realize that there's not a lot you can do with that, but you are going to Pokestops you're not at, and getting gear you're not supposed to be getting, you are fighting gyms that you're not supposed to be fighting, that real people are at trying to win.
6551000	6566000	And that's where I draw the fucking line. Like, if you want to sit in your house and not move from your spot, then I guess I have less of a problem, but I just think that stream's gonna be a little bit boring, so I'm not sure that's what people are doing,
6566000	6577000	cause sitting on your couch. You know what, I will say this, I did see a guy who was, I'm doing a stream where I am just gonna power evolve like all my characters tonight, and I'm gonna show you how I'm doing that and all that.
6577000	6591000	That's fine, I guess. I didn't find it to be the most riveting thing in the world, but okay, cause they're not cheating, so I'm okay with that, but it's the spoofing location. I realize it's not as big a crime in Pokemon Go as it is in Ingress, but I'm sorry.
6591000	6592000	Or even-
6592000	6595000	People that are at the location should not have to fight people that aren't there.
6595000	6609000	Isn't that funny? Like, someone that's sitting in a building outside of Central Park, or like a park area, I'm gonna spoof this account or whatever to drop blures on all of these locations, and then I'm gonna film the people rushing towards me.
6609000	6618000	I don't know about that. Alright, anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to turn a rapid-fire news story into something longer, but I had a thing or two to say on that.
6618000	6638000	Alright, so the next big thing in Virtuality is coming, and that is, yes, it's a Rick and Morty game, Rick and Morty Virtual Rick-ality, and it's being developed in partnership with Adult Swim Games and Alchemy Lab, that's Owl as in the other bird, for the HTC Vive, and it looks awesome.
6638000	6647000	I guess it's sort of like a job simulator type game, and actually that makes sense because their last game that the company did was job simulator, so.
6647000	6650000	I guess they're a good fit for it. I guess so, yeah.
6650000	6659000	Alright, well, if you're enjoying Overwatch as much as I am, you're probably very excited to know that Anna has been announced as a playable character in the game.
6659000	6666000	That is gonna be the first free additional kit, because they're not doing DLC, it's a new Overwatch hero that they're gonna add to the game.
6666000	6675000	It is Pharah's mother, so what makes this really awesome is that she's like an old lady of Arab descent without an eye.
6675000	6688000	So, now if you remember the OLR Dream Games, if you were to go back and visit the OLR Dream Games, one of the OLR Dream Games we had suggested a long time ago was a game called Grandma's Got a Gun.
6688000	6695000	And I would think that Overwatch introducing Anna like half meets that qualification.
6695000	6703000	Grandma's Got a Gun was just supposed to be the license free version of like a shooter based on Golden Girls.
6703000	6718000	So this is only halfway there, because I don't know if Anna likes cheesecake or not, but I still think this is really awesome that, you know, it's especially as I'm getting a little bit older, and you know, we all are here at Orange Lounge Radio as we've been doing this for 14 years.
6718000	6724000	So, it's nicer to see older people represented in video games, so I think that is kind of awesome.
6724000	6732000	And it's cool that she's just a sniper healer, she has a sniper rifle and she can use that to heal or damage folks, and I think that's pretty awesome.
6732000	6745000	So, Blizzard does the character design thing very, very, very well, and so it's really cool to see that Anna's just another well designed character that brings some new stuff to the table for the game.
6745000	6755000	I want to mention Evolve. Last week we mentioned that Evolve was going free to play, and apparently the free to play thing working out pretty well for developer Turtle Rock.
6755000	6769000	Apparently the peak concurrent users in June for Evolve, before the game went free to play, the peak concurrent users totaled 234 at its peak.
6770000	6779000	Yeesh. Well, Turtle Rock has picked up over a million new players on PC, thanks to the free to play transition of Evolve.
6779000	6787000	So, you know what? That's pretty awesome, so congrats to the team there, and even I think I have to check that out at some point. We'll see.
6787000	6789000	Moving on, DarkSakura.
6789000	6802000	Well, for fans of Killer Instinct, they have announced the final DLC character for season 3, and that is going to be Eidol, which I was watching the trailer for that today.
6802000	6812000	It was pretty, pretty crazy. So, it will be, of course, Killer Instinct is available on Xbox One and Windows 10.
6813000	6825000	And there will also be the Killer Instinct Definitive Edition that will have all 26 players. I found a typo in this article. From the past, and not pass-ed, 3 seasons. I'm going to email them.
6826000	6842000	And then, in other news, there is a big download coming up for the Wii U. We have some more TurboGrafx-16 stuff.
6842000	6858000	We have Chroma Blast, Jackpot777, Reptilian Rebellion, and Tumblestone on Wii U for Virtual Console. There's Bunk's Adventure, New Adventure Island, and R-Type. Yes! Freaking love R-Type.
6858000	6861000	That's the first time they're getting TurboGrafx games too, huh? That's cool.
6862000	6882000	3DS is getting 7th Dragon 3 code VFD, Monster Hunter Generations. There's also, for download, Journey to Kresia. Final Fight is coming out to 3DS on Virtual Console. And then a bunch of Monster Hunter themes. So, lots of other sales coming up, but I won't go into all of them.
6883000	6894000	Alright. Very cool. Well, this is the part of the show where we would get into the frugal question of the week. However, once again, I failed, and I forgot to post a stupid frugal question of the week, because I'm an idiot.
6894000	6914000	I'm thinking, and I don't know, and I'm going to pitch this live on air, which I didn't warn my co-hosts about, maybe we ought to invite somebody else who might be really wanting to do this type of thing for our show, a long-time listener supporter, to be like our social media person.
6914000	6930000	You know what? Doesn't every big company get like a social media manager type of thing? Isn't that a thing now? Maybe OLR needs a long-time fan to run our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and, you know, post funny memes and do things like that.
6930000	6935000	What do you guys think? Does OLR need a social media manager because Rob keeps fucking failing at it?
6935000	6936000	Sure.
6936000	6941000	And that may or may not have something to do with the fact that I have four podcasts right now and maybe a fifth soon.
6941000	6942000	We'll go to Patreon.
6943000	6944000	Why a fifth?
6946000	6947000	What?
6947000	6948000	I said, why a fifth?
6948000	6952000	Because Jamie and I may or may not have been talking about something for a little while.
6953000	6956000	And I might be doing another one too with little Jamie.
6956000	6959000	You know who's not having a podcast? This guy right here.
6960000	6961000	He's not doing a podcast.
6961000	6962000	He's the one and only.
6962000	6970000	Thought about doing a podcast because I have to have something to do while my wife is watching Grey's Anatomy, but nah, probably not.
6970000	6977000	I only have my garage to record in and it's dirty and has boxes everywhere and there's cat vomit on the floor and...
6979000	6985000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Rob's like VOG host podcast now so it's easy to make a new one. I have created a monster.
6985000	6993000	To be fair, Bobby, if you told me that that thing wasn't ready, I would have just done it the way we've done some of the other shows.
6994000	6997000	Because I was really hell bent on making that idea happen. It just would have happened slowly.
6998000	7001000	It probably still wouldn't be out. So Bobby has definitely helped that.
7002000	7005000	Help us strike when the iron is hot on Pokemon. That is for sure.
7005000	7008000	Immortal King in chat says, Rob is the Walt Disney of podcast.
7008000	7013000	I think I take that as a compliment except there were some rumors about Walt Disney that weren't so hot.
7013000	7015000	So as long as I don't have any of those traits, then we're fine.
7016000	7020000	As long as we're sticking with the imagination part of Walt Disney, then I accept.
7022000	7023000	No, we're not going there.
7023000	7034000	When the show inevitably ends and I inevitably pass away, you are to sever my frozen head and bury it under Studio N7. Sound like a deal?
7035000	7039000	No, because he's not going to have a jackhammer and eh, I'm just going to throw it over the fence.
7039000	7040000	Throw it over the fence.
7043000	7055000	I did always say if I were to pass away before my prime, my request is that you put me into a catapult and you fling me against my place of work building during the lunch hour.
7056000	7062000	That is my one request. I realize you might need a permit, you might need some clearance, but that would be my request.
7062000	7069000	That's the funeral I want. That's the burial I want. I want you to fling my corpse from a catapult at the building during the lunch hour.
7071000	7073000	That's my one request. Thank you very much.
7075000	7079000	Of course, I would like to live to be 100 years old and healthy as well. That would be great.
7080000	7086000	JD is asking onto a window or not. Preferably the break room window would be preferred, but if you know...
7086000	7088000	Onto? Through a window.
7089000	7099000	I realize that the wind and everything might make that complicated, but put Loki in charge. He played enough tank wars in his life. He ought to be able to know the appropriate angle and power to use.
7100000	7110000	Through a window and then he'll land on an office chair with the momentum that you'll have laterally. He'll be able to roll across the floor. That should be fine.
7111000	7116000	And Dark Tetsuya says, will someone be blasting in like a wrecking ball or whatever that Miley Cyrus song is?
7116000	7125000	Yes, you are to blast that song on a loudspeaker. Again, you might need a permit, but I would love that if right with the chorus, I came in like a wrecking ball.
7125000	7132000	No, they're gonna be like, listen, you're not allowed to do that here. Turn that music off. Now go ahead and continue with flinging the dead body.
7136000	7140000	Alright, this is a place of work. We will not be having that song here.
7141000	7151000	Let's get back into some other news now that we had our... See, in light of the Fugu question of the week this week, you got talk about my funeral. It's very morbid. I don't know if I've...
7151000	7153000	Again, I'd like to live to be a hundred years old.
7153000	7155000	And his podcast hoarding.
7155000	7165000	And my podcast hoarding. That's right. You know what? I can't help it. But if you ask me what TV shows I watch, nothing.
7166000	7175000	I don't... I watch... I watched... I shouldn't admit this, but I'm going to. I watch Chelsea on Netflix before bed the nights that there's a new episode. That is it.
7175000	7177000	Email has been submitted with correction.
7177000	7179000	I hear Stranger Things is pretty good.
7179000	7183000	I have heard that's pretty good too. Isn't that a scary one though? I don't like scary ones.
7183000	7186000	Yeah, but it's like 80's scary with like Winona Ryder and stuff.
7186000	7190000	Oh, I love Winona Ryder. Okay, that's okay. 80's scary is fine and Winona Ryder's...
7190000	7192000	It's like they say it has a really big Spielberg vibe.
7192000	7197000	Okay, Winona Ryder's great. Winona Ryder makes everything better. Winona Ryder was the best thing about the Star Trek movie.
7199000	7203000	How can you not love Winona Ryder? She'll steal your heart.
7203000	7207000	Why do people feed bread to ducks? It's so bad for them.
7207000	7210000	I don't know, Jamie. Why do people feed bread to ducks?
7210000	7213000	Just mad at people. Don't hurt the poor ducks.
7213000	7215000	Perhaps those people are mad at ducks.
7215000	7218000	No, don't be mean to ducks. Give them seeds.
7218000	7225000	Getting back into some video game news and not catapults and bodies and bread ducks.
7225000	7227000	But bread is what ducks crave.
7227000	7231000	Back into news, DarkSagra.
7231000	7242000	Well, okay. So Niantic is working on the issue with Pokemon Go on iOS for full access to Google accounts.
7242000	7246000	Which, first of all, wasn't worried about that to begin with.
7246000	7252000	But there is no big reason to be concerned about it.
7252000	7258000	Niantic is working on making sure just the only essential data is there.
7258000	7268000	And to basically put in there for client side fix to detect what information is accessed and be able to prevent certain things.
7268000	7275000	So it's actually in the wording on there. It's an erroneous request.
7275000	7279000	They're really not bothering with any of it.
7279000	7285000	So only it's gonna request the most very basic information.
7285000	7288000	So like I was telling everyone.
7288000	7295000	Now, another little thing about Pokemon Go is making all Americans learn the metric system.
7296000	7301000	Because, I'm sorry, we're freaking behind in the world.
7301000	7305000	Everywhere the fuck else uses metric.
7305000	7309000	We are the only place left that uses the imperial system.
7309000	7313000	I don't even think England uses the imperial system.
7313000	7317000	So it is, to be fair, it is, I mean, for distance is one thing.
7317000	7324000	But it is really hard when you've gone your whole life knowing like, for example, temperature is the big one for me.
7324000	7329000	Like when it comes to temperature, it's like, okay, 104. I know what that feels like.
7329000	7332000	I know the difference between 104 and 94 and things like that.
7332000	7334000	I think that's like 40 something degrees Celsius.
7334000	7338000	And it's like when you hear it in Celsius, like I can't relate the same way.
7338000	7340000	Like it's just it's hard when you've known that your whole life.
7340000	7343000	But I do agree at least with like distance and Pokemon.
7343000	7349000	It is a little, you know, but again, I don't think I'm going to start necessarily looking at kilometers per hour in my car or anything like that.
7349000	7355000	Like it's just it's really hard when you've grown up with it your whole life and that's all you know, you know what I mean?
7355000	7358000	I understand, though, why these other systems are better.
7358000	7361000	I mean, multiple to ten. It's very easy.
7361000	7365000	104 degrees Fahrenheit is 40 degrees Celsius.
7365000	7369000	Well, I'm glad you can calculate that shit on the fly, because I'm not at that.
7369000	7372000	I talked to way too many people in Canada.
7372000	7378000	But at any rate, because that's right, all the distances are measured in kilometers.
7378000	7390000	So but what's sad is that there's a Google trend searches for how far is two kilometers and how far is five kilometers spiked after July 6th.
7390000	7393000	So here you go, everyone.
7393000	7396000	There is 0.62 miles in a kilometer.
7396000	7405000	So two kilometers is the equivalent to 1.2 miles and five kilometers is 3.1 miles, which I need that from doing 5Ks.
7405000	7411000	So and don't forget about 10 kilometer eggs, which gives you the best Pokemon would just be what, 6.2, right?
7411000	7414000	Yeah, so do the math.
7414000	7415000	There it is.
7415000	7419000	So this is your math lesson of the day, the more you know.
7419000	7423000	Bobby Blackwolf says, I think 5K kilometers is the length of a 5K race.
7423000	7425000	IR smart. Yes.
7425000	7428000	Good. You did it. You did my nap now.
7428000	7434000	Now, to be fair, charities have been pushing the metric system or have been pushing the system on us for years.
7434000	7437000	With 5K races, right?
7437000	7439000	Yeah, that's what I thought.
7439000	7445000	JD in chat says, now, if only the footsteps distance thingy were fixed, then we'd actually learn it.
7445000	7446000	Yes.
7446000	7447000	Here's the thing that's funny about that.
7447000	7451000	Actually, they're in apparently the iPad version of the game.
7451000	7452000	It shows footsteps.
7452000	7458000	But when you tap on it, it shows the actual fucking distances and meters like it did during the beta.
7458000	7460000	And why does it now is beyond me.
7460000	7463000	Yeah, it's weird that they changed that from the beta.
7463000	7464000	I don't know why.
7464000	7467000	Yeah, in the beta, you guys, it actually showed the real number.
7467000	7471000	It wasn't exact, so you couldn't totally triangulate.
7471000	7477000	But what? In the original beta, it was rounded to multiples of 50.
7477000	7481000	And then in the second beta, like they didn't update, it was rounded to multiples of 20.
7481000	7482000	Yeah.
7482000	7487000	And then they changed it to this nebulous foot thing, which I believe is just the multiples of 50 again.
7487000	7489000	I think one foot is 50, two feet is 100.
7489000	7498000	It's not. It's actually one, if I remember correctly, it's 100 meters, 500 meters, 1,000 meters.
7498000	7499000	Oh, wow.
7499000	7502000	That's pretty tough to find.
7502000	7505000	Maybe. I could be wrong on that, but I thought that's what it was.
7505000	7507000	Yeah, but Alan's right in chat.
7507000	7508000	Live.vognetware.com.
7508000	7511000	It's bugged right now anyway, which I think is what JD was referring to.
7511000	7515000	It's showing three paws for everything, no matter what it is.
7515000	7518000	So they need to fix that, just so you know.
7519000	7526000	Have you ever noticed like when you have like a lure, or not lure, incense on and you do capture one, you can kind of see it running away.
7526000	7530000	Like it takes like a piece of the cloud with it.
7530000	7532000	I thought that was kind of neat.
7532000	7534000	Yeah, there are funky little things with that.
7537000	7543000	I'm a little angry at Niantic for this, but I guess it's, you know, to be expected because it's so popular.
7543000	7546000	And now like a lot of retail locations are wanting to get in on it.
7546000	7550000	But they are taking requests to add new Pokéstops and Gyms to Pokémon GO.
7550000	7553000	And they have their requests open.
7553000	7556000	Also they're taking requests for removals.
7556000	7562000	So if you don't want your front yard to be a spot for teenagers to hang out in, you can remove it.
7562000	7567000	But then again, you probably did that for Ingress, so it's your own fucking fall in the first place.
7570000	7571000	But why not Ingress?
7572000	7578000	Well, something interesting along with that, and I just got this in one of my Ingress hangouts eight minutes ago.
7578000	7587000	And this is something that came out of Japan because they had the last Aegis Nova anomaly in Tokyo, the Mega anomaly this weekend, right?
7587000	7595000	So there was an interview with Kawashima, who is with NIA, and actually said some of these things about the game.
7595000	7601000	Talking about level cap, and saying that level cap changes may collapse the game balance.
7601000	7605000	So they're going to be deliberate in doing that, but they are considering new metals or functions.
7605000	7611000	We are developing some functions exclusively for level 16, which would contribute to the whole Ingress community.
7611000	7614000	And I wonder if that's portals, but we'll see.
7614000	7621000	Our developing resources were largely occupied by Pokémon GO, so the pace of improving Ingress was rather slow recently.
7621000	7627000	Now engineers are coming back to Ingress, and the pace of adding new features would be Brisker.
7627000	7631000	We have a long list of coming tasks and features, so we steadily implement them.
7631000	7633000	And here's the one you want to hear about.
7633000	7638000	New portal submission is temporarily down because of the lack of our resources, but we want to resume it.
7639000	7643000	At least they're just fixing stuff, because there's like several portals around here that are like,
7643000	7648000	Oh, this is a mural. No, it's not there anymore. Oh, this is a church. It's been taken down.
7648000	7652000	You know, there's like stuff that's just not there anymore that they have portals for still.
7652000	7659000	We have been discussing about adding a third faction in gameplay, but we cannot promise that for now.
7659000	7663000	I think that would really disrupt the game if they did that.
7663000	7669000	I know it's kind of the fan wank thing in Ingress, but if you want three factions, play Pokémon GO.
7670000	7671000	But we'll see.
7671000	7672000	Yeah, that'd be weird.
7673000	7677000	It would be very weird because of the transition for these players that have been playing for so long.
7677000	7679000	Like, how's that even going to work?
7679000	7682000	Just new players, I guess. They'll be a little low level.
7682000	7689000	And then, of course, with any popular game, we saw this with Overwatch, Pokémon porn searches are up.
7689000	7691000	And I guess it makes sense.
7692000	7698000	It's not as high as Overwatch, because Overwatch is like 1,500.
7698000	7707000	But this is actually 800%. This is actually 336% up between males of 18 and 24.
7707000	7709000	This is, of course, coming from Pornhub.
7711000	7719000	On top of that, there is a whole new subreddit now, thanks to people and just wanting to be naked on camera.
7719000	7728000	That's right, Pokémon GO NSFW, where the people are using the AR mode to take selfies and dick pics and post them online.
7728000	7732000	Oh yeah, somebody was kind enough to point me to a Tumblr of this.
7732000	7739000	It was nothing but... I'm going to sound like such trash, but this is just what's on the internet, people, and especially Tumblr.
7739000	7743000	It was dick pics done in Pokémon GO.
7743000	7749000	And so it would just be like, hey, there's a little Pidgey hanging out here, and it's some naked dude right next to that.
7749000	7757000	I kind of laughed because it's really funny, but it's one of those jokes where it's like, okay, now how long is that going to be funny for?
7757000	7763000	Right, and unfortunately, it's this type of shit that's going to get media coverage versus all the positive stuff.
7763000	7768000	It's going to be like, oh, there's people shooting porn dick pics in my game.
7768000	7771000	You mean you gave somebody a camera and somebody made porn with it?
7771000	7776000	There's dick pics in that Pokémon GO. It's terrible for your children. Don't let them play it.
7776000	7783000	They'll get hit by cars and fall off cliffs, and robbed, and see titties.
7783000	7785000	That was a bad time for me to hiccup.
7785000	7788000	This is bad. I hate hiccups.
7788000	7800000	Alright, through these hiccups, I'm going to try to tell you about, maybe this can be my talent, is hiccuping on demand for an internet-wide talent show that Twitch is apparently putting together.
7800000	7810000	That's because, of course, Twitch's creative banner has been expanded, and some folks do comedy, music, theater, voice acting, and magic tricks.
7810000	7813000	I had no idea you could do magic tricks on Twitch now.
7813000	7821000	I almost want to start a crappy little magic tricks channel where I do magic tricks really badly.
7821000	7824000	I'm sure somebody's already doing it. I don't know.
7824000	7829000	But anyway, there was a post on the Twitch blog that said,
7829000	7834000	One of the things we heard loud and clear is that there are many other ways streamers would like to share their passion,
7834000	7840000	which is why we're expanding the Twitch creative category to allow streamers to not only create, but perform their art.
7840000	7845000	So now creative is basically the world's biggest open mic night.
7845000	7850000	You might be able to land a gig performing at TwitchCon in San Diego.
7850000	7859000	So if you've streamed for at least four hours with material related to your act, you can submit an audition video not to exceed five minutes in length.
7859000	7864000	And if you're picked, you will not be given travel to SoCal, but as long as you can get there,
7864000	7872000	Twitch will let you in the door for free, get you in a badge, and then I guess you'll get to perform in the Twitch talent show,
7872000	7876000	which will be a part of TwitchCon this year.
7877000	7884000	How about, can I be one of those people? Can my talent be eating all of the food that's in front of me?
7884000	7887000	Because that was the thing we were talking about a couple weeks ago on the show, right?
7887000	7893000	Where the girls that like binge eat, I guess, and dudes too, but that just binge eat all the things in front of them.
7893000	7894000	Can that be my talent?
7896000	7899000	The binge eating and projectile vomit onto Pokémon.
7899000	7901000	Just bring me more of those Cinnabon things from Taco Bell.
7901000	7903000	I was just saying we should just go get some more.
7904000	7910000	That will be my talent. Watch them just disappear in front of your very eyes.
7910000	7917000	Alright, wow, I have the hiccups really bad, so I need to pass things over to DarkSakura, who's going to open up the mailbag.
7917000	7923000	Participate at orangehomesradio.com and read the emails we have this week.
7923000	7930000	Well, before I do that, William Murderface was asking if there's any way that my old comic book podcast could come back.
7930000	7935000	And that was Monday Comics Mania that I used to do with Tiara.
7935000	7937000	Oh, it was Comics Insanity.
7937000	7944000	I did do Comics Insanity as well, but I was like, I would love to do a comic podcast, but I don't have a co-host who would do it with me.
7944000	7950000	I tried to see if Captain Spike would do it, but I know he's busy with Game Buoy and other stuff, so...
7950000	7954000	He's trying to out podcast whore me, just so you guys know.
7954000	7956000	Oh, then maybe I should talk to him.
7957000	7960000	So, emails, we have all of one.
7960000	7964000	And I will read it to you now, in my drugged up voice.
7964000	7965000	Ready?
7966000	7968000	You wanna hear it? Here it go!
7968000	7969000	Hello, LR.
7969000	7977000	I just wanted to provide some information for folks interested in playing DDR Ace at Dave and Buster's in North America.
7977000	7983000	By the time this email is read, all 30 locations scheduled to get the game will have received and installed it.
7983000	7984000	Hopefully.
7984000	7988000	A recent post on BimaniStyle lists all 30 locations.
7988000	8001000	If your local D&B didn't get it, but you're able to reach one that did, know that if the game is successful in its initial locations, they have announced plans to add it to more locations next year.
8001000	8005000	So if you're able to get to one of them, please try to make the trip.
8005000	8010000	D&B requires underage guests to be accompanied by someone over the age of 25.
8010000	8015000	Underage is defined as 18 or 21, depending on the location.
8015000	8018000	Check their website for more details.
8018000	8024000	The game is presented in brand new cabinets of the latest model with large, gorgeous HD widescreens.
8024000	8027000	The marquee is unique to this North American release.
8027000	8036000	All of the text in this version of the game has been translated into English, except for Japanese song titles, which from what I've heard have been left untranslated.
8036000	8043000	The game will cost 6.8 chips per credit, or between 91 cents and $1.42, depending on the quantity you purchase.
8043000	8048000	Note that all games at D&B are half-priced on Wednesdays.
8048000	8054000	At every location, DDR Ace is connected to the EMU Summit service.
8054000	8058000	EMU's cards will be on sale at the front desk in each location for $5.
8058000	8060000	I already have one.
8060000	8067000	If you plan to play this game more than once, you'll want a card, as your scores and clear status will be saved automatically.
8067000	8074000	You'll be able to unlock more songs, and you'll also have access to options and features that are unavailable without one.
8074000	8082000	When you start the game with an EMU's card, you'll be prompted to select either Normal or Premium Play.
8082000	8087000	Premium Play will prevent your game from ending if you fail a song. You'll simply go on to the next stage.
8087000	8094000	Also, several modifiers, as well as the ability to earn an extra stage, are exclusive to Premium Play.
8094000	8104000	In Japan, Premium Play costs about 20% more pastel-y than a normal play, but D&B doesn't use pastel-y or anything like it,
8104000	8110000	so unfortunately at this moment, the default setting is for Premium Play to require two credits instead of one. Blugh.
8110000	8118000	That's about everything you need to know to get started. DDR Ace contains 700 songs spanning the series' history,
8118000	8124000	and you will receive additional songs in the coming months via network updates.
8124000	8129000	I hope you enjoy it. I certainly plan to keep on stepping. Aaron, why?
8129000	8139000	Thank you for the update, because I've been too busy catching Pokémon to actually go check out DDR Ace, but 700 songs? Good golly.
8139000	8145000	Do I detect a road trip to D&B? I think we need to make that happen, and... Because I know our local closet doesn't have one.
8145000	8149000	And the fountains has a shitload of Pokéstops, just so you know.
8149000	8157000	So, yeah, the machine is really pretty too, although honestly, you and I just need to go to round one, I think is the real place we need to go to.
8157000	8164000	I haven't been, so as soon as I get the All Clear on my wrist, we need to go. Do they have DDR Ace yet, the round ones?
8164000	8169000	Do you chatters know? I know Dave and Buster's, I get that, and I guess that is a lot closer.
8169000	8176000	But at some point, I gotta get Dark Soccer out there, and that would be fun. So, we'll see.
8176000	8183000	Let's see, over at our chat, live.vognetwork.com, sg100matt says,
8183000	8186000	700 songs, they better turn off the song select timer.
8187000	8192000	And Orangewrite says, yeah, all the round ones do, at least Lakewood and San Jose does. Well, there you go.
8192000	8196000	That's the one I want to know about, so, awesome.
8196000	8202000	Yeah, and Brakeman says, make sure the wrist is 100% before you risk it. Yes, doctor's orders.
8202000	8206000	Yeah, see, I'll tell you this, I actually tested to see if I was gonna be a...
8206000	8208000	Because California Extreme was this weekend as well.
8208000	8209000	I really wanted to go.
8209000	8219000	Dan went, but I tried to play pinball the day before to see if my wrist was gonna be up to it, and uh-uh.
8219000	8225000	I just, I couldn't have played. It was very sad, because apparently the Beymani section was pretty epic this year.
8225000	8226000	That's sad.
8226000	8228000	Yeah, that was a part of part of second.
8228000	8229000	That's awesome.
8229000	8230000	I like to wiggle my butt.
8230000	8231000	Do you?
8231000	8233000	I play Deluxe.
8233000	8234000	Of course, of course.
8234000	8240000	Alright, you guys should email us as well. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8240000	8243000	Now it's time to get to the FUs of the week.
8243000	8272000	FU to, um, my wrist being really slow to heal, and I don't know how I'm gonna do at work next week or tomorrow.
8272000	8283000	So, we'll have to see. Um, but yeah, FU to that, and um, that's really it.
8283000	8285000	FU did not have any more Cinnabon Delights.
8285000	8287000	So, stuff is good.
8287000	8290000	Uh, Loki.
8290000	8299000	Um, F, speaking of Cinnabon, FU to the Cinnabon, um, frozen Cinnabon thing that I bought from the store that had the dough.
8299000	8304000	The Cinnabon cinnamon and the, uh, I guess the icing that goes on it.
8304000	8311000	Except it didn't fucking have one of the three things that are required for a Cinnabon, and that would be the cinnamon.
8311000	8314000	That portion of it was fucking missing from the packaging.
8314000	8315000	It was just a bond.
8315000	8321000	It was just the fucking dough, and I don't even know if the frosting was there. It's like two of the three things.
8321000	8324000	I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
8324000	8332000	I'm like, I don't even know. I'm like, I fucking want Cinnabon there, and it's like, yeah, you got lucky that it's just missing.
8332000	8336000	It's fucking gone. So, fuck them.
8336000	8342000	My FU of the Week goes to these fucking hiccups. This is the worst thing ever during live radio.
8342000	8344000	I shouldn't have drank all that wine that fast.
8344000	8348000	There's a trick. All you have to do is figure out how to change the air pressure in your lungs.
8348000	8352000	And there's a trick they taught us in massage school, but it's kind of complex.
8352000	8353000	But it works.
8353000	8358000	Yeah, I don't have time for complex issues right now. I'm trying to force myself to burp. That's what usually does it for me.
8358000	8359000	Like that?
8359000	8364000	Yeah, like that, basically. Isn't that classy for radio to be doing right now?
8364000	8366000	Well, I was just proving it's possible.
8366000	8370000	Yes, I know. All right. Just a couple more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line.
8370000	8374000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. But first, Logie.
8374000	8384000	So this is pretty exciting. It's taken a long time, but they were getting close to cracking the Sega Saturn.
8384000	8390000	And basically, this is a project that was done by James Laird-Waugh.
8390000	8395000	He's known as Professor of Dr. Abrasive. He's a coder.
8395000	8401000	And he also has created some other cartridges and stuff that bypasses different things for the Nintendo Game Boy.
8401000	8408000	And also engineered some flashcards for the Game Boy and some other stuff.
8408000	8413000	But now he has created a plug-in flashcard for the Sega Saturn.
8413000	8419000	And originally, he did this as part of a way to get access to the sound chip that's on there.
8419000	8424000	Because he wanted to actually use it to kind of, I guess, run a tracker or something like that.
8425000	8438000	So he's built something that's going to basically replace one of the cards in there and plug it into an expansion port that's going to allow him to have access to the CD drive and all that stuff.
8438000	8451000	So that's pretty awesome. And he's going to release it public, but right now he's still trying to finish it up to the point where basically someone can easily just plug it in and go and be done.
8452000	8455000	So that would be pretty cool thinking of that working.
8458000	8461000	What can we crack the Sega Saturn to do?
8461000	8472000	Well, he's making it right now. What he's using it for is basically to gain access to the sound chip. So he can do chip tunes and stuff on there.
8472000	8474000	Did you watch the whole video?
8474000	8476000	I watched most of it, yeah.
8476000	8480000	I watched the whole thing the other day because Ranma linked it to me.
8480000	8487000	I thought it was really interesting, though, what he did to be able to finally get into the coding on the chip itself.
8487000	8493000	That he had to take it through another type of decompiler to be able to get the stuff off of.
8493000	8499000	And a lot of really neat in-depth stuff as to just exactly how strong the copy protection was.
8499000	8502000	The Saturn was a really over-engineered machine.
8502000	8514000	Alright, well lastly tonight before we get to the Skype line, I'm not sure how legal this is, but it's certainly fun while it's lasting.
8514000	8518000	How many of you guys ever played the DOS versions of Mega Man?
8518000	8526000	They were not the same as the NES games. They were different. They had different monster bosses and they kind of weren't very good.
8526000	8534000	Well, somebody is actually trying to remake them. I actually had the first Mega Man DOS game that had three boss monsters in it.
8534000	8536000	That was it. It was limited to three.
8536000	8543000	Well, apparently somebody has taken it upon themselves to actually remake the Mega Man DOS games.
8543000	8550000	They're packaging them in together to make like one NES-style Mega Man title.
8550000	8553000	And you can actually get it on the Steam Workshop.
8554000	8557000	Normally the Steam Workshop is like a mod.
8557000	8559000	It didn't have horrific artwork.
8559000	8560000	What's that?
8560000	8562000	Yeah, it did have pretty horrific artwork.
8562000	8570000	It did have some horrific artwork. It is an add-on for Game Maker Studio, but Game Maker Studio I believe is free.
8570000	8571000	Yeah.
8571000	8575000	Or at least I had it in my library somehow, whether it was through a bundle or what have you.
8575000	8580000	So you download Game Maker Studio and then you can download this as a workshop add-on.
8580000	8588000	And somebody's made like a full 8-bit NES game style that's basically inspired by the DOS games that weren't that great.
8588000	8591000	But I actually downloaded this. I checked out a little bit of it and played it.
8591000	8599000	Even though I could not get it to be any bigger than that tiny, tiny, tiny window that I think is the native NES resolution.
8599000	8602000	So I have to play around with the settings more to see if I can get it to be bigger.
8602000	8607000	But it was like playing an 8-bit NES game. It was kind of fun.
8607000	8612000	So they did a good job with it and I wonder how long until Capcom shuts it down to be honest.
8612000	8615000	At the very least it's good to check out the engine.
8615000	8621000	And they made like a custom map editor and boss builder and all this stuff in it too, which is kind of cool.
8621000	8624000	So they basically made Mega Man Maker.
8625000	8627000	That wouldn't be half bad.
8627000	8629000	Although they did have that for the PSP.
8629000	8633000	I didn't like Darcelle that one. The Mega Man powered up Mega Man or whatever.
8635000	8643000	Alright, we're going to open up the Skyline at Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Twitter. On Twitter. On Skype.
8643000	8650000	Meanwhile, we're going to go and see if there's any last minute stories from Loki. Although I kind of doubt it. Do we have any last minute stories?
8650000	8656000	There's not much. One thing I was going to mention that they're going to be releasing Earth Defense Force 4.1 onto Steam.
8656000	8662000	For $49.99 is way too fucking overpriced for that game. Way, way, way too overpriced.
8662000	8667000	So that's not something I'm going to get at launch because I have it on PlayStation 4 and I don't really play it a whole ton.
8667000	8671000	It's fun. I like that and I would be looking forward to playing it with mods and everything.
8671000	8676000	Or playing it with some sort of cheat device or something.
8678000	8685000	I don't know. $50 seems like it's an awful expensive game. Just wait for it to come down in price because that is way too expensive for that.
8686000	8691000	Alright, let's get to the phones. Take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8691000	8693000	Hi, this is Raginator.
8693000	8695000	Hey, Raginator. What's on your mind, buddy?
8695000	8697000	Not a whole lot, actually.
8697000	8703000	Instead of talking about Steam like I normally do. Repeat ad nauseam.
8703000	8708000	I think I'll switch it up and talk about good old games for once.
8708000	8716000	I think I may have mentioned it earlier in the chat, but in case you noticed.
8716000	8727000	EA has added some new stuff to GOG over the weekend that I think you guys might like.
8727000	8732000	In case you don't have it on, God knows what other service.
8732000	8744000	They have released the original Dead Space to GOG and I believe the ultimate edition of Dragon Age Origins.
8744000	8753000	Chances are everyone probably has those games either on console or Steam or Origins or whatever.
8754000	8760000	I'd be surprised if you didn't get them in some bundle or an Origin giveaway or something, but who knows?
8760000	8763000	There may be some folks who miss the boat. It does happen sometimes.
8763000	8777000	Yeah, or maybe there are probably a few people out there that get really bad cases of heebie-jeebies when it comes to anything that has DRM in it.
8777000	8783000	So hey, if you've been holding it off because of DRM, now's your chance to get them.
8783000	8790000	I think temporarily they're what? Either 40% off or 60% off? Something like that?
8790000	8798000	But hey, might as well get them if you don't have them already.
8799000	8815000	On that note, speaking of GOG, is there any games that you would like to see on GOG that maybe aren't on there?
8815000	8821000	The Original Civilization. I check once a month to make sure it hasn't been added yet.
8821000	8823000	That's the one I most want to see on GOG.
8823000	8831000	As far as a classic game goes, I do realize they have Colonization and I think they have Civ IV?
8831000	8839000	They did bring over one of Sid Meier's other games that is kind of underrated in my opinion.
8839000	8847000	Covert Action, which I really liked when I was younger, and I've talked about it on this show before, but I would really like to see The Original Civilization.
8847000	8848000	Oh really?
8848000	8849000	Yup.
8850000	8856000	Yeah, I think I've seen Covert Action and Colonization listed.
8856000	8862000	In fact, I have Colonization on Steam, but I haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
8864000	8867000	It's good, but it's very different from the other Civ games.
8867000	8873000	But I mean, it's still at its core kind of one of those what they call the 4X type of games.
8873000	8878000	But there's just some very different mechanics in it where the outcome is very different from a Civ game.
8878000	8879000	But it's fun, I liked it.
8879000	8883000	I enjoyed a Sid Meier game called Railroad Tycoon a little more.
8883000	8885000	That's probably my second favorite.
8885000	8889000	Well, actually it would be third favorite because Covert Action is probably my second favorite.
8889000	8893000	Then probably Railroad Tycoon, but it's really close because I really like Railroad Tycoon.
8893000	8899000	And I would also like to see that on Steam, GOG, anywhere really.
8899000	8903000	They did do a version of it that was really souped up.
8904000	8907000	I want to say like probably about 10 years ago.
8907000	8909000	That's not the version I'm thinking of.
8909000	8915000	Specifically, there was a version around 94, 95 called Railroad Tycoon Deluxe.
8915000	8921000	That's the one I'd like to be able to play again because I played that when I was younger in high school.
8921000	8923000	And I would like to be able to play that particular version again.
8924000	8932000	Ah. Well, I'm probably going to let you go if only because I want cats.
8932000	8937000	I have my feet acting up and he had three things going and he's going to end up pulling out of the cord.
8937000	8940000	That's okay because these hiccups are driving me bonkers.
8940000	8942000	But thank you so much for the call. I really appreciate it, okay?
8942000	8944000	Yep, you too. Have a nice night.
8944000	8946000	Alright, you too. Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.
8946000	8947000	Alright, bye-bye.
8948000	8953000	I know this is kind of weird but I'm actually going to close the Skype line and we're going to go ahead and end the show.
8953000	8959000	I am hurting here with these hiccups and the more I talk, the more I'm pushing and I need to stop.
8959000	8961000	So we are going to end the show.
8961000	8964000	So thank you very much for tuning into the show.
8964000	8969000	And if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show and help spread the word.
8969000	8976000	Where every gamer has a voice, a nice five-star review on a site where you found this show would go an awfully long way.
8976000	8979000	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Dark Sakura.
8979000	8983000	Um...no. No.
8983000	8984000	Yes?
8984000	8985000	No.
8985000	8986000	Yes?
8986000	8987000	Cinnabon.
8987000	8988000	Yes.
8988000	8989000	Yes.
8989000	8990000	Loki.
8990000	8996000	Um...I don't know. I really do need to stop playing Katamari.
8996000	8998000	No you don't.
8998000	9000000	It's not going to happen though.
9000000	9002000	That's the spirit.
9002000	9007000	And my final thought is I'm going to go lie down. Sorry for the awkward ending to the show.
9007000	9010000	But these things happen sometimes on live radio that you can't control.
9010000	9013000	And thankfully it happened at the end of the show.
9013000	9015000	At least you get a nice long show nevertheless.
9015000	9018000	But we'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
9018000	9020000	Have a great night everybody. Bye bye.
