00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,520
This week, US Dave and Busters in Round 1 locations will be receiving DDR Ace! Fingers

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,800
crossed that there's one coming near you! And that's just the tip of the iceberg for

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,060
this week's gaming news. This and more starts right now on the show, where every gamer has

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:41,980
a voice.

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:49,940
This July the 3rd of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie.

6
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,360
And joining you live here at the Voice of Geeks Network, where we do tape live every

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,980
Sunday night. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

8
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,100
show VOG Network dot com. That's V-O-G Network dot com. We are here based out of Sacramento,

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,980
California in Studio N7, talking about the latest and greatest in video games, gaming

10
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,820
culture, the gamer lifestyle. Again, I'm Rob Roberts. Not joining us tonight, unfortunately.

11
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,040
DarkSakura not in studio tonight. She is off. Lots of people doing stuff for the holiday,

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,580
obviously with American Independence Day tomorrow. So she had a conflict this week and couldn't

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,420
be here. But joining us tonight is Techmaster Loki. Hello, Loki. How are you doing?

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,420
Fine.

15
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,100
Okay, Loki is completely distracted. He's just his head is down looking at his phone

16
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,940
while he's going tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. What the hell's going

17
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,940
on over there, Loki?

18
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,540
I'm playing the new tap my Katamari game.

19
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,500
So what is tap my Katamari?

20
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,300
It's the unholy alliance of a Katamari game mixed with a cookie clicker type game.

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,420
Yeah, that sounds that sounds bad. I think the only thing that could be worse would be

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,860
like a Final Fantasy cookie clicker game. That would be like right up my alley. But

23
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,420
Katamari is pretty, pretty close. It's Yeah, yeah. What do you do you think you're gonna

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,180
be able to put that down long enough to read some stories?

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,540
Oh, yeah, I don't even need the clicker game. It plays by itself.

26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,860
So yeah, I just I'm just gonna sit here and kind of kind of make my fingers kind of run

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,460
on the screen while I'm reading a story. Oh my god, Loki. All right. Yeah, SSU 100

28
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,340
Matt is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Oh, dear, that is a bad combo. And

29
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,300
fifth dream says I use eight fingers to play the Katamari game. Yes, you can join our live

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,740
chat room. Again, we are live on Sunday nights at six Pacific nine Eastern at vog network

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:36,260
and you can join chat live.vognetwork.com. If you want to chat along with the show, stop

32
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,460
me in chat saying tap my Katamari is something you don't say in an international airport

33
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,140
TSA check. Yes, probably probably not something you're gonna want to explain in a sealed off

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,480
room. We do have some guests in studio filling in tonight. Since we are down a dark soccer,

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,360
we brought some of our longtime friends of the show in to help fill the space tonight.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,940
So say hello over there is Shane from Ranger pride joining us the studio again, two weeks

37
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,580
in a row. Yeah, I don't know why. Yeah. Except he's not really on the show because he keeps

38
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,660
looking over again. We have lots of distractions going on. So no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

39
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,380
no, no, no, no. You're about to say something that's not true. Big surprise. Okay. It is

40
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,180
true. He's watching the summer games done quick, which I know. No, no, no. That's not

41
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,520
what's on my screen. And you're, you're, you're doing that with your eyes and your hand is

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,020
moving around and yes, capturing show. Tell me that's a lie. Well, no, cause I haven't

43
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,100
got a shiny for a little bit here. So yes, my hands are playing Pokemon right now trying to

44
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,100
catch a shiny, but no, I am reading dialogue from the classic game of the week for this week. And I

45
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,300
am laughing because of some of these things I forgot and am now remembering. Oh, okay. All

46
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,500
right. But, and so good. As soon as you're done with that, you'll go right back to watching the

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,580
summer games done quick. Well, technically there's a little window over here that see,

48
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,620
oh, you're, oh, you got one of those picture in picture, one of those fancy iPads that does the

49
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,460
multiple apps. He's got the fancy one that can do that. So I get, I can't be mad though. The summer

50
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,820
game's done quick and you know, awesome games. They do those things twice a year and it's for

51
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,580
charity and it's everybody loves it. It's just Metroid Prime right now. So I really don't care

52
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,660
that much, but it's also summer games done quick. So I have to watch it anyway. You still have to

53
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,660
watch it a little bit. Of course, of course. And yeah, vidpower in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

54
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,540
says the gaming multitasking of everyone on the show tonight is strong. Yes, it really is. All

55
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,660
though we do have another guest here joining in studio and I got to give him props because I don't

56
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,740
see him. He is, he is ready to go and he has a phone in his hand. You know what's on that phone

57
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,940
is tonight's show roll. Well, he's ready to go. If I double click my home button, I can get right

58
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,500
back to the show. Whatever, whatever. Say hello everybody to Flaco Jones. Hello everybody. Hey,

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,460
how you doing? I'm doing great. How are you doing? Good. Good to have you back. Thanks. I like,

60
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,020
it's been a while, but it's like there's always so much TV on Sunday night. Like I can't be on

61
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,060
OR till all my shows are over. They're all over. They're all over. No Walking Dead. No Fear the

62
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,900
Walking Dead. No Game of Thrones. Sunday's boring. I'm glad we're the fourth or fifth priority. Yeah,

63
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,340
Big Brother. See, look, I picked you over Big Brother. Oh, that's so sweet. That's not like

64
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,260
three times a week. I can go without. You can read the live feeds. I can watch After Dark every night

65
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,460
too. And you need to get Davon's Diary Rooms on the CBS website. It's all you need. That's the

66
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,020
only reason to watch the actual show is to see your diary. Which by the way, I will say this,

67
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,140
if you are a fan of that show, um, I don't know if you guys on the show is bad. We've been on a

68
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,380
really schedule on guys on the show, but like expert was sick, like really super sick. So we

69
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,780
had to take a couple of weeks off, but we came back this week and we did a Big Brother themed

70
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,940
episode with our pal. I haven't listened to our pal Ronnie, who was a contestant years ago. So

71
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,380
it was a really fun show. So if you like that show, it was good. Check that out. Oh, that's cool.

72
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,900
Logie doesn't even watch that garbage. I have no idea. I know of Big Brother. I've not watched.

73
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,340
He was a great guest when he was on Hoard House. So yeah. And I tried not to repeat,

74
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,380
I tried to repeat a lot of the same stuff, some of the, but like most of it was kind of new

75
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,420
information. I, the big, I will say this, the biggest shot, I shouldn't ruin this. You should

76
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,620
go listen to it. But I will say the biggest shocking thing that came out of that for me is

77
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,020
that there, the little intros, when they get their keys, totally staged stuff, right? Of course. No,

78
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,220
it's not. What? I don't believe you. I don't believe Ronnie either. That's such a lie. Did

79
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,740
he watch this season? Maybe when he did it. Maybe back when he did it like 20 years ago

80
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,500
when he was on Big Brother. It's like, how, how did you get like a bag of bread that has a key

81
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,340
in it? What do you have a whole camera crew watching them for? The trick is they put keys

82
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,380
in all of them. They're like going, go listen to the guys on the show this week and form your own

83
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,340
opinion. Listen to your own lies. But I got to bring it back to video games. I got to bring it

84
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,140
back to video games. I love that you dressed up for the radio show wearing your Splatoon shirt.

85
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:53,180
It's Splatoon mashed up with Powerpuff. Oh my God. It is Powerpuff Splatoon. This has to have

86
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,900
come from the internet. Where else do you find this? This is like T Fury, I think. Or yeah,

87
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,580
I think it's T Fury. I don't know. I like that. But yeah, it's from the internet. Of course. Of

88
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,060
course it is. I'm pretty sure because we got Shane like an early birthday present, a Silent Hill shirt

89
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,780
from there too. It's like a Silent Hill, was it Fighting Game? I don't even remember. I want to

90
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,380
say that. Mario Kart. Oh, Mario. It's like Silent Hill Kart. That's right. That's hilarious. One of

91
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,900
those other sites. What is it? Redbubble? Is that the name of it? Yeah, they're a good one. I got

92
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,420
that. It's the Kermit the Frog mashed with Bayonetta. And so I wear that to all. Yeah,

93
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,020
it's Kermit. It's Kermitetta. It's Kermit the Frog mashed with Bayonetta. I can't even imagine

94
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,300
what that looks like. It's fucking amazing. I'm imagining it and you don't want to.

95
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,740
Like I'll go get the shirt in a minute here, but I wear it to all the Ingress events since I play

96
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,420
on Green Team. So we're frogs. So I wear my Kermitetta shirt. And like most people just

97
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,580
kind of like don't even like get it. They're just like, what a weird thing on his shirt. But like

98
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,100
once in a while, somebody will look at it and go, is that Kermit and Bayonetta? And I'm like,

99
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,980
you're cool. Yes, it is. I just got back from a trip to Seattle, you know. Oh, you saw Splatoon

100
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,140
on this shirt. That's the first thing you saw. Well, I was going through TSA and the guy saw

101
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,100
Powerpuff Girls. And he was, you know, very, I don't know what to say, but he was like,

102
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,940
he was like, whoa, I think you're the first man I've ever seen walking through here wearing a

103
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,380
Powerpuff Girls shirt on. It's like, oh, okay. You should have been like, I wore it for my

104
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,900
little girl. It was her one wish today, asshole. I know he just had to be like, he's like, oh,

105
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,540
I wore pink before. I wear pink camo, breast cancer awareness month when I'm in the army.

106
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,940
Of course. Oh my God. Like I want to go to that airport right now because I am wearing my pink

107
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,340
Kim Chi from RuPaul's Drag Race shirt. And it's like, like this is a screaming homosexual t-shirt.

108
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,700
I'm just wearing a purple shirt, man. And it's got Powerpuff Girls on it.

109
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,020
I don't get why the TSA people try to talk to you anyway, cause you don't want to be there.

110
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,980
Cause to be honest though, that shirt looks like it could be a brat shirt. So it's really hard to

111
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,500
say it does look like a brat shirt. I'm just saying, you know, it could be some confusion

112
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,180
there. Yeah. We got to kick out of it though. It's like, really? That guy was that when I went

113
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,180
through the airport recently, I was wearing my Popplio shirt and the chick at the end was like,

114
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,620
Oh, I love Pokemon. I love Bulbasaur. I'm like, thank you. Let me get my shoes and leave.

115
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,940
I did not care to talk to her about that. Like don't come at me with Bulbasaur when I'm wearing

116
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,780
Popplio. I don't care about your Bulbasaur. I can't believe that somebody like tried to

117
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:26,700
talk to Shane about Pokemon and he just like shot it down when like, I don't like it anymore.

118
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,300
No, it is not Bulbasaur. If she didn't call it Bulbasaur. If she did, I would have smacked her.

119
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,060
Yeah. Okay. But here's, here's the thing. If, if I were to call Shane and be like,

120
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,820
Shane, I'm really upset right now. Cause I had to take Alan to the hospital today. He would be like,

121
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,780
well, did you play Pokemon in the waiting room? That's pretty right. Actually, I would say

122
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,380
something like that. And he'd be like, cause I caught three shinies today. Have you even gotten

123
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,820
a badge yet? And I'd be like, I'm in a moment of personal crisis, but I'm in a moment of personal

124
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,740
crisis because you're not playing Pokemon. Yeah. That's how it is. Exactly. It had to

125
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,460
arrange who's going to go out there and hack my portal for the day.

126
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,780
Kind of get that done until September, until yeah, September. And then, then I'm free.

127
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,860
Then you're free. No way you think you're free, by the way, Loki's referencing Ingress in which

128
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,140
there is an achievement or a badge for how many you have to hack once a day for 360 days to get

129
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:30,780
a particular badge. But my counter, like, even though I have that badge is almost up to 500.

130
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:37,180
I keep saying I'm going to get to 500 and then uninstall just in time for Pokemon go.

131
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,460
Yeah, they might, it might time out that way. We'll see. Oh, sure. That'll stop you from playing

132
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,140
both or not. We'll see. We'll see. I already have my strategy for how to play Pokemon go when it

133
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,100
launches. You don't really need to go anywhere. Cause the book might come to you. Well,

134
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,500
keep in mind in the beta, they were feeding people coins. So, and that's the pay currency.

135
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,220
So I figure you're probably going to have to drop 10 or 20 bucks, like just to load up on some of

136
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,700
the items. Like again, if, if you want to, if you want to really be the very best that no one ever

137
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,580
was, of course, they're going to make you pay money. You can buy her fee the very best. Yeah.

138
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,780
But you're not going to be able to buy Pokemon balls on a whim. You're going to have to hack

139
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,380
them. So you're gonna have to find where all the pokey stops are. So I'm going to have to go to

140
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,500
one of the parks where there's a ton of today, Ingress nodes, where there'll be Pokemon go stops

141
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,340
and like, just basically walk around for an hour and just hack, hack, hack.

142
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,540
I just wish they would just stop, you know, working on another game and just maybe,

143
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,020
I don't know, update the portals that they have out right now, because I swear to God, like,

144
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,340
a vast majority of them are just like non-existent anymore. It's like, yeah,

145
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,740
this is for this church, which has been torn down or, Hey, this is for this mural. That's

146
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:52,140
now painted over. I don't know. In, in general, I have issues with some of the ways Ingress has

147
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,060
been moderated. Like there's, there's a lot of like rampant cheating going on,

148
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,900
which is kind of shitty and kind of ruins it for everybody. And it's like, it's like people

149
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,460
like right now, I don't know how much I should say on there, but there's,

150
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,460
there's a lot of issues. Like multiple accounts will say that like, there's like well-known

151
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,900
people that are carrying more than one account. And it's like, like one or two people with eight

152
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,180
accounts in their back pocket. So they can build whatever portals they want. It's like,

153
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,940
kind of ruins it for everybody else, you know, silly. Anyway. I was going to ask you quickly

154
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,700
about your shirt, Shane, cause you have an escape room shirt on. Oh yeah. Cause I love talking about

155
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,500
the escape room stuff. I know. So I'm trying to think of something we haven't talked about.

156
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,780
You should get a shirt that says, ask me about escape room. Well, why haven't we done one in

157
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,340
SAC yet? I don't understand. Shane's been home for like two weeks and we still have not done,

158
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,780
and this is very unlike Shane. And I think it's only because he's distracted with the

159
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,900
Pokemon shiny collecting thing. I really am distracted by Pokemon. He'll be the only guy

160
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,540
in the escape room with his DS playing Pokemon at the same time. They probably wouldn't let me

161
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:56,060
play it. Yeah, exactly. No, I don't know why we haven't. I suggested doing it on a whim one time

162
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:02,220
and then we didn't. And so like whatever, because you suggested doing it on a whim when I couldn't

163
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,580
do it. And I also think it was father's day that day. It was father's day, but escape room is

164
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:16,300
better than father's. Well, you haven't done an escape room. I have done fatherhood.

165
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,420
You know what we should do Flaco, but we should go to an escape room without Shane

166
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,300
and it would be like the nastiest prank. Yeah, but you know what? You wouldn't win cause I wasn't

167
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,740
there. Yeah. I don't think I'd be good at those. I really don't. I don't, I don't, I don't know.

168
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,340
Do you download any of those phone apps? I never know. Are the escape room? Cause you know,

169
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,220
they, they try to kind of put that in the gaming space for people that enjoy that.

170
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,900
I don't think it would be as fun to be quite honest. I think it's one of those things that

171
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,620
I'll try it. You were talking a lot about like the, the decor of the place does a lot. Like if

172
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,460
you have like bookshelves that actually flip around slides that you slide down, like crazy,

173
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,460
double dare shit in the escape room, big hamster wheel that we had to run around,

174
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:09,180
slid down like a mouth with teeth. Yeah. Double dare escape room. I could just,

175
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,620
I could just see Shane dragging us all to the super slimy double dare escape room or something.

176
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,100
It was like, yeah, I just, I'm always gaming. I could see you would be able to do a lot,

177
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,500
like possibly in a sense, cooler things because it's not physical and real. But I think there's

178
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,020
something to be said that when we unlocked that bookcase to slide over, that was an amazing moment

179
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,020
in, in playing that escape room. So I just don't think that would translate well to a game.

180
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,020
But I'm not opposed to trying a game when I just, I haven't sought that out because

181
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,220
I'd rather do the real experience. What about a VR escape room?

182
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,300
That could be cool. I would, I would try that. I would probably run into things on accident

183
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,540
and hurt myself, but. Isn't that just going to be like

184
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,460
Resident Evil 7 on VR or some of those types of games? Because aren't those kind of like escape?

185
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,260
The room in what Silent Hill, Silent Hill is gone. It's silent Hills is done. You can't,

186
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,980
like stop wanking on the show because it's not going to happen. Hold on. Now we were just going

187
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,420
to get a persona. We were just talking about a mate and you made for TV silent Hill movie. So

188
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,300
yeah, we were, it's not gone. Yeah. They're still trying to beat. They're trying to reanimate the

189
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,020
core. But again, I want you to, I want you to examine what you just said. It's a silent Hill

190
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:33,340
made for TV movie. Okay. Made for it's probably not made for TV is made for streaming networks

191
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,380
movie. Like the last made for, you know, who else does, you know, who else does streaming

192
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:45,340
movies for Netflix is Adam Sandler. Oh, he does. He has quite a lucrative career doing that with

193
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,060
none of which I've watched. I'm like, damn, he's making a lot of movies. Cause you apparently the

194
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,460
whole thing is that you can, you can kind of watch those. You can hate, if you can, you can

195
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,940
have a hate boner and watch those movies without anyone knowing. And you know, that's, that's

196
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,460
basically the thing is that you can watch those movies and nobody will ever know you watch them,

197
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,780
except for the people you share your Netflix account with. They should publish at like

198
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,660
Netflix, the list of people who watch Adam Sandler movies. And Netflix shame. What the hell are you

199
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,420
watching? What was it? The, what was it? The, I kind of can't remember all his stupid movies.

200
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,540
He has, he shouldn't do over. I know that Jack and Jill was the one that I'm talking about.

201
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:30,060
Like the made for, we all know that the racist Indian one, the race people thought it was like

202
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:36,780
ridiculous six or something like that. I think that's what it was. Act Def points out Netflix

203
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,940
has a Facebook sharing feature. Remember when no one's going to use, remember when Netflix was

204
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,500
still new and on the three 60, you could do like Netflix party and everybody could actually watch

205
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,580
the same thing together, like through the three 60 and you could kind of like chat about it.

206
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,420
And then Netflix got rid of that for some reason. I mean, and it's not like it's stopping people

207
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,300
from just getting on Skype and doing that. Right. It's cool. We'll just create a new app

208
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,620
that people can come together and just chill while they watch some movies. We'll call it Netflix,

209
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,780
Netflix and chill the app. Love it. All right. We need to get back into some video game talk.

210
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,100
So let's start off tonight's show talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

211
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,580
that we've been playing this week. Loki, we'll start with you tonight. So, uh, let's see this

212
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,740
week. I kind of can't remember which week was what. Um, I did finish playing South Park. I

213
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,940
finished that game and that's is hilarious. Absolutely awesome game. Worth a replay even.

214
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:36,220
Um, just, it's like watching an episode of the show. It's just that well done. And so definitely

215
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,540
recommended if you haven't tried it out yet, still get it on the steam sale, which is, you know,

216
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:48,300
I think it's still eight bucks. So definitely check that out. Um, what else? I also played,

217
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,460
um, this stupid Katamari game that I am still tapping on. Um, Ingress, I played a little bit,

218
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,500
uh, Pokemon Go just because there's a couple of days left. So I, you know, tried it a little bit.

219
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,540
They had, I don't know if it was intentional or if they just fucked up the coding because

220
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,100
a lot of that shit was pretty fucked up anyways in the app. But for some reason,

221
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,780
one of the last days of Pokemon Go, they had like, I don't know if it was like no spawn delay or if

222
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,460
they were just spawning the whole day's worth of Pokemon at once. So you'd load into the game and

223
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,220
all of a sudden it's like, Hey, there's 30 Pokemon standing right at my feet. So that was kind of

224
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:33,260
interesting briefly. So we did that and, um, yeah, that's pretty much it. Oh, and I raised a Ferrari

225
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,340
and a Lamborghini. So that's non gaming, but it was fun. How briefly tell us about that. Cause you

226
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,860
were hyping that on the show last week. Awesome. So it's basically this, um, I don't know. It's

227
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,620
a company. They have like a, like six exotic cars and they do these different, like you can either

228
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,340
rent them and go like on a trip, like you go down, you know, Napa and you're driving the highways

229
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,300
and stuff that, or they have what they call like the autocross challenge thing. So basically it's,

230
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:09,100
they set up this course in a parking lot at the San Joaquin fairgrounds. So it's a parking lot

231
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,100
and then you drive through the course in one of those cars. So you don't get really fast because

232
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,100
think of it like, um, you go to one of those indoor go-kart tracks. It's like that, you know,

233
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,500
it's a lot of turns and stuff, but you're in a Ferrari instead of, you know, a go-kart. So

234
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,660
it's, you're basically in second gear the entire time, but you still feel the power from those

235
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,060
cars. It's just ridiculous. So I got to do that and it was a lot of fun. I started off with the

236
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,820
Lamborghini and, um, I mean, that was just incredibly fast. And then of course I couldn't

237
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,900
get enough of that. So I also, um, decided to do the Ferrari that they had there as well.

238
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,580
And I actually liked the Ferrari a little bit more because it felt like it kind of kind of

239
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,780
kind of drifted a little bit more. Um, I mean, they were pretty much so low the ground and,

240
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,740
you know, they have the traction control and everything or all wheel drive on the Lamborghini.

241
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,740
So you're not really skidding too much, but you can hear it. I did make a really cheesy music

242
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,540
video thing, you know, kind of showing the footage. Cause I was actually doing Periscope,

243
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,180
um, at least for some of those. In fact, the, when I did the Ferrari, I had the guy who was

244
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,660
the instructor kind of guy holding my phone and Periscoping the whole thing. So that was kind of

245
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,780
cool cause I don't normally do that. And so I kind of cut some stuff from that, but you can hear it.

246
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,100
Like you can hear the tires squealing as you're like turning and stuff, but it was fun. I mean,

247
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,340
I'd totally do it again. It's just incredibly expensive. You know, what's open now that we

248
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,500
need to do is the indoor skydiving place. That would be fun. I would be down with that, but yeah,

249
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,420
that is like, it's something like you're all, you know, racing the car. This would be kind of fun,

250
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,460
but man, you get in that thing. It's just like, you're not ever going to be able to do this

251
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,580
normally. I mean, it's just, these are expensive cars that you'll never be able to buy. Yeah. And

252
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,020
just getting to actually drive them. I mean, that's, it was just awesome. It was really fun.

253
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,900
Uh, SSG100Matt says, uh, in chat over at live.vognetware.com, I kind of want to do this

254
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,380
myself with my dad also. I'll have to look into this. It sounds like great father-son bonding

255
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:17,500
things. I mean, I don't know how they're in LA and I think I know in Stockton, but I think

256
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,500
they've got some maybe elsewhere in other States, but definitely don't buy it straight from the

257
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,140
website. Cause it's like 200 and some dollars to just do the autocross thing, which is not worth

258
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,700
it, but you can get group on deals. I think my dad, cause he was the one that kind of treated

259
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,620
for it since it was like a father's day gift. He, I think paid 105 and then they offer you,

260
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,300
if you want to drive the second car, you just pay an additional 65 to do it.

261
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:48,060
So I paid an additional 65 to drive the car. I thought it was worth it. I mean,

262
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,740
especially now he was talking about like going to the indoor, um, go-kart tracks.

263
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,580
They're just as expensive to drive those shitty things. I did do that once I did the indoor and

264
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,260
it was like Mario Kart in real life. Yeah. Those are fun because those things, those suckers like

265
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,580
drift around the corners and stuff. I mean, and I would have loved, they had like different setups

266
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,460
and I think it based, it depends on how busy they are. Cause they had two tracks set up on this one,

267
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,620
but I watched their little commercial thing on YouTube and they have a different track set up

268
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,380
that's a lot bigger and a lot more straightaways. And I would've liked to do that a little bit more

269
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,540
cause you get more speed on that, but I had fun. I mean, it was fun. Just like, it's like Forza,

270
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,100
but you're doing it in real life and it's just totally different. It was a lot of fun.

271
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,700
All right. Well back to video games, I'll talk about my gaming week, which is actually pretty

272
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,580
busy. This, this live streaming thing I've actually been doing, like I kept talking about

273
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,940
in the past. I want to get into doing it more, but as of the past couple of weeks,

274
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,780
I have actually been doing more live streaming. So if you're not following me on Twitch,

275
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,380
please consider following me on Twitch. I'm Rob Roberts on Twitch. And I did some game streaming

276
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,500
this week because I hooked up the Wii U in my office. So I was doing some virtual console. I

277
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,500
did Super Mario Brothers 2. I did Super Mario RPG, which just came out on virtual console this week.

278
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,300
And that was a lot of fun. Um, and then, uh, I was doing like a random Final Fantasy 14 stream.

279
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,420
And I feel like I did something else this week, but what do you use to put your setup

280
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,220
together there? Um, well, they're not paying me to give this shout out and I hope I'm not missing

281
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,140
out on a referral bonus, but it's, uh, it's, if there is a referral bonus, please consider using

282
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,660
my email or ask me on Twitter. Um, but it is a website called game show. Uh, and they were at

283
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,740
Twitch con when Jason, our voiceover guy had me go to Twitch and I got a demo of it. And I liked,

284
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,020
you know, I really like open broadcast source, but I could not for the life of me figure out

285
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,340
how to do a lot of like the overlay stuff, you know, that they show like the followers and all

286
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,420
that stuff. Well, game show has it all built in. Oh, that's cool. And so you build your shot kind

287
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,420
of like you do an open broadcast source, but then you can have different shots in the bottom and you

288
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,620
can mix them. So that's what I have is I have like my game and cam shot, and then I have my game cam

289
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,580
chat follower, all that stuff. So I can kind of switch back and forth. I thought it was pretty

290
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,700
cool. And you can assign it with hotkeys too, but I use, I still use my mouse to do all that. So,

291
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,540
um, yeah, I mean, it can kind of be distracting. It was, you're kind of like trying to play your

292
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,020
game. You're also keeping one eye on chat. So it's, it's tricky, but, um, yeah, that's,

293
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,020
so that's my shout out to them. Cause that was the software that kind of, I will say though,

294
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,620
it does have some drawbacks because like in order to change the game that I'm pushing to Twitch,

295
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,820
like a couple of weeks ago, I did a Overwatch stream, but it was labeled final fantasy 14.

296
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:33,580
Well, that's because I just used my shot construction from Final Fantasy 14, but just

297
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,780
changed the window to Overwatch to save like a new project. Yeah. Yeah. You have to like save it.

298
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,300
You have to edit the file as a text file to go in and change the setting for what game it's telling

299
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,580
Twitch you're playing into the right game. So there are some weird quirks that they still

300
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,060
need to work out. The PS4 never gets that right anyway though. Yeah, that's always one stream

301
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,340
behind. It's always whatever you last ran. Right. Yeah. Even if you change it, it will still show.

302
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,060
What I have to do is log into Twitch on a computer and then tell it right then what game I'm going

303
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,900
to. Oh yeah. That's what I always do. I didn't know that that's the way, but it's annoying

304
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,380
because my computer sucks. So I don't want to turn it on and wait like 10 minutes to

305
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,820
get it to go. Cause I have my computer's like seven years old or something. Yeah. And Bobby

306
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,900
says it also used your camera mic that one time. That was kind of my bad because, um, again, when

307
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,740
I set up the shot originally, I was playing around with the camera mics that you guys could hear Alan

308
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,780
in the background. Cause you'll notice when I stream, you can't really hear him, but I thought

309
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,700
the camera mic would pick him up, but it sounded like crap. But for some reason I copied that into

310
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,380
what I ended up really using. And then I went back to my Final Fantasy 14 shot and it was,

311
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,700
wasn't fixed, blah, blah, blah. But yeah, the camera mic thing was awful, but that was kind

312
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,580
of my fault and not the programs. Um, okay. So yeah, I've been doing more live streaming. So

313
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,020
that was, that was cool. But I've also been playing other games too. I went back to round

314
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,380
one yesterday, uh, over in San Jose. And so I got to play some music games. Um, and you're here,

315
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:05,740
you guys go, some of you guys that, uh, have been sad that I have fallen out of love in many ways

316
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,500
with music games. I don't follow them as much as I used to in the early days of OLR, but obviously

317
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,700
I've been getting back into it. Thanks more and more to round one. I think you guys will get a

318
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,580
kick out of this. I bought an EMUs card, so I actually have an EMUs. Yeah. And you played it

319
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,460
on 2DX and what songs did you play on 2DX? Old songs. So you're still out of it. Well,

320
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,420
hold on though, because I got like a bonus thing at the end that was like, what was it called?

321
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,860
The music game fans are going to laugh at me because I don't follow this stuff as much as

322
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:38,380
I used to. It was something like, um, it was like a train, like, like a bonus train stage

323
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,580
came up at the end and I played that and it was one of the new songs because I was like,

324
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,180
Ooh, what's this special thing that I'm sure if you had your choice, you would just be like,

325
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,820
I'm going to go play spooky or something. They took spooky out of the game. I don't know what

326
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,140
the old songs that they have anymore because they're old and nobody plays whatever, whatever.

327
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,940
Um, so yeah, I was playing that musica and, uh, you know, just, just some random stuff that at

328
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,300
round one. So, um, I'm sure Shane didn't go yesterday because he was doing other stuff,

329
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,300
but, um, I'm sure, well, I still have like 20 bucks worth of credits left on my card,

330
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,580
so we're going to have to go back so I can spend that $20. Right.

331
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:20,540
Oh, you know what? I just decided I'm going to go there on August 15th.

332
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,300
Why that particular day? Am I out of town that day or something? And I'm just not remembering

333
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,620
in the moment. No, but I will be coming back from Power Morphicon and I have to make a stop

334
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,380
in San Jose anyway. Okay. And it sounds like that stop is not going to be extended to round one.

335
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,900
Okay. That works, I guess. So you can meet me down there.

336
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,940
Maybe. I don't, I have, I have to look at my calendar, see if I'm busy that weekend.

337
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,420
It's not a weekend. Oh, well then that's going to make it really hard to get over there.

338
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:53,740
It's like a Tuesday. Yeah. It's about that. Anyway. Um, and then, uh, on the mobile,

339
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,780
I want to make sure I mentioned this game as well because there's a new free to play.

340
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,540
You know, um, Loki was talking about the Katamari thing. He's still playing at the moment by the

341
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:06,380
way. Uh, and I checked out a new free to play game called Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, which

342
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,300
just came out on mobile. Um, I think this past week in the US. You have to try that too.

343
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,660
Yeah. It's, um, it's another fine. It's, it's different than record keeper though. Record keeper

344
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,340
keeper is I think a little bit more of the traditional Final Fantasy kind of looking thing.

345
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:26,540
This one has like, it looks like the traditional battles, but you, you just tap the, um, units and

346
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,500
they go attack. So it almost sounds like that horrible active time battle game, but it's,

347
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,260
it's actually nothing like that. I hated that active time battle game. And I really liked this

348
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,220
one. Um, because not only like you can hold your finger down instead of just tapping and you can

349
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:47,180
swipe to the right to use magic limit breaks, espers that you fuse with the units and all that

350
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:52,300
stuff. So it has a lot of that like traditional Final Fantasy six stuff, but it is a free to play

351
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,980
games. There's a lot of grindy stuff in it. Cause they want you to spend the currency that they

352
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,540
give you a little taste of for free, but you know, to, to get all the good stuff, you have to use

353
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:08,060
that currency, but I'm still enjoying it. And I don't, I don't play any huge marathon sessions

354
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,220
and I get enough bonus energy from completing quests and stuff that it hasn't really been a

355
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,940
problem for me yet. So, um, yeah, I'm enjoying the Brave Exvius. That's for sure. Um, I'm getting

356
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,940
asked a question about my gaming week and chat over at live.vog network.com. Vid power says,

357
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:29,260
I assume it's beat media 2d X 23 copula at round one. Yes it is. Yeah, it is. I could, again,

358
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,940
sound Voltex was busy the entire time. I couldn't get on that one. That's like the most popular,

359
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,020
but wanting you to play it last time either because it was really fun all the time. It was

360
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,740
pretty fun. Um, let's see. And then Kaijuto talking about the, uh, PlayStation four streaming

361
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,340
says, once you switch a game on PlayStation four, you have to reset up the broadcast. At that point,

362
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,260
you change the name to what you're currently playing. That doesn't work.

363
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,380
Uh, I don't, I don't know. I haven't streamed. Does he mean like start it and then stop it and

364
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,140
then start it again? Cause I guess that could work. Cause I would think that would technically

365
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,940
work, but that seems really ridiculous. I feel like I've tried that before. It didn't work,

366
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,660
but I don't know. Yeah. I I've just, I always fill in the thing. And then when I go to look

367
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,060
at my stream efforts of an archive, it's the previous game I played. This is I've always

368
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,900
done what you did, but the like having it on the computer and updating it there.

369
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,660
But the reason why I did that is so that I could have the chat room up on the computer in case

370
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,460
somebody had to be kicked or banned from chat. I can't do that from PlayStation four, but I could

371
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:31,020
excuse my, I could excuse myself to go to the restroom, boot the person from chat and then

372
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,140
come back. Yeah. So there's always that, but that's why I always set it up that way. So,

373
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,660
all right. That's pretty much it for my email. We have a, Oh no, I need to mention this one more,

374
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,380
one more because, um, uh, Loki last week got me some awesome birthday presents. And one of

375
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,180
the games he got me was grand theft auto five. I did play grand theft auto five today, and I beat

376
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,260
the prologue part of the game, which is the little, like, you know, uh, escape sequence

377
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,900
in the beginning. And then you race some cars and, and, uh, yeah, I played through that. Um,

378
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,420
I would have played more of it, but when I first went to go play at Thursday night,

379
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,700
it had to install and it was very, very slow. And then I had to download a patch. So it was like

380
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:12,620
at least 10 gigs, if not more. So I was just like, all right, I guess I'm not playing tonight.

381
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,220
I'm sure when I go back to play that, I'm going to have to do that as well. Well, not the install,

382
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:22,300
but the patching, cause they release a ton of content on the line. So my advice to y'all,

383
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,180
if you're gonna play grand theft auto five, start the night before. So it can update everything and

384
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:32,300
then come back the next day. Yeah. And the same thing happened. Like, Oh, I can't play for like

385
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,020
hours. Oh yeah. That's. And when you start the game, that's a really funny way to just,

386
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,940
it's not even like the, the, the whole PlayStation network installing in while you could do other

387
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,260
things. It's, I started the game and then it had like some kind of install on a loading screen

388
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:50,700
forever. A lot of PS four games are like file four. I felt was the same way. Dragon age

389
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,820
Inquisition, I think did that. They do that because they're streaming the way they do it

390
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,220
so fast as they put part of the game on the hard drive. Part of it stays on the desk and they

391
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:06,300
stream it from both. So it's reading off the hard drive and the Blu-ray at the same time. So they,

392
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,380
they're able to, you know, stream faster that way. At least that's what they need to do with

393
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,660
the older consoles. Not sure if that's necessary, the new ones, but that's, I know at least the only

394
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,860
game that I've had to do that with. So that's an interesting way to fuck over the red box people

395
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,260
is to like make the game install take all night. So now that the game's installed,

396
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:30,620
got to take it back. Sucka. Anyway. Uh, that's about it for my gaming week. So we'll go over to,

397
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,380
uh, Flaco Jones. How was your gaming week? What did you play? It was pretty good. I played, uh,

398
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,460
I played Splatoon because I hadn't logged on since the new weapon. I don't know when the new weapons

399
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,780
came out. They came out a couple of weeks ago or whatever, but the last round of weapons came out.

400
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,940
So I tried each one of them out. It was pretty cool. Uh, I wasn't a big fan of any of the new

401
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:55,900
weapons, maybe the new and zap, but it's tough to learn new combinations, especially when you're

402
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:02,140
used to the old ones. So I, I, I, I give them some, another chance or two. So, and then I played

403
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:09,580
a lot of Hearthstone on my phone and Marvel puzzle quests on my phone and Overwatch tons and tons of

404
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,060
Overwatch because I didn't even mention Overwatch, but yeah, I've been playing that too. Did you play

405
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,100
the new, uh, competitive mode? No, I don't play that much Overwatch. I'm not ranked 25. You're

406
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:25,900
not 25. So I was 24 and three quarters. So I got on and one night and I did, I only needed to win

407
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:32,140
like a couple more games and I got up to 25. So then I did the, I think this was Friday night.

408
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,060
It was the main cause it wasn't working the next day. So yeah, Friday night I did the placement

409
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:44,300
deal. So you have to play 10 games in the new competitive mode format. And after that,

410
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,100
they give you, based on, I guess your win and loss ratio, I guess it's always really based on,

411
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:56,220
you get a, I figured what it's called like a rating. So I did terribly, I lost my first game,

412
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,500
then I won my second while I was playing with extra for, and then I lost like, I want to say

413
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:09,580
the next six in a row or maybe five in a row. And then I won three of my last four to get to

414
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:15,580
a semi-respectable four wins out of 10. So I got a 39, which I was actually fine with. It was like,

415
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,180
I was like, you know, it sucks to lose since I actually lost a couple of them really close,

416
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:28,060
like very near wins. And then I, uh, I, um, got on there and I got a 39, but I was like, you know,

417
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,860
it's not too bad because I want, I'd rather be up against weaker competition anywhere,

418
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,460
but it's not weaker. It's probably more of my, it seems to make sense. That's probably the people

419
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,020
that should be up against. I will be that loser that gets zero wins out of 10 in the placement

420
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,780
and I will fucking rage and throw my keyboard against the wall. But then you don't have to

421
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,020
play against this hardcore people. I guess that's the bonus. That's, that's the bright side I took.

422
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,380
I even was like, man, I kind of wish I'd won three. Like we did one of those, you know,

423
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:56,060
those ones where it's like 50, 50, I call it 50, 50. I don't know what it's called, but it's like,

424
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,700
you have to have the percentage go to a hundred first for the other side. We won the first round

425
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,500
of that and it's best out of five as opposed to best out of three, what it is in quick play.

426
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,740
And then the other team, three people just dropped or four people dropped. So then it was the rest

427
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,780
of our team, six people against two and they still make you play the whole thing out. I felt so bad

428
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:22,620
for those two people. I've heard that the really toxic, gross part of the community is coming out

429
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:29,020
in that competitive match. I wouldn't know, but, but blizzard has also said, if you drop too many

430
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,940
matches, you're going to get banned from the competitive mode. Yeah. Blizzard said they're

431
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,620
watching it. And if you drop too many matches, you, you get kicked out of competitive mode and

432
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,660
they'll get the rewards. Wow. So yeah, we basically just two poor guys, but they stuck through it.

433
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,700
I felt bad for them. Like, should they, so they get a loss then on their placement, right? That's

434
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,820
just feels so unfair. Yeah. Cause they had no chance that he was only one loss when, um,

435
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:57,740
when I play Overwatch, I'm like that GIF of Ron Swanson with the headphones on just kind of

436
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:04,540
bobbing back and forth because I just don't ever turn on my voice chat. I ignore everything in

437
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,340
party chat. I'm like, can't hear you. I don't, I don't give a fuck what any of you have to say.

438
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,420
That lets me mute it. So they can't hear me, but I turn it on, but I've never heard anyone. I have

439
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,980
team chat auto join. I've never heard a single soul on the way to say like four people in team

440
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,620
chat. I suppose it's unfortunate because there's probably people that actually want to help and

441
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,780
like help people do better. Maybe that's why I leave it open just in case somebody actually

442
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,220
has something constructive to say that I'll, I would chime in, but I've never had to. Yeah.

443
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,060
That's why I would get zero out of 10 placement, but it's like, I'm not going to put up with the

444
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,620
toxic garbage. Anyway. Um, Alan walked into studio and I know Alan's been playing a crap ton of

445
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,860
Overwatch as well. So you, you have something to say on this clearly. Hello. Hi. How are you doing?

446
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:50,380
Um, yeah. So for the 10 evaluation rounds, yeah. If you drop out of those, cause a lot of people

447
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,300
want to game the system and get as many wins as possible. Yeah. If you drop out of those,

448
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,860
then you can possibly be banned from the season altogether. But once you do the 10 evaluation

449
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:04,380
rounds and you are in the actual season competitive mode with everyone that has their rank,

450
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,820
if you drop, and I have a complaint about this in a minute, if you drop your other teammates will

451
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:15,260
be like, you lost a person and they haven't signed back on. If you wait 90 seconds, you can all leave

452
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,140
this round without a penalty. So if someone drops. Oh, so that's why everybody else left.

453
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:27,900
Yeah. So it kind of, yeah. Okay. So there'll be a notice that says like, cause also I've disconnected

454
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,020
not on purpose, just because lag spike or internet went down and I'm not sure if this is working as

455
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:39,180
intended, but I was able to reload the Blizzard client, get back into the game, click play, or

456
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,340
actually put me right back into the match. So I was in, but because I disconnected and was out

457
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:48,060
for a minute, even though we won, it counted as a loss to me personally. And my rank went down by

458
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:55,580
one. Oh, wow. And that's awful. And actually, and cause you know, in chat is saying if they ban

459
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,420
people, they better refund their money too. Well, I don't think people that are getting banned are

460
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,460
getting banned for the entire game, just from the season, just from the, the rank play or whatever.

461
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,580
Yeah. You can still do play the normal game. You can do quick play. You can do. Yeah.

462
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,940
Um, but you, it is possible to get banned from normal play too, but you have to be one of those

463
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,660
like really toxic assholes to get that happen. Um, and then I got four out of 10 for my evaluation

464
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,140
rounds. Yay. Uh, what, what did you get for it? Yeah. What was it? What would the number they

465
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,300
gave you? 46 or 47. Well, how does that part work? Cause I was like, shouldn't I just be a

466
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,540
40? I was a 39. That's like, what did they, how did they decide I was a 39 and not a 40?

467
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:36,220
I think it goes by how many like, cause a lot of, a lot of the escort, the vehicle ones are escort,

468
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,420
the payload. There are checkpoints. So if you get all five checkpoints, that's more points.

469
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,860
All right. That makes more sense. So yeah. Oh, so I probably got a really good boost from that one

470
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,660
wherever he left. Cause we won three to nothing. Two or three of my losses ended in sudden death

471
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:55,100
where it was tied. And then we lost. It was so fun. I should be like seven to 10, but yeah, no.

472
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:02,220
Um, yeah, so I was given a 47 rank, but because of disconnects and losses,

473
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm now at like 44. So I'm going down, down, down. But yeah, if you get to level 25,

474
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,900
you can do your 10 evaluation matches. I don't know if I can help you though.

475
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,540
Yeah, probably. You probably can't do the evals with me. It's fine. I just need to suck it up

476
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,100
and play more Overwatch. It was kind of cool. Like I sit up till almost two in the morning

477
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,220
at like one 30 in the morning, I think just playing that. Cause it's like, I just want

478
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,100
to finish it. I know I'm doing terribly, especially when I was on the bad streak,

479
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,140
but you know, I ended well, so it was fun. I just want to be that guy that gets zero of 10.

480
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,340
The competitive matches are actually a lot longer because yes, you do a full match. And then the

481
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,940
other than it's flipped where if you're escorting the payload and you're on defense, then you're on

482
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:47,420
attack. And um, though actually they can be shorter. Yeah. Cause if you don't meet the

483
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,260
criteria that the other team met, it just ends. It does. It's like, there's no point now. Yeah.

484
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:59,260
Like, um, we got our payload in like with like three minutes to spare. So the other team had

485
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,540
to do it in that time or less. So their timer was adjusted to buy what our score was. So they

486
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:09,020
had to basically do it better than we did. So yeah, it adjusts. Um, or you only, we only had

487
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,140
to make it to the second checkpoint on one. You didn't have to make it all the way to the end of

488
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,500
the map. You just get, you just had to beat the other team and then you, then it's over.

489
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,580
But yeah, otherwise it's like, if it's like you said that that contributes to your rating,

490
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,820
wouldn't that hurt your rating then you couldn't get the max points. Like say if you went first,

491
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:29,580
you can go down anywhere from a half to a whole point. Like I've gone down three quarters of a

492
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,740
point before. Okay. So yeah, I still haven't played since doing my placement actually,

493
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,340
but cause I've been busy. Yeah. So they're really long cause it could be upwards of three

494
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:42,220
whole matches. Yeah. It's an investment. It makes you do best of five instead of best of three,

495
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,780
which what it is on quick play. Yeah. So they changed that too. So that's all Overwatch,

496
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,140
Overwatch. It's what a lot of people are playing right now. So

497
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,780
I've had a blast. You guys have more experience with it than me. Although I feel like I've been

498
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,900
playing enough, you know, but I thought I was so surprised. Like I feel like I've been playing

499
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:05,420
a lot and then I log out. I'm like, I'm not 25. Okay. My name is Splatoon. Splatoon. You'll

500
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,420
need to get to 10 to play ranked mode. I don't know. I don't think time comparison wise. I

501
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,700
don't know if it's similar or not. I think, I think it's a lot faster to get a 10 in Splatoon

502
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,340
25 in Overwatch. But I agree with that. Anything else for your gaming week?

503
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,060
I think that's pretty much it. All right. Let's go to Shane. Shane, how was your gaming week?

504
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:26,060
What have you been playing? I played Pokemon. That's literally it. Um, I know I did play

505
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,420
the Final Fantasy game on mobile, but I've already uninstalled it. I don't like it.

506
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:37,420
Not a fan. It's not very fun to me. So Pokemon. How's your, uh, shiny decks going?

507
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:45,260
55 is my current total now. Yeah, but it's not really when there's 720. Oh my gosh. Which you

508
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,060
can't even get all shiny, but have you caught any shinies during the show tonight? No, not yet.

509
00:41:50,060 --> 00:42:00,700
What one are you working on now? Uh, Ivy soar and, uh, pan Sage and, uh, Quilladon. Those are

510
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,660
the three I'm looking at at the moment. I thought you got one of those last night.

511
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:10,860
Yeah, I got pan Sage, but I evolved him. So I need to get him again. Oh, got it. Yeah. So

512
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:19,260
just those lots. You looking forward to Pokemon world? Uh, the worlds. Yeah. I'm so excited for

513
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:25,340
that. They had the, um, cause it's not in the show at all. Uh, they had the American and Australian

514
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:31,420
and I believe Hong Kong nationals this weekend. So I was watching, I wasn't watching Hong Kong

515
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:37,500
cause I don't think there was a stream of it. Um, but American and Australian were both on Twitch

516
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,260
and I watched that and it was a lot of fun. Yeah. Actually vid power and chat over at

517
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,580
live.fognetwork.com says, uh, Pokemon national championships is this weekend. Yeah. I saw some

518
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:52,300
of the trading card, um, which is, is still fun to watch. I play a little bit on my iPad sometimes.

519
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,740
I didn't watch any of the Pokken. Um, even though that got streamed and I watched a lot of the

520
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,740
actual video game and that was like the best. I cannot wait to watch it in person.

521
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:09,980
So much fun. All right. Well, uh, let's get to tonight's gaming news. Uh, just some quick

522
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,700
housekeeping. Um, remember to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio.

523
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,100
We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. Um, and as far as our schedule goes,

524
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:25,260
uh, the next show we will have off for sure is labor day weekend. Um, as I will be at dragon con,

525
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,100
which that, that date is sneaking up sooner rather than later. I got to get my flights

526
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:35,980
booked this week. Cause uh, yeah. Wow. I can't believe it's the end of next month or no, I guess,

527
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,740
I guess the way the dates fall this year, it's actually the beginning of September with the labor

528
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,140
day kind of got close enough. Yeah, but close enough. Close enough. I've started thinking about

529
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,780
what cosplay I want to do, but I saw my pal Victoria. I haven't seen in like a year and I

530
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,140
feel like she came on this show. Was it, she was on guys on the show. She did the Disneyland

531
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,220
episode of guys on the show. Um, and she does like a lot of super cosplay stuff. She did a

532
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,540
game of thrones character yesterday at Rocky, uh, cause they were doing like a nerd theme.

533
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:06,620
Uh, so she's, uh, she did, uh, who's the one that shame, shame. Oh, I don't know the nun.

534
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,260
I don't know her name. No, not, not the nun. She was Cersei. Cersei. That's okay. You see,

535
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,260
look, I have a show Sunday nights. I don't get to watch the other one, but you got close. I got

536
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:21,420
close. I described it. Well, because I know at the very, at the beginning she was dressed and

537
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,180
she was sipping from a wine glass, which I guess is like a big thing. That's all she ever does.

538
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:30,940
Okay. So she was doing that. And then at the end, apparently she came out and she was not wearing

539
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,060
a lot of clothes and the whole audience was throwing popcorn at her going shame, shame. Yeah.

540
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,220
And that was like the joke. So anyway, um, how do we get on that? Oh yes. Because she said she

541
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,940
would help me do a cosplay, whatever I want to do for dragon con this year. But I'm not,

542
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,300
I'm not sure. Like I could do my joker again, even though the belt broke. So I have to get that

543
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,820
fixed. But then I'm like, well, I kind of want to do something else, but I also really don't

544
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:57,020
want to shave my beard. So kind of limits what I can do. I don't know. We'll see. Does it,

545
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:07,020
you could be a Pokemon. I'm going to be a Pokemon. Oh my gosh. Can I really pick? Yes. Pick. Yeah.

546
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,700
What Pokemon? Let me go look, which one I want you to be. Do I get to pick which one I want him

547
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:20,220
to be all like in your memory? No. Yeah. I have a Pokemon. Cause the one, the one I would like

548
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:27,100
you to be is goth to tell. I think that would be hilarious. I'll show you in a minute. I'll search.

549
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:34,700
Um, or you could be, Oh, it'd be hilarious. Like all I'm just trying to think about is,

550
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:43,820
Oh, you could be, um, a Florges also. So basically I'm picking the female looking one.

551
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:50,940
Whatever. I, and you know what, for the right, actually, that's not a horrible outfit.

552
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:59,340
Oh my God. For, for the right, for the right costume, I'll consider shaving my beard.

553
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,780
No, you don't have to shave your beard. You just paint over it. You just cover it. Just cover my

554
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:08,460
beard. I'm going to find the mustache. And you get to pick which color flower petals for this one.

555
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,100
Goodie. I like how, I like how he's already saying it. Like it's a sure thing. Like what

556
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:19,420
was the one you played in, in a poke and tournament? Um, it's a Fennekin's evolved form.

557
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:24,460
Breaks in. Yeah. Breaks you in. Isn't that like a ginger? It's a Fox. I don't know. Fuck off.

558
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,700
Here's the one you could be. Oh, you've shown me that one. That's just a flower.

559
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:37,820
It's like a drag queen flower. Look, it's got like all these flowery.

560
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,580
Does it even have a face? What is that? It's faces right there. Actually,

561
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,900
I don't understand. You know what? Dark Tetsuya makes an awesome nerd point in our chat room at

562
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:52,380
live.voggenower.com saying, isn't that what the guy that played Joker in Batman 66 did? He didn't

563
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,100
shave his mustache. Yes. Cesar Romero who played Joker in the old sixties, Batman. He, he never

564
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,780
shaved. That's why his face kind of looked funny. He would not shave his mustache for the role.

565
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,460
They painted over it in the white paint because the older cameras, they didn't really catch it,

566
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,300
but since they have to remaster Batman, like if you go back and watch the Batman 66 movie,

567
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:15,100
like he's really bad. I have breaking news. What happened? What I have a better Pokemon for you to

568
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:23,980
do. I hate it when shame breaks. It's not, it's never legitimate. Not going to dress up as yes.

569
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:29,100
What is that? One is like the old school one that looks like the drag queen basically. Well,

570
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:35,980
like all the ones I'm picking for your drag queen. I might as well do Mr. Mime. No,

571
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,060
that's not drag. I'll just, I'm just going to wear a pink Snuggie and say I'm a ditto.

572
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:45,740
That's that'll be it. All right. Stupid. Yeah. Just like your ideas. Not as stupid as being jinx.

573
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:55,180
All right. Look, I don't even, I think you would do a very good job. I would have to

574
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:01,020
Orko enjoy. I would have to paint my entire body purple. You know, just your hands and your face.

575
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,100
Oh, well that's all. And, but not your lips. That's some lipstick you could wear. And then

576
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:10,700
you get a blonde wig and then like the, um, you could just be a Pokemon trainer, get a blow up

577
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:18,860
doll, dress it up like that. Okay. Now here's the thing. And I could do this. And then we're

578
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:26,380
getting into gaming news. We're leaving this. I actually, years ago, one Halloween, I dressed as

579
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:32,300
Ash Ketchum because I have a Pokemon that's like life size, a little Pikachu. And like,

580
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:38,220
you can kind of put your arm through the tail and it can sit on your shoulder. So I actually did

581
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:43,660
that one year. So I could do the Ash Ketchum again, except this is like Ash Ketchum pushing 40.

582
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:50,700
I haven't caught them all yet. This is not a very good life plan.

583
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,660
Which if you think about it with as old as Pokemon is

584
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,380
Ash Ketchum ought to be pushing 40 now. So it's kind of appropriate.

585
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,620
All right. Very best that I could be in accounting.

586
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,700
That was the very best. And then I took an arrow to the knee.

587
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,100
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, found a better one.

588
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:15,180
Then you got drafted into the war. All right. I'm so done with this topic. We

589
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,100
need to get back into some gaming news. This is all about games right now.

590
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,820
It's it's horrible. I would have unsubscribed hours ago. This is pretty awesome. All right.

591
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:31,420
Loki get his can be a lot bunny. It's basically, no, it's a bunny. It's like a Playboy bunny.

592
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,220
I a Playboy. Oh my God. Gaming news. Loki started us off tonight.

593
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:43,420
So Microsoft is getting rid of X-Box fitness. Which is a bummer. I was going to use that to

594
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,420
lose some weight so I could do some slutty cosplay like jinx. That's not going to happen

595
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:53,100
either. I'm not going to be slutty jinx with that. Um, but yes, apparently, um, you know,

596
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,100
they're going to start to go wind down. So right now you can't buy new content.

597
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:03,740
And those who have purchased content so far, you can use those up until June 30th, 2017.

598
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:09,660
And then after that, well, too bad. You don't get free shit anymore. You don't get to, uh,

599
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:16,940
view your content that you paid for anymore. That kind of sucks. Well, that sucks for you.

600
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,620
If you bought that $60 Jillian Michaels workout video that it's just going to get taken away from

601
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:29,100
you. I've never, ever even heard of X-Box fitness, like for real. When did that happen?

602
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,460
At the launch of the three or at the launch of the 360 and the launch of the one when the connect

603
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:40,780
was included with every X-Box and you know, a big part of why the connect took off in the beginning

604
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:45,660
was what dance games and fitness games. Right. That was like all the connect was in the beginning

605
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:51,020
for the 360 for the X-Box one. It was never anything. Well, it was an extra thing that

606
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,100
they packaged in with your system that you're paying for. I think it had hoped to continue

607
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,500
the, um, dance game and fitness game trend because, um, there was, there was a dance central game for

608
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,780
a hot minute, but it was like, uh, here's a very bare bones version of it. Now buy all our songs

609
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:12,460
extra that that doesn't fly usually pretty much. So, and Microsoft still has not said, like,

610
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:18,300
you're going to get compensated. I mean, this is why people are nervous about buying shit digitally

611
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:23,180
and they should be, you know, again, it depends how much you're spending, I suppose.

612
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:28,060
Like, you know, if steam went belly up tomorrow and I can no longer download,

613
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,340
you know, the shower with your dad simulator that I spent 69 cents on, I'm not going to be that

614
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,340
worried about it. You know, when you were saying that you got that game, I confused it with that

615
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,580
other showering game with guys where you actually have to like rub them down. You've seen that game

616
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:46,380
before I have that game. It's hilarious. No, you're weird. You know, if you saw this game,

617
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,260
you'd be like, why am I not playing it right now? It's by the guy that does the lot of like

618
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:57,740
the sex games, I guess like, Oh, that guy. Oh no, no. Like he has stuff on steam. It's like,

619
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:03,180
that's what he's known for. He had the game where you, where you take like penis pictures,

620
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:08,860
like you were, um, like on, you know, one of those social media things and

621
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:14,460
Is this guy to steam like that guy on Amazon who writes those books? It's like pounded in the butt

622
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:22,060
by my butt and like, uh, like, uh, pounded in the butt by the Brexit and like all these like

623
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:26,620
random things. I mean, please tell me somebody else has heard of this on Amazon. Yes. There's

624
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,860
this author on Amazon who writes all these like crappy. Well, I don't know. I haven't,

625
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:34,460
I haven't read them. I don't know if they're good or not, but they're, you know,

626
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:40,220
gay Rodica things that have these like ridiculous names. I don't think they're supposed to be good.

627
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:47,900
One of them got troll nominated by the CD side of Twitter for a prestigious, like a Hugo award

628
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:54,620
or something. And it was, it was, um, it was one of this guy's books. So this sounds like that,

629
00:52:54,620 --> 00:53:00,940
but on steam anyway, I don't know how we got from X-Box fitness to pound it in the butt by my butt,

630
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,580
but basically, so the reason that they're terminating the service is because the service

631
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:11,180
requires regular content updates, given the service, um, relies on providing you with new

632
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,820
and exciting content regularly. Microsoft has given too much or has given much consideration

633
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:24,220
to the reality, um, updating the service regularly in order to sustain it. And, um,

634
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:34,540
and that's it. That's like half of a quote. What the hell? Um, we thought about it and that's it.

635
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,500
We're done. Um, we thought about, Hey, yeah, we were going to update that service called

636
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:45,260
game room too, but those guys. Yeah. That's a sore spot too. Cause I spent money on game room

637
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:52,060
and it's like, well, that's gone pounded in the butt by Microsoft. Um, looking at the internet,

638
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,980
I found the name of that book that got nominated for a Hugo award. It was space Raptor button

639
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:02,220
invasion. That's the one that got nominated for you. I hope they get made into a movie.

640
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:11,100
It'll probably do better at the box office. You know what? You laugh, but I bet space Raptor.

641
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:17,180
What was it? Space Raptor button vision or space Raptor button vision has more of a story than

642
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:22,620
Tetris does and Tetris is getting a three movie deals. So why can't space Raptor button vision

643
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,020
get at least one movie? Why not? I never thought Loki would be defending space Raptor button

644
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:31,740
vision here on the show, but seriously, we are that having a movie would be less ridiculous

645
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,460
than Tetris having a movie. That is how ridiculous that concept is.

646
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:43,820
Um, all right. Well, one concept, uh, we would like to hear about soon already is the

647
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:48,860
Nintendo NX and what is the fricking catch with the Nintendo at X? What is the thing?

648
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:54,140
Uh, apparently in an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto this week talked about that the reason

649
00:54:54,140 --> 00:55:00,220
why the NX has not been unveiled is because there is a secret idea. And, uh, from this

650
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:06,940
article with big story, uh, that he said in terms of NX, there's an idea we're working on.

651
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,940
This is why we can't share anything at this point. And I don't want to comment on the other

652
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,660
companies. If it was just a matter of following advancements in technology, things would be coming

653
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,380
out a lot quicker. So in other words, what I draw from that is that, look, if we were just bumping

654
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,420
up the specs and putting out like a power console, then, then we would have said it already. But

655
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,460
because there's some type of twist to the system that they don't want other people to steal,

656
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:38,300
that's why they're not unveiling it. What? This is a stupid fucking reason. I'm sorry.

657
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,700
I want to, I do want to just quickly say though, maybe there's a translation thing going on here.

658
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,940
I do. Cause this has happened a couple of times. That's the case. And then this, I mean,

659
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,900
translators, come on, seriously. But, um, assuming that there's not a translation issue,

660
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,380
I think that is a dumb fucking excuse because seriously, what is two fucking months or how

661
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,940
many months between now and when they're going to announce it, is it going to matter? And they're

662
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,660
going to fucking copy it anyways, if it's a good idea. But it didn't come out right away. Like the

663
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:10,860
move and the connect weren't a thing that was like out at the launch of the weed. The connect

664
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,980
was sort of like an evolved idea. I wouldn't really consider Microsoft doesn't necessarily

665
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,980
just steal ideas. They steal them and make them better. And that's what they will try to do in

666
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:25,100
theory with connect that they didn't really, that they didn't really perfect until the Xbox one,

667
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:29,020
by which point everybody stopped caring to see a trend of Microsoft where they try to steal these

668
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:33,100
ideas and make them better. They're not really successful with a lot of them. Like the windows

669
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:43,900
phone, the zoom, the connect, uh, what was that? The, uh, or the, yeah, but then they do something

670
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,860
like a second screen glass crap. Okay. Uh, but then they do something like Xbox live,

671
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:53,180
which has been like the biggest innovation. So they kind of been doing that for a long,

672
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:57,260
one could argue that was bitten off. What like game spy servers and things that were already

673
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:02,060
existed in the PC world. Okay. So fine. They did something right there, but it's been a while

674
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:07,180
since they've had it hit. But like, I seriously think that as a stupid fucking reason and it's

675
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:12,300
cause it's, if it is a gimmick of some sort, they're not going to change their game plan.

676
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,460
That, I mean, if it's that significant, I don't think that these companies are a changer game plan

677
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:21,180
that quickly. And if it is something that they can change that quickly where they're like,

678
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:26,380
if you announced it now, they're going to be able to steal it by the time that you release this.

679
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:32,700
Who cares? I mean, it's going to be like, yeah, so it'll delay it a few more months and then

680
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:38,140
they'll steal it. I mean, what's the big deal? I think I know what it is. It is putting a handle

681
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:43,340
on your system again, just like they did with the game. Uh, dark to see you in chat says,

682
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,540
well, yeah, I mean, look at the, we, after it was announced and Sony came out and said,

683
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,380
look, our system has motion control on our control. It was fucking so I can see why

684
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:55,100
Nintendo went that way. They're still using that fucking garbage motion controller. I disagree.

685
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:01,020
I think the move actually was better. Like it was way more accurate than the we, and it felt,

686
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,260
it just didn't really have, you know, you're right. Yeah. Cause I did use that. I do remember

687
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,500
that now, but like the implementation of it was garbage. Like they didn't have the games

688
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:15,180
to justify it. But I give Sony massive props that now it's like, okay, well that's coming back. So

689
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:22,700
like, it's not, it was good back then, but it's not good enough. I think they need to do more

690
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:28,220
with it. Uh, let's see. And then Stoppy says, uh, because you know, Nintendo doesn't have a legal

691
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:33,420
arm to go to after companies that copy their idea. Maybe they're all busy going after let's players

692
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,420
and coffee table books. Well, that's a whole nother issue, but yeah. Uh, maybe their legal

693
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:43,740
arms tied up with that. Although, you know, again, apparently Sony or I'm sorry, apparently, um,

694
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:50,460
Nintendo couldn't stop the move, but I would bet because the move was based with a camera and the

695
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,980
Wii thing was based on infrared. That's was different enough for it not to be a very different.

696
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:00,940
Yeah. Yeah. Cause we, you, the, the remotes are looking at a sensor bar. So they're basically

697
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:06,300
finding like two, two points that are on top of your TV and they're tracking that versus the

698
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:12,060
camera tracking the actual controllers instead. Well, I mean, they're going to have to unveil

699
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:17,580
what it is eventually to make people want one. So I, I still kind of agree with the general

700
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:22,940
consensus that the week before Tokyo game show is when this will be revealed. And the reason why

701
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:28,300
is not because Nintendo, you know, Nintendo doesn't really do Tokyo game show, but the third

702
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:33,740
parties that are going to put games out on an X will then be able to, uh, basically promote for

703
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:37,580
them at Tokyo game show. And I, I, that's why I believe that we will hear about the NX the week

704
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:42,060
before Tokyo game show. Can we at least all agree that whatever they're hiding right now is probably

705
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,700
insignificant really? Yep. Yep. I don't think it's, I don't think it's something that's so

706
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,540
game changing that they need to hide it. I'm going to agree with it, but not in such a negative

707
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,860
connotation. I think because they're hiding it, it's something that's really easy to copy.

708
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:00,060
So that's why they're hiding it. So we'll see. What's it going to be over your own VR? I mean,

709
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:04,860
seriously, like, I don't know what they could, well, they've already publicly stated that they

710
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:09,340
are, you know, they've seen a lot of things that they're thinking about doing things and they have

711
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:13,740
projects and ideas. I'm starting to get the impression that they don't know what the fuck

712
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,420
they're going to make that system into that. They're just throwing all these ideas like,

713
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,100
Oh, maybe we should do some VR. Well, maybe we should do this. Maybe we should do this.

714
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,740
I don't think that's why they're showing it because they don't know what the fuck it is.

715
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:28,780
Yeah. They don't have anything to show. It's just like, I'm going to throw a wild dart

716
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:34,780
against the wall. And if this whole handheld and console universe thing, it proves to be true.

717
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:42,620
Nintendo are, I think it has something to do with game streaming. And they're worried that

718
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:47,980
Sony's going to jack it for PlayStation now. And I don't, I'm sorry. I don't, you know,

719
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:53,820
if I knew what it was, boy, I'd probably be a lot richer and, uh, you know, be a games analyst full

720
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:59,580
time. But, um, I have a feeling, I don't know why my gut tells me it seems like a natural evolution

721
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:05,100
of the fact that the Wii U streams from the countertop box to your device, maybe they

722
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,940
figured out a way to get that done over the internet or something there. It's something

723
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,340
they don't want Sony to incorporate into PlayStation. Now, again, that's just a wild

724
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:18,780
guess, but that would strike me as something that's quote unquote, easy to copy. If Sony

725
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:22,780
were to dedicate the resources to the copy, because I think they are dedicating the resources

726
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:27,180
to it. I wish they'd spend those resources on getting backwards compatibility to work instead,

727
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,780
because I don't believe for a second that they can't get that to run on the PS4.

728
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,340
Stop being chat says, I don't disagree with Rob, but game streaming, if that's the idea,

729
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,420
they're worried if people copying, they deserve all the hate they get. I, here's the thing,

730
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:44,220
it's not like, like, obviously it's not just game streaming. There's something new there. And if I

731
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:50,540
knew what it was, then I could steal Nintendo's idea, but I'm speculating. I wonder if, here's

732
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:54,300
the, here's might be, okay, I'll put out the wild guess that I think it might be.

733
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:00,700
Because with PlayStation now you stream games from a centralized server. You don't really stream it

734
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:06,780
to your place. You don't stream it from your PlayStation four to your Vita, unless you're

735
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:13,100
in wifi. I think what could be the catch is that Nintendo's figured out a way through low bandwidth

736
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,860
or something, maybe just for virtual console games, maybe for very, very low bandwidth games

737
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:22,460
or something. They found a way that you can stream over the internet, over the air from your

738
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:29,900
NX to your handheld NX, no matter where you are. That's, that's my guess.

739
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:35,420
It's a crazy guess. I totally admit, but that's, that's what I mean when it's something to do with

740
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:39,820
game streaming, but it's something we haven't quite seen yet. No, I don't think you could

741
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:44,700
literally pause your game at home. Get in the, get in the car to go start going to work or the

742
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,740
train to go to work and pick up right where you left off on your device. The Vita and the

743
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:55,500
PlayStation four almost do this, but they don't really do it over the internet. I, I don't think

744
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:01,180
so. That's just my wild guess. Uh, all right. Anyway, let's, uh, let's move on to some more

745
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:08,300
stories. Uh, who's going to go next? Jim, it's me. It's me. Uh, I wanted to talk about, uh,

746
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:13,100
summer games done quick. And I know a lot of this is covered. I heard the tail in the Bobby show,

747
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:18,700
so, but, um, uh, that's okay. We have podcasters who might listen in reverse. They might listen

748
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:23,100
to reverse order and listen to Bobby second. So, so the thing that I wanted to open up with

749
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:28,460
before I get into the summer games done quick was, you know, they were featured, uh, one of

750
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:33,500
the speed runners is featured on the Colbert show or was it called the late show? It's sad that I

751
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,580
don't know what it's called Letterman's old show. It's the late show because that was Letterman's

752
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,900
show. It's the late show with Steven Colbert. It was Steven Colbert. They had Mitch flower power,

753
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:47,420
whose name real name is Mitch Fowler. I'm like, Oh, I get it now. So they had him on and he ran

754
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:53,180
Super Mario brothers three. And I guess because his, one of his fast times is like three Oh eight.

755
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:58,940
Then Colbert raced him in like cooking and eating a hot pocket. And then he also had like,

756
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:05,500
these guys do a relay race from some local track. It was like Columbia. I think so. Yeah. So yeah.

757
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,940
So they did like a three way thing where like these guys were running a relay race and Colbert

758
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:14,220
was microwaving and eating a hot pocket. And this guy was running some more of a string. Colbert won

759
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:20,300
because this guy didn't Mitch didn't get his best time, but he did it in like three 35. I think it

760
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:24,220
was kind of lost in the broadcast because once Colbert finished, they kind of ended this segment.

761
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:28,460
And, but then, you know, he finished his run. I think he got like a three 35 and then like

762
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:33,180
something he didn't trigger the glitch as fast as you usually get. But he got it. And I saw her,

763
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,300
I saw him walk up to the princess and all that. So he triggered the ending without having to fight

764
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,900
Bowser. So that was pretty cool. And I just thought it was cool. Cause then at the end,

765
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,660
they plugged summer games on quick. So they plugged it on national TV. And I know

766
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:47,500
this marathon has been running for a while every year. They've been making more money,

767
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,740
except for the last awesome gives. They made less money than the previous one, but I think it'd be

768
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:56,540
cool to see what kind of bump summer games gets this year. And I like, I've always followed this

769
01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:02,140
a lot. I actually applied to be, or I guess submitted a run to be on this year's summer

770
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,580
games on quick, but I was rejected, but it was a PT. I was going to try to run.

771
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,020
You're going to keep submitting until you get it though, right?

772
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:10,060
Yeah, I'll keep trying. I don't know if it's a game they would ever want to put on.

773
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:13,340
I almost wanted to like promote it as like, cause I was, I was trying to say like

774
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:20,540
every summer because the S I told you earlier, it's during the awful or during the AGDQ,

775
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,980
they do awful games on quick during the summer. They do silly games on quick starts in S well,

776
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,820
they also do spooky games on quick every summer. And they usually throw a couple of horror games

777
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,300
in there. So I thought, Oh, this would be great compliment. Cause it's so short,

778
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,660
just squeeze it into a spooky games block. But now I'm like, wouldn't it be funny if they did

779
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:40,460
like a slow games done quick. Cause PT kind of falls into that realm of, I hate to say walking

780
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:43,820
simulators, but it's a game where you just pretty much are walking down the hallway, except for one

781
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:50,220
short segment where you're going fast. But I've also seen speed runs on games like, uh, uh, gone

782
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:53,740
home. You can beat in under a minute. Yeah. Gone home is another one. I was playing when I was

783
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,020
waiting for the grand theft auto installation. I actually played gone home on PlayStation four and

784
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:01,340
I re there's a trophy for beating it in under a minute. And I was like, why you can beat the game

785
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:05,420
in a minute? And I let you go home. You're like, all right, I'm done. No. If you know,

786
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:11,180
I mean, spoiler alert, but if you know where the secret door is, where the key to the attic is,

787
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,940
which you usually find throughout the discovery, you get kind of get clues to where the secret

788
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,820
door is. But if you know where it is, you just go right to it, grab the key to the attic,

789
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,420
go to the attic, get the diary and end the game. And you can be, uh, everyone's gone to the rapture

790
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:26,060
in like a minute because there's a glitch you can do. If you kind of like jump and twirl around

791
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:30,380
near the start, you can jump a fence. And actually where you start is really close to the place where

792
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:38,700
you start switches tonight and then you walk up and do the final cut scene. So you can do that.

793
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:43,020
So I was like, Oh, that'd be fun if they did a block of slow games done quick. The S thing,

794
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,780
they're games that are typically slow. Uh, until Dawn is another game where you pretty much walk

795
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:50,700
the whole game and there's some glitches in that good game. I don't think you could speed run that.

796
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:56,460
Tiger watch. Yeah. Tiger con chat says you think they will ever do a winner games done quick.

797
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:01,500
That is awesome. That is awesome. Games is in the winter. Awesome. Games happens every January. So

798
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,740
we're speed running until Dawn. Do you just kill everybody off? Uh, there's different categories.

799
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:08,780
There are categories for saving everyone. It's just like every speed run. There's categories.

800
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,140
There's any percent and there's, you know, all the, any percent, it doesn't matter what happens.

801
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,780
Usually that's the most popular category in any speed run. Uh, so yeah. So yeah, I looked at the

802
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:21,980
schedule. I think it's a pretty cool, you know, uh, marathon this year. I kind of like how they're

803
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:26,060
ending it with super Mario RPG. They've, they've typically ended either with the final fantasy

804
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:30,620
game or I think a couple of times they've ended with Corona trigger. So this time,

805
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:34,060
and I think one time did they end with the Metroid race? I don't know. I don't think they ever have.

806
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,740
I think you've always ended with an RPG. Yeah. Metroid's like right before it's usually much

807
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:41,100
as right for it. It is again this year. It's like they don't match rated because it's the

808
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:46,620
big moneymaker to be fair though. Super Mario RPG is another square. Super Nintendo is true.

809
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:52,220
So it does kind of fit. That's the thing. It just came out recently. Yeah. So Nintendo,

810
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:55,340
they set this a while ago though. They set the schedule a long time ago, which I think is kind

811
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,780
of funny. I think it's just a coincidence. I don't think it's because of that, but yeah.

812
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:04,540
Hey, you never know. Nintendo may be looking at it going bump that up or something. Yeah.

813
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,860
I don't see anything really great on there, but the one game that stuck out to me,

814
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:15,020
I think it's during their silly block is a bubble ghost because that's a game boy game that I had

815
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,980
for game boy. It's so cute. I see. I didn't see that. Yeah. What I kind of like about the marathon

816
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:25,420
is I discover games that I either never heard of or barely heard of or just wouldn't even think

817
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:29,180
about watching. And I see them and they're really funny. Like, you know, I actually discovered,

818
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:35,740
uh, roundabout on there and I thought that was so good. And I first saw it on, uh, games on quick.

819
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:39,740
And then I went and I bought it. I was like, let me look at this game. And it happened to be on

820
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,500
sale when I looked it up. It's like, I'm going to buy that. So I bought that right away. And, uh,

821
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,100
gosh, what was that Western game they did? Yeah. I was just thinking about that. I don't know what

822
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:52,460
really bad, but hilarious, like old, old PC Western game, the teaser classic game of the week.

823
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:57,340
I saw that one as well on there. And so we'll see more of that later. But, um, yeah, there's,

824
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:01,420
I, that's, that's why the scene, the schedule doesn't really bother me. You see the ones that

825
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,780
are there that are always there. The mega man games is of course the Metroid race and all

826
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:11,580
that stuff. The Mario block is always, I love the Mario 64, like the, the minimum stars run,

827
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,100
whatever that is. I love that every time I watch, I love watching them run backwards.

828
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,100
So I'm, I'm a big portal runs. Yeah. The portal runs are good. I don't think those are on this

829
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,660
year. I saw, I saw with a tear in my eye, the spooky games block. It's not much of a block.

830
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,300
It looks like, I don't know if there's a scheduling issue, but it looks like they broke

831
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,660
up the games cause they're doing the amnesia on one night and the next night they're doing like

832
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,260
silent Hill three and like resident evil. Maybe they just don't think amnesia is scary.

833
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:38,940
Spooky games like near Halloween or anything like that. No, no, no. They just have a spooky block

834
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:43,500
during the summer. Cause of the, yes. You know, uh, they just, they usually, you know, confine

835
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,620
it to sometime after midnight and they throw those in there. The block that amnesia is in,

836
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:53,260
it has like Wolfenstein and Dishonored too. So maybe it's some sort of like first person.

837
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:57,340
I think that's part of a first person block. Yeah. But it may, and maybe the guy that runs it,

838
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,700
it looks like the person that runs silent Hill three is the exact same person. Yeah. Running

839
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,980
resident evil two. So the spooky games block, so to speak, it's just silent Hill three resident

840
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:10,220
evil two and little big planet and little big planet. That could be spooky. Yes. Um,

841
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:14,620
I do want to point this out. It's kind of related is that humble bundle tends to do a themed

842
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:19,180
bundle for the, um, summer games, no quick and awesome ways to quick. They just released the

843
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,980
summer games bundle. Um, but what's interesting about it is that the minimum is 15. There is no

844
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:28,460
games that you just get for like a dollar. So you have to pay at least 15 or more there. It's, it's,

845
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:34,300
I think it's some you kind of seen before, like super meat boy and VVVVV, which I mean are great

846
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:39,260
games, but they're kind of in every pack, but there's also, I have like most of these, uh,

847
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:44,300
there's serious Sam, double DX XL and serious Sam, the random encounter. There's freedom planet,

848
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:49,420
escape goat to Guacamelee and dust forest DX. So the other games that I'm pretty sure I have

849
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:55,340
almost all of these with the exception of maybe escape go to with the rest. I know I have,

850
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:58,380
yeah, I don't. Are these all games that are actually featured this year? They're not

851
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,140
featured this year. I don't see them are maybe meat boy is that's, that one's a pretty mean,

852
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:06,460
that's a mainstay. I think it might not be VVVV maybe. I don't think that one is on this year.

853
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:10,220
I didn't see that one, but I thought I saw meat boy. Now that I'm more awakened, looking at this

854
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:19,020
list, there looks to be a, like a Disney Capcom, any S block that block looks like DuckTales.

855
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:25,100
Disney's little mermaid, Mickey mouse, capade. They almost always do a Disney block. Ship

856
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,860
and Dale rescue Rangers too. Oh yeah. Rescue Rangers too. That's the way. Yeah. Like I want

857
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:34,060
to watch that. All right. I can't because I'll be, I've had it on all day. Like it started at

858
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:37,340
10 AM. It's been on that. It's probably still play. Well, you know, it's probably not playing

859
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:42,460
now because Catherine just started and my wife hates that case. I hate that game. So

860
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:47,260
you hate it cause it has sheep when she was pregnant with our son, I believe I was playing

861
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:51,820
it like crazy and she just was, you know, anything she relates to all that sickness for me and

862
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:56,380
pregnancy. She's just like, I don't like it. Except Taco Bell. Well yeah, she still is Taco Bell.

863
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:59,900
Isn't it like a puzzle game or something? It is pretty much a puzzle game. Yeah. But there's also

864
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:06,460
like a whole, like a dating SIM almost thing in the middle of it or not really a SIM, but there's

865
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:09,740
like, when you go to the bar, there's like all these social things you have to do. And that

866
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:15,020
unlocks kind of how the story unfolds. Beating the puzzles is one thing, but yeah, I played on

867
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:18,460
easy mode cause I, I'm not good at those puzzles, but I beat the game and it was really fun. I

868
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:23,740
thought, but yeah, it was, it was weird. He had really good anime cut scenes and what's

869
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:27,180
interesting about that run, which I have to watch it later because I do actually want to watch it

870
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:32,380
because the guy who's running it is playing co-op mode, but he's playing it himself with two

871
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:36,780
controllers. So it's one player with two controllers. That's awesome. I'm like, that sounds

872
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:41,660
amazing. So I wish I got one of his controllers is a fight stick. Okay. So that makes it easier then.

873
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:45,660
Wow. I didn't see that. See, I haven't seen it. So Shane's watching it right now. One controller is

874
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:52,380
a dance pad. That'd be cool. That'd be awesome. All right. Let's, let's move on with some other

875
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:56,620
news. I'm sure a lot of people are multitasking with the summer games done quick, but they do,

876
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,860
they put everything on YouTube anyway. So if you miss something.

877
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:02,060
Yeah. They're really good archiving. If you, if you don't watch it on YouTube,

878
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:05,420
sometimes you take a little longer. Are you that one? You're not getting picked up. Oh,

879
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:08,220
sorry. You might not be like, no, just, just right then.

880
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:14,780
Okay. Anyway. Yeah. They, uh, if you go on, uh, usually the Reddit thread that references

881
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:21,180
summer games on quick, they'll usually have links to the, what I want to say, like the time code,

882
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:27,580
the splits or whatever in their Twitch stream. That's faster way to see the archives. If you

883
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:32,780
don't want to wait for YouTube and if you're new to it, I highly suggest watching any of the relays

884
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:37,420
because the relays are always fun. There's, they did a donkey Kong country, tropical freeze one

885
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:43,580
today, Canada versus USA. And there's a super Mario maker blind custom team relay race,

886
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:47,740
which they did that in, uh, awesome games. And that was really fun to watch.

887
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:51,020
And so they'll be doing it again. And also don't forget it is for charity.

888
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:55,420
So donate to the French doctors without borders. I don't know what that is.

889
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:00,860
It's doctors borders, but they're, they're like, uh, things in French. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know

890
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:06,220
that many sounds on frontiers or whatever. I don't speak French, obviously. Wow. You sound

891
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:10,620
like me trying to do Japanese release dates. That's great. All right. Uh, let's get to some

892
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:14,300
other news though, for a time. Cause we, uh, are running a little long, but that's all right. Uh,

893
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:21,820
Loki. So there's a key reseller, um, G2A, which most people don't like because they're also known

894
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:27,420
for people that, you know, they hack people's accounts and steal codes or, you know,

895
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:33,260
fraudulently obtain keys and resell them on their market. Um, but now, Hey, they're trying to get

896
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:41,340
on the good side of developers by offering up to a 10% royalty and for keys sold on their platform.

897
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:46,860
However, it is up to the developers to set that royalty, which will be applied on top of the

898
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:52,620
prices set by third party sellers. And in order for the developers to take advantage of that,

899
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:59,980
they need to partner with the site. So they will need to register their products with G2A

900
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:08,460
and acknowledge owned intellectual property in games. Hmm. Um, yeah. In fact, I mean,

901
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,700
there's been some developers that have come out and said basically, Hey, we'd rather you

902
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:17,500
pirate our game than the purchase from this website. They're not very liked.

903
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:23,180
No, they're not. Well, I mean, yeah, there's, there's, you know, allegedly stolen credit cards.

904
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:28,140
I don't think it's alleged be like they have had instances where people have purchased stuff off

905
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:35,340
of that site and it's been with a stolen account and the keys get revoked. So you just gotta be

906
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:42,140
aware or, you know, wary of where you purchase things. Yeah. I don't know if that's a site that

907
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:45,740
can really redeem itself. And were there ones that were also like reselling the humble bundle

908
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:49,900
keys and stuff like that? Was that them? The dollar keys? I want to say it was them. I don't

909
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:56,540
know. That's shady too, though. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange

910
01:15:56,540 --> 01:16:03,500
Andradeo at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SOFA. All right. Well, uh, let's move on to

911
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:07,820
something. Uh, I know I'm really looking forward to it because I love this series of games. Um,

912
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:13,180
and that's Diablo. And apparently, uh, there's rumblings that there is something new coming

913
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:18,060
out in the Diablo universe, which in a way is kind of a duh because, you know,

914
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:22,460
Blizzard just released Overwatch and they're, they've got Heroes of the Storm going and

915
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:25,660
Hearthstone, which, you know, they're still supporting those games. World of Warcraft

916
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:30,140
has an expansion that's just about to come out. So what's left? Starcraft and Diablo. Well,

917
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:36,380
Starcraft 2 just kind of, they just finished that trilogy, right? That, that last game, uh,

918
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:40,860
what the hell is it? There was the Heart of the Void Swarm. Wings of Liberty or something.

919
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:46,060
Whatever the last one. Starcraft something of something. That just came out not that long ago.

920
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:50,220
And so Diablo is kind of the game that hasn't seen a little love in a couple of years. Um,

921
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:55,580
because, well, they had the expansion for Diablo 3 or the game that fixed Diablo 3,

922
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:01,900
Reaper of Souls, but then that's kind of it. And if you've played the game and you beat,

923
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:06,940
uh, Reaper of Souls, you kind of know that the game is wide open for another expansion.

924
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,740
And so it seems very likely that this is going to happen, but, uh, apparently a Blizzard's

925
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:18,860
career page now has a job posting relating to the future of Diablo. It's a game director to lead the

926
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:25,020
quote, unannounced project for Diablo. It's just talking about leading the Diablo series into the

927
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:30,140
future. So it is showing up, uh, on their jobs page. They're definitely still recruiting for

928
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:34,700
Diablo's future. I think this is much more than just patches because they're still, I mean,

929
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:39,580
they're doing seasons in Diablo, they're doing patches, but you know, it's that, that, that's

930
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:45,580
starting to run out of steam. Like I love Diablo. I played this season long enough to get the banner

931
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:51,260
and the rewards. And then I stopped, like I haven't been hitting it as hard as I did some of

932
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:56,940
the previous seasons. So, um, I'm assuming it'll be another expansion and not a Diablo 4. Diablo

933
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:02,540
4 is going to take a lot of time, but, uh, we'll see. What if it's some sort of like competition

934
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:06,780
game since that's what all their games are now at this point? Well, I'd be, I don't see how Diablo

935
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:11,660
really works in that universe. They, they technically, there is a PVP mode in Diablo.

936
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:15,980
It's just, they kind of just threw it away. I mean, there's, you can't really do a lot with

937
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:22,460
it to be honest. Did they actually put anything you got put in it? You, you can enter, uh, with

938
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,460
a friend of yours and there's an MPC that you can talk to and you can go to a Coliseum where you can

939
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:30,620
like kick each other's butt, but that's it. Like there's no matchmaking. There's originally,

940
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,460
they said there was going to be an arena in Diablo. That's never happened. None of that's there.

941
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:38,540
There's just, you can go and you can BBB, but I think a good thing to put in the next expansion,

942
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:43,420
if that's what they're working on that, that might be it. Who knows? So, uh, we'll see.

943
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:49,420
I would assume though that there's going to be, you know, uh, a new act, a new class,

944
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:54,300
you know, uh, 10 more levels, all that stuff too. But yeah, we'll see. Shane, what do you have for

945
01:18:54,300 --> 01:19:00,460
us? I have Pokemon. So, um, for the past few weeks, the Pokemon company has been teasing

946
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:07,820
that we were going to get some new news on July 1st, but some crazy thing happened. And, uh,

947
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:16,460
the morning, early, early morning of June 30th on YouTube, there were leaks for random Pokemon.

948
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:20,140
Couldn't tell if they were real or not, but they came from a Russian something or other,

949
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:25,580
cause it looked like, like a Russian ESRB sort of, uh, splash screen at the beginning,

950
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:31,500
but they were real. And so we got seven new Pokemon. We got a fish that looks like a drag

951
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:39,500
queen named Bruxish. We got an adorable, uh, bee fly named Cutiefly. We have an old grandpa dragon

952
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:49,340
named Drampa. We have the Pikachu clone for the new, uh, region, uh, Togedemaru. We have Grubbin's

953
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:54,620
evolution, uh, charge a bug, which looks like to me a bus. And I think it's adorable, but it's

954
01:19:54,620 --> 01:20:00,140
apparently a battery, whatever. Uh, and that evolves into a Vic Viper looking thing from

955
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:08,300
Gradius called Vikavolt. Um, and then we also finally got the English names. Oh yeah,

956
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:14,220
the English names for the koala Pokemon called Komala and the puppy Pokemon called Rockruff.

957
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:20,300
And then finally we got a, um, what we kind of guess might be a legendary, um, for one of the

958
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:28,220
islands that you start on. Um, his name is, uh, Tapu Koko. It's awesome. I mean, the Vikavolt

959
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:33,500
thing seriously looks like Vic Viper from Gradius. It's really cool. Rockruff is a really cute name.

960
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:40,300
It's adorable. It's my, like, we didn't have any footage in what they gave us on, on the first,

961
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:47,980
but at the Hong Kong nationals, uh, they showed the first in-game footage of Komala and Rockruff,

962
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:55,820
and I will have all the plush toys of Rockruff possible. Now you, you said that there was like

963
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:59,820
a Pikachu clone in this game. What was the name of the Pikachu clone? Togedemaru. But it's not,

964
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:04,380
it's not Pikachu. No, every, um... It looks more like a Marill to me than a Pikachu. Every

965
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:12,300
generation has an electric Pokemon, like, in the same vein as Pikachu. So, and we had Pikachu in

966
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,780
the first generation. We had its pre-evolution in the second, Pichu. Then we had Plusle in

967
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:23,100
mine and in the third. We had Prachirisu in the fourth, Emolga in fifth, and then Dedenne in the

968
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:29,100
sixth, and now the Steel Electric. I think it's actually a Hedgehog. It has little spikes,

969
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:34,860
and it's a Steel Electric. It's super cute. I would like a plush toy of that as well.

970
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:39,100
Actually, there are a lot of these I want plush toys of. Not the Drag Queen Fish, though.

971
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:44,620
I'm okay with it, but it's kind of frightening, and, uh, I don't know.

972
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:48,380
Fifth Dream in chat at live.bogonetwork.com says,

973
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:53,340
Beautyfly and Cutiefly should get married. Do you ship Pokemon?

974
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:56,860
No. I was just curious. Well, ditto in everything when I'm making eggs.

975
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,980
When you made 5,000 oshawott in your quest to get a shiny one.

976
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:10,460
Yes, five years of hatching oshawott. So many people got winter coats because of that.

977
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,500
All right, we're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games

978
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,620
that you can play a lot sooner than Shane can play Pokemon Sun and Moon.

979
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:19,340
Why would you have to rub that in?

980
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,460
Because it makes me feel better because you're mean.

981
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,220
All right, Loki, what's coming out of the US this week?

982
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:29,180
We have Fury, which is coming out on PC and PlayStation 4. It's also part of

983
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:35,500
the PlayStation Network, you know, the free games that you get for PlayStation Plus.

984
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,740
So that'll be coming out this week.

985
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:42,060
Mega Dimension Neptunia 7. That's on PC.

986
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:46,860
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 13 on PC and PlayStation 4.

987
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,220
The Banner Saga 2 is coming to PlayStation 4.

988
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,700
Inside on PC.

989
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:57,980
Carmageddon max damage on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

990
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,980
And Hawken on PlayStation 4.

991
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,340
Carmageddon's coming back?

992
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,780
Yeah, they got a new Carmageddon.

993
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,260
All right.

994
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:07,340
And it's very offensive to people because they've got, you know,

995
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:10,940
people in wheelchairs and stuff that you're destroying.

996
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,120
Wow.

997
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,020
All right.

998
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:19,180
Traveling over to Japan and checking out what's coming out on the PlayStation 4 over there.

999
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:24,140
This week on July 7th, you can get price reductions on Tales of Zestiria

1000
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,540
and Sengoku Basara for Sumogari.

1001
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:32,380
There is a new game called Shin Hairagami 2 comes out this week in Japan.

1002
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:38,300
It looks like it might be like a mystery anime type of thing that is based on.

1003
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,780
So that's what you have to look forward to on the PlayStation 4.

1004
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,740
Uh, I don't believe the Wii U has anything this week.

1005
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:50,460
Oh no, they are getting a, um, like a Splatoon bundle with the system in Japan.

1006
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:53,820
It's like, I guess that's Splatoon, but it has the new Amiibo with it.

1007
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,380
So that is...

1008
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:56,060
I forgot that's coming out pretty soon.

1009
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,180
Those Amiibo, aren't they?

1010
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:59,180
In Japan, we're out this week.

1011
01:23:59,180 --> 01:23:59,900
One week?

1012
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:00,400
Yes.

1013
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,460
So that makes sense that we would be getting...

1014
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,900
Squid Sisters and Recolors.

1015
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,700
Very soon as well.

1016
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:10,540
That Shin Hairagami 2 comes out on the PlayStation Vita as well.

1017
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,100
And then lastly on the 3DS this week.

1018
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:16,460
Ooh, Cold Sept Revolt comes out on the 3DS.

1019
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,020
I...

1020
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:20,620
This is one of those games that I really wish had done better in the US.

1021
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:23,420
It's like a trading card game meets Monopoly.

1022
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:24,700
I think these games are rad.

1023
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,700
They're like, they're really hard to master and I'm really terrible at them,

1024
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:29,660
but they're fun to play.

1025
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,860
But I don't think the series did very well here.

1026
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,140
So I highly doubt this game.

1027
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:38,700
I'd have to import this game if I want to play it and play it on Shane's Japanese 3DS.

1028
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:42,140
But since I can't read Japanese, I'm not going to do me a lick of good.

1029
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:42,860
But if you're a Cold Sept...

1030
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:46,700
And that's a Pokemon 3DS that only plays Pokemon, really.

1031
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,780
So nothing else can go in there.

1032
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:53,180
When he's not looking, I'll grab it and put Cold Sept in there.

1033
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:55,980
It's also blue, so you have to pry it from my dead hand.

1034
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:59,500
I tainted your 3DS with another game series.

1035
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:01,500
All right, how about the UK?

1036
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:05,740
I believe Flaco Jones is filling in for the UK releases this week.

1037
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,180
Yeah, I got it right here.

1038
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:10,300
The first game is a PC game I've never heard of called Bum Rush.

1039
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,620
So that sounds weird.

1040
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,500
Like maybe it's a sequel to that Raptor butt.

1041
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:19,500
What I was going to say is the American version called Butt Rush because they call them bums.

1042
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:25,180
Anyway, that's on July 6th and July 7th.

1043
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,060
PC game Inside.

1044
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,540
That's the Xbox game that we have over here, right?

1045
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:31,740
Is it also on PC over here?

1046
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,780
Everything is on Xbox and PC now, right?

1047
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:35,900
Yeah, it was on PC over.

1048
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:40,700
Yeah, anyway, I heard about that from Extifer actually, and he said it's really awesome.

1049
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:41,820
I think he only played the beginning.

1050
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:44,940
And then Lion's Song on PC, also July 7th.

1051
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,860
All right, that's it for Europe.

1052
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:50,380
That's it, that's all I got.

1053
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:51,820
There's just a couple more stories for you guys,

1054
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:54,540
then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

1055
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,500
But first, Loki.

1056
01:25:56,220 --> 01:26:01,180
All right, so we got some cool news regarding upcoming movies.

1057
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:04,300
I'm pretty excited about the sequel, The Wreck-It Ralph,

1058
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,620
which will be coming out in 2018.

1059
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,420
And yeah, they haven't really said...

1060
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:14,220
Oh, March 9th, 2018 is when that'll be coming out.

1061
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,260
Nice to have that confirmed,

1062
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:20,300
even though I think some of the voice actors had already spilled that they were working on it.

1063
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,180
Right, yeah.

1064
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:25,500
And then the live-action Minecraft movie has a release date now as well.

1065
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:31,340
And that's coming out May 24th, 2019.

1066
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,820
I still can't believe that's being directed by the guy from It's Always Sunny.

1067
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,340
Yeah, yeah.

1068
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,900
I don't know, like, I don't know that it sounds awesome.

1069
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,020
It's Mac, it's Mac, yeah.

1070
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,340
Yeah, it sounds incredibly awesome.

1071
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:43,740
I just...

1072
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:45,900
I'm curious to see what's going on.

1073
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:51,180
I mean, Marvel gets a lot of guys that aren't necessarily super experienced at the big budget

1074
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:51,580
movies.

1075
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:52,700
I think it'll be great.

1076
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,500
So Marvel gets to get a bunch of guys from TV to do their movies.

1077
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,980
I just can't imagine a live-action Minecraft.

1078
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:58,940
I have no idea.

1079
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,300
But hey, you mean the live-out?

1080
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,380
I think it's supposed to be CG.

1081
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,540
Like, I thought it was supposed to be like a CG movie.

1082
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,900
It probably has a lot of CG.

1083
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,660
If they pulled off that Minecraft story mode, like, it's gonna be like that.

1084
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:12,540
Minecraft story mode was, like, done with, like, in-game graphics.

1085
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:15,580
Like, I can't imagine a live-action movie, like, with people.

1086
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:16,700
I don't see that.

1087
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:20,380
Like, it has to be, like, an animated movie.

1088
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:22,620
Or, like, some kind of combination or something like that.

1089
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,300
Speaking of which, I really want to see the Lego Batman movie when that comes out.

1090
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,820
Yeah, that trailer was hilarious.

1091
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:28,320
I love it.

1092
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,880
All right, um...

1093
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,400
Going back to Wreck-It Ralph 2 really quick.

1094
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,200
Yeah, go for it.

1095
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,640
Does anybody else, like, think it's kind of...

1096
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,800
I mean, I haven't read any of the details on it.

1097
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,480
But the image is him, like, over all these, like, internet parody sites.

1098
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,560
Like, they have Google, but spelled with a U.

1099
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,000
So is he just invading the internet?

1100
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:44,500
Like, Google?

1101
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,520
Is it not gonna be so...

1102
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,320
Well, yeah, but it has, like, a thing over it.

1103
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,200
I don't know.

1104
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,320
Anyway, so, yeah, I was like, so is he just gonna be going...

1105
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,520
Is it not really gonna be about gaming?

1106
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,280
Is it just gonna be about him invading the internet?

1107
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,280
Or is it gonna be on a gaming app?

1108
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:57,920
Like, I don't know.

1109
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,520
It's all browser games.

1110
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,960
I just hope it doesn't get too far away from the video game thing.

1111
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,800
I know the first movie kind of did that, but...

1112
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,720
It could be more contemporary games, as opposed to, like, throwback references.

1113
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:09,440
But, yeah.

1114
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,480
Shiny, yay.

1115
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,800
Well, they still were pretty contemporary.

1116
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,600
I mean, they have, like, a Call of Duty-type parody and Mario Kart and that type of stuff.

1117
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:17,840
True.

1118
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,320
Yeah.

1119
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,720
By the way, I'm surprised he didn't make me play the breaking news bumper.

1120
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,600
No, because I was like, I have to say it now.

1121
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,280
I didn't have time for a breaking news...

1122
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,280
It's an Ivysaur, so it's cool.

1123
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,680
Anyway, that was the only thing that kind of concerned me.

1124
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,280
I was like, oh, I do want to see more Wreck-It Ralph,

1125
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:36,240
but I hope it's not just, I don't know, him just invading different websites or whatever.

1126
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:39,280
Did they announce who's, like, signed on for it so far?

1127
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,880
I think it's the original cast that's coming back.

1128
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,160
Like, all of them?

1129
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,080
I guess there'd be, like, four real ones.

1130
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,880
It's not a huge cast, but I'm pretty sure all the main, all the principles...

1131
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,120
Yeah, Sarah Silverman doesn't have a TV show anymore.

1132
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:51,920
She's, what's she doing?

1133
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,400
Well, on the poster, it's him and Sarah Silverman's character, right?

1134
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,160
So, I'm sure they got the two mains back.

1135
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,080
And I'm sure they'll also get Jack McBrayer.

1136
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,000
Yeah, what, 30 Rock's been cancelled for years?

1137
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:00,640
What's he doing?

1138
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,480
He just does Conan bits now.

1139
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,240
Does he really? That's it?

1140
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:07,120
He makes cameos as that same guy, like, for the rest of his life.

1141
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,640
That's because he is that guy.

1142
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,880
Jane Lynch, what she did, does she still host the Hollywood Game Night thing,

1143
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,000
or did that cancel?

1144
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,400
I stopped watching it, but I was watching it.

1145
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,520
But I think that's still going.

1146
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,840
I think they just drop it in whenever they got room on the NBC schedule,

1147
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:22,640
because it's cheap to produce.

1148
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,840
You'd think I'd be more excited about game shows making this huge comeback on TV,

1149
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:26,560
and I guess I am.

1150
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,680
But, you know, Sunday night is now when they've got Family Feud,

1151
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,080
$100,000 pyramid match game are all on Sunday night.

1152
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,400
And everything I'm hearing about match game is that it's really good.

1153
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,360
I know I need to watch it.

1154
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,840
I didn't watch it last week because all games are and stuff, but yeah.

1155
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,040
Yeah, so anyway.

1156
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:44,480
Well, maybe one reason I don't watch as much TV is because I'm watching live streaming.

1157
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,880
And, you know, a lot of that is probably coming from Twitch.

1158
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,640
But if you have ever streamed from your PlayStation 4,

1159
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,960
you know that you have several options when it comes to live streaming.

1160
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,000
You can stream.

1161
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,440
You can do YouTube live as well now, right, on PlayStation 4.

1162
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,080
Yes, you can.

1163
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,600
Is Daily Motion live or is that just an export video thing?

1164
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,160
I don't know.

1165
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,000
But I don't think they have a live component.

1166
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,320
Ustream is the other one that you can stream to, but not for much longer.

1167
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,800
Sony is going to be revoking support for the Ustream service,

1168
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,600
and that's going to end on August 1st, 2016.

1169
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,840
So this means that you will no longer even be able to view the Ustream stuff

1170
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,720
from live from PlayStation or the Vita or anything.

1171
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,080
Does anyone still use Ustream?

1172
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,440
I think that's probably why.

1173
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,840
Well, yeah, there's no reason for the termination.

1174
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,960
Maybe there's some contract agreement or something like that.

1175
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,000
I wonder if it has to do with the fact that Ustream is the only network

1176
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,320
that will accept the Playroom anymore.

1177
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,280
And that's where...

1178
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,840
Remember when PlayStation 4 streaming first started?

1179
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,320
Playroom was hilarious when it first started.

1180
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,400
That was where you would see the nastiest shit was on those Playroom streams.

1181
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,040
Funniest.

1182
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,840
And they're still kind of like trash if you go in there and look.

1183
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,080
Come on, they're doing strange shit now on Twitch, too.

1184
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,560
I read something where they're like watching people eat.

1185
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,880
Yeah, that's funny.

1186
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,640
What I learned from watching Playroom on there, other than the obvious stuff,

1187
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:07,520
was that everybody that does that on there has a long couch.

1188
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,000
One of those ones that does the corner couches that takes up the entire living room,

1189
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,160
and they always have a big dog wing on it.

1190
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:18,720
Every time, there's always a big long corner couch and a big old dog sitting on the end,

1191
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,000
and there's whatever going on.

1192
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,440
They're smoking and doing whatever.

1193
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,760
I'll never forget the night I got the PlayStation 4,

1194
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,080
and I think Shane was living here or something at the time,

1195
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,320
and was like watching, we were just watching some of the streams,

1196
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,880
and like some chick just took her top off, right?

1197
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,040
And like, this is awesome.

1198
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,320
Shane was just horrified.

1199
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,680
And I was laughing so hard that I was like crying because I'm like,

1200
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,640
oh my God, these people are drunk and they're going to regret this.

1201
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,160
Yeah, people are always drunk, too.

1202
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,000
I remember.

1203
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:45,680
All right.

1204
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,040
So yeah, no more you stream.

1205
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,280
So sadly, this means the end of the play.

1206
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:56,960
I feel like there ought to be like one more like great Ustream dumpster fire stream day.

1207
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,160
Looks like that's on you, Rob.

1208
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,520
On the last day of July.

1209
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:00,800
Fire it up.

1210
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:07,760
They should just offer streaming for the game or playroom to Chatterbait instead now.

1211
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,600
You know, you think Pornhub ought to get on this, right?

1212
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,080
I'm sure Sony wants that partnership.

1213
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:14,960
I mean, I know.

1214
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,720
I'm assuming.

1215
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:18,400
What doesn't Pornhub have?

1216
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,080
They do have a lot of affiliate sites.

1217
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:20,960
They probably own them.

1218
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,560
I mean, I think the most hilarious thing I saw was that screenshot from

1219
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:31,280
Pornhub that said something like hot British blonde fucks 15 million people all at once.

1220
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,040
And it's that guy talking about the Brexit.

1221
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:35,840
That was funny.

1222
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,960
Anyway, let's let's you know what?

1223
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,160
Let's go to a simpler time.

1224
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:44,640
Let's take a step back into a time when we didn't we didn't have streaming pornography.

1225
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:48,000
If you wanted to if you wanted pornography, you had to wait for like

1226
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:54,480
the lingerie catalogs to get delivered in the mail or a dirty magazine because there

1227
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,920
was no such thing as streaming pornography.

1228
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,000
It's a simple time where we take a step back and look at a classic video game.

1229
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,240
And usually Dark Sakura will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks

1230
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,600
is worthy of your attention.

1231
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,360
However, she's not here this week.

1232
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,040
So we have an OLR first, I believe.

1233
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,440
I don't think this has ever been done before.

1234
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:20,000
We have a joint choice for Classic Game of the Week between Flaco, Jones and Shane have

1235
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,720
both yet.

1236
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:25,360
And I'll have you know that I did petition for a certain game, but was unfortunately

1237
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,880
denied despite the fact that we had a perfect scenario here.

1238
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,000
So blame it on all them.

1239
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:31,760
Tough.

1240
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,080
What is the classic game of the week?

1241
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,040
Flaco and Shane.

1242
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,960
We didn't even rehearse how we're going to do.

1243
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,400
No, we really didn't talk.

1244
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,080
So you go, Shane.

1245
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,440
I talked last on UK.

1246
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,200
So, OK, I'll say the name of the title.

1247
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,480
Totally rad for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1248
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:54,560
Oh, there's the music from 1990 Japan and in Europe in 1991 in North America.

1249
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,280
Yeah.

1250
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:00,160
I like how the release date, at least on the wiki, says that Europe just got it in 1990.

1251
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,440
It's not more specific.

1252
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,240
Yeah, that's funny.

1253
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,320
Sometime in 1990, they got it.

1254
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,520
This nebulous year.

1255
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:09,520
All right.

1256
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,960
So what are we talking about?

1257
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:11,440
I don't know.

1258
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:15,280
I first found out about this game on Games Done Quick.

1259
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,360
And I think it was Awful Games Done Quick.

1260
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,520
Did I say that we should watch it?

1261
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,160
Because this is a game from my.

1262
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,760
We always watch the Awful Games Done Quick.

1263
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,200
And you had actually said you played this game.

1264
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:25,600
Yeah, yeah.

1265
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,200
This is a game from my childhood.

1266
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,760
I played the heck out of this game when I was younger.

1267
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,680
And I remember it being really fun.

1268
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,520
But my memory was clearly tainted.

1269
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,560
Or I was just remembering the dialogue.

1270
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,560
Because when we watched it on Awful Games Done Quick, it was pretty awful.

1271
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,000
It's a terrible game.

1272
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,240
But the cutscenes alone, I think Rob's watching them right now, are so hilarious.

1273
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,680
It's what makes it a classic game.

1274
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,200
So we don't have to respect the guys giving the week this week.

1275
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,880
You can all rip on it and say how terrible it is.

1276
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,160
Yeah, it's not a good game.

1277
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:58,800
We are literally picking this because it is a funny, funny, funny dialogue.

1278
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,000
Dark Soccer does not always pick games that she thinks are good.

1279
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,480
That's true.

1280
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,840
She just thinks they're noteworthy.

1281
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,000
Yes.

1282
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,400
So you can go for this game.

1283
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,080
Maybe you guys should read some dialogue.

1284
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,760
Well, no, we'll do that.

1285
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,360
Yeah, let's talk about what it is.

1286
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,960
Talk about what it is and you can describe it.

1287
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,640
So it's just a somewhat typical side scroller.

1288
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,760
You play as Jake in the American version.

1289
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:28,560
And basically, you know this crazy magician guy who's training you to use magic.

1290
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,400
And all of a sudden, your girlfriend gets kidnapped.

1291
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,600
And other people get kidnapped.

1292
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,200
And you're on a quest to save them all.

1293
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,640
In Japan, it was called Magic John.

1294
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:41,840
I don't know why we didn't keep that name.

1295
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,880
It's pretty good.

1296
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,680
I'm going to assume it has to do with the basketball player Magic Johnson, who they

1297
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,960
didn't want confusion.

1298
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:49,680
I don't know.

1299
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,440
I just thought it's not a magic toilet.

1300
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,800
I guess that would make sense why they would change it.

1301
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,600
Just a lucky guess.

1302
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,080
And he is learning magic in the game, in the plot of the game.

1303
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:56,400
Yeah.

1304
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,040
From Zebediah, who has a P on his hat.

1305
01:35:59,040 --> 01:35:59,200
Yeah.

1306
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,400
Which stands for Zebediah.

1307
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:00,720
Yeah.

1308
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,720
To Zebediah, the P-acyllic.

1309
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,680
And it's not a very good game.

1310
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,360
You get different power-ups, so you can become like an eagle thing.

1311
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,880
You can become like a lion thing.

1312
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:15,920
It's not good.

1313
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:16,160
Yeah.

1314
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,520
It's like a bad kind of Mega Man-ish rip-off.

1315
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,600
It really does look like shit.

1316
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,200
Like, it gets worse.

1317
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,960
Because you're just looking at the first stage.

1318
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,200
Yeah.

1319
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,120
It gets way, way worse.

1320
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,920
But some of the designs are hilarious.

1321
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,640
There's this punk popcorn boss thing.

1322
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:41,120
It's a stick of corn that's in a late 80s, early 90s biker gang.

1323
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,920
It's got a mohawk and piercings.

1324
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,880
But it is a big ear of corn.

1325
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,320
And this guy right now that's on the video, he's throwing pizzas at you.

1326
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,360
I don't know what they are.

1327
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,800
Maybe they're supposed to be boulders.

1328
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,200
I'm sure the Japanese game makes a lot more sense.

1329
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,880
Because they did not translate it word for word.

1330
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,560
Instead of getting a story, I'm guessing the Japanese had.

1331
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,360
They kind of stuck with the premise.

1332
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:11,520
But all the dialogue is in surfer lingo and late 80s speak.

1333
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,120
And it is so funny.

1334
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,320
Sorry to interrupt, but here it is.

1335
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,680
This is the best line in the game.

1336
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,040
Jake, they're like, stealing me or something.

1337
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:23,360
And that's the female damsel in this dress after she gets kidnapped.

1338
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,400
She says, Jake, they're like, stealing me or something.

1339
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,840
There are so many best lines in this game.

1340
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,800
That's the best line.

1341
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,480
They're like, stealing me or something.

1342
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,040
Wait, wait, wait.

1343
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:31,600
I'm going to count it.

1344
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,640
Because there's a game.

1345
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:34,400
Jake was attacked by surprise.

1346
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,880
Which is like, oh, surprise is attacking me.

1347
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:42,960
There is a fact on Game Facts that just has the dialogue.

1348
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,520
So something that I really like.

1349
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,720
Let me pull it up here.

1350
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,280
And the music right now while you're pulling that up.

1351
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,320
I love this music the most.

1352
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,520
Can you turn this up just a little?

1353
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,920
It's like a weird twist on the circus theme.

1354
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,200
Well, that doesn't sound the same as what I heard yesterday.

1355
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,320
Anyway, it was more like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1356
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,360
Good job, Flago.

1357
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:05,680
I know.

1358
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:06,320
I blew that one.

1359
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,560
But I swear it was different when I listened to it the other day.

1360
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:13,360
So this is the dialogue in Act 2-3 according to the fact I'm reading.

1361
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,320
And I remember this dialogue.

1362
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:18,000
I just don't know if that's the right way to categorize it.

1363
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,160
So the characters are Jake and Allison.

1364
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,080
So it looks like you've already rescued Allison.

1365
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,440
So here's what she says.

1366
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,480
Jake, I'm like, really nervous.

1367
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,240
Because I think that that typo is in the game.

1368
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,000
Like, my dad tried to save me.

1369
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,600
And now they've got him too.

1370
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,280
I don't know what they've done with him.

1371
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,800
Jake, no way.

1372
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,680
He's the gnarliest professor on the coast.

1373
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:42,880
So it's your dad they really want, Allison.

1374
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,440
Jake, I kind of want my dad back, you know?

1375
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,800
Jake, that's totally understandable.

1376
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,400
Wow, how about if I save him?

1377
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,960
He's such a take charge hero.

1378
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,640
I really respect that about him.

1379
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,360
So good.

1380
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,200
I mean, I love this game and the cutscene so much.

1381
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,040
This is like, if you follow me on Twitter,

1382
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:04,240
at Flaco Jones, this is my avatar is Jake from Totally Rad.

1383
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,880
And my name is like Totally Flaco on there.

1384
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,640
So this is like actually the showgirls of video games, it seems.

1385
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:11,280
Probably.

1386
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:11,600
Maybe.

1387
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,160
It's so bad.

1388
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,680
Because the dialogue's so shitty.

1389
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,960
Excuse me, we just talked about how great it was.

1390
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,720
Well, you don't know shit.

1391
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,040
Also, one thing to mention.

1392
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,920
Weirdly enough, when they brought it over also,

1393
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,440
um, the character models in the,

1394
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,240
I guess what you would call cutscenes, look different.

1395
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:35,040
So in the Japanese one, they're very like Japanese animation style.

1396
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,680
But in the American one, I'm guessing in the European one,

1397
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,360
that's really sometime in 1990, according to legends,

1398
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,880
they redid them to look older.

1399
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:51,120
And it's, I guess, just like typical, like, like Allison looks like,

1400
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,640
you know, kind of like she talks like a valley girl.

1401
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,480
She kind of looks like the typical valley girl.

1402
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,160
I don't know about Jake though, his hair's kind of weird.

1403
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,000
I don't know what he's supposed to look like.

1404
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,040
I think it's almost like because it's drawing so much,

1405
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,360
it's almost like they combined Bill and Ted into one person.

1406
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,720
Yeah, yeah, I would say that's an accurate representation.

1407
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,640
Oh, there's the corn cob guy.

1408
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:13,120
Yeah, see, he is an ear of corn that is also like in a biker gang.

1409
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,200
He's got little tight pants on.

1410
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:15,680
It's great.

1411
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:18,560
And high heels.

1412
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:22,800
I think this might, it might be a feminine character, actually.

1413
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:23,280
I don't know.

1414
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,760
No, it's wearing like a vest and nothing else.

1415
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:30,000
What? I don't want to, I don't want to sit here and try to decide.

1416
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,440
Why?

1417
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,040
Were there any of the great lines you can remember?

1418
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,760
I know like there was a point where, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1419
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,800
They, the professor and Allison just show up out of nowhere.

1420
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,680
And Jake's like, how did you get here?

1421
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,680
And they're like, oh, we took the Hollywood freeway.

1422
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,960
Are they in a spaceship or something?

1423
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:45,840
They're underground.

1424
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:46,560
They're underground.

1425
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,360
But in the original game, I believe they're in a spaceship.

1426
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:51,920
That's the other thing.

1427
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:52,480
It's kind of funny.

1428
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,440
They say they're underground.

1429
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,160
It's like, there's really like aliens and stuff involved.

1430
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,600
And it's great.

1431
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,480
And at the end, when Zebediah leaves you, he says, Jake, you've been most excellent.

1432
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,120
By now, you know, I'm one of the underground people.

1433
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,160
I don't know if this is a typo.

1434
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:08,800
A doggy.

1435
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,200
I don't know.

1436
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:10,640
That was the bad guy.

1437
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:10,960
Yeah.

1438
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,920
Has been destroyed.

1439
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,240
So I'm going back, back to my own people, back to my own world.

1440
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,640
You've been a totally decent apprentice.

1441
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,560
Maybe we can do lunch sometime.

1442
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,200
Later, dude.

1443
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,720
And then Jake's like Zebediah, dude.

1444
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,120
Oh yeah.

1445
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,440
And Alison constantly like locks herself in the trunk.

1446
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:35,840
Because she's learning magic as like, like almost like a magician's assistant locking

1447
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:36,800
herself in a trunk.

1448
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,120
Yeah.

1449
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,440
And then he talks about like copacetic.

1450
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1451
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,040
He's like talking here.

1452
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,600
He's like, it's totally tranquil, Alison.

1453
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,160
I love this game.

1454
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,000
So yeah, I think that's, I think that's about it.

1455
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,880
Yeah, that's really it.

1456
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,360
Everybody should go like, you know, watch a let's play.

1457
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:53,600
What?

1458
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,960
No, they should watch the AGDQ version.

1459
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:00,720
Yeah, because they actually, they called it cut scene percentage on AGDQ.

1460
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:04,400
So they didn't, even though it was a speed run, they left all the cut scenes intact so

1461
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:05,360
you could watch them.

1462
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,480
They kind of read along with it.

1463
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,040
Yeah, they do.

1464
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:07,360
Yeah.

1465
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,800
So there's kind of like a laugh track going on.

1466
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:09,440
It's fun.

1467
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:10,000
It's funny.

1468
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,720
I would recommend people watch that because the actual gameplay stuff they get through

1469
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:14,480
quickly and then the cut scenes, they read them.

1470
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:18,480
And you can see how bad the game is because they, they like point out like where like

1471
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,560
it just drops to like one frame a second.

1472
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,200
Basically it's, this is a bad game.

1473
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:28,320
It's a classic classic game of the week.

1474
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,040
Totally rad, which is totally bad.

1475
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,520
And that makes me totally sad.

1476
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,680
Again, you weren't listening to anything we said.

1477
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,960
No, it's bad as in good.

1478
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,640
Cause that's what they said back then.

1479
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:41,920
That's right.

1480
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,320
I can reread that dialogue, Shane.

1481
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:44,820
All right.

1482
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,960
We're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, there is more news to come.

1483
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,400
And there's also some rapid fire news and some emails as well.

1484
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:57,440
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1485
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:10,240
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, July the 3rd of 2016 with episode

1486
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:16,640
number 648 of our show already in progress, joined in studio tonight by our pals, Flaco

1487
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,480
Jones and Shane here in studio.

1488
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:22,480
Of course, myself and Loki not here tonight, Dark Sakura, you know, something I forgot

1489
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,640
to talk about during my gaming week that I did play this week.

1490
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:27,440
Cause I talked about how I went to round one again this week and I was kind of like, Oh,

1491
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,160
music games.

1492
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,120
I'm like 25 again.

1493
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,160
This is so fun.

1494
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:36,880
But one of my pals, um, actually owns at her house, a dance maniacs machine and which was

1495
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:37,840
the classic game of the week.

1496
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,520
Like last week or two weeks ago, last week was, was actually dance maniacs.

1497
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,600
So I actually got to play that game again last week.

1498
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,160
And you know, you know what my impression was after I played the game.

1499
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,320
I want one of those machines.

1500
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,440
Like, I think that is the Bemadi machine I want to have in my house.

1501
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,160
And to be honest, those are really cheap too.

1502
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:56,080
I can't, you gotta help me find one Loki.

1503
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,280
Cause I don't even know where I can find one right now, but that's, I just joined the Facebook

1504
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,320
group that I'm on and they put all sorts of stuff up there.

1505
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,840
They list all the different Craigslist ads.

1506
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,560
Maybe I'll do that.

1507
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,200
Alan's in the kitchen.

1508
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:09,120
Alan, can you, can you not wait for me to buy a dance maniacs machine to put in this

1509
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:09,680
house somewhere?

1510
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,400
He just gave a very fake.

1511
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,320
I still want a DDR machine.

1512
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,800
I know there is no way the wife's gonna allow that to happen.

1513
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,040
No, you'll never, you'll never get one of those.

1514
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,080
You could store it here though.

1515
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,520
Just put a blanket over it.

1516
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,880
She'll never know.

1517
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,720
She will know cause she goes in the garage.

1518
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:28,800
But like, um, or at least I've rebuilt my pants.

1519
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:34,720
I have stuff like I bought sheet metal like years ago at this point to redo them.

1520
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,520
And I have like parts for it, but I just never got around to it.

1521
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,920
I was going to move my arcade cabinet to the garage too.

1522
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,600
Well, you know, what's also interesting is that she also owns the, um, para para machine

1523
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:48,640
that used to be at arcade infinity years ago, years and years ago that they, they own it

1524
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,200
now.

1525
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,880
Um, so I thought that was pretty cool.

1526
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,720
And they, they did something, they switched something in it.

1527
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,240
So it doesn't run off a hard drive anymore.

1528
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:55,680
It runs off a flash card.

1529
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:59,440
And so it loads like instantly, like it's like way faster than those machines used to

1530
01:44:59,440 --> 01:44:59,760
be.

1531
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,960
So it's kind of interesting how some of the advances in technology actually affect these

1532
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,560
arcade games from like 15 years ago.

1533
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,160
It's kind of, kind of awesome.

1534
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:12,240
So yeah, now I'm on that kick where I'm like, I could, I could buy an arcade game for the

1535
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:12,640
house.

1536
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,280
I'm worth it.

1537
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:13,840
Right.

1538
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,920
I can get my baby Pac-Man machine someday.

1539
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,880
Cause I always said I would buy that machine at some point.

1540
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:27,440
So we'll see, um, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, um, act deft, uh, saying

1541
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:31,280
dark soccer would be sad because rageinator clearly didn't know, uh, the classic game

1542
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,040
of the week last week.

1543
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,320
Uh, and uh, yeah, Akuma JP saying, oh, it's 4th of July here.

1544
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,840
So it's, it's early cause he's over in Japan.

1545
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,680
So it's early 4th of July there.

1546
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:42,720
Uh, probably not the day off like everybody has here tomorrow.

1547
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,400
It's kind of, I don't have the day off.

1548
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,000
Well, sucks to be you.

1549
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,600
Uh, yeah, me too.

1550
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,280
Uh, I had a four day weekend.

1551
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:49,760
That's fine.

1552
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,160
I'll just get paid basically double time and a half.

1553
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,760
So whatever, whatever.

1554
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,680
Um, one other thing I want to bring up, speaking of like money type stuff, uh, steam sales

1555
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,400
still going on.

1556
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,680
And during the break, we were briefly talking about it because Loki was like, when's that

1557
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:02,160
thing over?

1558
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:06,160
And it is over 10 o'clock AM our time on the 4th.

1559
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,760
So it's pretty much in its last hours.

1560
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,160
There's probably like 14 hours left in the sale.

1561
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:14,560
Uh, I have yet to buy a game in the sale, which is kind of surprising for me, but I

1562
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:19,200
feel like everything that's on my wishlist that I'm considering buying is like, it would

1563
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:20,560
be nice to have.

1564
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:25,760
But then I look at my gaming backlog and I'm like, uh, you got to play that stuff first.

1565
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:29,520
You, you literally just got grand theft auto five and fallout four for plays.

1566
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,520
Like you don't need to buy more fucking steam games right now.

1567
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,640
Pokemon.

1568
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:32,960
Yeah.

1569
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,880
See, then I have to hear that too.

1570
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,240
If I end up buying grim Dawn or one of those games that's on my list that I actually want

1571
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:38,560
to play.

1572
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,840
So I, yeah, I keep buying stuff anyways.

1573
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,880
Like some things like are really cheap and it's just impulse buys.

1574
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,800
Like, especially when stuff gets down to like $10 on PlayStation four or something like

1575
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,640
that, it's like, you know, I want to play need for speed or dragon Asian acquisition.

1576
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:56,480
I probably won't get around to it right away, but I went ahead and purchased those anyways

1577
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,480
cause they were cheap.

1578
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,120
So why not?

1579
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,440
Well, we'll see.

1580
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,800
We'll see if I can go 14 more hours without making a purchase or if I finally crack and

1581
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,760
buy something tonight.

1582
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:11,200
Although to be fair, dark Sakura bought me the shower with your dad simulator game because

1583
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,560
it was not even a dollar.

1584
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,040
And so that was a part of the steam sale.

1585
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,840
She bought me for my birthday, but she also bought me, I should mention this, the steam

1586
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,720
controller.

1587
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,760
Um, and I just picked that up yesterday, so I haven't been able to play a game with it

1588
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,200
yet, but I've just been kind of like touching the controller and I kind of like it, but

1589
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:28,000
it appears I'm the only one in studio that really likes the controller.

1590
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,560
Okay.

1591
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,920
It's, it's neat, I guess.

1592
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,440
Not if I just would have to try it out.

1593
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,480
I mean it, I don't know.

1594
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,040
It's different.

1595
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:33,200
Yeah.

1596
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:36,240
I don't want to, I don't want to give like a final say until I actually play some games

1597
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,000
with it, but I like, I like the way it feels.

1598
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,360
I like the big disc great.

1599
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,400
I liked all the buttons.

1600
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,520
It's very clicky.

1601
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:46,240
I just, I mean, I'm just not sure about those giant pads and it's nice that it still has

1602
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:50,320
the analog stick and the regular buttons on it too, but they're very pushed to the inside

1603
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,880
because of the giant, like touch pads.

1604
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,880
And so that part isn't super comfortable.

1605
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,320
I'd be curious to see how it could, I think it'd be kind of neat.

1606
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:02,400
I mean, it just, I just have to see how it plays out in the game.

1607
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,400
Well, it's kind of a really nice feel to it.

1608
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,200
I like it a lot.

1609
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:05,440
All right.

1610
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:08,480
We are going to be welcoming your phone calls this segment as well, a little later, not

1611
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:11,600
just yet, but you can give us a call on Skype, orange lounge radio.

1612
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,120
All one word is our username on Skype.

1613
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,640
That's orange lounge radio.

1614
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:18,960
If, um, you know, if you're using, uh, Skype on your computer, as opposed to a smartphone

1615
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,480
or something like that, you might want to call echo one, two, three first to make sure

1616
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,440
your connection works.

1617
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:27,520
Before you give us a call, we'll be opening that up on about 30 to 45 minutes, but first

1618
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,640
we have some news to get through.

1619
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:29,840
We'll start with Loki.

1620
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,600
Um, yeah, so this was something that's been teased to be coming out for a while now.

1621
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,480
Um, at least people finding different retail list listings and whatnot, but, um, now they

1622
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:44,400
finally announced that the BioShock, uh, collection will be coming out and it's going to be BioShock

1623
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:51,680
one, two, and infinite, and that's going to be coming out pretty soon here.

1624
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:57,920
Uh, they were going to be remastering BioShock one and two, and what's kind of a nice, um,

1625
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:01,800
and I think they did this with Skyrim, you know, or they will be doing this with Skyrim

1626
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,720
when it comes out later on this year.

1627
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:09,320
Um, if you already own BioShock one and two, you get that free remaster or you get a free

1628
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:12,280
remaster once these come out.

1629
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:13,840
So that's going to be pretty awesome.

1630
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,560
Um, the only thing it does not have is the multiplayer from BioShock two.

1631
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,960
So they're not going to be bringing that, but who gives a shit?

1632
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:21,960
Yeah.

1633
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,480
I said all single player DLC and I think that's all.

1634
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:27,360
And I never played the Minerva's den for BioShock two, which I never did that.

1635
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:34,200
And I never finished the, the one burial at sea for BioShock infinite, which it was really

1636
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:38,080
good, but I just, I moved the PS3 to the back bedroom TVs and I was nice back there.

1637
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,080
So I never finished it.

1638
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:40,080
I never finished two.

1639
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,520
I just didn't get really drawn in.

1640
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,000
Two is really good towards the end.

1641
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,680
Like I know it's kind of repetitive early on, but two gets really good.

1642
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,560
The last like third of the game is amazing.

1643
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:50,560
Yeah.

1644
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:55,960
So that'll be coming out later, um, on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC again.

1645
01:49:55,960 --> 01:50:01,840
Um, but like I said, you know, a night might be a good idea since if maybe you're not interested

1646
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,800
in purchasing this all over again and say you own infinite and not the other two, I

1647
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,640
bet the other two are on sale right now in the steam store.

1648
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:12,280
So if you want to get that on PC, now might be the time to do that.

1649
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,280
You get that free upgrade.

1650
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:17,600
So I want this on PS4, I'm very excited that it's coming out.

1651
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,600
Yeah.

1652
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:20,080
I'd like to play through BioShock one again.

1653
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,080
Infinite was great.

1654
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,080
Infinite was good.

1655
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,280
I never played one cause it scared me.

1656
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,280
I did.

1657
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:28,280
And I own one and two on PS3 like cause they were PlayStation plus games I think at some

1658
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,280
point.

1659
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,280
They were all PlayStation plus games.

1660
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:31,280
Infinite was too?

1661
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,280
Infinite was too.

1662
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,280
Yeah.

1663
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,280
That's hilarious.

1664
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,280
That's why I bought a burial at sea cause I'd only originally rented infinite, but then

1665
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,280
when it was free, I bought it.

1666
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,280
I mean, I didn't buy it.

1667
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,920
I downloaded it and then I bought the DLC cause I'm like, well, I should buy the DLC

1668
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:46,080
since they're giving it to me for free and uh, but I still never finished it.

1669
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,080
All right.

1670
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:51,600
And then, um, let's see here on top of that, if you're not looking to necessarily purchase

1671
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:57,800
new games, but you have a subscription to either PlayStation plus or Xbox live, um,

1672
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:01,040
gold, you can look forward to some new games this month.

1673
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:06,120
So starting off with, um, Xbox live, you're going to be getting, um, let's see in the

1674
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:11,200
beginning of the month, the bear saga two on Xbox one and tumbles.

1675
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,200
Let's see.

1676
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,320
That's going to be the first half of month or actually the whole month, July 1st through

1677
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:18,840
July 31st and then tumble stone will be July 16th through August 15th.

1678
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:22,720
That's weird how they kind of offset those and then Xbox three 60 you'll be getting rainbow

1679
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:27,640
six Vegas two for the first half of the month and try on evolution for the second half of

1680
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:28,640
the month.

1681
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:31,700
And remember those are going to be backwards compatible as well with the Xbox one.

1682
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:36,040
So I don't have yet to play Toronto evolution, but I think I have the disc on three 60.

1683
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:39,480
This was kind of interesting that it's coming out now for, actually I think I have it on

1684
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:42,680
PlayStation, not three 60 because I borrowed it from you and I beat it.

1685
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,680
Oh, there you go.

1686
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:44,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1687
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,680
No, I have it on PlayStation.

1688
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:46,680
Yeah.

1689
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,680
It was actually pretty fun.

1690
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:50,800
I mean, it wasn't great, but it was fun to play for free on PlayStation plus.

1691
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:55,800
Um, as I mentioned in our games that are coming out this week, fury is a game that's coming

1692
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,180
out, which looks pretty fantastic.

1693
01:51:58,180 --> 01:51:59,840
So definitely check that out.

1694
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:04,540
I'm also on PlayStation four gain saints row got out of the hell.

1695
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:08,520
So if you played through, you know, saints row four and that type of stuff and you're

1696
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,020
looking for another game, it was all right.

1697
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:11,860
I played through the whole thing.

1698
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:13,500
Um, it's different.

1699
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,080
I guess at least it was a new map.

1700
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,080
So I give them that.

1701
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:20,700
But you know, it's basically just another re-skin of saints row the third.

1702
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:23,440
I had a quick question on that one for people that might know better.

1703
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:27,660
Is that, so that's just a standalone, you know, it is a standalone game, but they never

1704
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:28,660
made four free.

1705
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:34,220
Did they, or they did on Xbox, funny enough, um, saints row, saints row for you was a free

1706
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:39,420
on, on Xbox, saints row four was, um, maybe he's on PS three.

1707
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:40,420
It was free or something.

1708
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:43,060
It was on, it was free for, it was on PS three.

1709
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:45,780
I know at one time, I think I know it's in my library.

1710
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:50,920
I purchased the bundle together because they had got out of hell and saints row four remastered.

1711
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,220
So that was something that was being sold.

1712
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:56,220
I was hoping it was the collection together, but it's still just a standalone, just a standalone

1713
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:57,860
game, um, which is fine.

1714
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:58,980
Maybe they'll do that another month.

1715
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:01,820
It'll be saints row four or something, but got a hell is not bad.

1716
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:03,580
I mean, I check it out.

1717
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:04,980
It's, you know, it's free.

1718
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:09,140
Um, so aside from PlayStation four though, they have call Juarez bound in blood on PS

1719
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:15,580
three fat princess on PS three and then on the Vita, um, or a Sheikah or was it array

1720
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:21,300
Sheikah Sheikah, uh, tainted bloodlines and Prince of Persia revelation.

1721
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:29,100
So those would be for July and finally a doom is getting an update.

1722
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,100
That's right.

1723
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,100
The brand new doom.

1724
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:35,940
And one of the cool things that they're adding to that is the gun placement will be in the

1725
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:39,120
center of the screen or classic doom weapon placement mode.

1726
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,180
They have that.

1727
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:41,180
So that's kind of neat.

1728
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:43,320
It kind of a little bit of a throwback there.

1729
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:49,340
They've also added photo mode to the game as well so you can take pictures of stuff.

1730
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,340
Cool.

1731
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:51,340
That might be one of those games.

1732
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:54,540
I try the steam controller with cause I have do you know, photo modes, one of the things

1733
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:57,660
you can do in grand theft auto, you can take selfies and stuff and take pictures of your

1734
01:53:57,660 --> 01:53:58,660
camera phone in there.

1735
01:53:58,660 --> 01:53:59,660
Awesome.

1736
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:02,620
You can like murder somebody and take a picture of the corpse and they have all the like tumbler

1737
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:05,340
filters and everything in there, like all sorts of cool stuff.

1738
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:06,340
All right.

1739
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:07,340
I'll get to that eventually.

1740
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,340
I enjoyed what I played.

1741
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:12,180
It's just, you know, unfortunately, uh, if the game hadn't taken like 20 hours to install,

1742
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:14,620
that is unfortunate, but yeah, it'll be worth it though.

1743
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:16,340
The game was fantastic.

1744
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:20,860
Uh, let's, uh, talk about metal slug because it seems like, boy, these games get re-released

1745
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:25,140
all the time and uh, sure enough, here comes another release of metal slug.

1746
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:29,120
The metal slug anthology is coming to the PlayStation four.

1747
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:34,120
It's part of the PlayStation two classics that will be available on PlayStation four

1748
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,160
that is being released on Tuesday.

1749
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,280
Uh, so you can check that out.

1750
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:43,680
And there's also a Vita PSP version that you can get for $20 that has already been out.

1751
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:49,720
But this, uh, this anthology that has the first six games and metal slug X, uh, that

1752
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:54,820
was out for PS2, the Wii and PlayStation portable in 2007, uh, that is going to be, uh, coming

1753
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:55,820
out this Tuesday.

1754
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:59,740
So for you metal slug fans, uh, hooray, get excited.

1755
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:06,500
Uh, also as mentioned in the opening by Jason, uh, dance, dance revolution, a or ACE, uh,

1756
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,980
is, uh, going to be apparently coming out pretty soon.

1757
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:15,300
Um, United States based round one locations are going to get DDR ACE this month.

1758
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:20,460
Uh, apparently Dave and busters will also be getting this game.

1759
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:27,460
Uh, they are saying that it was as of July 1st making its way out to the stores.

1760
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:31,580
So Dave and busters may be starting to install these games already as they are making their

1761
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:35,300
way from, uh, the Los Angeles port where these things are delivered.

1762
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:37,620
Uh, so you can check that out.

1763
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:40,980
Uh, apparently there will be more information on EMUs and what to look forward to with all

1764
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:42,340
that later this week.

1765
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:46,460
So next time we go to round one, Shane, they'll probably have DDR ACE there, which probably

1766
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:50,420
won't play it now, which I don't know what's in it that it will be very exciting, but it

1767
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:51,500
will, you never know.

1768
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:54,900
There might be, there might be a new smile, DK song I hadn't heard yet.

1769
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:55,900
So we'll see.

1770
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:58,860
I, I will pass on that when I go back to round one.

1771
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:00,860
Is the new thing they're adding pachinko slots?

1772
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:06,380
No, I don't, I think music games are like one of the few things that Konami oddly enough

1773
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:10,820
after all these years and all the shit we've given them about missteps in the past, the

1774
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:14,340
music game seems to be kind of the one thing that they're kind of like, they're still gung

1775
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:15,340
ho for.

1776
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,340
Yeah.

1777
01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:17,380
They're kind of not fucking with the formula there.

1778
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:22,340
So, and, and they have newer, like they have this sound voltex and music, like they're

1779
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:23,580
doing new things with it.

1780
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:29,060
So it's kind of hard to complain, I suppose, uh, street fighter five, which, you know,

1781
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:33,940
just recently had the story mode patch has had a deep discount, no, not deep discount,

1782
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:35,900
but discount enough for a new game on steam.

1783
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:39,260
And I think on a recent PlayStation sale, they really want you to buy street fighter

1784
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:40,260
five.

1785
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:43,540
Well, uh, no more and more eyes are going to be on street fighter five.

1786
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:50,600
That's because on Sunday, July 17th, ESPN two is going to be televising Evos street

1787
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:53,180
fighter five world championship.

1788
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:55,860
And that's going to be at seven o'clock Pacific on Sunday, July 17th.

1789
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:59,860
Again, that's live from Mandalay Bay where Evo is happening.

1790
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:04,900
So, um, that's pretty exciting that it's going to have that type of coverage on television.

1791
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:05,900
It's not even on the Ocho.

1792
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:07,580
No, it is not on the Ocho.

1793
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:08,580
It's on ESP.

1794
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:09,580
It's on the dose.

1795
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:10,580
Number two.

1796
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:11,580
Uh, let's see.

1797
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:12,580
We have a couple on the number two.

1798
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:17,300
Which I don't, some fighting game fans kind of feel that street fighter five is number

1799
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:20,020
two, but that's, some people also really like it.

1800
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:21,020
So we'll see.

1801
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:22,020
All right.

1802
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:23,140
Uh, we got a couple more stories here.

1803
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:24,140
I think Shane first.

1804
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:25,140
Yep.

1805
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:31,060
So, uh, poke in tournament in Japan, uh, they have an arcade version of it and on July 20th,

1806
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:34,360
they are getting, um, some characters we already have on the Wii U version.

1807
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:38,420
They're getting Garchomp, Brakeson and shadow Mewtwo.

1808
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:42,120
However, they are also getting a brand new character.

1809
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:45,160
It's going to be a real full-fledged character, not just like support.

1810
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:53,760
Um, there is rumors, uh, of who it could be because the Wii U had an update that had some

1811
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,320
files data mined.

1812
01:57:55,320 --> 01:58:04,000
So right now people believe it's either going to be Scizor, um, Darkrai or Empoleon, uh,

1813
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
but we're not sure.

1814
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:10,720
And we will find out, uh, on July 14th, um, through a live stream on NicoNico if you're

1815
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:11,720
in Japan.

1816
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,720
I'm sure it'll leak to the web everywhere.

1817
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:19,300
So you can probably expect that character to become DLC for the Wii U one.

1818
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:24,180
It is very interesting how Pokken will bring a lot of these lesser known Pokemon to people's

1819
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:27,300
attention other than like the base 151.

1820
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,300
You know what I mean?

1821
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:29,300
Thank God.

1822
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:34,540
I was expecting it to be possibly somebody from the new generation, but, and before I

1823
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:38,080
heard the whole, Oh, we data mined these things here.

1824
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:41,120
So I'd be fine with either of those three.

1825
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:47,440
My gut, if it is one of those three is it's going to be Scizor, but I would prefer Empoleon

1826
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:48,980
or Darkrai.

1827
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:53,800
Do you think maybe one of those is the fighter and then the other two are like a new support

1828
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,200
bracket that's coming out?

1829
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:04,080
I guess it could, but out of those three, I would only see really maybe Darkrai being

1830
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:07,720
a support character, but stranger things have happened.

1831
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:10,920
I guess, uh, we'll find out on the 14th.

1832
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:11,920
All right.

1833
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,440
Uh, Flaco, how about you?

1834
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:14,440
Yeah.

1835
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:15,440
Uh, let's see here.

1836
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:22,440
The Nintendo, my Nintendo is adding new rewards and discounts to their whatever you'd call

1837
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:25,560
it, like refresh service.

1838
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:30,240
It's you know, it's the old way you would open up the package and you have like a code

1839
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:32,840
in there and you'd put it in and you get the, you get free stuff.

1840
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:35,280
Now it's based on what you buy.

1841
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:39,260
The problem I have with it is like, I've been supporting the Wii U pretty well, so I have

1842
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:41,420
most of these games already.

1843
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:45,180
And the, the one thing that kind of stood out to me is I'm not going to read down this

1844
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:46,180
whole list.

1845
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:50,660
We can go check them out, you know, somewhere, but uh, no free game for silver.

1846
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:51,660
This time.

1847
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:52,660
Last time they had that one pick cross game.

1848
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:53,660
I don't have a 3DS.

1849
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:57,580
I didn't get to play it anyway, but they had that this time.

1850
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:04,640
The only free ones are, are with gold coins, uh, Metroid 2, 3DS, Wario Land 3, 3DS, Super

1851
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:10,440
Mario 3 Wii U, Donkey Kong 3, 3DS, Super Mario Kart Wii U, Virtual Console and Mario Kart

1852
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:13,200
8 DLC pack one.

1853
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:16,120
So those are all the ones that are free and then there's a bunch of discounts too.

1854
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:20,520
But again, most of the stuff I already own or just don't care about and I feel like the

1855
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:23,080
service is really going to shine when the next system comes out.

1856
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:26,400
It's just weird that they implemented it while the Wii U is pretty much done.

1857
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:31,480
You get this for buying new games, by the way, there's no new games coming up and like

1858
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:33,000
you get it by buying digitally.

1859
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,080
Well if you have a Wii, that's kind of hard sometimes.

1860
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:36,560
Yeah, yeah, and it's only for digitally.

1861
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,120
So if you go buy disc games and say you really want to get Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

1862
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,000
on disc, you're not going to get any points for it.

1863
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,720
I think it was launched more for Miitomo's benefit.

1864
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:45,720
Yeah.

1865
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:46,720
So once more these mobile games.

1866
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:47,720
So what do you do with Miitomo?

1867
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,720
Cause I see the coins.

1868
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:51,560
They have like a separate thing from Miitomo.

1869
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:52,560
They count as silver coins.

1870
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,140
They still count as silver coins, but silver coins only get you discounts in that one game

1871
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:57,680
they gave out the first time.

1872
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:59,260
So you can earn that with Miitomo.

1873
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:00,260
And they have a couple of crappy themes.

1874
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:02,520
So what do you get platinum coins from?

1875
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:07,200
Well, I guess from doing little quests and stuff, like if you go to the My Nintendo website,

1876
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,200
there's hidden things.

1877
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,320
There's like a, there's like a question.

1878
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:10,600
There's like a coin block at the bottom.

1879
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:12,000
If you tap on it, you'll get some coins from that.

1880
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,400
But those are, those are still silver coins.

1881
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:14,400
That's the thing though.

1882
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,400
Those are silver.

1883
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,400
I thought you said.

1884
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:17,400
Oh, platinum?

1885
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:18,400
No, yeah.

1886
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:19,400
There's no platinum.

1887
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:20,400
There's no platinum anymore.

1888
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,400
It's just gold or silver.

1889
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:22,400
Sorry.

1890
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,400
I thought I had platinum and gold.

1891
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,400
It was like gold slash platinum.

1892
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,400
I think I'm logging in right now.

1893
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:26,400
I think platinum and silver are the same thing.

1894
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:28,940
It's just we're calling them different things here in the room.

1895
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:30,200
There's Miitomo.

1896
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,360
There's Miitomo coins.

1897
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,720
There's silver coins.

1898
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:33,720
And gold.

1899
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:34,720
And gold.

1900
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,720
That's it.

1901
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:36,720
Yeah.

1902
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:37,720
Okay.

1903
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:38,720
Yeah.

1904
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,720
There's no platinum.

1905
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:40,720
Platinum was in the old way.

1906
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:41,720
Yeah.

1907
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:42,720
I missed.

1908
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,640
They need an app or something for that thing because like I can't remember the login on

1909
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,920
their stupid website for it.

1910
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:46,920
Yeah.

1911
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:47,920
You just have to go to the web.

1912
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:48,920
Mobile web works fine.

1913
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,920
It works fine on mobile web.

1914
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:50,920
It's a good thing.

1915
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:51,920
Yeah.

1916
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:53,200
Sometimes it doesn't work the same on here as it does on my PC though.

1917
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:56,960
Like I can't, I don't get a lot of the secrets on mobile that I would on PC.

1918
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:57,960
Interesting.

1919
02:01:57,960 --> 02:01:58,960
I've noticed.

1920
02:01:58,960 --> 02:01:59,960
My little guy is holding a question block.

1921
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:00,960
Okay.

1922
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:01,960
Rapid fire.

1923
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:02,960
So next story.

1924
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:03,960
Oh, sorry.

1925
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:05,960
Well, I was just gonna say, I really wish we could just have Club Nintendo back.

1926
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:08,280
I really do not like my Nintendo whatsoever.

1927
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:11,120
But I think this will be better when the next system comes out.

1928
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:12,120
Yeah.

1929
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,120
I'll wait for edX before I-

1930
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:15,840
But I want like physical cool goods like you got from Club Nintendo.

1931
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:16,840
That was so neat.

1932
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:17,840
Yeah, that was true.

1933
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:18,840
That was kind of cool.

1934
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:19,840
I still use like five pouches.

1935
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:20,840
I'd prefer games but-

1936
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:21,840
I don't know.

1937
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:25,160
I got way more free games with Club Nintendo than I could ever get or even want to get

1938
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,160
from this one.

1939
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:27,160
Yeah.

1940
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:28,160
So it's kind of sad.

1941
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:29,160
The rewards are not as good here.

1942
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:31,040
And they'll get better when the next system comes out.

1943
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:35,880
The story I really want to talk about at the next one, the final Splatfest has been announced.

1944
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:36,880
I'm sad.

1945
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:40,040
And I know it's going to be Callie versus Marie.

1946
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:41,040
Also sad.

1947
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:47,120
And I think everybody made the same like summation I did when they wrapped up the previous Splatfest

1948
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:50,720
and they kind of ended it with, you know, well, next time we're playing for keeps.

1949
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:51,720
I didn't know it meant the last one.

1950
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:53,640
I just thought, oh, because their amiibo are coming out.

1951
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:57,000
So the final Splatfest will be Callie versus Marie, but they'll do more after that.

1952
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,440
But no, they've announced like, this is it.

1953
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:03,600
This is the final Splatfest, which is like, how hard is it to just put two topics up like

1954
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:08,280
once every two months and pick two colors, like, is it really that much to code?

1955
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,280
But I guess it is.

1956
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:13,720
And the team is obviously working on a Splatoon 2 or a Splatoon remaster for the next Nintendo

1957
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:14,720
system.

1958
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:19,680
So maybe that's when Splatfest will come back if there's like a remaster, obviously a sequel.

1959
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:24,600
So it's a little sad to see it going away, but I'm excited to play it.

1960
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:26,640
I still don't know which team to pick.

1961
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:30,480
It's like, uh, with, well, it's going to be purple and green, right?

1962
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:31,480
Yeah.

1963
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,480
Purple.

1964
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,480
Easy.

1965
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:34,480
That's it.

1966
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,480
I thought you like greens.

1967
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:36,480
My favorite color.

1968
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:37,480
I don't like the, I don't like the green.

1969
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:39,800
And I don't like the green and splatoon neon yellow.

1970
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:40,800
It's not green.

1971
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,440
I like, like dark green forest green.

1972
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:43,440
Fine.

1973
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:46,240
I like, I like a lot of shades of green, but not like baby poop green.

1974
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,240
Yeah.

1975
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:48,240
I don't understand why they use that.

1976
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:49,240
It's neon.

1977
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:50,720
It's I think they even literally call it the game neon green.

1978
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,440
It's like, oh, it's gross.

1979
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,880
Looks more like neon yellow to me.

1980
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:55,360
So yeah, I don't know which team I'm going.

1981
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:58,000
I think I'm going to go Marie cause she's kind of mean.

1982
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Yeah.

1983
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
She's the sassy one.

1984
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
That's for sure.

1985
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,120
Uh, Callie's one more splat fest.

1986
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:04,120
She's one.

1987
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:05,120
Ooh, gosh.

1988
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:06,120
I don't know.

1989
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,720
Like over 50% of them definitely.

1990
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:08,720
She's one.

1991
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:09,720
I think she's won a huge market.

1992
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:10,720
I think Marie.

1993
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:11,720
Wait.

1994
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:12,720
Yeah.

1995
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:17,720
I think Marie is only one, like five in North America and I think just as many in Japan.

1996
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:21,600
So fucking Marie, I'm excited though.

1997
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:26,000
I just, I really love splatoon and I, it's going to be sad to see splat fest go, but

1998
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,200
at least I don't have to play till like, don't the amiibos unlock splat fest mode or something

1999
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:31,200
like, or the splat fest.

2000
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:32,200
They just do songs.

2001
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:33,200
Yeah.

2002
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:35,400
They just perform songs and like a concert stage or something.

2003
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:36,400
Yeah.

2004
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,720
But I love their songs, so I'm happy about that and I'm definitely getting this amiibo

2005
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:39,720
when they come out.

2006
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:43,120
I think on the eighth, sometime next week, I don't know, maybe 12th.

2007
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:44,120
All right.

2008
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:47,280
Well, sadly my dumb ass forgot to do a Fugu question of the week this week, but that's

2009
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,680
okay because we're running a little long.

2010
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:53,560
I might need to outsource that segment to somebody else cause um, it's, I keep, I haven't

2011
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:58,440
been slipping too much lately, but you know what, somebody else can start posting.

2012
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:01,400
I wonder why it might be an age thing.

2013
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:02,400
It is.

2014
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:03,400
It is.

2015
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:04,400
It's old.

2016
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:05,400
Yeah.

2017
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,400
Super old.

2018
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:09,840
I hope, I hope, uh, Julian's ready to take over the show soon cause I might not make

2019
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:10,840
it.

2020
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:11,840
We'll see.

2021
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:12,840
All right.

2022
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:15,900
Uh, so we do have some more news stories though, a little more long form.

2023
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:18,820
We do have the mailbag FUs of the week still coming up as well.

2024
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:22,540
And then, uh, we also are going to get to your calls at orange launch radio on Skype,

2025
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:23,540
but first Loki.

2026
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:24,700
All right.

2027
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:31,180
So we've been kind of covering the saga of Vivendi trying to take over Gameloft and Ubisoft.

2028
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:40,100
So now, um, Gameloft has announced that the new executive or new CEO is going to be, um,

2029
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:45,260
coming from Vivendi and let's see.

2030
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:51,660
They are going to basically be adding five of their own, um, executives to, I guess,

2031
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:56,700
the shareholders group or their publishing board.

2032
02:05:56,700 --> 02:06:05,380
Um, so they've got, you know, four, five members from Vivendi and yeah, I don't know.

2033
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:07,660
Basically just trying to complete their takeover.

2034
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:14,280
They basically own, uh, 95.77% of Gameloft's voting rights.

2035
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:18,840
So yeah, that hostile takeover is kind of happened.

2036
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:22,040
I'm curious to see what's going to happen with Ubisoft though, because now they've got

2037
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:26,320
Gameloft is like, how, how far away is that?

2038
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:29,480
And can they really get less or more terrible?

2039
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:35,600
I mean, I don't know if that's something you really want to, uh, question that can actually

2040
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:36,600
happen.

2041
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:39,320
You did see their press conferences E3 this year, right?

2042
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:40,320
Watch all our students.

2043
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:41,320
Okay.

2044
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:42,320
I give them that.

2045
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:43,320
Don't really give a shit about the rest of it.

2046
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:44,320
And the South Park game.

2047
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,840
Oh, and the South Park game is going to be fantastic.

2048
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:48,720
That last South Park game was awesome.

2049
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:51,200
Seriously, go play that if you have not played it yet.

2050
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:55,240
Uh, William Murderface in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com suggests they could acquire

2051
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:56,240
Zynga.

2052
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:58,760
That sounds like it could get worse.

2053
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:01,120
Yeah, I guess, I guess so.

2054
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,120
All right.

2055
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:05,760
Uh, let's, let's do some Twitch news because there are some updates on the Twitch fronts.

2056
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,440
In fact, one of them, I think Loki kind of referenced earlier.

2057
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:15,680
Uh, there is a new category on Twitch, which is watching people eat.

2058
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,680
That's right.

2059
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:21,720
It's a new category called social eating and, uh, you can watch people eat.

2060
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:25,360
That is a fucking, I am blaming fucking millennials for this shit.

2061
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:26,560
I'm sorry.

2062
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,560
This is such...

2063
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:29,960
Okay, grandpa, why?

2064
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:30,960
It's stupid.

2065
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:33,480
It is absolutely stupid.

2066
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:38,360
Listen, I get it that you want to be, you know, social with your shit and you want to

2067
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:42,680
share everything that you're doing because you're so fucking entitled that you feel that

2068
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:46,040
everybody gives a shit about that.

2069
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:50,000
I mean, like, it's bad enough that you take pictures of the food you eat and shit and

2070
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,560
my wife is fucking guilty of this shit and I call her out on that and I'm like, what

2071
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:54,560
the fuck are you doing?

2072
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,680
Just eat that fucking food.

2073
02:07:56,680 --> 02:08:01,640
Anyways, but fucking live streaming yourself eating food.

2074
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:05,840
The only excuse I would give to this, if you're fucking building a hamburger that's

2075
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:11,200
the size of like a couch or something, you know, a la epic meal time, that is okay shit

2076
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:16,360
to fucking stream, but I don't give a shit about you eating your fucking mac and cheese.

2077
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:20,680
For what it's worth, it seems like that actually may be the case is this is, this is really

2078
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:25,640
born out of a trend of people eating a lot and apparently it may be actually South Korea's

2079
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:30,400
fault because this is actually something that gets a big audience in South Korea where they

2080
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:35,480
call it mukbang and I'm probably mispronouncing that, but, uh, you have a host who eats a

2081
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:39,320
lot of food and you can see this gallon, this live stream has about seven different dishes

2082
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:44,120
in front of her that she's currently eating while she just talks with the audience.

2083
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:50,200
So she knows it's impolite to talk with your mouth full of this is what I'll allow because

2084
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:53,000
this is, I, this goes back to like a fourth of July tradition for me.

2085
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:58,240
I will allow competitive eating is this, does it talk about competitive eating?

2086
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:04,040
So my fourth of July tradition, which is coming up tomorrow, is I always watch the Nathan's

2087
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:09,280
famous hot dog eating contest every morning at nine o'clock on ESPN, just like, you know,

2088
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:10,280
all these great sporting events.

2089
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:11,960
Like, uh, what'd we talk about?

2090
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,960
Uh, Evo Evo.

2091
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,960
Yeah.

2092
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:14,960
Stuff like that.

2093
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:17,440
And, uh, here's the storm or the dorm and, uh, yeah.

2094
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:21,040
So I get to watch, uh, somebody, someone took down Joey chest out last year, so I'm super

2095
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:22,400
excited tomorrow to watch that.

2096
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:24,840
So if it's competitive eating on Twitch, I'll watch that.

2097
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:25,840
I'm sure, sure.

2098
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:28,240
Joey chest with the Twitch account now.

2099
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,240
I don't think it is.

2100
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:31,280
I just think it's people that he's more like foodstagram.

2101
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:35,040
I think it's, it's more of just like people go because don't get me wrong.

2102
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:39,520
I don't have a problem with you streaming that stuff mainly on YouTube, I think is a

2103
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:40,800
better format of that.

2104
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:49,160
But like, I guess it's just people will watch, you know, what they'll watch on there and

2105
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:50,680
whatever becomes popular.

2106
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:51,680
That's what it is.

2107
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:57,080
I don't think it's a thing, but then again, people watch Bob Ross forever on there and

2108
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:58,080
it was really fun to watch.

2109
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:59,080
Bob Ross was fucking awesome.

2110
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:00,080
He's so fucking awesome.

2111
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:01,080
The chat made that.

2112
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:05,080
And, and, and I, and I still watch it on Netflix now that it's on there.

2113
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:06,080
I enjoy that.

2114
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:07,440
My kids love it.

2115
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,440
It's fantastic.

2116
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:13,960
I'm glad to be able to share that with them, but I don't give a fucking shit about people

2117
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:15,280
eating food.

2118
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:17,400
I would never want to broadcast myself eating food.

2119
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,400
That's stupid.

2120
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,680
Even if I have a lot of food and trust me, all the meals I make for myself are usually

2121
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:21,680
pretty large.

2122
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:22,680
Loki does eat a lot.

2123
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:26,680
Uh, look in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com William Murderface getting a little heated

2124
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:31,760
saying, uh, blame it on gluttons all you want, but that blaming millennial shit is bullshit.

2125
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:35,320
But to be fair, you said your wife does this shit too, and she's not a millennial.

2126
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:39,480
So you're, you're blaming more.

2127
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:43,520
You're blaming Instagram, foodstagram culture is what it is.

2128
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:47,120
I'm blaming people that are way too involved in social media.

2129
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:49,360
Like they want to share everything about their lives.

2130
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:52,840
And trust me, not everything about your life is fucking interesting.

2131
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:58,280
I know that social media, that's why I'm very minimally on Facebook.

2132
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:00,820
I'm very minimally on Twitter.

2133
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:02,440
It's usually to complain about something.

2134
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:05,960
And that's usually the Twitter's for complaining about video games and talking about video

2135
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:06,960
games.

2136
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:09,720
Facebook is for sharing pictures of my kids when my wife tells me to upload a picture

2137
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:11,000
of my kids.

2138
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,320
That's usually what it's for.

2139
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:13,320
It's all right.

2140
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:17,520
Look, I have other Twitch news that maybe it'll be less controversial, maybe more.

2141
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:18,960
I don't know.

2142
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:25,020
But there's a new thing that's being experimented with, with some of the top streamers on Twitch

2143
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:26,180
right now.

2144
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:30,200
And what you can do, you can get this currency called bits.

2145
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:33,600
And you use these bits in a feature called cheering.

2146
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:39,000
So you buy the bits for like, you can get 100 bits for $1 and 40 cents.

2147
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,560
And then what you do, you use this cheer, which is an animated chat emote.

2148
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:49,620
So like if you type cheer one, a little gray triangle comes up and you just spent 1.4 cents

2149
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:54,880
to cheer that streamer with a little animated emote icon.

2150
02:11:54,880 --> 02:12:01,520
And apparently that streamer will get one cent and Twitch gets the other 0.4 cents or

2151
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,520
whatever it is.

2152
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:07,280
So this is a way, I guess, where the whole tipping thing that's on Twitch is now built

2153
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,200
because Twitch wants a cut of that.

2154
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:10,200
That's what this boils down to.

2155
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:14,880
And Twitch sees that all these live streamers are like, you know, tip me, tip me, tip me

2156
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,280
on the, on the screen there.

2157
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,200
Those are, yeah, those, those are the emotes.

2158
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:19,320
That's fucking stupid.

2159
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:23,600
Well, keep in mind that if you get into the subscription program or whatever, you can

2160
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:27,040
design your own emotes that go with a subscription to your channel.

2161
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:29,400
But, and don't get me wrong, I understand you.

2162
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:30,520
It's not about the emote.

2163
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:32,120
It's about the penny you get with it.

2164
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:35,480
So what's up with the star David being, I know why is one of them like a sideways star

2165
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,480
of David?

2166
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,080
I that's really, is that offensive?

2167
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:39,080
I think it might be offensive.

2168
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:41,360
I think that might be if that's the most expensive.

2169
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:42,360
Is that the red one?

2170
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,360
Yes.

2171
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:44,360
Yeah.

2172
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:45,360
Turn your head sideways.

2173
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,360
It's a red David.

2174
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:48,940
It kind of, it kind of, yeah, I guess it looks like what Donald Trump just got in trouble

2175
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:49,940
for tweeting.

2176
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:50,940
Maybe.

2177
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:54,480
Um, I don't know.

2178
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:59,080
I don't know if I see it that same way, but, um, I guess I, I wouldn't know.

2179
02:12:59,080 --> 02:13:04,400
So uh, I'm sure it fucking be like, it's going to get to the point where I hate to have the

2180
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:08,640
reference chatter bait again in twice in one episode, but it's going to be like, okay,

2181
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:12,120
yeah, well I'm not going to play this level in the game until I get enough of these bits.

2182
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:17,260
You know, technically though, if a streamer wanted to do that, they already could with

2183
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:18,400
that whole tipping thing.

2184
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:22,200
Cause I can't tell you how many streams I've watched where they have the little tip counter

2185
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:26,800
and you know, all these people paid and I'm always, I, I'm going to dig myself a hole,

2186
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:29,720
but I just, I'm going to say it because it's fucking honesty and that's what I give you

2187
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:30,720
on this show.

2188
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:33,800
I, I've been getting more and more into live streaming lately.

2189
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:36,440
Um, it really doesn't cost anything to live stream.

2190
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:38,840
Granted I did buy the capture card.

2191
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:42,400
So I mean there are some expenses there where I guess you could buy a new microphone or

2192
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:50,320
maybe a better card for your computer and stuff, but I just don't understand why people

2193
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:55,220
beg for money to play video games on the internet.

2194
02:13:55,220 --> 02:13:57,980
Like it, I just, I don't know.

2195
02:13:57,980 --> 02:14:02,440
I would be grateful if somebody wanted to tip my stream or whatever, but I'd kind of

2196
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:06,480
be like, you know, but here's some awesome charities that really need the money.

2197
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,200
Cause me, I would have bought that stupid capture card.

2198
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,600
It's because they're entertaining you.

2199
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:14,280
It's like saying, why do we pay movie stars to act in movies?

2200
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:18,160
But then, okay, but they're working at something to give you an experience.

2201
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:19,160
Okay.

2202
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:21,300
But honest talk, is it really, I'm not saying I agree with it.

2203
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:23,940
Is it really just the person playing the game?

2204
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:26,980
Shouldn't the game maker get a little bit of that?

2205
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:30,900
And yes, I know this ties into the YouTube argument and I'm getting going down a slippery

2206
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:36,780
slope here, but I do kind of feel like the game makers deserve a little bit, but it kind

2207
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:37,780
of depends.

2208
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:41,460
I guess it really depends on what you're doing with your stream.

2209
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:46,280
Like there's some Twitch streams where literally the person is just sitting there with their

2210
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:50,980
little head in the box playing the game and all they ever say is thanks for subscribing

2211
02:14:50,980 --> 02:14:52,980
so and so thanks to the donation.

2212
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:54,500
So that's all they ever say.

2213
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:55,500
That's it.

2214
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:58,260
And when it's that stream, I kind of look and go, you know what?

2215
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:01,180
The person who made the game is doing more than you did.

2216
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:04,660
But then there's other streams where there's banter going on.

2217
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:05,660
They're talking.

2218
02:15:05,660 --> 02:15:06,780
They're being funny.

2219
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:07,780
And it's like, okay.

2220
02:15:07,780 --> 02:15:08,780
Awesome games done.

2221
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:09,780
Quick streams.

2222
02:15:09,780 --> 02:15:10,780
Yeah.

2223
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:11,780
That's different.

2224
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:14,220
But who says this is this and this is that?

2225
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:15,220
I would disagree.

2226
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:17,100
They're getting publicity for their game.

2227
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:18,100
People are watching.

2228
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:21,840
I mean, they may be tuning in for the person that's streaming, but they're also seeing

2229
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:27,300
this game that they're playing and that is free publicity for that game.

2230
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:32,860
So I don't really think that the company necessarily needs to get paid on top of already, you know,

2231
02:15:32,860 --> 02:15:36,660
that game was purchased by whoever's streaming it, I would assume.

2232
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:40,560
So they may get sales off of that person streaming it, but I don't see why they should get a

2233
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:45,940
cut of that person, you know, whatever they make from streaming that game because they

2234
02:15:45,940 --> 02:15:47,480
could be streaming any other game.

2235
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:49,820
They're trying to sell themselves, not the game.

2236
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:51,820
The game is like a side thing for it.

2237
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:52,820
Well, I don't know.

2238
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:55,820
You know, this is one of those things where maybe the further down the rabbit hole I go

2239
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:58,580
with live streaming, then I'll finally kind of get it.

2240
02:15:58,580 --> 02:16:01,680
And then people are going to be like, Rob, you fucking hypocrite, you settle that thing

2241
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:02,680
on OLR.

2242
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:03,680
Then now you're asking for money.

2243
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:07,720
But as it stands right now, I feel like if people were to be kind enough to donate these

2244
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:12,060
things on my stream, I would just put them back into Steam to buy games to stream.

2245
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:16,380
Like I just, you know, it just kind of, that's how I'd spend it.

2246
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:21,460
I don't feel like I'm going to make a living off Twitch streaming or any of that stuff

2247
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:24,380
because I kind of like the job I do have right now.

2248
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:32,580
So anyway, let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2249
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:37,420
Let's see, Tiger Claw says, if you think about it, that whole social eating thing is pretty

2250
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:39,820
much product placement.

2251
02:16:39,820 --> 02:16:43,900
Stoppy in chat says, just wait for Rob to become the next booby streamer.

2252
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:44,900
Be careful what you wish for.

2253
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:47,740
I got a really nice top in the closet.

2254
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:51,900
Let's see, Fifth Dream says, it's like saying if you watch a movie you bought a lot, you

2255
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:54,060
should pay more for it.

2256
02:16:54,060 --> 02:17:00,740
Well, I know movies like the Rocky Horror Picture Show say that I had on VHS back in

2257
02:17:00,740 --> 02:17:03,340
the day, DVD, Blu-ray, iTunes.

2258
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:07,300
Wait, wait, wait, perfect example then, here you go.

2259
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:12,060
So all the people that go watch a performance of Rocky Horror, that movie is playing in

2260
02:17:12,060 --> 02:17:17,380
the background, should the people that made Rocky Horror get a cut of that money?

2261
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:21,140
The people, okay, the people that made Rocky Horror are getting all the money.

2262
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:22,500
The cast doesn't get anything.

2263
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,540
They just go straight to whoever made the movie?

2264
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:30,900
Well, it depends on a variety of factors, but I'm going to keep it simple and say, believe

2265
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:35,460
me, 20th Century Fox gets a cut even to this day every time that movie is shown.

2266
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:37,020
That's why you actually still have to get the rights.

2267
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:41,500
You can't just show that in a theater and act, you still have to go through 20th Century

2268
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:42,500
Fox and get the rights.

2269
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,900
That's pretty stupid, I'm just going to say.

2270
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:45,900
That's really stupid, actually.

2271
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:46,900
Just letting you know.

2272
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:51,740
All right, well anyhow, let's move on, we could probably talk for another hour about

2273
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:54,500
this, but we do have some other gaming news we want to get to and we might have some calls

2274
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:55,860
on this later, we'll see.

2275
02:17:55,860 --> 02:17:57,660
But anyway, for now, Shane, what do you have for us?

2276
02:17:57,660 --> 02:18:04,020
So Capcom released that Resident Evil 7 teaser.

2277
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:08,640
People couldn't figure out what some of the items were for, specifically the finger that

2278
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:11,860
you could pick up, and everybody was going crazy for it for like a week.

2279
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:15,140
I can't believe they didn't understand that Capcom was giving you the finger.

2280
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:20,740
Basically, yeah, because recently, if you had signed up for their ambassador program,

2281
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:28,540
they sent you some email touting how many times the demo's been downloaded.

2282
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:34,000
They actually make reference to the finger, and they say in a picture that the path is

2283
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,640
closed for now, but patience, dot dot dot.

2284
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:43,020
So maybe there'll be some sort of update or a new demo where you can use that finger.

2285
02:18:43,020 --> 02:18:46,320
But basically, the demo's garbage now.

2286
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:48,900
There's no real secrets to it.

2287
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:54,640
I think it really tried to evoke that spirit of P.T. and...

2288
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:55,640
But without the payoff, really.

2289
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:58,980
Yeah, without any sort of payoff.

2290
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:01,380
It makes me less excited for the game now.

2291
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:05,460
Well, so since they said the game, I mean, I know they said this about P.T. as well,

2292
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:08,900
but P.T. stood on its own, but they said, like, oh, it's not going to really be anything

2293
02:19:08,900 --> 02:19:09,900
like this demo.

2294
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:11,600
Yeah, they were just going for the atmosphere.

2295
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:14,620
But I did read an article with one of the guys that said it is still going to be in

2296
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:15,620
first person, though.

2297
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:16,620
Oh, I didn't see that.

2298
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:17,620
That's interesting.

2299
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:23,180
Well, when it's going to be a VR game as well, that kind of seems like a given sense.

2300
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:24,180
Do you think that...

2301
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:25,180
Who cares?

2302
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:28,660
OK, remember when P.T. first came out, the fact that it was a Silent Hill game was a

2303
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:30,220
surprise at the end.

2304
02:19:30,220 --> 02:19:37,680
Do you think if Capcom had put out the demo as, you know, new Capcom VR demo, it didn't

2305
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:40,740
tell you what it was, and at the end you found out it was Resident Evil 7, do you think that

2306
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:41,740
would have had a greater impact?

2307
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:45,700
It might have had a greater impact, but it still wouldn't have been as good of an impact

2308
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:51,300
just because of how lame, really, overall that demo actually is.

2309
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,740
I think people would have been like, that's Resident Evil?

2310
02:19:53,740 --> 02:19:56,420
It wasn't like, you know, people wanted a new Silent Hill game.

2311
02:19:56,420 --> 02:20:00,420
I think some people wanted a new Resident Evil, but it's kind of like, well, they already

2312
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:01,420
have like seven of them.

2313
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:03,380
Yeah, well, you know they're going to crank them out every couple years.

2314
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:06,980
I mean, it's just like, it was just like, oh, that didn't really seem like a Resident

2315
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:09,220
Evil game to me, but OK.

2316
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:13,140
It wouldn't have been just like, holy shit, this is Resident Evil!

2317
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:14,180
It just doesn't have the same effect.

2318
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:21,300
All right, let's get through a few stories here, and then we'll get to tonight's mailbag.

2319
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:22,300
Loki.

2320
02:20:22,300 --> 02:20:24,020
All right, so this is kind of cool.

2321
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:28,020
There's a brand new Kickstarter for a System Shock remake.

2322
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:33,460
It's being remade in Unity, and I think they're probably, well, they're probably going to

2323
02:20:33,460 --> 02:20:39,940
hit their goal already, because they've already, they're looking for 900,000, and I think the

2324
02:20:39,940 --> 02:20:45,340
last time I checked it, it was already 600,000 something, so, and it was still with like

2325
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:48,660
almost 30 days left.

2326
02:20:48,660 --> 02:20:49,820
It looks pretty awesome.

2327
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:50,820
You can check it out.

2328
02:20:50,820 --> 02:20:57,140
If you want, you can actually pick up a demo on Steam, Good Ol' Games, or the Humble Store,

2329
02:20:57,140 --> 02:20:59,420
if you want to check out and play the actual demo.

2330
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:07,340
Yeah, they're up to $773,206, and they have 24 days to go, so most likely they're going

2331
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:12,300
to hit it, and it looks like it's pretty good so far, so I would definitely, you know,

2332
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:16,700
I'm kind of, I didn't really know too much about System Shock, but I mean, it looks something

2333
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:20,380
like they could be pretty good to back, but definitely go check out the demo and see what

2334
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:24,380
you think.

2335
02:21:24,380 --> 02:21:26,420
Are you, are you going to back this, Loki?

2336
02:21:26,420 --> 02:21:27,420
I don't know.

2337
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:28,420
You don't really back any Kickstarters.

2338
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:32,020
I am not backing that many kicks, oh, I'm probably not backing any Kickstarters right

2339
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:37,820
now unless it's going to be like some hardware thing or something that I really want, but

2340
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:39,100
just PC games, man.

2341
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:42,600
Like the last few Kickstarters I backed, I did Shadowrun and everything, and I was so

2342
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:47,060
gung ho about those, and then I completely forgot they came out and I didn't play them.

2343
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:51,020
Like I can't say there's a Kickstarter game that I have played now in there, and I've

2344
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:55,780
got like, you know, that, Among the Sleep, it's just a bunch of games that just sit at

2345
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:57,820
my backlog.

2346
02:21:57,820 --> 02:22:03,380
Some folks in chat responding positively to this, vidpower in chat at live.vognetwork.com

2347
02:22:03,380 --> 02:22:06,780
says, played the System Shock demo, it was pretty fun.

2348
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:10,280
When Dungeon Buster says, yeah, the demo was really good, I backed it, I still have the

2349
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:15,900
original around here on all nine three and a half inch floppies.

2350
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:20,200
Some folks very excited for this new Kickstarter.

2351
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:24,100
Let me talk about this because this is very interesting where there was actually a Ford

2352
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:25,100
commercial.

2353
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:28,940
It was an advertisement that was, I think it was specifically from a dealer.

2354
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:30,260
I don't think it was from like Ford Central.

2355
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:32,780
It was just a print ad, not a commercial.

2356
02:22:32,780 --> 02:22:36,540
It was, no, there was actually a YouTube as well that was out there.

2357
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:37,540
There was.

2358
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:42,020
And this was like an email, and what it was, it was the Ford Freedom Event, but here's

2359
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:47,900
the problem is that all the artwork that was on it was lifted from the game Firewatch because,

2360
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:54,360
you know, the whole thing is a SUV go off in the wilderness or whatever, then the Firewatch

2361
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:58,400
art kind of has all that wilderness element to it.

2362
02:22:58,400 --> 02:23:04,700
So yeah, a lot of people on Twitter kind of call in Ford out on this and what the hell's

2363
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:05,700
going on.

2364
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:10,600
Apparently, the dealer was contacted and the dealer was kind of, you know, like they were

2365
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:15,840
kind of a little shifty about it, apparently hanging up on some people and not really commenting

2366
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:16,840
to others.

2367
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:20,940
But apparently, there was an email that got, went back to one of these sites like Game

2368
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:26,160
Informer or something saying that the art was taken from a DMCA compliant site when

2369
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:28,540
getting images.

2370
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:32,500
But apparently, when they went and looked on the site, they didn't see anything like

2371
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:33,500
that.

2372
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:38,140
And actually, one of the folks behind the game Firewatch even called from Campo Santo

2373
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:44,180
actually called and said, there's no way that the image came from that site because there

2374
02:23:44,180 --> 02:23:47,600
were images on there on the company's website that don't appear elsewhere.

2375
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:52,160
So I mean, this just, it sounds straight up like the dealer took the art.

2376
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:57,280
But I'm going to throw out the theory, here's what really happened because I don't, here's

2377
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,720
what I don't think happened.

2378
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:04,880
I don't think the dealer was like, oh, this video game, I really like this art.

2379
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:08,200
I'm going to steal this art for the email.

2380
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:12,360
I think what the dealer did, the dealer did a Google image search and just took the image

2381
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:16,640
from Google image search, had no fucking idea it was from a game until Twitter alerted them

2382
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:17,680
to the fact.

2383
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:20,920
And that's why they're like, oh, well, the site we use is usually DMC, not, they use

2384
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:23,400
Google image search and that got them in hot water.

2385
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:25,680
That's what it is.

2386
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:29,960
I would, I would bet money on that being exactly what happened is that the dealer used Google

2387
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:30,960
image search.

2388
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:35,740
So lesson learned, if you do anything that's out there in print or that stuff, do not use

2389
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:36,740
Google image search.

2390
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:41,480
I even, I create learning courses that go online for my, as part of my job and you know,

2391
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:47,120
something I did at my former employer and I would specifically use public domain clip

2392
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:48,120
art sites.

2393
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:49,120
I was very cautious.

2394
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:50,120
I never used Google image search.

2395
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:55,280
I would use public domain sites to get whatever art I wanted to use, which, you know, there's

2396
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:56,280
a few of them out there.

2397
02:24:56,280 --> 02:25:00,360
If you had to know where to look, um, that, that have a very generous license.

2398
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:07,640
So anyway, uh, and act-deft in chat says, uh, pretty much they were lazy.

2399
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:08,640
Yep.

2400
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:13,320
And JD in our chat says, sure, but if you're using Google image search for business reasons,

2401
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:14,940
it's on you to get right clearances.

2402
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:16,480
That's absolutely right.

2403
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:19,800
The whole fact that I found it on a Google search that ain't going to save you or this

2404
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:23,760
dealer in this, in this circumstance, you still have to get the rights clearance.

2405
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:27,900
I think there is a, I think, don't quote me on this, but I feel like there is a button

2406
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:30,840
you can use on Google.

2407
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:33,560
Maybe it's being actually, I can't believe I'm going to fucking reference being, but

2408
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:34,560
I am.

2409
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:37,760
I think there's something that you can actually specifically find images that are like creative

2410
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:42,240
commons or you can find images under certain licenses on some of those search engines,

2411
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:44,520
but you just kind of like, you can't be lazy about it.

2412
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:45,920
You have to kind of think about that.

2413
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:47,600
So there you go.

2414
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:50,560
Um, I believe we are going to go to the mailbag now.

2415
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:58,280
I think it's time to get in the mailbag.

2416
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:03,760
Every week you guys email us, participate at orange lounge, radio.com and send us your

2417
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:08,240
emails and we read a few of our favorite emails here on the air.

2418
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:11,920
Uh, but I believe when I last checked the mailbag, there was only one email to read

2419
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,400
tonight.

2420
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:16,760
So I'm going to actually open up the mailbag right now.

2421
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:19,480
Does it qualify as one of your favorites though?

2422
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:22,080
Cause you just said you only read a few of your favorites.

2423
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:25,940
Well, anytime somebody takes the time to email us, it makes me happy.

2424
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:32,760
So yeah, by default, by default, yeah, it doesn't sound like a favorite by default.

2425
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:38,400
Except now for some reason, I can't remember the password to get in our fucking email.

2426
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:39,400
Shit.

2427
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:40,800
This is embarrassing.

2428
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:41,800
So old.

2429
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:43,160
Let's have dark soccer to call in.

2430
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:47,280
No, like I'm positive.

2431
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:48,280
That's it.

2432
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:52,640
What am I doing wrong?

2433
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:53,640
This is so funny.

2434
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:54,640
Since you're too busy to run the soundboard.

2435
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:55,640
I'll do that.

2436
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:56,640
Fuck.

2437
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,640
Fascinating.

2438
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:08,080
You're going to get locked out and like a 30 minute wait before you can try to get an

2439
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:09,080
email.

2440
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:13,880
Somebody's like, someone's trying to hack your account under lock until you can call

2441
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:15,880
us to verify.

2442
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:16,880
Well he's doing that.

2443
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:20,120
I forgot to mention something in my gaming week cause it wasn't a video game, but I just

2444
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:22,680
played today exploding kittens.

2445
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:23,680
The card game.

2446
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,120
It is really fun.

2447
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:27,120
Is it?

2448
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,120
Cause it sounds sad.

2449
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:29,120
No, it's funny.

2450
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:30,120
And it's fun.

2451
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:33,640
I mean, we played the clean version, so I don't know how, if people prefer the dirty

2452
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:39,360
version or whatever, but it was just like a really fun, fast to play like little card

2453
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:40,360
game.

2454
02:27:40,360 --> 02:27:43,480
So I don't know if anybody in here bought that game or not, but it's Rob did.

2455
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:44,480
Oh, Rob bought it.

2456
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:46,680
Oh, but Rob's busy.

2457
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:48,600
I did buy it and it's still in the box.

2458
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:49,600
You haven't played it?

2459
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:50,600
Did you unwrap the box?

2460
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:51,600
Okay.

2461
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:53,880
I just want to point out, I logged in on my phone.

2462
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:54,880
With the same password.

2463
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:55,880
With the same password.

2464
02:27:55,880 --> 02:28:00,480
Did you keep the caps lock key on, on accident?

2465
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:02,600
I hope that's, but usually they warn you.

2466
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:03,600
I don't know what the hell.

2467
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:04,600
Sometimes.

2468
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:05,600
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

2469
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:06,920
Did you try turning it off and then on again?

2470
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:07,920
Yeah.

2471
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:08,920
Try turning it on and off again.

2472
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:09,920
Oh Jesus.

2473
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:10,920
Now there's like a ton of emails too.

2474
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:11,920
This is the best thing.

2475
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:14,920
And I got to read them off my phone.

2476
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:16,920
This is such a train wreck.

2477
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:17,920
Oh, that's so great.

2478
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:18,920
Ah, fuck off.

2479
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:19,920
All right.

2480
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:22,960
Uh, let's get to our first email tonight with all this tiny print I'm going to have to read

2481
02:28:22,960 --> 02:28:23,960
here.

2482
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:26,160
Old people glasses to read it.

2483
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:28,160
Can someone send me my glasses?

2484
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,160
Oh God.

2485
02:28:29,160 --> 02:28:30,160
My focus.

2486
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:36,480
Uh, this email comes to us from James Nighthawk starting us off this week.

2487
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:38,680
Hello boys and girls of OLR.

2488
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:41,760
James Nighthawk here emailing from across the pond in England.

2489
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:44,360
Firstly, a belated happy birthday to the show.

2490
02:28:44,360 --> 02:28:48,960
I've been on board for over a year now and I've become a weekly listener via the podcast.

2491
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:52,080
I'd love to listen live, but hey, time zones are a bitch.

2492
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:53,600
I'd like to talk about music games.

2493
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:54,920
Always a favorite topic with you all.

2494
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:56,600
I have two questions.

2495
02:28:56,600 --> 02:28:59,200
Question one, what is it about music games that you love?

2496
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,260
What drew you in and kept you playing?

2497
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:06,120
As a musician myself, games like rock band never drew me in as a way to pretend to play

2498
02:29:06,120 --> 02:29:07,120
guitar.

2499
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,140
For me, it was the way the reward systems and skill systems were tied to the music tracks

2500
02:29:11,140 --> 02:29:16,720
that kept me playing and wanting to improve my skills to replay levels and score higher.

2501
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:22,440
I will admit, however, that rock band drums are pretty cool for a non drummer as at times

2502
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:27,600
it does offer a damn good approximation of actually playing the drum track.

2503
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:28,600
Let's start with that.

2504
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:29,720
What about music games do you guys love?

2505
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:31,120
Shane, you want to start?

2506
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:33,120
The music.

2507
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:35,680
Well as silly and sarcastic as that is.

2508
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:37,000
No, it's not really sarcastic.

2509
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
It's just true.

2510
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,720
Yeah, no, it is kind of for me as a big motivator as well.

2511
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:43,160
The music usually is pretty good.

2512
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:48,080
And sometimes the gameplay that goes with it will make me like the music more or even

2513
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:49,080
at all.

2514
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:54,280
The music I may not have liked, but if it's in a game that I enjoy playing, then that

2515
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:59,240
music gets elevated to maybe I could download this and listen to it and it'll like bring

2516
02:29:59,240 --> 02:30:01,260
back those memories of playing the game.

2517
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:04,720
Like that happened a lot in Elite Beat Agents, like there are a lot of songs I would never

2518
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:08,960
listen to outside of Elite Beat Agents until I played the game.

2519
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:10,520
And now I'm like, oh, that song's cool.

2520
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:11,520
I like it.

2521
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:15,840
I think too, even though you might not be accurately making music, like you're playing

2522
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:19,240
the guitar and it's not like actually playing an actual guitar.

2523
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:23,560
You are still interacting with the game where you're making music through whatever the game's

2524
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:24,560
system is.

2525
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:27,920
And that goes as far back as say, Parappa the Rappa, which was one of the earliest music

2526
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:32,700
games where you could do like freestyle segments where you kind of hit the buttons in whatever

2527
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:33,700
order you wanted.

2528
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:37,360
And that was, for me, that was always something I really liked about music games and like

2529
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:43,440
say a game like BeatMania 2DX is that, okay, it's not actually DJing, but it's kind of

2530
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:46,200
cool that the key presses do affect the music.

2531
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:48,920
And when you play like shit, you're going to get shitty music.

2532
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:53,080
But when you're playing in rhythm and at end time, you're creating these really awesome

2533
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:54,680
trance or dance songs.

2534
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:57,280
That was always part of the charm for me.

2535
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:00,640
Loki or Flocko, want to chime in on this before I move on?

2536
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:01,640
I always like the music.

2537
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:02,640
Yeah.

2538
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:06,200
And that's really, you know, kind of what drew me in is just museums plus, you know,

2539
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:07,740
they'd be fun.

2540
02:31:07,740 --> 02:31:11,520
And VidPower in chat says, yeah, it was the butterfly song that first drew me into DDR.

2541
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:14,120
And to be honest, that was kind of a big part of it for me too.

2542
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:18,520
But I had already had played like Bust a Move, Bust a Groove, you know, that series before.

2543
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:21,960
And so when I first saw that in the arcade, I was like, oh, it's like that.

2544
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:25,120
But with your body, even though those of you that have played both know they're actually

2545
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:28,600
not that similar, but I was like, it's like that, but you use your entire body.

2546
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:32,480
And that was actually part of the real kick in the beginning was that DDR was something

2547
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:34,380
you actually controlled with your body.

2548
02:31:34,380 --> 02:31:36,360
So it didn't play like any other game.

2549
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:40,520
And I think that's a big draw of the music games too, or the peripherals, I suppose.

2550
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:46,040
One more comment in chat where JD it says, yeah, key sounding is a big factor in my enjoyment

2551
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:47,040
of music games.

2552
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:48,040
Absolutely.

2553
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:50,720
Anyway, moving on with James's email.

2554
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:58,380
Question two, can you think of any great games which tie music-based gameplay to a more traditional

2555
02:31:58,380 --> 02:32:00,240
gaming system?

2556
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:04,320
Games that come to mind for me are the bit trip games, as they do exactly that.

2557
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:07,020
One is a runner where your actions time with the beat.

2558
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:10,820
One is a pong clone with timing based on the song and so forth.

2559
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:15,660
I've recently downloaded but have yet to start Rhythm Thief for the 3DS, thanks to the awesome

2560
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:17,400
Nintendo Humble Bundle.

2561
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:19,740
This sounds like it might be exactly what I'm looking for.

2562
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:24,420
I find I'm now intrigued by the idea of games where the gameplay is music-based, but the

2563
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:27,540
progression is more story or video game-based.

2564
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:30,020
The theater rhythm games tried this.

2565
02:32:30,020 --> 02:32:35,660
Alas, while I enjoyed the mechanics, the RPG part is very lacking and largely ignorable.

2566
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:38,900
I have high hopes for Rhythm Heaven on the 3DS once it comes to Europe.

2567
02:32:38,900 --> 02:32:43,180
I hated the DS version, as the stylus is not a way to play that style of game.

2568
02:32:43,180 --> 02:32:46,140
Although you were not impressed by the new Rhythm Heaven game, were you?

2569
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:50,900
I am warming up to it, especially because I heard remixes are coming.

2570
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:52,340
I just have to unlock them.

2571
02:32:52,340 --> 02:32:53,980
Do you have to use the stylus to play it?

2572
02:32:53,980 --> 02:32:58,980
No, but honestly, to counter what he just said, I was playing the game with just using

2573
02:32:58,980 --> 02:33:03,020
the A button, because that's what you would be using, and the directional pad.

2574
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:08,420
And I was doing fine at it, but then when I switched over to stylus, I found it to be

2575
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:12,460
a lot easier and a lot more fun.

2576
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:20,540
The first game that comes to my mind is Crypt of the Neko Dancer, that's the one that comes

2577
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:21,660
to my mind first.

2578
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:29,940
I would say Rez, because it's a shooter, an on-rails shooter, and it has a story, and

2579
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:32,820
it's all musical-based, and it's going to be VR.

2580
02:33:32,820 --> 02:33:36,220
Pick anything Mizuguchi was involved with.

2581
02:33:36,220 --> 02:33:37,220
You know what?

2582
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:41,620
James, follow this guy, Mizuguchi, because everything he did is these types of games

2583
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:42,940
you're looking for.

2584
02:33:42,940 --> 02:33:45,660
Space Channel 5 would be another game, right?

2585
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:46,860
Right up the alley.

2586
02:33:46,860 --> 02:33:48,900
Luminous, one of the best puzzle games.

2587
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:50,660
It's a puzzle game, but I don't know how...

2588
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:56,220
But it uses music, because the sweeper is in time with the music, so that is very important.

2589
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:59,020
That's a good use of that, Rez.

2590
02:33:59,020 --> 02:34:00,020
I just said Rez.

2591
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:01,340
Yeah, it was literally just said.

2592
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:02,340
No, it's alright.

2593
02:34:02,860 --> 02:34:03,860
Child of Eden.

2594
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:06,940
Child of Eden, the sequel-esque type of thing.

2595
02:34:06,940 --> 02:34:11,460
Meteos didn't use music as much, but I did feel like, you know, another Q Entertainment

2596
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:14,140
game where I feel like music was kind of a part of it.

2597
02:34:14,140 --> 02:34:15,140
Every Extend Extra.

2598
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:16,140
That's the other one I was trying to think of.

2599
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:19,500
I also kind of want to warn about Rhythm Thief.

2600
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:24,660
It starts out kind of fun, but I felt like it got old pretty quick.

2601
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:28,140
I know you got it as part of a bundle, so maybe it won't be so bad, but I paid full

2602
02:34:28,140 --> 02:34:32,300
price for that game when it came out, and I was not very happy with that purchase.

2603
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:38,180
Alright, finishing up this email from James Nighthawk, thanks once again for the podcast.

2604
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:39,580
Much love from the UK.

2605
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:40,580
P.S.

2606
02:34:40,580 --> 02:34:45,180
I have no idea how the American media is covering the British referendum result.

2607
02:34:45,180 --> 02:34:49,140
Please please, listeners of OLR, be aware we are a nation torn by this.

2608
02:34:49,140 --> 02:34:51,980
Half of us did not want the result we ended up with.

2609
02:34:51,980 --> 02:34:56,820
Well, that feels just like in line with where we're at right now with the presidential election,

2610
02:34:56,820 --> 02:35:01,700
and I'm probably sure more than half of us don't like the result, or the choices we have

2611
02:35:01,700 --> 02:35:02,700
available to us.

2612
02:35:02,700 --> 02:35:08,440
I do feel like the biggest narrative we've been getting with Brexit is that, yes, Donald

2613
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:13,020
Trump could be elected president if we don't fucking watch it.

2614
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:17,980
That's kind of the sense I've been getting from the media and Facebook and all that stuff

2615
02:35:17,980 --> 02:35:18,980
here.

2616
02:35:18,980 --> 02:35:19,980
So your vote counts.

2617
02:35:19,980 --> 02:35:21,620
Yeah, I guess that's a nicer way to put it.

2618
02:35:21,620 --> 02:35:22,940
Think back to the 2000 election in Florida.

2619
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:26,780
That's a more non-partisan way to put it, yes, that's very good, I like that.

2620
02:35:26,780 --> 02:35:28,260
Every vote counts.

2621
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:30,380
Even some for people that aren't alive.

2622
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:31,380
Yeah.

2623
02:35:32,060 --> 02:35:36,980
Okay, I will tell you the other thing we saw with the Brexit, where it's like, good lord,

2624
02:35:36,980 --> 02:35:40,880
we always thought British people were smarter, but they're really not when you get that guy

2625
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:47,860
on TV that says, well, I didn't think it would actually pass, so I voted for it.

2626
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:50,540
I thought, is that like-

2627
02:35:50,540 --> 02:35:54,540
That's like, okay, I'm gonna fucking dig some dirt here, you ready?

2628
02:35:54,540 --> 02:36:02,820
That's like my fucking ex-boyfriend, ex-boyfriend, who voted for Prop 8 just because everybody

2629
02:36:02,820 --> 02:36:08,660
was pressuring him to vote against it, and he felt like he had to vote against it, and

2630
02:36:08,660 --> 02:36:10,580
he had no will.

2631
02:36:10,580 --> 02:36:12,140
Wow.

2632
02:36:12,140 --> 02:36:19,100
There's a reason we use the word ex in that title.

2633
02:36:19,820 --> 02:36:31,100
Anyway, moving on to YYR, who sent us a couple emails this week, saying, first email, hello

2634
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:35,940
LR, happy 14th birthday, Rob, hope you enjoyed yours as well, sorry that I couldn't be around,

2635
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:38,100
but driving home from a convention took precedence.

2636
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:41,460
I wanted to follow up on what was obviously the most important thing you talked about

2637
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:42,820
on last week's show.

2638
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:46,620
Yes, there is a place where RC Cola is on tap.

2639
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:51,100
It is none other than the famous eight on the break arcade in Dunlin, New Jersey, where

2640
02:36:51,100 --> 02:36:56,220
they also serve the break steak special, a semi-famous break steak cheesesteak, a side

2641
02:36:56,220 --> 02:37:01,540
of fries, and a drink of your choice, perhaps even RC Cola, for just five bucks, and he

2642
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:02,900
gives a link to their menu.

2643
02:37:02,900 --> 02:37:05,780
Oh yeah, and they have a ton of music games there too.

2644
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:07,700
We'll be running the yearly tournament soon.

2645
02:37:07,700 --> 02:37:09,300
Not too late to hop on a plane.

2646
02:37:09,300 --> 02:37:13,000
Not that I expect you guys to fly out just for that, but suggestions can't hurt, right?

2647
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,020
Now that we've established all of that, we can move on with our lives.

2648
02:37:16,060 --> 02:37:18,460
Thank you for that incredibly crucial update, YYR.

2649
02:37:18,460 --> 02:37:23,460
Actually that was good to know that RC Cola can be found on tap, and at a arcade that

2650
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:28,100
music gamers, certainly the ones on the East Coast, have certainly heard of.

2651
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:31,020
By the way, YYR sent us a second email.

2652
02:37:31,020 --> 02:37:34,540
I don't usually send two emails, but I've been listening to last week's show while doing

2653
02:37:34,540 --> 02:37:38,180
some summer cleaning, and Dance Maniacs happens.

2654
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:42,620
Rob, while you were at MAGFest, did you happen to play on the Dance Maniacs that was there?

2655
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:44,220
No, I did not.

2656
02:37:44,220 --> 02:37:47,880
If you only walked past it, you might not have noticed, but if you played, you might

2657
02:37:47,880 --> 02:37:52,460
have seen that it had a lot more songs on it than your typical Second Mix Append J Paradise.

2658
02:37:52,460 --> 02:37:57,300
That's because it was running a new custom version of the game, built from scratch, with

2659
02:37:57,300 --> 02:38:03,260
many new songs added, but still looking and feeling just like Second Mix Append J Paradise.

2660
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:06,220
Of course, all the old songs were retained as well.

2661
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:10,100
It won't make for great radio, but here's a video of this version running on the cabinet.

2662
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:14,140
Anyway, the reason I wrote about this is that the creator is really cool, and would almost

2663
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:18,060
certainly share this version with anyone who purchases a cabinet and expresses interest.

2664
02:38:18,060 --> 02:38:22,620
You may need to purchase some additional hardware, though, and have a spare computer lying around.

2665
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:24,460
Hit me up if you need more information.

2666
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:27,820
I'm going to send this to my friend with the Dance Maniacs machine that I talked about

2667
02:38:27,820 --> 02:38:31,100
earlier, because I bet she would be all over that.

2668
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:34,940
So thank you very much for that, YYR, and someday when I get a Dance Maniacs machine,

2669
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:36,860
I might want that too.

2670
02:38:36,860 --> 02:38:40,580
And now that I know there is a special Dance Maniacs machine at MAGFest, I'm going to be

2671
02:38:40,580 --> 02:38:43,740
on lookout next year.

2672
02:38:43,740 --> 02:38:46,740
Last email tonight from Redertainment, hello peoples.

2673
02:38:46,740 --> 02:38:50,300
As you may have already covered, this week Twitch launched a new category called Social

2674
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:51,620
Eating.

2675
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:55,180
There's something about this new category I'd like to spark a discussion about.

2676
02:38:55,180 --> 02:38:58,900
Twitch posted a social eating FAQ, which I linked to above, that guides the users of

2677
02:38:58,900 --> 02:39:01,800
Twitch on what they can and cannot do with social eating.

2678
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:05,140
It's one of those things Twitch tells its users it cannot do that I have a question

2679
02:39:05,140 --> 02:39:06,140
about.

2680
02:39:06,140 --> 02:39:11,300
Quoting from the post, examples of what you cannot broadcast on social eating, feeding

2681
02:39:11,300 --> 02:39:25,500
others, such as pets or babies.

2682
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:33,060
So parents cannot feed their babies on Twitch as part of social eating.

2683
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:34,060
Why?

2684
02:39:34,060 --> 02:39:35,140
What is the legitimate reason for this?

2685
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:39,860
I can understand Twitch not wanting users to drink alcohol as part of social eating,

2686
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:43,580
which is something else they expressly forbid, but why not feed a baby?

2687
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:48,460
But see, something that I think would be kind of cool, as far as feeding other people, what

2688
02:39:48,460 --> 02:39:51,460
if someone's blindfolded and you feed them stuff and try to get them to guess what it

2689
02:39:51,460 --> 02:39:52,460
is?

2690
02:39:52,460 --> 02:39:53,460
That sounds like fun.

2691
02:39:53,460 --> 02:39:56,180
You can take that shit to fucking YouTube.

2692
02:39:56,180 --> 02:40:00,580
It just sounds like a fun usage of it.

2693
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:01,580
No.

2694
02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:07,700
I think there's a greater problem in our society as it goes with the whole breastfeeding in

2695
02:40:07,700 --> 02:40:13,580
public and how people are shamed and it really shouldn't like any mom I know that's done

2696
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:19,840
it uses the blanket or covers up, you know, so that it doesn't like at the dinner table,

2697
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:22,500
you know, sitting there topless at the table.

2698
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:27,100
But even if she wanted to sit there topless at the table and feed the baby, you know what?

2699
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:28,180
Baby's got to eat too.

2700
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:30,060
And that's kind of a woman's choice.

2701
02:40:30,060 --> 02:40:35,740
So I just, it may not necessarily be something that's appropriate for streaming on the Internet.

2702
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:37,860
Is that Twitch is a video game.

2703
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:41,860
Like I just I don't understand why this competitive eating or the eating sorry thing is even on

2704
02:40:41,860 --> 02:40:43,360
Twitch to begin with.

2705
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:47,140
So I just I feel like they kind of had to arbitrarily draw a line.

2706
02:40:47,140 --> 02:40:50,940
But it's one of those things where it's like, I don't know, for Twitch's sake, it's just

2707
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:52,900
not really worth arguing about.

2708
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:57,400
I mean, I just it's it to be honest, I think the question has to be addressed at a much

2709
02:40:57,400 --> 02:40:58,660
higher level than Twitch.

2710
02:40:58,660 --> 02:41:02,220
Well, to be honest, that's my point cares if they don't like to do it on their platform.

2711
02:41:02,220 --> 02:41:06,180
There are other streaming platforms out there like YouTube live where I guess, could you

2712
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:07,660
drink alcohol live on the air?

2713
02:41:07,660 --> 02:41:09,700
I mean, were there any rules against that?

2714
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:10,700
I don't think so.

2715
02:41:10,700 --> 02:41:14,620
A fifth dream in chat says, you know, the second the mom is paying too much attention

2716
02:41:14,620 --> 02:41:19,180
to chat and pokes her baby in the eye with a spoon, Twitch would get destroyed.

2717
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:21,340
So they're making sure to nip that in the bud.

2718
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:22,340
I don't know.

2719
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:25,580
I don't know if you intended that pun, but that's good.

2720
02:41:25,580 --> 02:41:29,220
Are we going to have like swatting during some of these like food eating events and

2721
02:41:29,220 --> 02:41:30,220
stuff like that?

2722
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:34,500
No, because only trash people do that.

2723
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:40,060
Or could it be like, instead of swatting, they'd be like, I don't know, pizza pie ordering.

2724
02:41:40,060 --> 02:41:41,980
It's like, what?

2725
02:41:41,980 --> 02:41:42,980
Who's at my door?

2726
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:44,980
I didn't order these 20 pizzas.

2727
02:41:44,980 --> 02:41:47,100
God damn you, internet.

2728
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:50,140
Akuma JP says, we see that everywhere here.

2729
02:41:50,140 --> 02:41:52,160
What's with the West with breastfeeding?

2730
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:56,940
This topic is way larger than what our video game podcast can cover, but in a nutshell,

2731
02:41:56,940 --> 02:42:04,020
like the, our nation has an obsession with heaven forbid somebody see a titty, even though

2732
02:42:04,020 --> 02:42:06,780
boobs are like everywhere.

2733
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:09,500
Heads can explode, but you put a titty out there.

2734
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:11,300
Oh shit.

2735
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:14,340
It's one of those things that I think is just going to have to change with time.

2736
02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:21,400
Even though Game of Thrones is the highest rated show on TV, it has exploding heads and

2737
02:42:21,400 --> 02:42:22,400
titties.

2738
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:23,400
Anyhow.

2739
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:30,840
But only the Japanese have exploding heads being caused by titties.

2740
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:36,880
And SSJ 100 Matt says, blame Janet Jackson or blame Justin Timberlake who ripped the

2741
02:42:36,880 --> 02:42:39,480
top off yet got away scot-free.

2742
02:42:39,480 --> 02:42:45,240
That is something that I will never understand in my lifetime about our culture is that why

2743
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:50,520
was she crucified for that yet Justin Timberlake, Oh, I'm going to sing another song and so

2744
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:54,100
millions and billions of albums, like it's fucked up.

2745
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:58,240
Like there's just, I don't mean to get all like social justice warrior on you, but come

2746
02:42:58,240 --> 02:42:59,240
on.

2747
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:00,240
That's fucked up.

2748
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:02,800
Like it's just, there's this things in our culture that don't make sense.

2749
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:06,720
And titty police is one of them.

2750
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:07,720
That's it.

2751
02:43:07,720 --> 02:43:11,680
All right, let's move on and we're going to get to the F you of the week.

2752
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:13,920
What a, what an appropriate segue to make here.

2753
02:43:13,920 --> 02:43:14,920
I don't know.

2754
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:15,920
I'm pretty forward to the police.

2755
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:19,160
I mean, I think I have a different thing in mind.

2756
02:43:19,160 --> 02:43:39,080
I think you're defining it a little differently than I am damn.

2757
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:40,920
Loki wants you to start tonight.

2758
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:41,920
Okay.

2759
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:48,920
So big fuck you to the stupid Sacramento County law that they put in the place effective today

2760
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:56,280
or not today, July 1st, where basically they have eliminated plastic shopping bags because

2761
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:58,480
I don't know why the fuck they did.

2762
02:43:58,480 --> 02:44:00,080
Oh, we're good for the environment.

2763
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:01,080
Fuck you all.

2764
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:03,320
Seriously is a fucking inconvenience.

2765
02:44:03,320 --> 02:44:07,720
If I want to be environmentally friendly and buy those fucking bags, the reusable ones,

2766
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:11,480
I will, but I don't, I don't give a shit because it doesn't matter.

2767
02:44:11,480 --> 02:44:14,980
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to pour extra fucking oil into all the rivers and

2768
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:18,620
streams to offset all the good that this shit is doing.

2769
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:22,500
You're such an asshole.

2770
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:23,500
But you know what?

2771
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:29,460
I look, I am, I'm pretty fucking liberal, but I would say if I were to become governor,

2772
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:31,700
I would overturn that fucking bag ban day one.

2773
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:32,980
I'm I'm with you.

2774
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:38,240
I don't, it doesn't like I, you recycle the bags and use them for other things and I do

2775
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:44,240
all the time, all the time anyway, too, too many political discourse on tonight's show.

2776
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:45,760
My FU of the week.

2777
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:46,880
I don't, I don't know.

2778
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:48,000
I don't really have a lot.

2779
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:52,960
So my FU of the week goes to my lazy ass not being, being motivated enough to exercise.

2780
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:57,160
Uh, I need, I need to get up off my ass and do more exercise, especially if I do want

2781
02:44:57,160 --> 02:45:00,280
to wear better cosplay at a dragon con.

2782
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:01,280
So who knows?

2783
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:04,440
Maybe in the next next day or two, I'll finally get started with that.

2784
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:05,440
Flaco, how about you?

2785
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:07,040
And now I talked about how much I love them.

2786
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:08,040
I don't care.

2787
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:13,400
F U S G D Q because you didn't accept my submission.

2788
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:17,760
Oh, I can be Minneapolis right now, but I'm on Rob's couch.

2789
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:19,960
Hey, wait a minute.

2790
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:23,600
That's it.

2791
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:25,960
I still love them for not accepting.

2792
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:27,600
Minneapolis isn't that great anyway.

2793
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:28,600
All right.

2794
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:30,160
Practicing PT in the back room.

2795
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:32,360
Just don't, don't hate me.

2796
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:33,560
Minneapolis, St Paul people.

2797
02:45:33,560 --> 02:45:34,560
I'm just telling a little joke.

2798
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:35,560
All right.

2799
02:45:35,560 --> 02:45:37,360
Uh, Shane, last but not least.

2800
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:41,120
If you to being tired, cause I'm really tired and didn't take a nap today and I went to

2801
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:43,760
bed at like four and got up at nine.

2802
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:44,760
Yeah.

2803
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:47,880
If you to lack asleep, but that was my own fault.

2804
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:49,840
I will say this though.

2805
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:54,080
Shane stayed on the phone with me the entire drive home so that I wouldn't fall asleep

2806
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:55,080
on the road.

2807
02:45:55,080 --> 02:45:59,640
And so that was, that was pretty awesome thing that Shane did pretty awesome.

2808
02:45:59,640 --> 02:46:03,680
As much of a jerk as he has to me, sometimes he'll do things like that that make me want

2809
02:46:03,680 --> 02:46:04,680
to keep him around.

2810
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:05,680
So there you go.

2811
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:06,680
All right.

2812
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:11,080
I started seeing like a lullaby where he would, he, you and I both know that would never fucking

2813
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:12,080
happen.

2814
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:14,880
Like why do we even have these scenarios that are just untrue?

2815
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:15,880
Yeah.

2816
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:22,300
I, he wouldn't even do it for, even as a goof, he wouldn't even do it for, for his boyfriend.

2817
02:46:22,300 --> 02:46:25,200
He wouldn't do it for a child that he had.

2818
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:27,200
Would you, would you sing a lullaby for your child?

2819
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:28,200
No.

2820
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:29,200
No.

2821
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:33,760
Why would I want to go outside of the backyard to sing to the kid that's trying to go to

2822
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:34,760
sleep?

2823
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:37,880
Cause that's where they're going to stay in their pen.

2824
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:44,000
And let's all be, let's all be thankful for a minute that Shane doesn't have kids and

2825
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:49,200
I'm not sure if they thankfully is gay and is very, very unlikely to be having kids.

2826
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:53,560
I like, I don't know if they'd have a pen cause I think I just tie them to a tree so

2827
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:54,840
they can't get away.

2828
02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:56,880
It's way cheaper and easier.

2829
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:59,800
You don't let him babysit, do you?

2830
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:01,120
His kids kind of love me.

2831
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:02,120
Yeah.

2832
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:03,120
He's actually great with our kids.

2833
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:04,720
It's all lies.

2834
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:05,720
He loves our kids.

2835
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:07,280
He's great with the idea of the tree.

2836
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:08,800
I would imagine they would.

2837
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:13,040
They'd tire themselves out trying to run around the tree, but they'd also choke themselves.

2838
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:14,040
So it's a win-win.

2839
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:18,480
Now that fifth dream that is false advertising, chicken wire cages are where kids belong.

2840
02:47:18,480 --> 02:47:21,840
It's actually has to be kid wire cages.

2841
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:23,680
Chicken wires for chickens.

2842
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:26,080
You guys all need therapy.

2843
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:29,180
Let's, we got a couple more stories for you guys and we're going to open up the skype

2844
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:32,780
line at orange lounge radio on skype, uh, Loki.

2845
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:36,880
So this is the weirdest news I think we can be reporting today.

2846
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:44,720
And that is first off, well, crystal Pepsi is coming back again, again, apparently people

2847
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:45,720
get it this time.

2848
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:46,720
Yes.

2849
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:47,720
A limited time.

2850
02:47:47,720 --> 02:47:52,920
It will be in stores on July 7th in Canada and July 8th in us, I thought it was August

2851
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:53,920
for us.

2852
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:54,920
Nope.

2853
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:55,920
It's July.

2854
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:59,700
And apparently along with that, uh, we're going to be getting a game.

2855
02:48:00,620 --> 02:48:09,680
It is a similar area spoof of the Oregon trail called the crystal Pepsi trail.

2856
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:12,400
Yes.

2857
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:15,640
The crystal Pepsi trail.

2858
02:48:15,640 --> 02:48:16,640
You can check it out.

2859
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:17,640
Oh my gosh.

2860
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:19,840
I just remember when that came out last time it was on Amazon.

2861
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:21,660
It was all sold out in like five minutes.

2862
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:25,360
But now it's on the eighth so I can go get my Cali Marie amiibo and crystal Pepsi in

2863
02:48:25,360 --> 02:48:26,360
the same day.

2864
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:27,360
It'll be amazing.

2865
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:28,360
Yeah.

2866
02:48:28,360 --> 02:48:31,900
I want to see how this is going to happen now, but Oh, crystal Pepsi will try to like,

2867
02:48:31,900 --> 02:48:34,860
now I remember why I hated that.

2868
02:48:34,860 --> 02:48:36,460
I didn't remember what it tasted like.

2869
02:48:36,460 --> 02:48:42,140
I don't remember either, but I remember liking it as a sweetie with aspartame.

2870
02:48:42,140 --> 02:48:46,020
Oh, so it's diet was always diet.

2871
02:48:46,020 --> 02:48:48,180
I don't feel like it tasted like a diet soda.

2872
02:48:48,180 --> 02:48:49,180
It was sweeter.

2873
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:50,180
I remember that.

2874
02:48:50,180 --> 02:48:51,220
Uh, maybe it's a mix.

2875
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:53,340
Do these sell surge at the stores yet?

2876
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:54,900
I know it's on Amazon.

2877
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:55,900
Surge was okay.

2878
02:48:55,900 --> 02:48:59,280
I miss Citra.

2879
02:48:59,280 --> 02:49:00,280
That's what I want.

2880
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:01,280
Surge.

2881
02:49:01,280 --> 02:49:06,200
I want to get some crystal Pepsi and see if it's, I liked it when I was younger, but everybody

2882
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:08,160
says it's not as good as you remember.

2883
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:09,540
Yeah, probably.

2884
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:10,540
So we'll see.

2885
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:11,540
We'll see.

2886
02:49:11,540 --> 02:49:12,540
I think I just liked it cause it was clear.

2887
02:49:12,540 --> 02:49:16,080
I was like, Ooh, like Coke zero and shit like that now.

2888
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:17,520
So maybe it'll be popular.

2889
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:20,800
I just remember the Saturday night live commercial they had that was crystal gravy.

2890
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:22,800
Did you ever see that?

2891
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:24,520
I think it's on YouTube.

2892
02:49:24,520 --> 02:49:25,520
I do remember that.

2893
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:26,520
All right.

2894
02:49:26,520 --> 02:49:31,660
Oh, act depth and chat says, sky, buy a crystal Pepsi and stream it on Twitch.

2895
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:36,220
I fucking could now, but just don't put any alcohol in it and don't fucking, don't give

2896
02:49:36,220 --> 02:49:37,220
it to a baby.

2897
02:49:37,220 --> 02:49:40,020
Don't feed it to a baby while I'm on the street that do a baby anyway.

2898
02:49:40,020 --> 02:49:41,020
All right.

2899
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:47,900
If it's in a baby that kind of looks like an adult moving on, uh, last story tonight

2900
02:49:47,900 --> 02:49:52,040
has to do with an NES emulator and this is what we've actually talked about before.

2901
02:49:52,040 --> 02:49:58,720
It is an NES emulator that turns games into 3d, not like the way you would see it like

2902
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:03,420
on a 3ds or something, but it actually will turn the game into looking like, like it's

2903
02:50:03,420 --> 02:50:07,300
like a rotatable type of like 3d play field.

2904
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:11,540
Um, apparently this software is available now and you can actually get it through itch

2905
02:50:11,540 --> 02:50:15,100
IO, which seems weird cause it's an emulator, but okay.

2906
02:50:15,100 --> 02:50:17,600
Uh, but you can get it as a free download.

2907
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:22,540
You can chip in optionally for 99 or more for access to the latest build as soon as

2908
02:50:22,540 --> 02:50:23,540
it was released.

2909
02:50:23,540 --> 02:50:28,420
Uh, previously this was going for $30 and if you did buy that for that price, you're

2910
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:29,940
going to get refunded the difference.

2911
02:50:29,940 --> 02:50:35,500
Although I'm surprised he's allowed to charge any money for it at all when you, I guess

2912
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:39,820
you don't get the ROMs and I guess that's the difference, but like you can get an idea

2913
02:50:39,820 --> 02:50:40,820
what this looks like here.

2914
02:50:40,820 --> 02:50:44,460
Uh, I'm, I'm looking at a video here in studio where somebody is playing balloon fight, which

2915
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:48,320
you know, ought to be a pretty simple NES game to emulate cause there was one of the

2916
02:50:48,320 --> 02:50:49,320
earlier titles.

2917
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:53,440
There's not a whole lot going on, but you kind of get the sense that it looks like,

2918
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:58,020
you know, when a child would make a diorama and a shoe box, like that's the type of thing

2919
02:50:58,020 --> 02:51:00,440
that balloon fight kind of looks like here.

2920
02:51:00,440 --> 02:51:01,440
It's cool.

2921
02:51:01,440 --> 02:51:02,440
It's a really cool effect.

2922
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:04,800
Put together with the Perler beads or something like that.

2923
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:09,280
Yeah, it's, it's a really cool effect, but um, yeah, it's uh, you know, again, I don't

2924
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:12,000
know how well this would work in every Nintendo game.

2925
02:51:12,540 --> 02:51:15,980
Some folks in chat kind of echoing something I concluded there.

2926
02:51:15,980 --> 02:51:20,180
Stoppy says emulators are legal, licensed ROMs are not.

2927
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:26,260
I still am a little surprised that it is allowed to exist on this store, but I suppose the

2928
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:30,300
patent would be, you know, on the Nintendo hardware would be expired by now.

2929
02:51:30,300 --> 02:51:32,540
So maybe that's, that's why they're able to get it.

2930
02:51:32,540 --> 02:51:35,860
That's why you have all the knockoff Nintendo things that you can buy now.

2931
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:40,940
Um, so maybe that's, that's why, but yeah, the ROMs certainly would not be included.

2932
02:51:40,960 --> 02:51:43,040
Are there any public domain NES ROMs though?

2933
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:44,840
I don't know if there are any out there.

2934
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:48,760
If there could be home brew stuff that people make, yeah, I guess only the home brew stuff

2935
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:53,000
would work because anything that was actually in a cartridge, Nintendo would have rights

2936
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,000
over that cartridge.

2937
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,920
I think, I think again, I'm not a lawyer.

2938
02:51:56,920 --> 02:51:59,120
I'm just speculating, I suppose.

2939
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:02,940
Anyway, that is going to do it for the stories tonight, but we are going to open up the Skype

2940
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:07,120
line for a little bit here for any of you, the one to get through orange lounge radio,

2941
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:08,120
all one word on Skype.

2942
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:11,820
If you want to give us a call since we are already after nine o'clock, I'm only going

2943
02:52:11,820 --> 02:52:14,100
to leave a little room here opportunity to call it.

2944
02:52:14,100 --> 02:52:15,100
Oh, good.

2945
02:52:15,100 --> 02:52:17,420
It is ringing already, so we'll get to it.

2946
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:18,420
Hi.

2947
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:19,420
You're on orange lounge radio.

2948
02:52:19,420 --> 02:52:20,420
Who is this?

2949
02:52:20,420 --> 02:52:21,420
Hey, this is Act Deft.

2950
02:52:21,420 --> 02:52:22,420
Hey Act Deft.

2951
02:52:22,420 --> 02:52:23,420
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2952
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:31,820
Well, I'm kind of tired, but, but, uh, I want to talk about, uh, Kirby Pen and Robobot.

2953
02:52:31,820 --> 02:52:32,820
Yes.

2954
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:36,060
Uh, we started to talk about this a little bit at the end of last week's show, but, uh,

2955
02:52:36,060 --> 02:52:39,120
uh, what's your thoughts on this?

2956
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:45,680
Well, the last time I talked to, oh Lord, I hadn't, I hadn't played it, but right now

2957
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:55,340
I am only 2% of 100%, uh, sorry, of having a file with 100%.

2958
02:52:55,340 --> 02:53:02,480
That game is probably the best Kirby I have ever played.

2959
02:53:02,480 --> 02:53:06,420
That is quite some praise there, Act Deft.

2960
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:14,300
And, and you know me, everyone that's been listening to the show quite, sorry, quite

2961
02:53:14,300 --> 02:53:22,780
some time, knows I love Kirby and, and I have said that Kirby Superstar is probably the

2962
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:32,460
best there is, and, and Robobot, I don't know if I didn't expect that much.

2963
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:40,960
Or, uh, I, well, I said, it's a Kirby game, I have to play it, but it really blew me away.

2964
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:44,840
It's like, wow.

2965
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:50,320
It's so, basically I can define it like so much fun.

2966
02:53:50,320 --> 02:54:00,340
Having the robot, uh, well, destroying everything, uh, in your path, uh, the bosses, even playing

2967
02:54:00,340 --> 02:54:06,360
as regular Kirby and, and having the abilities, uh, like the new ones, especially the, the

2968
02:54:06,360 --> 02:54:12,520
psychic, the ESP one, like, oh my God, that's the, that, that one is so broken, but it's

2969
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:21,520
so much fun to use, and, and all the other modes in the game are also so fun.

2970
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:30,160
My, probably my only complaint is the multiplayer game it has, uh, Kirby's Team Clash.

2971
02:54:30,180 --> 02:54:32,820
It's pretty short.

2972
02:54:32,820 --> 02:54:34,220
That's, that's my only complaint.

2973
02:54:34,220 --> 02:54:41,380
I, I, I, I played it yesterday or last night with some friends, uh, and there's only like

2974
02:54:41,380 --> 02:54:47,340
six quests, and they're pretty much like boss battles with four people.

2975
02:54:47,340 --> 02:54:55,460
Uh, they're fun, they're fun, but yeah, it took, it took us like probably half an hour

2976
02:54:55,460 --> 02:54:57,720
to beat them all.

2977
02:54:57,720 --> 02:55:05,120
And we tried, uh, the last one twice because we died and all that stuff, but other than

2978
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:09,880
that, I really, really cannot recommend this game enough.

2979
02:55:09,880 --> 02:55:15,200
It's probably heading to, towards my game of the year of, uh, 2016.

2980
02:55:15,200 --> 02:55:16,680
That's some, some pretty high praise.

2981
02:55:16,680 --> 02:55:20,560
Are you sure now, just to ask a tough question, cause that's what I do, are you sure that

2982
02:55:20,560 --> 02:55:26,220
you actually, you know, you're not just kind of blinded by, it's the new car smell, basically.

2983
02:55:26,220 --> 02:55:30,780
The fact that it is a new Kirby game, like is that, you think, influencing your opinion

2984
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:37,380
or, or no, this really does hold its own compared to these Kirby games of the past that you,

2985
02:55:37,380 --> 02:55:38,380
you love so much?

2986
02:55:38,380 --> 02:55:39,380
Okay.

2987
02:55:39,380 --> 02:55:43,600
How do I know that this game is like legit?

2988
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:45,700
I don't complete games.

2989
02:55:45,700 --> 02:55:52,040
I don't do 100 completion or a hundred percent completion on games, like there are only a

2990
02:55:52,040 --> 02:55:53,040
few games.

2991
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:56,600
Uh, do I do something like that last year?

2992
02:55:56,600 --> 02:55:57,600
It was undertale.

2993
02:55:57,600 --> 02:56:04,520
Uh, the year before that it was the solo night, which were both my games of the year of those

2994
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:07,240
years, respectively, and so forth.

2995
02:56:07,240 --> 02:56:15,000
Uh, and even Kirby games, if I like the game enough, I'll, I'll beat it like regularly,

2996
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:20,620
not complete it, uh, uh, like get all the collectibles and all the secrets.

2997
02:56:20,620 --> 02:56:27,140
Like, for example, uh, last year that we got, uh, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, that game

2998
02:56:27,140 --> 02:56:36,540
was fun and, uh, but I haven't even finished that game and I liked it, but I haven't even

2999
02:56:36,540 --> 02:56:38,100
finished it.

3000
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:43,220
And there are, there are other games that I like, but I don't go to the extreme to,

3001
02:56:43,220 --> 02:56:48,920
oh, I have to get all the things, I have to complete it 100%, get all the secrets.

3002
02:56:48,920 --> 02:56:53,780
And this game made me do it because it was so fun.

3003
02:56:53,780 --> 02:56:56,040
It's really fun.

3004
02:56:56,040 --> 02:57:01,960
And like, I'm gonna make this example, like, oh, like a person like Bobby Blackwolf that

3005
02:57:01,960 --> 02:57:09,400
doesn't play hard games or, uh, games that are too difficult, like, Kirby Planet Robot

3006
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:14,580
Bot is like the whole game, well, not the whole game because it has some challenging

3007
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:22,620
parts later on, but it felt like it was God Mode and playing Kirby, if anyone has played

3008
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:28,540
a Kirby before, at least one, you're basically play, you're basically playing God Mode already,

3009
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:33,000
but the, uh, in Planet Robot Bot, it definitely feels like it.

3010
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:36,380
It feels like an, uh, a fresh new Kirby.

3011
02:57:36,380 --> 02:57:43,280
That's probably my point here, like, and here's coming from the fan, I felt that the

3012
02:57:43,280 --> 02:57:49,960
Kirby franchise had gotten a little stale, maybe Planet Robot Bot brought new life to

3013
02:57:49,960 --> 02:57:50,960
it.

3014
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:58,940
Like, really, it's, I seriously need to tell everyone that this game is freaking awesome.

3015
02:57:58,940 --> 02:58:04,000
Those are quite some strong words of support there, um, yeah, I mean, I think one of the

3016
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,980
things that you mentioned there that I actually totally get is the fact that there's very

3017
02:58:07,980 --> 02:58:11,140
few games that you will sit there and play to completion.

3018
02:58:11,140 --> 02:58:14,240
So it's like when you do sit there with a game and play all the way to completion, you

3019
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:17,880
know it's something that you really, really like, or you wouldn't have done that because

3020
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:21,180
I'm kind of the same way and I joke about it on the show all the time that I have like

3021
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:22,180
gamer ADD, right?

3022
02:58:22,180 --> 02:58:27,080
And I bounce from one game to another, like, yeah, if I actually sit there and beat the

3023
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:31,820
game or like the entire trilogy, as was the case of Mass Effect, I must really enjoy that

3024
02:58:31,820 --> 02:58:32,820
game.

3025
02:58:32,840 --> 02:58:37,040
That is, that is a high recommendation, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to really consider

3026
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:40,940
checking that out, although I just, oh my god, the gaming backlog just grows and grows

3027
02:58:40,940 --> 02:58:41,940
at Deft.

3028
02:58:41,940 --> 02:58:42,940
It grows and grows.

3029
02:58:42,940 --> 02:58:48,260
I know, I know, mine too, it's like, oh my god, I have too many games to play.

3030
02:58:48,260 --> 02:58:51,140
Well, um, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?

3031
02:58:51,140 --> 02:58:57,340
Well, I'm also really sad that Flatfist, uh, are ending, but, well, at least we all have

3032
02:58:57,340 --> 02:59:01,380
still the online component, so.

3033
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:05,700
But, uh, I'll end my call with this, go Team Cali!

3034
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:09,980
Alright, go Team Cali in case Flaco's on the fence about who he's gonna pick.

3035
02:59:09,980 --> 02:59:12,300
Alright, take care my friend, thanks for the call.

3036
02:59:12,300 --> 02:59:13,620
Hey, thanks for having me.

3037
02:59:13,620 --> 02:59:14,620
Anytime, bye-bye.

3038
02:59:14,620 --> 02:59:20,740
187 Game OLR or you can call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,

3039
02:59:20,740 --> 02:59:23,180
but we have another call coming in right now, so let's get to it.

3040
02:59:23,180 --> 02:59:24,700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3041
02:59:24,700 --> 02:59:29,300
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3042
02:59:29,300 --> 02:59:30,300
We can't hear you.

3043
02:59:31,300 --> 02:59:34,300
One more try, if you're there.

3044
02:59:34,300 --> 02:59:35,300
Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.

3045
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:36,300
I hear a distinct ringing sound.

3046
02:59:36,300 --> 02:59:40,300
I know, I feel like I hear, like, uh, like something might not be connected all the way.

3047
02:59:40,300 --> 02:59:41,300
It's a robot.

3048
02:59:41,300 --> 02:59:42,300
Or something, yeah.

3049
02:59:42,300 --> 02:59:46,300
I don't know, maybe it was, uh, maybe it was a subliminal message, I don't know.

3050
02:59:46,300 --> 02:59:50,300
Anyway, uh, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to, uh, give us a call.

3051
02:59:50,300 --> 02:59:53,300
Loki, check in real quick to see if there's any last minute stories from you.

3052
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:56,300
Um, no.

3053
02:59:57,300 --> 03:00:00,300
Alright, I'll leave the phones open for just a little bit longer.

3054
03:00:00,300 --> 03:00:03,300
Alright, let's, uh, see if we can get to it.

3055
03:00:03,300 --> 03:00:05,300
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3056
03:00:08,300 --> 03:00:10,300
Hello, Rob, it's me.

3057
03:00:10,300 --> 03:00:11,300
No, same caller.

3058
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:14,300
Sorry, buddy, looks like Skype's not gonna work for you tonight.

3059
03:00:14,300 --> 03:00:18,300
Alright, I guess that's a sign to probably close it down, because it's already, uh,

3060
03:00:18,300 --> 03:00:22,300
I don't see any other, anybody else trying to get through, and it's, uh, already

3061
03:00:22,300 --> 03:00:26,300
9.15 here on the West Coast, which means after midnight on the East Coast,

3062
03:00:26,300 --> 03:00:29,300
so we probably should wrap things up, because I know Flocko probably needs to get back to the kids.

3063
03:00:29,300 --> 03:00:30,300
Uh, thank you for being here.

3064
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:31,300
If you're sleeping, thank God.

3065
03:00:31,300 --> 03:00:32,300
Oh, thank God.

3066
03:00:32,300 --> 03:00:33,300
I want to get back to hanging out.

3067
03:00:33,300 --> 03:00:34,300
The summer game's done quick, yeah.

3068
03:00:34,300 --> 03:00:36,300
Yeah, gotta do that.

3069
03:00:36,300 --> 03:00:40,300
I guess I can't livestream for a week, because I'll have to go against that stuff, we'll see.

3070
03:00:40,300 --> 03:00:43,300
Um, thank you for being here tonight, Flocko.

3071
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:45,300
Mario Kart Double Dash right now, just so everybody knows.

3072
03:00:45,300 --> 03:00:47,300
Yeah, I saw that, I just looked at that too.

3073
03:00:47,300 --> 03:00:48,300
Worst Mario Kart game ever.

3074
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:49,300
I was gonna say, that's what it is.

3075
03:00:49,300 --> 03:00:50,300
No, you love that game.

3076
03:00:50,300 --> 03:00:51,300
You guys all suck.

3077
03:00:51,300 --> 03:00:52,300
I love that game so much.

3078
03:00:52,300 --> 03:00:54,300
That's the game that gave us toe depth, barf.

3079
03:00:54,300 --> 03:00:55,300
I love that game.

3080
03:00:55,300 --> 03:00:57,300
Uh, anyway, I've-

3081
03:00:57,300 --> 03:00:59,300
Thank you for being here.

3082
03:00:59,300 --> 03:01:00,300
You're welcome.

3083
03:01:00,300 --> 03:01:01,300
You know what's contributing.

3084
03:01:01,300 --> 03:01:02,300
You're welcome.

3085
03:01:02,300 --> 03:01:03,300
I'm gracing you with my presence.

3086
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:04,300
Yes.

3087
03:01:04,300 --> 03:01:05,300
No, it's, it was super fun.

3088
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:06,300
I laughed a lot.

3089
03:01:06,300 --> 03:01:07,300
I always laugh a lot.

3090
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:09,300
I'm like the OLR laugh track.

3091
03:01:09,300 --> 03:01:12,300
Well, that's good that somebody's laughing.

3092
03:01:12,300 --> 03:01:14,300
Because lately I just cry.

3093
03:01:14,300 --> 03:01:15,300
I'm laughing with you, not at you.

3094
03:01:15,300 --> 03:01:16,300
Or both, I don't know.

3095
03:01:16,300 --> 03:01:17,300
Maybe both.

3096
03:01:17,300 --> 03:01:18,300
I was at you with that password thing.

3097
03:01:18,300 --> 03:01:20,300
Oh, that was great.

3098
03:01:20,300 --> 03:01:23,300
Or when you were picking which Pokemon Rob would be.

3099
03:01:23,300 --> 03:01:24,300
Yes.

3100
03:01:24,300 --> 03:01:26,300
It's like a flashback episode where we're flashing back to the current episode.

3101
03:01:26,300 --> 03:01:27,300
Yeah, to three hours.

3102
03:01:27,300 --> 03:01:28,300
These shows are so fucking long.

3103
03:01:28,300 --> 03:01:29,300
This is like Clerks now.

3104
03:01:29,300 --> 03:01:31,300
This is like Clerks animated series.

3105
03:01:31,300 --> 03:01:36,300
But yeah, I love being here and I'm glad I can be back after such a long break off.

3106
03:01:36,300 --> 03:01:37,300
All right.

3107
03:01:37,300 --> 03:01:39,300
Well, do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

3108
03:01:39,300 --> 03:01:40,300
Any websites?

3109
03:01:40,300 --> 03:01:41,300
Oh, gosh, I didn't even look.

3110
03:01:41,300 --> 03:01:43,300
Did you put my new article up yet?

3111
03:01:43,300 --> 03:01:44,300
Not yet.

3112
03:01:44,300 --> 03:01:45,300
It'll probably go up tomorrow.

3113
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:48,300
Oh, if it goes up tomorrow, if you listen to the podcast, look at my new article.

3114
03:01:48,300 --> 03:01:49,300
It's movie preview part two.

3115
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:51,300
I have a few things in queue and luckily...

3116
03:01:51,300 --> 03:01:52,300
Never mind.

3117
03:01:52,300 --> 03:01:53,300
No, no, I'll get them all up.

3118
03:01:53,300 --> 03:01:56,300
I'll get them all up tomorrow because I have the day off work tomorrow.

3119
03:01:56,300 --> 03:01:57,300
At some point you can actually listen to this podcast.

3120
03:01:57,300 --> 03:01:59,300
Know in the future that that article will be up.

3121
03:01:59,300 --> 03:02:00,300
Awesome.

3122
03:02:00,300 --> 03:02:01,300
Part two.

3123
03:02:01,300 --> 03:02:02,300
Summer part two.

3124
03:02:02,300 --> 03:02:05,300
And all right.

3125
03:02:05,300 --> 03:02:06,300
Thank you.

3126
03:02:06,300 --> 03:02:07,300
Come back again soon.

3127
03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:08,300
I'll try.

3128
03:02:08,300 --> 03:02:09,300
All right.

3129
03:02:09,300 --> 03:02:11,300
Unless there's really good stuff on TV.

3130
03:02:11,300 --> 03:02:14,300
Shane, you're okay.

3131
03:02:14,300 --> 03:02:15,300
Thanks for...

3132
03:02:15,300 --> 03:02:16,300
Super tired.

3133
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:17,300
...kind of being here in between shiny hunting.

3134
03:02:17,300 --> 03:02:18,300
What are you talking about?

3135
03:02:18,300 --> 03:02:19,300
I talked a whole lot.

3136
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:20,300
No, you did.

3137
03:02:20,300 --> 03:02:21,300
You did a good job on the show tonight.

3138
03:02:21,300 --> 03:02:23,300
I actually neglected shiny hunting a lot.

3139
03:02:23,300 --> 03:02:26,300
Do you want to promote anything like your podcast or anything like that?

3140
03:02:26,300 --> 03:02:27,300
Ranger pride.

3141
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:28,300
All right.

3142
03:02:28,300 --> 03:02:29,300
You're very good at promoting your stuff.

3143
03:02:29,300 --> 03:02:31,300
I'm super tired.

3144
03:02:31,300 --> 03:02:32,300
All right.

3145
03:02:32,300 --> 03:02:35,300
Then I guess it's time for us to go around and give everybody's final thought.

3146
03:02:35,300 --> 03:02:38,300
But I do want to say real quick, thank you as always for listening to and supporting

3147
03:02:38,300 --> 03:02:40,300
Orange Launch Radio.

3148
03:02:40,300 --> 03:02:43,300
All we ask at the end of every episode, tell a friend or two about the show.

3149
03:02:43,300 --> 03:02:44,300
Help spread the word.

3150
03:02:44,300 --> 03:02:47,300
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only put those voices out there

3151
03:02:47,300 --> 03:02:48,300
when they're here.

3152
03:02:48,300 --> 03:02:50,300
So again, please help us spread the word.

3153
03:02:50,300 --> 03:02:55,300
A nice five-star review wherever you found this show, such as like iTunes or Google Podcasts,

3154
03:02:55,300 --> 03:02:56,300
wherever you found the show.

3155
03:02:56,300 --> 03:02:58,300
It goes a long, long, long way.

3156
03:02:58,300 --> 03:02:59,300
We really appreciate it.

3157
03:02:59,300 --> 03:03:02,300
If you haven't done that yet, if you could take five seconds to do that, we'd really

3158
03:03:02,300 --> 03:03:04,300
appreciate it.

3159
03:03:04,300 --> 03:03:07,300
Okay, Loki, your final thought tonight?

3160
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:14,300
My final thought is that I need to find a place to take my son for fireworks tomorrow.

3161
03:03:14,300 --> 03:03:16,300
That's not going to be super crowded, which I think is impossible.

3162
03:03:16,300 --> 03:03:17,300
Good luck.

3163
03:03:17,300 --> 03:03:18,300
I may just give up.

3164
03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:24,300
I live in Atomas and they did it like on Friday night and I didn't know this was going on,

3165
03:03:24,300 --> 03:03:26,300
but it was like right down the street from where we live.

3166
03:03:26,300 --> 03:03:29,300
And so we just heard the explosions going off at 930.

3167
03:03:29,300 --> 03:03:30,300
So my son was still up at the time.

3168
03:03:30,300 --> 03:03:31,300
We just went outside and watched it.

3169
03:03:31,300 --> 03:03:32,300
It was awesome.

3170
03:03:32,300 --> 03:03:33,300
That's awesome.

3171
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:34,300
I was like, oh my gosh, they're right there.

3172
03:03:34,300 --> 03:03:36,300
And it was a 10-minute show.

3173
03:03:36,300 --> 03:03:37,300
It was fantastic.

3174
03:03:37,300 --> 03:03:38,300
Just get the lawn into it.

3175
03:03:38,300 --> 03:03:40,300
Just get the lawn chairs out and watch your neighbors.

3176
03:03:40,300 --> 03:03:42,300
That's what we're going to do.

3177
03:03:42,300 --> 03:03:43,300
We're going to do tomorrow night.

3178
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:47,300
We just buy the crummy ones and we just light them up on the street.

3179
03:03:47,300 --> 03:03:48,300
The kids love it.

3180
03:03:48,300 --> 03:03:49,300
Maybe we'll see.

3181
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:55,300
My niece's birthday is tomorrow, so we're going to go for her party and everything.

3182
03:03:55,300 --> 03:03:57,300
She's turning one.

3183
03:03:57,300 --> 03:04:01,300
And so we're going to do that and they'll barbecue and stuff.

3184
03:04:01,300 --> 03:04:02,300
But I don't know.

3185
03:04:02,300 --> 03:04:03,300
We'll see.

3186
03:04:03,300 --> 03:04:04,300
Awesome.

3187
03:04:04,300 --> 03:04:07,300
And my final thought is I don't have any Fourth of July plans at all.

3188
03:04:07,300 --> 03:04:11,300
So happy Independence Day, though, for everybody here in the States.

3189
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:17,300
And I hope everybody has a happy Canada Day belated to our Canadian friends because that was just a couple days ago.

3190
03:04:17,300 --> 03:04:19,300
But I hope everybody has a safe holiday.

3191
03:04:19,300 --> 03:04:24,300
And I'm going to use tomorrow to get some work done and play some games.

3192
03:04:24,300 --> 03:04:26,300
I think will be a good thing to do.

3193
03:04:26,300 --> 03:04:27,300
So that's it.

3194
03:04:27,300 --> 03:04:29,300
That's going to do it for this episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3195
03:04:29,300 --> 03:04:30,300
Thank you guys for tuning in.

3196
03:04:30,300 --> 03:04:33,300
We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.

3197
03:04:33,300 --> 03:04:35,300
Have fun watching those gaming marathons.

3198
03:04:35,300 --> 03:04:36,300
Good night.
