0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Extroverts rejoice! DVR-Ace is out and receiving positive reviews, and Pokemon GO is out in the US!
19000	22000	Now if only we could prevent Team Rocket from shutting it down from time to time.
22000	27000	Introverts, enjoy your personal comfort along with this week's news on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	34000	Hey, you know, I think I know some introverts playing both those things too.
34000	41000	But hey, welcome back everybody. It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
41000	48000	Live tonight on July the 10th, 2016 with episode number 649 of our show.
48000	56000	My name is Rob Robertson, joining me here in lovely Studio N7, located in Sacramento, California.
56000	61000	Home of many Pikachus and Eevees, apparently. Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
61000	63000	And Caterpie's in your bathroom.
63000	66000	Yeah, I hope it wasn't in the litter box, because somebody else Caterpie's in there.
66000	68000	No, it was hanging on the shower curtain.
68000	72000	Oh great, that's good to know. How are you, DarkSakura?
72000	73000	I'm okay.
73000	74000	Good. We missed you last week.
74000	76000	I missed me too.
76000	78000	But I know, did you have a good 4th of July?
78000	79000	It was alright.
79000	80000	It was okay. It was alright.
80000	90000	I managed to shut my thumb in the sliding glass door, so I have to get it, I guess, burned through to lancet.
90000	92000	Well, that's scary.
92000	94000	It's ugly.
94000	96000	So, you are not going to be here next week though, right?
96000	100000	I don't know. I'm probably not, or I might be late.
100000	103000	The California Extreme is next week too, I think, is something else going on.
103000	104000	Oh my god.
104000	105000	Busy, busy time.
105000	110000	Well, it's just that I'm going to be a judge at an event.
110000	111000	Oh, fun.
111000	116000	For, hold on, let me get the event information, so go ahead and go to Loki.
116000	118000	Alright, Dirty Housekeeping, remind me, we'll plug that event.
118000	121000	Say hello also to Techmaster Loki.
121000	123000	Hello.
123000	129000	With a mouthful of breadsticks, complete radio professionalism going on over there, but I know how it goes.
129000	132000	You only got here to the show with minutes to spare, so you gotta eat.
132000	138000	You can't, those rants tonight have to be fueled somehow, so there you go.
138000	139000	Right.
139000	140000	How are you doing, Techmaster?
140000	141000	I'm doing fine.
141000	143000	Yeah? Busy week?
143000	144000	No.
144000	145000	No, not really?
145000	146000	No, not really.
146000	148000	Oh, good, then you had a chance to play lots of games, I'm sure.
148000	151000	No.
151000	153000	It sounded like you said tech bastard.
153000	156000	Tech bastard Loki. Some might call him that.
156000	157000	That's fine.
157000	158000	I don't know about that.
158000	159000	Hey, you guys can also join us.
159000	162000	I'm fathered by Edward Stark.
162000	163000	Technology.
163000	168000	Hey, it's live, of course, every Sunday night. Our show is live.
168000	173000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
173000	176000	vog.network.com, vognetwork.com.
176000	182000	Although our pal Bobby did have the night off, he is at another engagement right now, so he could not make his own show,
182000	188000	but usually he will have his fun little show leading into what we do here, and he's got an anniversary show coming up.
188000	194000	You know, we just had an anniversary show. He's got one coming up as well, so we're all having birthdays right now.
194000	205000	You can, of course, join us live in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where Dungeon Buster theorizes Loki's restoring his mana for casting rants later.
205000	211000	Yes, that's how it works. You eat the food, you get the mana back, and then you can put everybody on blast later in the show.
211000	213000	Rob, I'm disappointed.
213000	214000	What?
214000	217000	Because everyone knows that drinking stuff restores your mana, and food restores your HP.
217000	223000	Sorry, sorry. Maybe I was thinking of one of those weird games that went against the grain and changed that formula.
223000	231000	No Go Deft in our chat room, I believe that's ActDeft under a new name, says Loki's rants are powered by breadsticks and hate.
231000	236000	I was going to say, I think in Final Fantasy though, at least Eleven, eating pies would give you...
236000	240000	There you go. So some things would challenge the formula.
240000	244000	Pizza pie, breadsticks sort of like a pizza pie. That kind of works, right?
244000	245000	That kind of works.
245000	247000	I just want pie, really. Just pie.
247000	250000	Pizza pie, apple pie, pizza apple pie, I don't care.
250000	255000	Chocolate cream pie. Specifically. Or Boston cream, which is cake pie.
255000	261000	Look, I know we've talked a lot about cake on this show, we've talked a lot about pie, but Alan's birthday was this past weekend.
261000	269000	So Friday night we went to the Brazilian Grill out in Roseville, and you know, they're really yummy, but you know what we had for dessert?
269000	272000	We didn't have cake or pie. We had flan.
272000	277000	And I feel like we don't give flan enough respect on OLR in our little dessert debates.
277000	281000	So I just want to show a little love for flan tonight.
281000	283000	Have you eaten a flan recently?
283000	287000	No, but I did have egg custard in my milk tea.
287000	290000	I feel like we should have a little PSA. The more you know.
290000	292000	A little thing that flies by after...
292000	294000	We'll have Katy Perry standing on it.
294000	297000	Flying in on a giant tub of flan.
298000	301000	You realize someone should Photoshop that now?
301000	307000	Dartit Studio says, I like Tech Bastard. Maybe there'll have to be a new name in the future. Who knows?
307000	311000	Stoppy in chat says, I can't stand flan. It's like an earwax cake.
311000	313000	You know what, Stoppy, I'm going to need you to leave.
313000	315000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
315000	317000	You know what I can't stand? People who are wrong.
317000	318000	It's the show...
318000	324000	Brad, you're asking what the hell is flan in a chat room when you could just look it up on the internet.
324000	325000	Wikipedia.
326000	329000	I think it's a yummy custard type of thing.
329000	330000	It's a custard.
330000	335000	It's like if they made milk in the jello and then sprinkled paprika on top or something.
335000	337000	No, it's more like a cinnamon.
337000	338000	It tastes like a churro.
338000	340000	It's like a gelatinous churro.
340000	343000	When you look at it, you don't think it's going to be as delicious as it is.
343000	346000	So if you're a picky eater who judges things a lot by what it looks like...
346000	348000	It is a subtle flavor though.
348000	352000	I always get the chocolate mousse or cake or whatever that they have there.
352000	358000	And I always regret it because it's just like, I don't know, too intensely chocolate.
358000	360000	It's like, okay, this is too much chocolate.
360000	362000	Hold on there buddy, this is too much chocolate.
364000	369000	Alright, and Brad from Pod Culture says, you assume I care enough to do that.
370000	372000	You should, you should if you've never had it.
372000	377000	Alright look, we could talk about desserts all night long I'm sure, but it is a show about video games.
377000	384000	I want to get into gaming because even though our gaming news tonight is a little bit light compared to recent weeks,
384000	390000	I truly feel a gaming, and you know, you know how sometimes I like to get a little dramatic on this show
390000	393000	and sometimes I have the tin foil hat on, but I truly believe this.
393000	396000	I kind of think a gaming revolution has occurred this week.
396000	402000	And as much as we talk about World of Warcraft changed gaming
402000	406000	and we talked about how Xbox Live changed gaming.
406000	410000	I really, really think Pokémon Go has changed gaming this week.
410000	414000	Fuck that, we were doing fucking Ingress at least a year before that.
414000	421000	I know right, the hipster old man in me is like, you sons of bitches pulling over at my park.
421000	422000	You know what?
422000	423000	Fucking amateur.
423000	427000	I stumbled upon a dead body, fucking amateur.
427000	430000	We've been finding dead bodies for years now.
430000	434000	I was cruising parks, I was in cemeteries at questionable hours.
434000	438000	I was in places that said restricted access, but I went there anyways just to hack a portal.
438000	441000	You fucking kids don't even understand.
443000	447000	Pokémon can be anywhere. If you want a portal, you gotta hike to it.
447000	450000	Who got you those portals? We did, fuckers, we did.
450000	454000	That's right, those pictures on your Pokéstop? That was us.
454000	456000	You ungrateful sons of bitches.
456000	459000	You want to know who put the Pokéstop at the strip club? I did.
459000	460000	Niantic.
462000	463000	Yeah, but Niantic approved it.
464000	469000	It was actually, I felt my nerd cred shoot up a little bit, and then I was like, oh my god, what's wrong with me?
469000	475000	When I commented on a YouTube video, the one about the strip club, and they were like, thanks Nintendo.
475000	479000	I was like, Nintendo didn't really have anything to do with that, it was an Ingress portal.
479000	483000	You didn't get your ass thrown out of that strip club with a camera phone in a strip club.
483000	487000	We didn't go into the strip club, it was right behind it in the graveyard.
487000	492000	No, but I saw a picture of someone like they were catching a Pokémon in a fucking strip club.
492000	494000	You can see the dancer on stage.
494000	496000	Because Pokémon are everywhere, you can capture it.
496000	498000	Yeah, but that shit's gonna get your ass beat.
498000	499000	She just caught a Caterpie in the potty.
499000	504000	But here's, okay, this is the thing, listen to this talk right now about the Pokémon and everything.
504000	510000	This is, I'm telling you guys, and you guys have probably experienced this a little bit, this is a social phenomenon right now.
510000	515000	And look, I understand there's a few of you guys out there that are gonna be like, I don't get it, Pokémon sucks, da da da.
515000	518000	Yeah, I don't get it either because there's no fucking game.
518000	520000	Well, hold on, we'll get to that in a minute.
520000	524000	But honestly, a lot of that talk, I'm gonna keep it real, because I like you guys.
524000	528000	A lot of that talk just screams to me, I haven't downloaded and tried the game yet.
528000	531000	Now, is the game perfect? Fuck no, it's got a lot of problems.
531000	534000	And Loki will have no problem addressing those problems shortly.
534000	542000	However, I gotta tell you guys, okay, first off, and even though I am an Ingress Hipster and we make those jokes and all that stuff,
542000	551000	the reality is, Alan, myself, Shane, we walked around downtown yesterday for a good three hours, probably got a good two mile walk in,
551000	554000	just walking to all these random places. Why? Pokémon.
554000	558000	We put off a lure at the park, and you know one thing I've learned about lures?
558000	561000	They don't just lure Pokémon, they lure trainers.
561000	564000	We met like six other people playing this.
564000	570000	The thing about Ingress is that in comparison to Pokémon GO, nobody's fucking playing Ingress.
570000	576000	And look, I love my Ingressers, I love you guys that are playing and so forth, but the reality is, because of the brand of Pokémon,
576000	584000	and the ease of getting into this game and so forth, Pokémon GO has just blown the fuck up in a way that Ingress just wasn't able to do.
584000	590000	But the Hipster in me is very happy that we laid the foundation for this game.
590000	596000	Just two things. Number one, me fussing at my phone at the post office, and the ten year old next to me going,
596000	600000	Oh my god, I know, right? When I couldn't connect to the server.
600000	603000	And number two, Trixie Mattel on Twitter.
603000	608000	It's kids, it's adults, it's grandparents.
608000	612000	You know, to be fair, it's a lot of the same demographics we'd seen in Ingress.
612000	620000	It was literally a little bit of everybody, but I mean again, in Pokémon GO, I have co-workers that I never suspected were playing video games at all.
620000	628000	That are obsessed, well I don't want to say obsessed with Pokémon GO, but that are talking about it at work and how on a lunch break they want to go lure Pokémon and stuff.
628000	631000	Like this is, gaming changed this week.
631000	636000	And yeah, it's got, it's broken and it has a lot of progress it needs to make.
636000	640000	You replace the word Pokémon with small children and they're pedophiles.
640000	644000	But they're not, they're small children, or they're small Pokémon.
644000	646000	God damn you.
647000	651000	Anyway, okay, so look, Loki, I know you've got issues with the game.
651000	654000	Let's talk about it. What's wrong with the game?
654000	660000	Did they fix anything from when I played the beta? Because I think they just said, hey, you know what, this is ready to go, let's put a fucking store in there.
660000	662000	And we're done.
662000	666000	I mean, I don't fucking get it. There's no game to it.
666000	670000	I mean, there really isn't. You can, you know, capture gyms.
670000	673000	For what? There's no points. There's nothing.
673000	680000	If there's no factions, there's no actual competitive portion of it other than like, cool, I captured the gym.
680000	684000	That'll be held for like two hours until some other person comes by and captures it again.
684000	692000	And it's just so fucking buggy. I understand it's free to play, but my fucking god, you did nothing.
692000	698000	Give it some more time to fix some of those fucking bugs. It is just broken.
698000	705000	Yeah, the gym thing is like unplayable. And even if you could play it, like you'll hold a gym, like you said.
705000	707000	I think the gym should be a team thing.
707000	714000	Yeah, I mean, there's a gym within Aisha. Obviously, I don't want to give away where I live, but I'm sure most of you have a similar scenario.
714000	715000	Everywhere.
715000	722000	I live in suburbia and when I fire up my scanner, I can see a gym not that far away.
722000	726000	It's not next to my house, but it's where I can kind of see it and see what color it is.
726000	734000	That thing changes hand several times a day. In Ingress, I own that portal and when anybody comes to fuck with it, I take it right back.
734000	741000	But in Pokémon GO, I can't do it. I would have to live on that fucking gym.
741000	750000	Well, it's because these people are playing like, I don't know, to be honest, I don't know how people are leveling so fast because like, I played it quite a bit when the beta was going on for two weeks.
750000	755000	And we had unlimited fucking everything. Like, all that shit you got to pay money for at the store, it was unlimited.
755000	762000	So like, I was using the XP boost thing, fucking lures, you know, all that shit got to level 7 in two weeks.
762000	768000	And there's like people that are level 19 and 20. It's like, dude, what the fuck are you? Are you just doing this all the time now?
768000	770000	I mean, do you work?
770000	774000	That's some of the questions we used to ask about certain Ingress players.
775000	781000	I still ask it about those players, but I mean, like at least then I can understand, you know, when they're hitting stuff at like three in the mornings.
781000	789000	I mean, that makes sense. But like, what the hell? I mean, I get it. But people are excited about Pokémon. I'll give them that.
789000	793000	But don't give Niantic a fucking pass for this level of shit. No one.
793000	797000	But Ingress doesn't let me catch an Eevee in the bathroom.
797000	806000	I don't, you know, first off, fucking AR people with that shit turned on in fucking amateurs, man. Just turn that shit off right away.
806000	814000	And all these people in the car wrecks playing Pokémon, please. I caught like six Pokémon on the fucking freeway here today.
814000	817000	Like, that is just, there is no excuse to that shit.
817000	821000	It is a lot easier to catch Pokémon if you just turn that AR thing off.
821000	823000	It's also going to save your battery.
823000	836000	But I mean, the novelty of it. I mean, even bringing up my Twitter feed, one out of every five tweets is a camera picture of like, look, there's a Squirtle on my toilet.
836000	840000	Or look, there's a Pokémon. I even posted one last night. We were at Benihana.
840000	847000	And I thought it was funny because one of the little Paras or something, the little crab guys was standing on the grill.
847000	850000	And I thought it made for a funny picture. I was like, oh, seafood time.
850000	857000	You know, I thought it was funny, but like, that's a lot of what's going on on Twitter right now is just, you know, a lot of memes and things that have to do with this game.
857000	863000	And it'll pass. People will calm down about it. And I, you know, I'm going to be the pessimist here. Shocking.
863000	866000	I think people are going to get bored of this really fast.
866000	874000	And I got bored of this really fast before because if people are catching everything that quickly and people are leveling up that quickly,
874000	879000	and then they're going to find, okay, all I can do is really take over gym, it's going to get boring really fast.
879000	884000	It's not like Ingress where you can kind of, at least, you know, there's team scores.
884000	887000	It's never ending Calvin Ball. Everything flips.
887000	894000	Yeah, there's like actual scores that you're paying attention to and stuff like that. It's just now it doesn't really seem like a point.
894000	899000	Well, here's the thing, you know, look, every MMO is botched in its first week, every single one.
899000	907000	And, you know, to Niantic's credit, like, sure, this game was going to be popular because it was a free Pokémon game,
907000	915000	but even I am sitting here going, I didn't think it would be that popular with all these people playing it.
915000	923000	And it's a lot of people. And so there's a part of me that's like, okay, maybe Niantic really wasn't ready for how many people wanted this.
923000	928000	And to be fair, and I know we have a worldwide audience, so I want to, you know, acknowledge,
928000	934000	we probably have listeners in Canada and the UK that are like, fuck you guys, I can't even play the fucking thing. Shut up, Loki.
934000	939000	Don't worry, if you have a Pokémon club membership, you know, you can't fucking play the thing either.
939000	944000	Well, and we'll address some of those things later in the show, because Pokémon GO is in our news a little later in the show,
944000	953000	so we'll address some of those world issues and that. But, you know, I do believe, just based on what I've seen with Ingress
953000	959000	and having played, you know, that for a couple years, Niantic is really good about every couple weeks there's a new version of Ingress
959000	967000	where they've done something. They added the Lawson power cubes or they put the cubes on the bar with the XM.
967000	973000	Like, they do change that and regularly update it. So I feel like Pokémon GO, you know, even during the beta,
973000	979000	we got several client updates there too. So, you know, I think the client that we have now in Pokémon GO,
979000	987000	it's not going to stay that way forever. And I think these issues will get worked out and there will be new versions of the client that come out pretty soon.
987000	994000	And so once things stabilize, then I think the real question is, and you do bring up some valid points, Loki,
994000	1001000	what happens when I catch them all? Now what? Because I've been going balls to the wall, running in every park and everything around town.
1001000	1010000	I've caught them all. Now what? Although I would speculate it's impossible to catch them all because they teased in that trailer
1010000	1018000	all those people in what was in New York City that were all capturing Mewtwo, you get the sense that like Ingress,
1018000	1026000	Niantic will probably do live events with some of the legendary Pokémon. So I imagine not every Pokémon is in the game right now.
1026000	1029000	There are some like Mewtwo.
1029000	1036000	You know, the only way, if I've learned anything from the movie industry, the only way you're going to be able to catch Mewtwo
1036000	1042000	is by everybody throwing their Pokéballs directly into his dick at the same time.
1042000	1051000	Stop. Let's see. Fifth Dream in chat says $5 to download your Pokédex completion certificate. Referencing a news story from last week, I think.
1051000	1058000	Kaijuto in chat says they need Pokémon battles. Or maybe not. Maybe the fake, it's just an AR Pokédex is what draws people to it.
1058000	1066000	They don't have to learn about EVs and all that stuff. That is a valid point is that they kind of simplified Pokémon, maybe too much for some.
1066000	1074000	Brad mentions, you know, catch a thousand of one type Pokémon, morph it into a shiny. Heaven helps Shane if they add shinies.
1074000	1081000	Oh, he's already told me. Like, he asked, he's like, are there shinies in Pokémon Go? I'm like, no, I don't think so.
1081000	1087000	It's just the first gen Pokémon. He's like, oh yeah, shinies weren't added until third or fourth gen or something like that.
1087000	1093000	And so, he's like, yeah, I'm screwed once that comes out. Once the shiny thing happens.
1093000	1101000	But, you know, again, the gym thing, the balance is really off. Like, the thing for the gym, it doesn't work right.
1101000	1106000	Like, we all try to attack a gym. It just freezes or the thing gets down to one hit point and it won't die.
1106000	1109000	They added AR for the gym, which is fucking unnecessary, but they did that.
1109000	1113000	Yeah, but whatever. So, but again, I think Niantic's gonna fix this.
1113000	1116000	But then here's the question. Where does the game bottom out?
1116000	1122000	And is this hype train gonna continue for weeks and weeks and weeks? Or is it gonna bottom out?
1122000	1128000	Because when Mitomo first came out, I think a lot of people were checking that out, but who's still playing Mitomo now?
1128000	1133000	Even I finally fell off the wagon. I kind of stopped checking Mitomo and I was doing it for a while.
1133000	1135000	Darsak, are you still playing Mitomo regularly?
1135000	1136000	Every day.
1136000	1138000	Wow. Okay. So, there's some.
1138000	1142000	Especially now that they've added more level, levels now.
1142000	1144000	So, I'm having a good time with it.
1144000	1151000	Okay. Well, that's fair. But it still would be fair to say there's not as many people playing Mitomo as there were in the beginning, certainly.
1151000	1156000	So, I mean, Pokemon Go is gonna have a bottom at some point.
1156000	1158000	I think, like, you know, kind of just going back.
1158000	1160000	Or is it? Maybe it won't.
1160000	1163000	I think some of the things that would help or some of the things they have in, like, Ingress.
1163000	1168000	Like, granted, I think the attacking, you know, and stuff, they're not gonna ever implement anything like that.
1169000	1178000	But the missions are kind of cool, you know, where you go and visit locations and, you know, maybe, you know, visit the PokeStops or something like that.
1178000	1180000	They could do something like that. It would be kind of cool.
1180000	1186000	Yeah, that'd be really cool if they took some of those missions from Ingress and put them in Pokemon where maybe you actually get a Pokemon as a reward for doing a mission.
1186000	1192000	Or candy or stardust or something that's, you know, currency. You don't really get a lot of ways in the game right now.
1192000	1194000	That would be pretty cool, I think.
1194000	1197000	I think that would help. I mean, I don't know.
1197000	1203000	Really, I know one of the things they're probably gonna add is just more Pokemon. I mean, they're gonna keep adding stuff to it eventually.
1203000	1204000	Yeah.
1204000	1211000	So it's never gonna run out, but, like, after a while, it's just gonna be like, eh, you know, where do I go to get these Pokemon?
1211000	1214000	I mean, it doesn't seem there's any rhyme or reason to some of them.
1214000	1219000	Well, we'll see. I don't know. I'm not quite as pessimistic as Loki.
1219000	1225000	I don't think you're gonna have the fever around it that we have right now, at least this week.
1225000	1229000	But I think in about a month's time, I think people will still be playing it.
1229000	1234000	You know, people might say, oh, once a week we're gonna go out and hunt Pokemon together. Like, it might become a thing for some people.
1234000	1238000	Thank God there's no fucking Sojourner equivalent in this game.
1238000	1243000	But I think for the most part, it's gonna, I think it'll still be a thing.
1243000	1248000	And I think, you know what's funny? Go listen to the very first show that was put out this year.
1248000	1253000	Not to swell my ego too much, but, you know, once in a while I have to pat myself on the back.
1253000	1259000	We did our predictions for the year, and I said on that show, I said Pokemon Go is gonna be the biggest mobile phone game of all time.
1259000	1264000	And if what we're seeing this week is any indication, absolutely right on that call.
1264000	1266000	It's way too early for that.
1266000	1270000	Bigger than Candy Crush? Bigger than Draw Something? Absolutely.
1270000	1275000	No, I think it's gonna just fizz out in a couple weeks.
1275000	1281000	Can't wait to see where we're at six months from now, where they're adding Gen 3 or 4 Pokemon into the game and people are still-
1281000	1287000	Make it more interesting. Like, I don't know. I just, I understand that, yes, Niantic will add updates and stuff.
1287000	1297000	But, dude, like, the way the app has been released so far is, it just like, network issues aside, it is just fucking broken.
1297000	1301000	Like, why is that acceptable for any publisher at all?
1301000	1310000	I thought the whole reason you have this beta test was to fix the problems, not rush it out because, oh, god damn it, we need to, you know, get those people to pay for, you know.
1310000	1315000	I was surprised it came out as soon as it did. I was thinking it wasn't gonna be till the end of the month.
1315000	1319000	Yeah, I was like, you know, when this thing ended, I'm like, dude, this thing needs time to cook.
1319000	1324000	I mean, even by the end of July, I think it's gonna be too quick and then they're like, oh, hey, it's coming out tomorrow.
1324000	1328000	It's like, holy shit, why? Why would you do that?
1328000	1335000	You know, ActDeft does remind of an interesting point. Loki, you have to keep in mind, Pokemon Go hasn't gotten an official international release.
1335000	1336000	Yeah, and you-
1336000	1337000	Not all people in the world have it.
1337000	1342000	You know why? Because they're like, holy shit, this shit is fucking broken and that's why they, like, stop their-
1342000	1344000	So, we're all beta testing it here in the States.
1344000	1347000	Yeah, we're beta test number two, I guess.
1347000	1362000	Huh, interesting. Well, we'll see what develops. I still think this game is here to stay, but I do agree that it's got a lot of broken stuff, but I think Niantic's track record shows they're gonna evolve it, lol.
1362000	1369000	The game will continue and I think there will be more of a game in there pretty soon for people to use their caught Pokemon.
1369000	1372000	We'll see. We'll see what develops with this.
1372000	1377000	Again, if you guys want to chat along with the show, live.vognetwork.com and we'll take your calls later.
1377000	1380000	I'm sure some of you want to talk about Pokemon Go later on. We'll take your calls.
1380000	1384000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, but-
1384000	1388000	Well, I also did have the event for next week.
1388000	1389000	Sure.
1389000	1390000	It's gonna say what it was.
1390000	1392000	Yeah, go ahead. I wanted to finish a thought on Pokemon Go, but-
1392000	1393000	Oh, sorry.
1393000	1394000	No, that's okay. Go ahead.
1394000	1408000	It's a game merge that it's gonna be held in our Sacramento area and it's produced by IDGA Sacramento and Women Who Code Sacramento, so that's awesome.
1408000	1409000	And you're gonna be at that?
1409000	1410000	I'm gonna be a judge.
1410000	1411000	Meet Dark Sakura.
1411000	1413000	Make your game not suck.
1413000	1414000	Awesome.
1414000	1416000	I'm a strict judge.
1416000	1429000	What was the other thing I was gonna say about Pokemon Go? Oh, this is the other thing. One last thought on that is that, you know, I still think the social phenomenon that's going on with this game is not to be ignored and it's huge.
1429000	1434000	I mean, everybody's talking about this game that has a remote interest in video games.
1435000	1453000	It's going to- and the reason why I say gaming is forever changed this week, and even though Loki kind of laughs at that because the game's a little bit broken, you know every other company out there, especially ones that make mobile games and shitty ones at that, are looking at how do we make the next Pokemon Go?
1453000	1460000	And there's gonna be so many knockoffs of this game coming your way real soon. Real soon.
1460000	1467000	And I'm not even talking about the obvious stuff, like I'm sure there's a lot of people going, oh, LOL, there could be a Digimon game or-
1467000	1469000	I would quit Pokemon Go for a Digimon game.
1469000	1479000	Or whatever other Mon games are out there, but I think, you know, any successful cell phone game is usually followed by clones. Look at what fucking happened to Flappy Bird.
1479000	1481000	Ooh, we're gonna catch some Skylanders soon?
1481000	1489000	Yep, yep. You know every other company is looking at this going, why didn't we fucking think of that? So-
1489000	1493000	Because you're fucking dumb, because Ingress has been out for three years, you stupid idiots!
1493000	1503000	Well, but, you know, again, without sounding too hipster grandpa-y, Ingress players built that network that Niantic is profiting off of big time.
1503000	1508000	Yeah, prof for my fucking paycheck, where's my fucking paycheck?
1508000	1510000	You get paid in bursters.
1510000	1512000	No I'm not.
1512000	1514000	I don't take payment in bursters.
1515000	1523000	Fifth Dream in chat says, Final Fantasy Go. Dardichia says, Puzzle and Dragons Go. Fifth Dream says, I would battle flans everywhere.
1523000	1528000	Stoppy says, Oregon Trail Go. You could actually go down the Oregon Trail.
1528000	1531000	I don't know if I want to go down the Oregon Trail.
1535000	1543000	Let's see, Kaijuto says, Pokemon Go is a ripoff of Invisimals for the PSP and Vita, so it's been ripped off already. Oh, interesting.
1543000	1545000	Yeah, but Invisimals is crap.
1547000	1552000	AgDef says, Your paycheck is with every Oculus Rift backers check for selling to Facebook.
1554000	1562000	Alright, we'll see what develops with Pokemon Go in the coming weeks. I kind of think- I'm interested to see the news stories.
1562000	1569000	I did like the funny, you know, because people are making funny photoshops and stuff like that, so Dark Souls Go.
1571000	1572000	That's really funny.
1572000	1582000	I like- well, I don't like, but I think it's interesting that there's all this stuff in the media. Like, you know, a girl finds body by the river because she was trying to look for a Pikachu or whatever it was.
1582000	1593000	So there's that. There's the whole unfortunate story about people are using the lure on the Pokestops to actually lure people out of their houses to rob them while the Pokemon lure is going.
1593000	1598000	I'm like, that's kind of- that's actually really clever, even though it's really fucked up.
1598000	1599000	Yeah, you can't catch your wallet.
1599000	1603000	So, don't steal things, assholes. It's not nice.
1604000	1615000	Alright, we're going to get to the rest of our show, but of course every week we like to start off with a little bit of how was your gaming week, and what other games have you been playing this week besides Pokemon Go?
1615000	1617000	If anything, Dark Sakura.
1618000	1622000	Other than Pokemon Go? Well, some Ingress.
1626000	1638000	Oh yeah, Sims 4. I'm building houses. I'm going to fill a whole town full of nothing but pretty Sims that I make, and that's kind of it right now.
1638000	1645000	Alright. Yeah, Pokemon Go took up a lot of my week too, so I didn't end up playing an awful, awful lot, but let's check in with Loki first.
1647000	1654000	You know, with Konami in mobile games, maybe we can see, you know, like, a mobile game from them, like Pokemon Go.
1654000	1655000	Oh, P.T. Go.
1655000	1658000	P.T. Go. Silent Hills Go.
1659000	1660000	That'd be fun.
1660000	1661000	That'd be cool.
1661000	1675000	You know, I have a problem. I really do have a problem. That problem is with clicker game addiction, and unfortunately I have played way too much fucking Tap my Katamari.
1676000	1684000	Fuck you for bringing that into my life, by the way. Fuck you. Fuck you a hundred times or something hard and sandpapery because I can't stop playing that game either.
1684000	1685000	I hate you.
1685000	1692000	It's a good time sink because Pokemon Go wasn't fucking working, so I couldn't play it from my house like I used to, but, um, yes.
1692000	1700000	It's just like, it's got that where you set yourself like a goal, okay, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna level this up a little bit.
1701000	1702000	Oh, wait, I got some more money.
1702000	1709000	Okay, well, I got to spend that money because, I mean, you know, you want to have the most cousins rolling while you're not playing, and then you get more money.
1709000	1715000	Oh, well, I got to spend that money too, and it just fucking goes forever, and it never stops.
1716000	1720000	I'm still playing it because it's entertaining, so whatever, you know, it's fine.
1721000	1730000	And then, yeah, I played a little bit of Ingress because that's required, and a little bit of Pokemon Go just because, you know, it's kind of sucks.
1730000	1741000	I actually leveled myself to, well, I leveled to five. I had leveled to four before on another, so I had an account through Pokemon Club, and their servers are fucked, so I was like, fuck this.
1741000	1753000	I could wait until this, you know, gets fixed, which could be forever, or I'll just create one through Google Play, which, you know, my Google account is usually easier to log into, so I did that.
1753000	1759000	I created another account, and I thought, oh shit, you know, now I'm gonna have to come up with a new username and all that.
1759000	1765000	Nope, it fucking let me have the same username, so I don't know how that's possible, but whatever.
1766000	1772000	So yeah, so I created a new account, leveled it up to five, so now I have one that's four and one that's five.
1772000	1779000	The four probably never get played again, but I'm surprised it let me do that, and yeah.
1780000	1787000	I have no intention to spend any money in this game whatsoever because those prices in that fucking store are fucking ridiculous.
1787000	1790000	Oh, but let's put that $99 option out there.
1790000	1797000	Yeah, but every game has an obscene, you know, money to spend cost thing in it, you know.
1797000	1801000	Like Tap My Katamari, doesn't that have like a $75 candy bin or something?
1801000	1811000	Yes, but, I mean, if you're willing to watch the ads, which I did, and actually I'd like to get on a tangent about that too, since I do play a lot of it, so I watch a lot of the ads.
1811000	1818000	Or I shouldn't say I watch a lot of the ads, I actually take a break from looking at the screen for about 30 seconds while those ads are playing, but I did actually see a lot of them.
1818000	1824000	And holy shit, do all the mobile games that are on those ads, like all the fucking same.
1824000	1830000	And there's like some shit I'm like, what the fuck kind of game? Do people actually play this shit?
1830000	1843000	Like they had some Willy Wonka slot machine thing, which it's kind of cool that it was the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka, so not the Johnny Depp one, but what the hell?
1843000	1851000	I mean, there's like some weird lotto shit on there, you know, people are getting pissed off at Counter Strike gambling and shit, and then they've got all this lottery shit on there.
1851000	1858000	I don't know. A lot of really crappy games on there. And then fucking Angry Birds has like a fucking Bust-A-Move game now.
1858000	1864000	So, I don't know, that's weird. But yeah, I'm not going to play any of those games either, so.
1864000	1873000	But I'll take the free candy, and you know, they dole it out so often that it doesn't really matter, you don't need to pay real money to get that stuff.
1875000	1876000	That's it.
1876000	1880000	Alright, before I get to my gaming week, I have an important announcement for Dark Sakura.
1880000	1881000	Uh oh.
1881000	1891000	That Raichu's back, and it's showing three feet somewhere from the ice. You're going to have to go to the park to find it or something, it's showing, it's a ways away, but it's in the radar.
1892000	1901000	Dark Sakura may leave the show. For the first time ever, Dark Sakura may leave the show, right in the middle of it, to go find her fucking Raichu.
1901000	1907000	Don't even try me, I am, uh, fuck.
1909000	1910000	Would you really be mad?
1910000	1912000	Dude, like seriously, like, since we started-
1912000	1916000	You're really leaving to go get the fucking Raichu. She's gone. She's going.
1916000	1921000	You know, since we started this show, that gym has changed colors twice already.
1921000	1923000	Yeah, I know, I know, it's crazy.
1923000	1926000	I am doing the right thing. I put down the phone.
1928000	1931000	Dark Sakura changed her mind, she will not be hunting the Raichu right now. Alright.
1931000	1933000	It better be there tonight.
1933000	1934000	Ah, tangled!
1934000	1935000	Oh cool, I'm almost level six.
1935000	1947000	Alright, anyway, um, so unlike Loki, I may have spent twenty dollars on Pokemon Go, and I may be level eleven already, which is really nothing compared to most people right now in that game.
1947000	1954000	Like, I couldn't really play the damn game for the first two days, so it wasn't really until this weekend when I was able to really start playing, so-
1954000	1956000	Yeah, I think the leveling must be-
1956000	1958000	Oh, it's completely different than it was in the beta. It's much faster.
1958000	1963000	Yeah, the beta, that's probably why I only got the level, the level seven or whatever, I don't know what the equivalent was.
1963000	1970000	Well, in the beta, they gave you great balls at level two, ultra balls at level three, and all that stuff, right? Great balls are at level twelve now.
1970000	1972000	So, they definitely changed-
1972000	1975000	But everything seems a lot easier to catch, so that's kinda nice.
1975000	1976000	That's true too.
1976000	1990000	It's none of that, oh hey rat, hey, let's uh, hey Pidgey, how about you jump out of that fuckin' ball like eighty times, oh hey, or like, you know, you throw like a master ball at it or something, and it's like, yeah, fuck you, I'm just gonna jump out of this anyways, even though you got a nice throw and all that.
1991000	1997000	So, yeah, it seems like some balancing and tweaking has happened there.
1997000	2007000	As far as other games I've been playing this week that aren't Pokemon GO, I've been playing Pokemon 3DS, actually. I'm continuing my quest in Alpha Sapphire.
2007000	2017000	I have definitely progressed more in that game than any other Pokemon game that I've played, save for maybe Pokemon Yellow, so at least in a very long time, so there is that.
2017000	2025000	Other ways, when it comes to like console stuff, I played a little bit more Grand Theft Auto, but not a lot, and then some other random console stuff, but nothing really new.
2025000	2035000	I didn't really get into any other new games this week, so same thing with PC, I played a few matches of Overwatch, Alan's been really into the ranked mode thing.
2035000	2040000	I am still not level twenty-five, cause I can't binge play that game the way other people do.
2040000	2045000	I play a match or two, and I'm like, okay, I'm good, I'm done, I don't need to, I need to play a ton more.
2045000	2051000	But, you know, Overwatch is still a thing that I'm playing a couple times a week, even if just for a little bit.
2051000	2054000	So, that's really it for my gaming week.
2054000	2063000	So for housekeeping, since Darsakha got her plug-in, I don't really have a lot else left, just a reminder we won't be here Labor Day weekend, but that's still a good six weeks away.
2063000	2065000	So, that's that.
2065000	2068000	Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
2068000	2072000	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2073000	2076000	All that being said, let's get into some other gaming news.
2076000	2079000	Things happened in the gaming industry that wasn't just Pokemon this week.
2079000	2081000	So, let's get into it. Loki.
2081000	2083000	Alright. Man, I'm full.
2083000	2090000	Anyways, so Blizzard is going after some creators of some Overwatch cheats.
2090000	2101000	So they have a cheat program that basically you pay a subscription to this company, and they give you special abilities, like the ability to see people on the map.
2102000	2109000	Different, I guess, aside from map hacks and stuff.
2109000	2117000	I don't know, but they were charging $1450 a month, so now they're going after the actual company that's making that.
2117000	2124000	And they kind of did something similar, I think, with their MOBA game as well.
2124000	2127000	I think they had something like that, some other cheating thing.
2128000	2139000	But the suit, basically they're using the DMCA, you know, as the reason for the case since, you know, obviously they had to reverse engineer something to get it to work.
2140000	2144000	But yeah. Cheaters suck.
2144000	2148000	And basically they're gonna, you know, ban people that are caught using this.
2148000	2156000	The interesting thing is, though, that the company, I think I was reading about it, maybe on another site, says that there's nothing Blizzard can do.
2156000	2161000	Because they're in Germany or something, and so they're not subject to the laws here.
2161000	2166000	So Blizzard can basically go suck it, is what the cheating company is saying.
2166000	2172000	And I agree, cheaters suck, and Blizzard needs to put the ban hammer on people that are using this software, but, you know.
2172000	2176000	I don't know if that works if they're doing business, though, in the United States.
2176000	2180000	Yeah, I mean, again, that's just what they say, is that they're immune.
2180000	2184000	That doesn't mean they really are, because you're right, if they're selling it in the United States, then they're kind of...
2184000	2187000	And plus, Blizzard also has a presence overseas.
2187000	2190000	They also had a bot for Diablo, was the other thing, Diablo 3.
2190000	2200000	They had a bot, and apparently they had the company that made that actually won against Blizzard in Europe in 2013 for their honor bot.
2200000	2201000	Really?
2201000	2202000	For honor buddy bot.
2202000	2208000	I seem to remember that came up on the show a while ago, so I kind of wonder if that sets a precedent.
2208000	2214000	And they also had a storm buddy heroes, or storm buddy bot that was for Heroes of the Storm.
2214000	2216000	And they, I guess, won against them as well.
2216000	2221000	Well, hey, shit, if you've won twice against Blizzard so far, I guess it wouldn't be a stretch that you win a third time.
2221000	2225000	Alright, but don't let Blizzard catch you using that software, they're probably gonna ban you.
2225000	2227000	So, enjoy that.
2227000	2234000	Let's talk about something a little more positive, and something that's awesome, and that is breaking games legitimately.
2234000	2237000	And something that was on full display this past week.
2237000	2246000	We talked about it a little bit on last week's show, but Summer Games Done Quick happened during this past week, and it officially ended yesterday.
2246000	2259000	Grand total, $1,295,326 raised for charity, which was the Doctors Without Borders charity, I think based in France.
2259000	2260000	Because it had a different name.
2260000	2261000	Medicines Sans Frontieres.
2261000	2263000	That's it, thank you very much.
2263000	2269000	And, just in case you were wondering, Kill the Animals did end up winning for Super Metroid for this year's speedrun.
2269000	2271000	So, they died.
2271000	2274000	But don't worry, they're only pixels, and they do come back in one of the later games.
2274000	2276000	Metroid Fusion.
2276000	2289000	Also, let's see, they did announce the dates for the next awesome games done quick, which will be January 8th of 2017 through January 15th of 2017.
2289000	2293000	Did you guys watch any of the Summer Games, er, yeah, Summer Games Done Quick? What did you guys think?
2293000	2295000	Cool like it always is.
2295000	2296000	Yeah.
2296000	2298000	Pepsi Man!
2298000	2302000	Everybody's talking about this Pepsi Man thing. I didn't see it.
2302000	2303000	You guys were watching it.
2303000	2304000	It's pretty funny.
2304000	2307000	Yeah? Is it like one of those games that's so bad it's good type of thing?
2307000	2311000	Yeah, it was a game that came out in Japan on PlayStation 1, I want to say.
2311000	2321000	And, it was all in English. They had like Japanese text on the bottom, but it was all voice acted in English, and they had these really terrible cutscenes, like full motion video cutscenes.
2321000	2330000	With some like, redneck looking guy just drinking Pepsi and talking about Pepsi, and it was stupid. It had nothing to do with the game.
2330000	2332000	Huh. Interesting.
2332000	2333000	And the game itself is just weird.
2333000	2334000	I'll have to see it on YouTube.
2334000	2340000	It's like, you run and run and you avoid obstacles. It's kind of Paperboy-like. Except you just run.
2341000	2351000	I did watch the one I watched the biggest chunk of. We actually, yesterday after our Pokemon run downtown, we came back here to cool off for a little bit. We were watching Summer Games done quick.
2351000	2359000	I saw a little bit of the Pokemon Red run that they were doing. I saw just the very beginning of that, and I thought that was interesting.
2359000	2368000	Because, you know, I didn't realize you could beat so many Pokemon without really leveling anything. I kind of thought that was something you had to do, but they sure knew their way around that.
2369000	2376000	But then I also watched quite a bit, probably a good hour, of the Final Fantasy 6 speedrun that they were doing yesterday.
2376000	2380000	And so that was pretty cool to see, because they have to bug out the game in some places.
2380000	2387000	So like, Locke ends up wearing the merchant outfit that he steals for like, a good chunk of the game.
2387000	2389000	And there's just other interesting little ways that they kind of...
2389000	2390000	That'd be kind of cool to watch.
2390000	2393000	Yeah, there's other ways that they kind of break that game that I thought were really interesting.
2393000	2397000	I was looking for, like, I heard they had some pretty cool stuff with Taskbot this year again.
2397000	2402000	But I was trying to search, because I normally watch it just through the archives, because I never catch it when it's on.
2402000	2407000	But, you know, I wanted to watch what they did this year with Taskbot.
2407000	2415000	Yeah, actually I'm hearing a lot about how Tetris the Grandmaster getting a lot of props for that.
2415000	2421000	And of course, you know, I know one of the guys who used to listen to OLR a bit is now really heavily involved with that.
2421000	2423000	So that's pretty cool how that all runs around.
2423000	2431000	A lot of folks... I didn't see this, but I certainly saw the response on Twitter and Facebook and so forth.
2431000	2434000	SHO 100 Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2434000	2438000	The moment where the disabled gamer completed that indie game one-handed.
2438000	2442000	He gave a really emotional speech after doing an amazing job on his run.
2442000	2447000	I didn't see it, so it's hard for me to comment on, but I'm gonna have to find that.
2447000	2449000	Because a lot of folks on Twitter were saying the same thing.
2449000	2452000	I guess donated during that and they had called it out or something.
2452000	2457000	Oh, did he? Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. I heard he donated, but I didn't realize it was during that. That's awesome.
2457000	2462000	It was some of the Super Mario RPG stuff was pretty cool, too.
2462000	2469000	So getting the 12 flowers in the Bowser chase or the... what was the guy's name?
2469000	2473000	I can never remember the bad guy who kidnapped Peach right at the beginning.
2473000	2478000	Bust Boomer? Buster? Anyway, chasing him down.
2478000	2484000	And someone accurately predicted out loud like how many flowers would get there in that chase. It was pretty fun.
2484000	2488000	It was neat. Yeah, those guys really know that game inside and out.
2488000	2491000	Or those games, anything they're speedrunning, they know them inside and out.
2491000	2495000	So it was pretty cool to see. So big props to everyone involved with that.
2495000	2499000	And we'll be talking about it again in six months when it's time for awesome games done quick.
2499000	2503000	Fingers crossed for our buddy Flocko and his submission for P.T.
2503000	2506000	I think he said he's going to try it every time until he gets in, so we'll see what happens.
2506000	2509000	Meanwhile, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
2509000	2517000	Well, we have hit a year anniversary since Iwata passed away.
2517000	2521000	I always hate the term passed away. I just prefer died.
2521000	2526000	Because why should you lessen the impact of something like that that happens?
2527000	2529000	You know? But that's me.
2529000	2534000	Anyway, it has been a year as of...
2534000	2539000	Well, it's already July 11th in Japan, I believe.
2539000	2544000	So it's been a year over there since everything went down.
2544000	2548000	And it just makes me wonder, what do you think about Nintendo now?
2548000	2551000	Kind of the direction it's going in.
2551000	2554000	Or even just seeing Pokemon go, I mean.
2554000	2558000	Yeah, right. Actually, that was an interesting tweet I saw yesterday.
2558000	2567000	Not to be too much of a downer, but it's a real bummer that Iwata can't see the cultural impact that Pokemon Go is having right now.
2567000	2571000	But in a way, even though it's a really sad thing to say, in a way it's also kind of uplifting.
2571000	2575000	It's like, oh, but he knew that that was going to happen.
2575000	2579000	And he'd probably be really thrilled that people are responding to it the way that they are.
2579000	2582000	So in a way, it's actually a little bit uplifting, I think.
2582000	2584000	I've had them look forward to it.
2584000	2589000	Yes. But I wonder how he'd feel about the NX delay.
2589000	2593000	I think that ended up happening a little later.
2593000	2595000	Then that one would be, it can't be helped.
2595000	2603000	I think there's a lot of people definitely still thinking about Iwata and just the impact that he's had on gaming that's going to be felt for a very, very long time.
2603000	2608000	It's very similar to when Steve Jobs passed for Apple.
2608000	2614000	The last product that he had worked on didn't come out for several years until after.
2614000	2619000	So again, not to be a downer, but these things happen.
2619000	2630000	So it's going to be several years before Iwata's presence on the gaming industry truly fades and moves into a newer generation of Nintendo.
2630000	2635000	But anyway, a moment to tip our hats and remember Satoru Iwata one year later.
2635000	2640000	Well, that being said, let's move on. Loki.
2640000	2647000	All right. So this is pretty cool. Red Dead Redemption has finally made it to the Xbox One backwards compatibility.
2647000	2649000	And that was on Friday.
2649000	2653000	And they're actually offering it now if you're a gold member for $7.49.
2653000	2659000	And not only with that, you will also get some of the DLC for free.
2659000	2665000	So they've got the Myths and Mavericks bonus pack and Legends and Killers pack are free.
2665000	2670000	So go check that out and go play it if you have it on backwards compatibility, because it's awesome.
2670000	2675000	They even did like a thing with what was it?
2675000	2680000	The website that does all the like frame rate tests and stuff. Digital Foundry, I think.
2680000	2685000	They did a test on the frame rates and everything for the game.
2685000	2694000	And actually now it's all pretty much 30 frames per second consistently and not any sort of slowdowns or anything like they had before.
2694000	2697000	So definitely check it out.
2697000	2703000	Is that maybe why it kind of took a little longer for that to come out even though the beta had released some time?
2703000	2709000	Or not the beta. It kind of leaked out, remember, for like a day that Red Dead Redemption was going to be backwards compatible?
2709000	2713000	So they kind of were taking time to actually tweak some things and make it better?
2713000	2717000	Possibly. Maybe for the consistent frame rate.
2717000	2724000	But pretty much a lot of the games that are on backwards compatibility end up running better than they do on their original systems.
2724000	2730000	That's pretty cool though that it gives you a whole reason to go back and kind of look at it again, right?
2730000	2731000	Yep.
2731000	2733000	Alright.
2733000	2738000	Kaijuto in chat says, do yourself a favor and just buy the game of the year edition for cheap and play it that way.
2739000	2744000	But some of the add-ons are all included and stuff, right? With the backwards compatibility?
2744000	2749000	Yeah, so definitely if you can get it digitally that way, that would be a way to go.
2749000	2752000	It's a great game. Just play it if you haven't.
2752000	2757000	Alright, well moving on to another Nintendo game and that's Splatoon.
2757000	2763000	And as you guys know, Splatoon is in a way winding down because the Splatfest will be ending.
2763000	2766000	The last Splatfest is going to be on July 22nd.
2766000	2773000	We already talked a little bit about that last week and there's the whole Team Cali and Marie and all that and who's going to join what team.
2773000	2781000	But Nintendo did take a moment this week to just reiterate that they're not pulling support for online in Splatoon anytime soon.
2781000	2787000	They have said that the quote general online experience and service will continue.
2787000	2793000	So they're not ending the game or anything like that or going to pull the servers like EA would or something like that.
2793000	2797000	The game will continue for the foreseeable future.
2797000	2805000	Probably until the inevitable Splatoon 2 or Splatoon on NX or whatever it's going to be.
2805000	2809000	Because y'all know this game is getting a sequel because pretty much everybody who played it loved it.
2809000	2812000	So we'll see what develops with that.
2812000	2816000	And good luck to everybody on that final Splatfest that's happening in a couple weeks.
2816000	2822000	I was worried that it was happening this weekend because usually they announce it.
2822000	2825000	You pick your teams and it kind of happens the next weekend.
2825000	2827000	But they gave a really big lead time this time.
2827000	2831000	So you actually have until the weekend of the 22nd to do this.
2831000	2834000	So good luck everybody who's going to be doing that.
2834000	2837000	Alright, moving on before we get to release dates.
2837000	2838000	Dark Sakura.
2838000	2842000	Well I'm sure everyone knows I'm a big fan of the King of Fighters series.
2842000	2846000	And not so much Fatal Fury but I love the characters in it.
2847000	2854000	So coming out to Dead or Alive 5 is going to be Shiranui Mai.
2854000	2857000	Yes, everyone's favorite ninja lady.
2857000	2861000	Me bouncy! Because that's what she says when she wins the match.
2861000	2862000	That's not what she says.
2862000	2864000	She says, me bouncy!
2864000	2865000	That's not what she says.
2865000	2866000	She shows a little bounce.
2866000	2868000	That's not what she says.
2868000	2870000	That's what I always heard as a kid.
2872000	2874000	She says, me bouncy.
2874000	2876000	So, anyway.
2877000	2880000	But, she was also my favorite character to play and not because of that.
2880000	2884000	Because she was a badass with the flame kick and the fan throws and all that stuff.
2884000	2892000	Yeah, the whole thing that I kind of hope is that they were saying like a KOF versus Dead or Alive.
2892000	2896000	Is I'd like to see more of the King of Fighters folks in the game.
2896000	2899000	I'd love to actually see a full versus series.
2899000	2901000	That would be pretty awesome.
2902000	2906000	And also Team Ninja, well let me rewind.
2906000	2908000	She's going to be available in September.
2908000	2913000	Team Ninja is also adding in new costumes based on some of the KOF outfits.
2914000	2923000	And then this month there's also a bunch of costumes and a stage based on Shingeki no Kyojin Attack on Titan.
2924000	2926000	I watched the trailer for that.
2926000	2928000	It was pretty badass.
2928000	2930000	I have to say it looked pretty interesting.
2930000	2932000	So, there you go.
2934000	2940000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the pass phrase Zoo.
2941000	2944000	I'm getting some backup and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2944000	2947000	Fifth Dream in chat says, I always thought me bouncy too.
2947000	2950000	Oh good, it wasn't just my immature mind.
2950000	2953000	Dark Tetsuya says, I did use her in Fatal Fury Special.
2953000	2955000	I think that was my favorite installment.
2955000	2958000	Yeah, honestly Fatal Fury Special still is one of my favorite fighting games.
2958000	2960000	She first showed up in Fatal Fury 2.
2960000	2962000	Yeah, she was first in Fatal Fury 2.
2962000	2965000	But then of course I loved her in Capcom SNK 2 as well.
2965000	2969000	That's one of those games we used to play at Golf Land right after DDR.
2969000	2972000	It was Capcom SNK 2.
2972000	2976000	Oh man, I wish they would have made a 3 to this day.
2976000	2981000	I realize both companies are very different now, but that was a fighting game I'm always going to love.
2982000	2986000	I liked when their artists did each other's characters.
2986000	2988000	That was the best.
2988000	2991000	Oh yeah, because SNK vs Capcom is also kind of a trip.
2992000	2999000	I loved seeing the differences in the style and how awesome it was.
3000000	3004000	It's kind of a bummer we never got Tekken X Street Fighter.
3004000	3010000	I know we got Street Fighter X Tekken, but remember we were supposed to get Tekken X Street Fighter and that kind of didn't happen.
3011000	3013000	Yeah, you get Akuma.
3013000	3015000	Yeah, you get one character.
3015000	3016000	Are you satisfied?
3016000	3018000	No, I'm not.
3018000	3023000	Unless they're using that engine to then ultimately do Tekken X Street Fighter.
3023000	3026000	Unless there's going to be DLC that's Tekken X Street Fighter.
3026000	3029000	Oh, bite your tongue. Bite your tongue.
3029000	3039000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some things that you'll be playing a lot sooner than Tekken X Street Fighter, that's for sure.
3039000	3041000	Loki, starting in the US.
3041000	3043000	Alright, I know there's not a whole lot this week.
3044000	3051000	Let's see, so starting off, we've got, oh actually quite a bit.
3053000	3058000	So, 7th Dragon 3 code VFD on the 3DS.
3059000	3063000	Assault Suit Lanos on PC and Playstation 4.
3064000	3069000	They're doing a new Ghostbusters game that's going to be on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
3069000	3072000	Kerbal Space Program on Playstation 4.
3073000	3078000	Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Force on Playstation Vita.
3079000	3082000	Necropolis on PC, Mac and Linux.
3083000	3085000	Poly Bridge on PC, Mac and Linux.
3085000	3089000	Song of the Deep on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
3089000	3093000	Tumble Stone on PC, Playstation 4 and Wii U.
3093000	3098000	Under Night, In Birth, EXE, Late.
3099000	3102000	These are Japanese titles, seriously, just throw random words in there.
3103000	3105000	That's going to be coming out on PC.
3106000	3111000	And a game called Video Ball on PC, Mac and Linux, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
3112000	3115000	And then, we've got some more stuff coming out a little later in the week.
3116000	3119000	Push Me, Pull You on PC, Mac and Linux.
3119000	3124000	Adrift on Playstation 4, which is, that's almost like I think a VR title at some point.
3125000	3127000	But I guess it can be played without VR.
3128000	3131000	And then we have Monster Hunter Generations on 3DS.
3132000	3135000	And Obliteracers on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
3136000	3138000	Which I love that, I love that name by the way.
3139000	3142000	And then actually on the weekend, Tumble Stone on Xbox One.
3143000	3144000	And then that's it.
3144000	3147000	Alright, well traveling to Japan, it's kind of a different story with the releases.
3147000	3151000	Because as I was looking at the calendar, I was like, wow, there's nothing.
3151000	3156000	There's nothing on Playstation 4, there's nothing on Wii U, there's like nothing coming out in Japan.
3156000	3161000	But then I got to the 3DS and I realized why there is nothing else coming out this week.
3161000	3169000	Because out this week in Japan, Yokai Watch 3 version Sushi and version Tempura are both out.
3169000	3173000	Yes, those are the names of the two versions. Sushi and Tempura.
3174000	3176000	I'm a big Tempura fan. I like fried fatty foods.
3177000	3178000	Team Sushi.
3179000	3182000	So, Yokai Watch 3, Sushi and Tempura are out on the DS this week.
3183000	3186000	I realize those games did alright here, but they're huge in Japan.
3187000	3193000	You know, all those Splatfest names and titles, they're really just testing out subtitles for the new Pokemon games.
3193000	3194000	Perhaps.
3194000	3196000	You're going to have Pokemon Hot Dog, Pokemon Ice Cream, and...
3197000	3199000	Pokemon Callie and Pokemon Marie? I don't know about that.
3200000	3202000	Pokemon Autobots, Pokemon Decepticons.
3204000	3207000	Stoppy in chat says, I'm waiting for Yokai Watch McRib.
3208000	3210000	So, this is kind of cool, to interrupt the show.
3211000	3214000	So, someone apparently is battling a Pokemon at the gym right now and I can actually see...
3215000	3217000	Yeah, you can see the animation in the scanner.
3218000	3219000	Oh yeah, it's pretty cool.
3219000	3227000	Yeah, when a fight is actually happening at a gym, you see like a little puff cloud of smoke and electricity and stuff coming off the gym, like there's a fight going on.
3228000	3230000	Like, you know, cartoons of cats and dogs fighting, that whole thing.
3231000	3232000	Yeah, it's pretty funny.
3233000	3234000	Oh, like fights in the Sims?
3235000	3236000	Gang, fight, gang, fight.
3237000	3246000	Oh my gosh, it almost, like, every time you see that happening, don't you just want to run down to the park and go, nerds!
3246000	3249000	Even though you're totally a nerd too, like...
3250000	3251000	Oh, it's a Nidorino.
3252000	3259000	Anyhow, let's see, going back, Tigerclaw says, Skye, have any of you guys found any Pokemon at the OLR studio?
3260000	3262000	You must have missed the very beginning of the show, Tigerclaw.
3263000	3267000	I caught an Eevee on the table, a Caterpie in the bathroom, and I just caught a Nidorino.
3267000	3282000	I did catch, I want to say I did catch a water Pokemon in a gutter, apparently, because I was on a walking trail, and there was like some drain runoff that was right there, and I guess there was like a seal bathing in the drain runoff.
3283000	3290000	I got a Staryu, whatever those things are, I got one of those today at a winery. Those are the water types I can go for.
3291000	3292000	I just got a Pidgey on my computer.
3293000	3294000	Congrats.
3294000	3305000	Alright, let's see, Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I wonder if Loki is going to run out and go, what are you doing? There isn't fun! This isn't a game yet! Stop it!
3308000	3310000	He very well might. Don't tempt him.
3313000	3314000	There's a Flareon up there now.
3315000	3319000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3319000	3325000	Loki, what do you got for us first, while I catch this Nidorino, which is very important because I don't have this in my Pokedex yet.
3326000	3337000	I like the people's names, though, that are on that gem. Sarah's Got Balls, Lifted Ideas, and Ricky the Prowler. If that doesn't sound like a pedophile name, I don't know what will.
3338000	3346000	I love some of the Pokemon names. Like, I'm sure a lot of you have seen that story about the Pidgey that was on the White House that's called Murica, right?
3347000	3349000	And then somebody put a...
3350000	3357000	Can you see the Pokemon names? Because I had, like before in the beta, I had a... was it a Raticate that was Donald Trump?
3358000	3364000	On the gems you can. Yeah, and somebody has a Pokemon somewhere called Fuck Trump that was on a gem. I don't remember, I just saw that floating around on Twitter.
3365000	3367000	You saw one too. Is the Westboro Church had one?
3368000	3370000	Yeah, that's Love is Love with the Clefairy.
3371000	3372000	Appropriate. Love it.
3372000	3379000	If I got a Pikachu, I would name it after this old, like, Flash animation that was out in late 1999, and call him Fuckachu.
3381000	3389000	It was this guy who turned himself into a Pokemon named Calic. It was the dumbest thing ever. I have it somewhere on a hard drive.
3390000	3395000	Act F'ed is correcting you in Chat Dark Soccer. It was a Clefable, not a Clefairy.
3396000	3398000	Whatever! It's one of the pink ones that I don't like.
3399000	3405000	However, I will have everybody know, I accomplished something I couldn't ever accomplish in the beta on day one.
3406000	3407000	Did you become the very best?
3408000	3412000	Yes, because I caught a Pikachu, which for some reason, I fucking live in a neighborhood of Pikachus. I'm not complaining.
3413000	3416000	But I also caught the very first day, Jigglypuff. Thank you, goodnight.
3417000	3422000	It's the one Pokemon I wanted. I got a Jigglypuff. Jigglypuff was like the fifth Pokemon I got.
3423000	3426000	No one can see that. Rob just pulled a Gia gun.
3426000	3432000	There's a reason why we're not a video show here at Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, Loki, what's Loki got for us in the news before we wrap things up?
3433000	3436000	More exciting news than actual Pokemon Go.
3437000	3438000	Did I do my game releases? I didn't?
3439000	3441000	Oh, no you didn't. So we should go to the UK first.
3442000	3443000	Yeah, I guess.
3444000	3446000	Meanwhile, I will sit here and name Pokemon after drag queens.
3447000	3451000	Oh my god, that's what we should do. We should just give them like, just make up drag names anyway.
3451000	3456000	Just the same rules apply as was at, um, it was a horse game.
3457000	3459000	Oh, um, uh, Derby Owners Club.
3460000	3461000	Yeah, the same rules apply as Derby Owners Club.
3462000	3463000	Rob had Politary.
3464000	3465000	I did, I had Politary.
3466000	3468000	Raichu is now the closest Pokemon showing on my radar.
3469000	3471000	What? Oh, girl. I've got Incense on right now.
3472000	3473000	We gotta get to break.
3473000	3475000	On the 13th is Fru for Xbox One.
3476000	3479000	And the 15th, Ghostbusters on three different systems.
3480000	3482000	And Obliteracers, which is actually kind of a neat name.
3483000	3484000	Okay, I'm done. Loki.
3486000	3487000	Alright. So, um.
3488000	3489000	Bitch better show up.
3490000	3494000	No more delays in the future. It is coming. No Man's Sky has gone gold.
3495000	3501000	And they posted to Twitter showing, hey, look, we got this wonderful DVD, Blu-ray that we're gonna, you know, have them press.
3501000	3505000	And, yeah, woo! So it is coming now, August 9th.
3506000	3507000	Congratulations. You did it.
3508000	3509000	Yes.
3509000	3512000	Oh, shit, we lost the DVD. Or the Blu-ray. No, I'm just kidding.
3513000	3516000	It failed Sony quality check. We have to go back to it.
3519000	3522000	So, I'm excited. I can't wait to play that.
3523000	3526000	Yeah, it's about time. Because I've been looking forward to that game.
3527000	3528000	It was supposed to be out for my birthday. That didn't happen.
3528000	3530000	So, now, now I will get it in the coming weeks.
3531000	3534000	But, but, but, but you got Mighty No. 9.
3535000	3536000	Mighty No. 2.
3537000	3538000	I can't wait.
3539000	3547000	Actually, although, if, you know, Captain Spike over at Gameboi.org, they did, which is also here on the VOG Network, they did a show on Mighty No. 9 recently.
3548000	3554000	And they kind of, you know, Spike said he played it and it's not bad. Like, the internet is really giving this game way too much shit.
3555000	3556000	The internet is wrong.
3556000	3557000	What's that?
3558000	3559000	The internet is wrong.
3560000	3561000	Believe, imagine that. The internet is wrong.
3562000	3563000	I just caught a vetinet on your butt.
3564000	3570000	Oh, God. I imagine, at the end of the day, it's probably just not the game people expected it to be.
3571000	3573000	Well, it's probably not what the footage they showed originally was.
3574000	3577000	I doubt it's Pepsiman bad. Like, that's probably the point.
3578000	3579000	There's worse games than Pepsiman.
3580000	3583000	Yeah, Pepsiman. I think that was a better game than Mighty No. 9.
3583000	3585000	I think Temple Run was actually inspired by Pepsiman.
3586000	3592000	Well, I don't know if you guys love this game or hate this game, but you're going to have a real easy way to try this game out soon, and that is the game Evolve.
3593000	3597000	You remember Evolve? That came out not that long ago. It was a 4v1 type of game.
3598000	3606000	Well, what's interesting about the future of Evolve is that Evolve is going to be going free to play, at least on PC.
3607000	3618000	You know, Turtle Rock, who developed the game, has said a lot of very interesting things about the game, and they even called some of the things that happened behind the game a, quote, DLC shitstorm.
3619000	3627000	So, there's going to be balance changes, UI improvements, map improvements, bug fixes, customization, and all that stuff.
3628000	3632000	On July 7th, all that package will be free as a beta to test server loads.
3632000	3641000	If you have previously bought the game, you are now a founder, and your content will transfer, and you're supposed to get some other type of extra gifts at some point.
3642000	3650000	Turtle Rock also saying if this is successful on PC, they are considering transferring it over to consoles as well.
3651000	3657000	So, we'll see. It's going to be interesting to see how this changes the game and what it could do to sequel potentials.
3657000	3665000	Be very curious about that, because I kind of figured this game was going to be getting a sequel, but maybe that's going to be in question now. We'll see.
3666000	3673000	Anyway, let's travel back to a time when, you know what, there wasn't, free to play games, no such thing.
3674000	3680000	No such thing. You would pay $40 for shit Atari 2600 games that were completely commercialized, like the Purina.
3681000	3682000	Purina Chuck Weiningen.
3683000	3685000	Okay, she went a little more recent than that.
3686000	3695000	But, anyway, every week here on the show, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you little shits, stop capturing your caterpies.
3696000	3699000	Stop capturing them and become partners with them.
3700000	3701000	And enjoy this classic game of the week.
3702000	3703000	Get chosen.
3704000	3705000	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
3706000	3707000	Digimon World.
3708000	3709000	I see what you did there.
3709000	3715000	Digimon World is, it was put up by Bandai on PlayStation. It released in 1999.
3716000	3725000	And it's about being a, you know, having a partner Digimon and raising them and helping save their island.
3726000	3734000	So, you start off as a person who is brought to File City on File Island by Digimon to save everybody there.
3734000	3740000	The Digimon were losing their memories and turning feral, and so you have to help save them.
3741000	3744000	You have to recover their memory and return back to the city.
3745000	3753000	So, you raise a single Digimon from its egg form, going into all the different levels of it.
3756000	3762000	After a while, it will start to fade with age and then turn back to an egg, so you have to raise it again.
3762000	3770000	But as you go through the game, it's actually based on certain questions depend on if you start with Agumon or Gabumon.
3771000	3778000	So, it was pretty, you know, I mean the game itself, it was really a game for the fans.
3779000	3782000	They had a crazy, crazy marketing campaign to compete with Pokemon.
3783000	3787000	Because at the time, yeah, that was around when Pokemon Red and Blue were both out.
3788000	3790000	There was a Digimon trading card game that came out with this.
3790000	3796000	And then the game actually, the trading card game actually came out with Digimon World 2 in 2000.
3797000	3803000	It didn't get the highest rating for Famitsu. It got a 23 out of 40.
3804000	3811000	But it sold well enough in the US to get a greatest hits release in a platinum range in Europe.
3811000	3815000	But it really was just a game made for the fans.
3816000	3822000	Because you'd have to know more about, I think, the series to be able to really get the game.
3823000	3827000	And I've played through it. I actually really enjoyed it, but I was also a pretty diehard Digimon fan.
3828000	3833000	It was really neat and it had other versions that came out.
3833000	3841000	There was Digimon World DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, Digimon World Data Squad, and Digimon World Championship.
3842000	3853000	Even though they weren't really official games that were in the series, they were just localized that way.
3853000	3859000	There was Digimon World Re-Digitized, where it came for PSP.
3860000	3867000	And then there was Digimon World Next Order that came out in 2015 for Vita.
3868000	3874000	And there was also, I was trying to find the thing on it.
3875000	3881000	There was the Digimon V, what was it? Barcode Scanner. Do you remember that?
3881000	3887000	Where this one brand of cereal would give you the best stats ever.
3888000	3895000	It was crazy, but I was always a bigger fan of Digimon than Pokemon, especially in terms of watching the anime.
3896000	3901000	I liked the concept better. I didn't like that they're not your little pets.
3902000	3906000	I liked that you actually teamed up with them and they could communicate with you.
3907000	3908000	I liked the whole series better.
3908000	3916000	Digimon World and I want a new Digimon game. I've been totally enjoying watching Digimon Adventure Try.
3917000	3918000	So, there you go.
3919000	3920000	Done.
3921000	3924000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
3925000	3932000	Digimon World on the PlayStation. What an appropriate selection for everything going on in the world this week, Darsakra.
3933000	3938000	No, I love it. I love it. It's a little bit of a, hey, don't forget this one as well. Love it.
3939000	3943000	Anyhow, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, some folks are remembering some of this.
3944000	3946000	Dark Tetsuya says, oh, Barcode Battler. At least that's how I remember it.
3947000	3951000	But the story, it was a specific brand of ramen that breed a powerful monster.
3952000	3958000	That was it. And to answer Act Deaf's question about if I've tried the new Digimon game on PS4, not yet.
3959000	3960000	You should put that on your to-do list.
3960000	3964000	I should, but I've got, built 20 million other things I'm playing.
3965000	3968000	The gamer struggle, the very big gamer struggle.
3969000	3974000	Let's see, Ragenator says, I did see some of the original Pokemon and Digimon anime series.
3975000	3980000	Admittedly, the Digimon theme was slightly catchy, but the shows themselves were, I don't know, obnoxious for lack of a better term.
3981000	3982000	You gotta watch them in Japanese.
3983000	3986000	And I was gonna say, you didn't, your fandom was not about the US ones, you always watched the Japanese.
3986000	3995000	No, because I, my first exposure to the Digimon was watching the Japanese one, so that's sort of what I stuck with.
3996000	4003000	I know those voices, so it's like going to watch, and Ranma and I have had this discussion.
4004000	4011000	It's like going, like when I start to watch Ranma one half, I have to watch it in Japanese because those are the voices that I know better.
4011000	4018000	You know, for people who watched it in English, they know the American voices better, so that's their preference, so.
4019000	4024000	I hear you. Alright, it's like when they change the voices. Like in Final Fantasy XIV, they changed voices in the expansion.
4025000	4028000	It's like, wait a minute, these aren't the same people. Who are these new people doing the voices?
4029000	4030000	One of them is dead.
4031000	4034000	Well, she died after Heavensward came out. That wasn't the reason why.
4035000	4036000	The new expansion.
4036000	4046000	Well, the new expansion is now yet, but yes, her voice will have to change. Although her character's story kind of wrapped up, so they just may not put the character in the game anymore.
4047000	4048000	We'll see. We'll see what they do.
4049000	4055000	Anyway, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, there's more of Orange Lounge Radio, including, yes, a FUGO Question of the Week this week.
4056000	4060000	Some rapid fire news. We'll talk about some changes to Xbox avatars that are pretty awesome.
4061000	4065000	We'll talk a little more about Pokemon Go, because it does impact the news in some ways as well.
4066000	4072000	We'll talk about your emails and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4079000	4088000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 649 for this July the 10th of 2016.
4089000	4095000	Our show in progress. If you missed the first part of our show, we spent some time in the beginning talking about the phenomenon that is Pokemon Go.
4096000	4103000	Just talking about the big impact that it has. Loki talked about some things he'd like to see improved, for lack of a better term.
4104000	4106000	We are going to get into some rapid fire news in this segment as well.
4107000	4113000	Next week on our show, I didn't realize this, I guess multiples of 50 are kind of a big deal. Next week would be episode 650.
4114000	4121000	Although, I don't know, I guess we already did something for episode 600, so we just have the quiciniera to look forward to at this point.
4122000	4123000	We need episode evil.
4123000	4125000	That's right, episode 666 is in sight.
4126000	4129000	Yeah, I actually looked at that earlier today. That's going to fall sometime in November.
4130000	4131000	Is that accounting for Labor Day being off?
4132000	4133000	Uh, yes.
4134000	4138000	Oh, you know what? I will also be gone gamer X week, so you gotta push it back one more week.
4139000	4140000	Yeah, because we'll be gone gamer X week.
4141000	4142000	My mom might be in town.
4143000	4144000	A few more weeks and we can hit.
4145000	4146000	I know, I'm like, we might make Christmas.
4146000	4153000	Hopefully, Orange Launch Radio episode 666 will be visited by Satan Claus.
4154000	4155000	We'll summon the Krampus.
4156000	4162000	Hey, you know what? My one wish, and I hope he's out there listening, for episode 666, I need him to be out there listening.
4163000	4169000	I want Travis Donovan as DJ Satan to call into episode 666, Orange Launch Radio. It's the one thing I want in life.
4170000	4171000	Make it happen.
4172000	4174000	Tweet him or something. Let him know. He has to be here.
4174000	4175000	It's time to prepare.
4177000	4183000	For those of you that don't know, when he had his show, Understation Live, he always closed each episode as DJ Satan.
4184000	4188000	Although, I don't know if I was supposed to give away that it was actually him, just like you're not supposed to know that I'm Mr. Spanky.
4189000	4190000	Like, we couldn't all tell.
4192000	4196000	I gave away big secrets here on Orange Launch Radio. Big secrets, my bad.
4198000	4199000	I'm going to get a hate mail tomorrow.
4199000	4205000	Alright, let's do some rapid fire news, and then of course we will get to your calls in a little bit here.
4206000	4207000	Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.
4208000	4209000	But first, rapid fire news. Loki.
4210000	4213000	So, here's what I love about Grand Theft Auto 5, and I really need to go back and play this.
4214000	4215000	And actually, I think this is probably going to get me to do that.
4216000	4218000	Especially Grand Theft Auto Online, because I really got out of that.
4219000	4221000	I don't know. I didn't have as much fun as I thought I would in it.
4222000	4227000	But, there's a brand new expansion coming out called Grand Theft Auto Online, Cunning Stuns.
4227000	4235000	And what it does is it adds a bunch of new pieces to make up your own stunt tracks in the race creator.
4236000	4244000	Because I don't know if you know, Rob, that in Grand Theft Auto Online you can go in there and make your own death matches, make your own racetracks and whatnot.
4245000	4252000	And one of the things that people like doing, especially in the mod community on PC, is making giant fucking ramps and all sorts of stunt races and stuff like that.
4253000	4254000	And they actually do that in the real game as well.
4254000	4266000	But now it's going to get ridiculous. They've got metal tubes you can race through with boost panels and fucking fan blades and all sorts of ramps and crazy shit.
4267000	4269000	Fucking can't wait. It looks awesome.
4270000	4275000	Perhaps they will have one where you can play as the badass librarian in a future expansion called Cunning Linguists.
4276000	4278000	Cunning Linguists. Yes, maybe. That'd be awesome.
4279000	4281000	I would look forward to that. DarkSakura, would you play the Cunning Linguists expansion?
4281000	4286000	You like grammar. I'm getting an eye roll.
4287000	4288000	There we go.
4289000	4299000	They're also adding new supercars, sports cars, motorcycles, and stunt themed apparel. And they'll be coming out on July 12th. Just a couple more days. For free, by the way.
4300000	4301000	I like free.
4302000	4311000	And I'm sure you'll be looking forward to a wonderful... Well, at least you installed all the patches and everything and you have yours in standby. It'll automatically install it.
4312000	4313000	Nice.
4314000	4325000	And then, on top of that, Final Fantasy VII is coming to Android for the premium price of $16. No thanks.
4326000	4337000	Can you tell me I can play Final Fantasy VII on my phone without any fucking controls? For $16, which is probably more than they charge on the Playstation Store? Oh, fucking sign me up.
4338000	4348000	I think it does have controller support. I would hope that it has controller support. But it is going to be available. Check it out. Go grab it.
4350000	4351000	DarkSakura, can you do your story six?
4352000	4353000	Sure. Why not?
4353000	4374000	For folks who are playing Gunvolt 2, Shovel Knight's going to be a guest boss in that game. And the trailer actually looks pretty neat, but he looks like he's going to be pretty hard to beat in that one. If you haven't seen the trailer, go check it out because it's pretty cool.
4375000	4398000	And then, perk up at death, there is going to be a Kirby Cafe in Japan. It's going to, actually there's not really a whole bunch more information on that, but it's probably going to be really, really good food. Probably fluffy, adorable, Kirby things.
4399000	4406000	I bet it'll be like some marshmallow dishes, which actually sounds pretty disgusting to me, but other than that though.
4407000	4414000	It's really one of those adult cafes and you know, well, it's Kirby themed. They suck, right? He sucks things with his mouth.
4415000	4422000	Loki, knock it off. Anything else about the Kirby Cafe, DarkSakura?
4423000	4425000	I'm done. Fucking done.
4426000	4437000	Hey, that System Shock remake that came up a couple of weeks ago on the show, it made its Kickstarter goal. $900,000 it actually raised. That is of course the remake of the 1994 game.
4438000	4447000	There is still time to go in the Kickstarter though, so I guess this means stretch goals. But yeah, so the System Shock Kickstarter made it, so it's going to be coming.
4447000	4456000	So you can follow progress on that. At Nightdive Studio on Twitter is where you can actually follow that for updates on that.
4457000	4460000	And some folks in chat are surprised to hear that. Yeah, so pretty cool.
4461000	4468000	Also, speaking of Kickstarters, there is a game called Pray for the Gods. That's P-R-E-Y.
4468000	4477000	That was a boss climbing action survival game that I think was originally announced some time ago, but now it's like a Kickstarter.
4478000	4479000	It's fucking fantastic, by the way.
4480000	4482000	Yeah, this is something I guess you've been following because I don't know much about this.
4483000	4495000	Well, I just saw someone had posted a link to it in Twitter or NeoGaf or something like that and it looks like, you know, it has a very big Shadow of the Colossus vibe to it.
4495000	4506000	Like they show the guy, he's fighting this giant bird thing and he grapples onto it with a grappling hook and he's climbing on the fur just like he would in Shadow of the Colossus.
4507000	4508000	It looks pretty awesome.
4509000	4516000	Well, they're looking to raise $300,000, which seems a little low for something that looks this good graphically, but they do have an interesting plan.
4516000	4525000	The plan is that they're going to launch it on PC with five bosses and then they will roll it out to like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 after the PC version.
4526000	4531000	So they're not going to do things that held back other games like Mighty No. 9 by trying to launch everywhere at once.
4532000	4533000	So it seems like they've got the plan figured out.
4534000	4535000	I want to see a team of three people making it.
4536000	4540000	Oh my gosh. That's a pretty intense looking game for coming from just three people. That's pretty awesome.
4540000	4544000	Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
4545000	4560000	Every week we ask a question and we read some of our favorite responses here on the show over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and Google Plus.
4561000	4565000	Yes, Google Plus is still a thing. Google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
4566000	4568000	You know, I end up saying that every week. Yes, Google Plus is still a thing.
4568000	4582000	We'll actually start on Google Plus tonight if it'll load here for me on this ancient computer that we broadcast the show from as it tries to open our question of the week, which is about Pokemon Go.
4583000	4589000	It's no secret that many gamers everywhere are suddenly staring at their phones as they collect Pokemon as Pokemon Go officially released this week.
4590000	4592000	We want to ask you what you think about the staying power of the game.
4593000	4598000	We don't hear too much about Miitomo anymore. Candy Crush and Draw Something, they aren't what they once were.
4599000	4603000	Do you think Pokemon Go will have staying power as a mobile title? Why or why not?
4604000	4610000	Starting with Act Def tonight who says Pokemon Go is here to stay. It has the potential to grow even further than other games and apps like Miitomo.
4611000	4617000	Hopefully Niantic solves the problems Go currently has, but I know that people will still be playing it years from now.
4617000	4630000	Philip W. answers over on Google Plus saying if they don't fix the issues and introduce some more expected features in depth for a Pokemon game, there's definitely going to be a drop off, but it'll likely remain popular.
4631000	4638000	And then we're going to check in over at Facebook where we ask the same thing at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
4639000	4648000	And we got some answers here starting off tonight from Rageinator who says, I don't know, I'm not part of Pokemon Go's target audience and never cared for the franchise.
4649000	4659000	All I'll say is this, Pokemon as a whole has a lot of staying power and a pretty good sized fan base. How long will Go last? I don't know. The best I can offer as an answer is a while.
4659000	4666000	You know though honestly though Rageinator, I kind of think Pokemon Go is targeting everybody, at least based on what I see people playing it.
4667000	4676000	I mean it might seem like it's a kids thing, but because Pokemon's been around 20 years, I know so many 30-somethings who were playing it when they were younger that are like eating this up.
4677000	4678000	And I may or may not be one of them, just saying.
4679000	4686000	Fifth Dream says, I'm not sure about staying power. If they periodically add content and new generations of Pokemon, I think it could last a good while.
4687000	4695000	I'm astonished at how popular and widespread it seems to be at the moment, so it could be around a while. I'll say this, I'm considering buying a better phone so I can play it on a trip next month.
4696000	4703000	William Murderface says, take whatever the staying power of Ingress is and add a multiplayer of 4 or 5 due to the theme.
4703000	4709000	Honestly, based on what I've seen, try 30 or 40 as the multiplier.
4710000	4720000	Anyway, due to the theme and mechanical differences, this assumes that they keep releasing new Pokemon and have regular events, possibly using legendary Pokemon as incentives for mass participation.
4721000	4730000	Without those, I think it's dead in a few months. With them, well, more than 5 years. With proper maintenance, this game has the potential to be around longer than all those you name combined, plus some.
4731000	4740000	SSG100Matt says, it's too early to say one way or the other. It'll be up to Niantic to keep the game going with events, updates, and improvements as often as possible.
4741000	4753000	As mentioned above, the attention that the game is getting is huge right now. If the game is updated often with plenty of events, then it'll last a while. Otherwise, people will get tired of catching Rattatas all day and it'll phase out by the end of the year. Niantic has their work cut out for them.
4753000	4767000	CainIam says, it depends if they can get their servers issues worked out, and if they add other features like trading or trainer battles between people, then there's a good chance that with the occasional update to the Pokedex to add in some new Pokemon, then yeah, Go has legs.
4768000	4776000	Redertainment says, I believe Pokemon Go will have a larger and more loyal user base than Ingress because Pokemon Go is an already established property.
4776000	4782000	Also, Pokemon Go gives me an excuse to go out on walks. I mean, besides exercise and being outside and all that shit.
4783000	4790000	Degenerate Johnny says, since Pokemon has a strong established fan base, I'm going to say that it has the potential of having a very long lifespan.
4791000	4799000	Especially considering what was said during E3 when Game Freak mentioned the possibility of integrating Pokemon Go with newer Pokemon games like Sun and Moon.
4799000	4809000	I just want to address that real quick though, Degenerate Johnny. I really, really, really do not think it's going to be something like you can import your Pokemon from one game into the other.
4810000	4818000	I mean, for one, Pokemon Go is only Gen 1, but because the way you level Pokemon is so different and the game itself is different, it would just throw off the balance.
4818000	4824000	You'd probably just get like, hey, you purchase this game, you get a code, hey, now it's like you unlock this.
4825000	4831000	Yeah, you're going to get items or like maybe a Pokemon that you unlock in one game or the other. I think it'll be something like that.
4832000	4837000	But it's not, I'm not expecting, and maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised, but I'm not expecting a deep integration.
4838000	4844000	I'm expecting perks for playing both and they're mainly cosmetic or pokey medic.
4844000	4854000	And lastly, Mega Man X400. I've never really been sure how to pronounce my co-host from reading his fundamental, his handle online.
4855000	4861000	I think it's Mega Man X400 says, almost didn't make it in time because I was out playing Pokemon Go lol.
4862000	4864000	Wait a minute, aren't you in Canada? I thought the game didn't come out in Canada yet.
4865000	4867000	Can't you just download the APK or whatever?
4868000	4869000	Probably, probably.
4870000	4871000	Of course, if you're on iOS.
4871000	4882000	No, there was even ways to do it on iOS. People were making accounts in foreign countries and all that stuff to get, remember it came out in New Zealand like one whole day before it was out here?
4883000	4884000	It did, I didn't even notice.
4885000	4893000	Anyway, as for the staying power, it's Pokemon, which the original game is still going strong. The game has a lot of potential for future growth.
4894000	4900000	I have faith they will continue to invest into this game more so than Miitomo or any other mobile game.
4901000	4905000	So there you go, those are the answers from our Facebook and Google Plus community, the Fugu Question of the Week.
4906000	4911000	Since we kind of already answered that earlier in the show, I won't ask everybody in here in the studio to do it again.
4912000	4915000	Instead, we will move on for more long form news, starting with Loki.
4916000	4924000	So yeah, they've done an update to the Xbox One avatars, and now they have options to have wheelchairs.
4924000	4933000	Which is kind of great for gamers that might be disabled, or if you want to roll a Professor X type character, then you can go ahead and do that.
4934000	4938000	So that's pretty cool, and that's what else they're going to be adding.
4939000	4942000	Yeah, and they have like an Xbox themed wheelchair.
4942000	4952000	It's one of those things that you really think should have just been in there a long time ago, and then when you hear it wasn't there and they have to add it, you kind of go,
4953000	4958000	Oh, well, gee, that seems like something they should have done a long time ago, but I suppose...
4959000	4971000	No, I don't really think it is, because if you look at all the other places that use avatars, like hell, your Miis don't have real bodies, let alone actual wheelchairs or anything like that.
4972000	4976000	Yeah, but still, representation is awfully nice, so for those gamers...
4977000	4984000	Yeah, it's nice that they're doing that, don't get me wrong. I think it's awesome. I just wish the Miis looked better, because they look like shit.
4985000	4989000	Alright, fair enough. I guess that's a little harder to argue with.
4990000	4994000	Okay, moving on, let's talk about Capcom and Street Fighter V.
4995000	5000000	People are playing Street Fighter V online, but some people are playing with characters they shouldn't be playing with.
5000000	5013000	Because apparently, when the cinematic story expansion came out last week, players actually got to see Juri and Urian, who have not been released in the game yet, but they are actually in one of the story mode's chapters.
5014000	5021000	So apparently, some folks went in and figured out how to tweak settings and make both these characters playable online, even though they're not out yet.
5022000	5028000	I don't know how the hell they did that, but you know what we say on this show, hackers gonna hack. If the data's there, they'll figure out how to get it on.
5028000	5037000	So anyway, producer of Street Fighter V, Kochi Sugiyama, actually went on Twitch as part of Capcom's regular stream that they do there.
5038000	5043000	They actually said that they've seen the videos on how to make the characters playable in online play.
5044000	5049000	So when you put this stuff on YouTube, how to do it, good chance is the people behind the game will actually see it too.
5049000	5059000	So they have a good understanding of how to see who's been using them, because the technique is out there for everybody to see, they know how they're doing it and how to figure out who you are.
5060000	5062000	Don't punish the people doing it, just fix the fucking problem.
5063000	5068000	Well, they do say that anyone who they know is using the characters will be dealt with strictly.
5069000	5076000	They also talked about a glitch that gives Ibuki some frames of invulnerability after landing from a particular type of air throw.
5076000	5080000	They are saying that's unintended and will be patched out, but nobody will be banned over that.
5081000	5083000	Just fix the shit.
5084000	5088000	I always say like, oh you found a bug in our game and we're gonna ban you.
5089000	5099000	It kinda blows my mind that all the data was there for them to be able to play online in the first place, but at the same time I also realized they had to get story mode out ASAP,
5099000	5108000	because, you know, releasing Street Fighter without the single player story mode was a little, you know, they got razzed for that before, so, I don't know.
5109000	5115000	Kaijuto in chat says, what are they gonna do to them? Tiger uppercut them? They might, they just might.
5116000	5121000	Although I don't think Sagat is in Street Fighter 5, right? I don't think he's there.
5122000	5124000	I could be wrong, but I don't think so.
5125000	5127000	Anyway, DarkSagra, what do you have for us?
5127000	5130000	A good story about Pokemon Go. A very good one.
5131000	5139000	Apparently it is having a positive effect on the player's mental health for one very big reason.
5140000	5149000	You know why that is? They're going outside. They're being in the world. They're getting sunshine, which, I mean, sunshine, first of all, that's vitamin D.
5149000	5166000	It helps give you energy and keeps you healthy, but people are actually going out and experiencing the world and interacting with other people and just walking and generally feeling better, which is having a very positive effect on their mental health.
5166000	5183000	It's helping people who, you know, have been sort of shutting themselves off due to other, you know, mental health issues have more incentive to go out and do things and really having a very positive effect, so, good.
5184000	5189000	Brad from Pod Culture says, in regards to being out in the sun, it also burns.
5190000	5191000	That's true.
5192000	5195000	You know what? Some people will turn to ash when they let the sunlight hit them.
5196000	5198000	Ash, alright. Ash, catch them.
5199000	5200000	Fuck off.
5201000	5209000	Let's see. Alan Alchemy in chat says, not like your cliched basement dweller, though I'm sure they're going outside more too.
5210000	5223000	No, all jokes and that stuff aside, it's really cool. And, you know, part of why I said this is like a cultural phenomenon of sorts is that it's really cool that this is having this kind of impact on people that, you know, can really nurture positive change in people's lives.
5223000	5233000	You know, I met a girl who said, yeah, I'm going to lose, you know, she's a bigger gal, and she said to me, she said, I'm going to lose 100 pounds and it's going to be because of this game.
5234000	5241000	She said, I'm walking more, I'm doing this stuff. She's like, I'm so motivated to go out and catch Pokémon, so I'm going to lose 100 pounds, it's going to be because of this game.
5242000	5243000	So, we'll see.
5244000	5250000	Let's see. S2100 Matt says, I went on a hike near a waterfall this weekend and met a couple playing Pokémon Go also.
5250000	5259000	Yep, they're everywhere. Brad from Pod Culture says, it does if you're a ginger. I got near a 100 watt light bulb, I get a sunburn.
5260000	5267000	I know those feels, bro. I also am a ginger, and so, yeah, I can't be out in the sun very long or I start to feel really, ugh.
5268000	5269000	That's why you play at night.
5270000	5276000	Well, and the summer this week has been very, very tolerable, especially considering we live in Satan's Taint with temperatures sometimes.
5276000	5282000	Like, okay, we're not Arizona bad, but, love you guys in Arizona, but we're not that hot bad.
5283000	5284000	Would they be like Satan's asshole?
5285000	5292000	It gets pretty fucking hot here, but it's actually been pretty merciful this week, so like when we went outside on Saturday it was probably only 80 degrees, so I felt fine.
5293000	5300000	I just wore a hat, and so, you know, I got a little pink on my neck because gingers, we don't tan, we just burn, so I got a little pink on my neck, but that's about it.
5300000	5310000	So, alright. Fifth Dream, kind of following that up in chat, says, I would like Pokemon Go in the autumn, winter. Fuck Pokemon hunting in this heat.
5311000	5320000	Kaijuto says, I'm in New York City, my local news just ran a story on Pokemon Go. The NYPD put out a don't text and drive poster with Squirtle on it.
5321000	5323000	Yeah, I'm hearing that local, you know, and there's-
5324000	5325000	I'm not texting, I'm fucking catching Pokemon.
5326000	5328000	I'm not texting, officer. I was throwing balls.
5328000	5337000	You've probably seen these pictures floating around Facebook and stuff, too, of the businesses that have signs that say, you know, Pokemon is for paying customers only,
5338000	5347000	because I guess people, to catch certain Pokemon, would go inside the store, even though, again, my ingress experience tells me that you don't need to be standing right on top of the freaking portal to capture it,
5348000	5353000	unless they used four axes and you need to ultra strike it, but Jarvis, that son of a bitch, in a nutshell-
5353000	5362000	I don't understand either, because you can, like, just, from my driving experience, if you see it on the screen, or even if you turn the screen, you can just tap that shit,
5363000	5369000	and it's like, whoop, there it is. I mean, you don't need to, like, walk right up to it, you just tap it and, oh, hey, look, I can attack it from a mile away.
5370000	5372000	I mean, I don't understand why people are going places.
5373000	5374000	Yeah, apparently-
5375000	5376000	Getting out of your car, what?
5376000	5383000	And people are talking about productivity, too. In fact, speaking of Travis, who I name checked earlier in the show, he posted some update where he said,
5384000	5388000	I had to tell my employees to stop playing Pokemon Go, and I was like, you're no fun, Dad!
5390000	5392000	Because how else do you respond to Travis?
5393000	5399000	Let's see, Stoppy in chat says, police chew catches you when you text and drive.
5400000	5403000	I like that, you should do posters, Stoppy.
5403000	5410000	Alan Alchemy says, yeah, I don't get that because the range is pretty large. They should be no reason why five feet inside a business would make a difference.
5411000	5415000	You know what's also funny? Just kind of, like, talking about the differences between Ingress and, like, Pokemon Go.
5416000	5421000	Ingress is like a game, like, you don't want people knowing that you're playing it, because you're, like, being all sneaky and stuff and doing that.
5422000	5428000	And in Pokemon Go, like, everybody's just like, hey, hey, hi, hi, you know, it's like, you're just hiding your phone.
5429000	5430000	I'm not doing anything.
5431000	5432000	I don't want the other team to know.
5433000	5440000	I don't want them to know my license plate and follow me home, because that sick shit has happened in Ingress, but I won't go there.
5441000	5451000	Anyway, that's why I'm actually kind of glad Pokemon Go isn't as competitive, because competition will bring out the really gross side of some people.
5452000	5455000	And I've seen that in the other game, and it's not fun.
5456000	5458000	It's also three teams, which has divided everybody.
5458000	5467000	Yeah, right? Well, let's be, Dark Soccer had the best meme about that whole thing, is that, you know, because we're all Team Mystic, for the record.
5468000	5470000	We're all on the blue team, just so y'all know. But Dark Soccer, what was that meme you had?
5471000	5476000	It had, like, a, I found the home bases of the other teams, and it was, like, a red and a yellow garbage can or something.
5477000	5479000	Yeah, it was, like, a red trash can and a yellow recycle bin.
5482000	5485000	Love it. But that, look, a little smack talking is okay.
5485000	5489000	A little smack talking is okay, but that's as far as we're gonna take it.
5490000	5492000	You can throw shade along with those balls.
5493000	5496000	That's right, that's right. We know how to throw a little shade with our balls here on Team Mystic.
5497000	5501000	Alright, Loki, what do you have for us before we get to the mailbag soon here?
5502000	5514000	Speaking of Pokemon Go, Niantic has made comments regarding the whole server problem, saying that, you know, they are holding off on releasing it in other regions, because of server issues.
5515000	5524000	Now, it has launched in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, but they are holding back on other locations until they figure out what the fuck is going on with their shit.
5525000	5534000	So, yeah, they've been, the thing's been freezing, the app's been crashing, like, fucking crazy. Like, if it just goes into, like, sleep mode, it's like, oh, yeah, I'm fucked.
5535000	5546000	So, yeah, I really feel for my friends in the UK that can't get in the game yet, I feel for you guys, but I just need you to understand, we can't have you in the game right now, the servers are bad enough.
5547000	5554000	And by the time you're in, everything will be better, and all these, you're gonna be like, what was Loki so angry about, because this game is so much better than what he was saying.
5555000	5560000	Yeah, because it's a little rough right now out there, so, you get your Pokemon soon, don't worry, you guys.
5560000	5568000	Don't worry, if you want your Pokemon fixed, you wanna get in on all that, Ingress, there's no lag in Ingress, it's free, play it, learn where all your portals are.
5569000	5576000	Yeah, spend some time in Ingress and you're gonna learn where all the stops are, because that's the one advantage us old school, you know, AR gamers have.
5577000	5578000	We know where all that shit is.
5578000	5592000	So, including some of the more obscure stuff, because, like, Shane was like, where are we gonna be able to find a gym that isn't taken anywhere, and I was like, there's a cemetery up in the town of El Dorado, I bet nobody's gone to.
5594000	5595000	Damn it.
5595000	5598000	Shit, I just said it on my show, god damn it. No, I'll find another.
5598000	5607000	Speaking of Ingress, I'm actually coming up on some of my portals that I've had for a while, you know, they're actually starting to tick further than my last one.
5607000	5611000	Oh, are you waiting for the other team to come on day 89 and have a party and sweep them all? Is that what you're waiting for?
5611000	5620000	I don't think they will, because it involves walking, and I don't know if they're going to, and even if they get that one, I have six more behind a fence that's not gonna open up until October, so I'm still good.
5620000	5623000	And you probably shouldn't say that here on this program, but we'll see.
5623000	5624000	And no one gives a shit.
5624000	5625000	No one gives a shit.
5626000	5630000	I don't know, we've met some crazies, Loki, probably haven't met as many as I have.
5631000	5637000	Alright, moving on, let's, or was that it, or was there, didn't you want to say something about this whole tip?
5637000	5643000	Yeah, I was gonna say, also, there's another tip, if you don't want to choose one of the three, start your Pokemon in Pokemon Go.
5643000	5653000	Because basically, it allows you to catch one of the three, and if you don't want to pick one of them, what you can do is say, fuck y'all, I'm walking away.
5653000	5660000	I'm leaving, yes, so, in the game, it starts off, you can choose between a Charmander, a Bulbasaur, or a Squirrel.
5660000	5664000	If you walk far enough away, they'll keep kind of following you, it'll keep reappearing.
5664000	5668000	But eventually, Pikachu will appear, and you can choose Pikachu.
5669000	5679000	Honestly, I don't know why you would want to, because Pikachu is very common, and the other ones I haven't seen at all, so, you know, I would choose one of the other ones who gives a shit, you'll get Pikachu eventually.
5679000	5683000	Yeah, I know, I'm like, if you want a Pikachu, just come to Studio N7, because they keep spawning here.
5683000	5688000	Again, I'm not fucking complaining, we even got, apparently there's a Raichu nearby, too, so, I'm not worried about that.
5688000	5690000	And that's gonna be mine.
5690000	5692000	Darusaka's gonna get in her car.
5692000	5694000	I love Raichu.
5694000	5697000	All right.
5697000	5700000	I've already enlisted you for guard duty.
5701000	5709000	What are some other little tips you guys have learned? I've noticed this is very popular clickbait on Facebook right now, is 12 things about Pokemon Go that you don't know.
5709000	5712000	What are some tips that you guys have learned about Pokemon Go?
5712000	5714000	Turn the AR off.
5714000	5716000	Turn the AR off.
5716000	5717000	Sometimes the AR is funny.
5717000	5728000	It'll save your, well, that's fine, but, like, once you do it a couple times, and you're like, okay, cool, just turn it off, it makes it way easier to catch things, it also makes it, like, a lot easier to not have your battery drained to nothing.
5729000	5732000	Because this game will drain your battery to nothing really quickly.
5735000	5743000	If you're playing in a car, just know that the GPS is fucking like this shit, because their app is just, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with it.
5743000	5746000	But it is, oh, speaking, hey, look at that, there's a fucking Pikachu.
5748000	5749000	Surprise.
5749000	5751000	Darusaka's getting on her phone.
5753000	5755000	Don't judge me.
5755000	5760000	But, yeah, so the, the, do you want to get a picture of Pikachu on the table and send it to the OLR Twitter?
5760000	5766000	It's gonna be on my, it's gonna be on my computer while I'm looking at Pokemon Go stuff.
5766000	5777000	I was gonna say, the GPS is lagged, like, I found that, like, I have to, like, I see the landmark, I'm driving past it, have to count, like, a few seconds, and then spin it, and it goes.
5779000	5781000	So, yeah.
5781000	5788000	I would say the tip that I have for people is don't forget about the eggs, because the game doesn't say anything about the eggs.
5788000	5792000	So, the minute you go to a Pokestop and you see that you hack a little Yoshi looking egg.
5792000	5795000	Someone's put a little lure on you when your Pokestop's there.
5795000	5800000	If, if it's the certain player name I've seen before, I think that person lives right across the street.
5800000	5805000	Anyway, isn't that creepy that I know that? Ingress has taught me how to be a creeper. Anyway, um.
5805000	5806000	I don't know, oh.
5806000	5808000	Don't, don't say it on air, don't say it on air.
5808000	5809000	I like the name though.
5809000	5811000	Wait, now I gotta look. Hold on, show me your phone.
5813000	5814000	Oh, no, Ashley, that's a new name.
5814000	5817000	A peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-tew.
5817000	5818000	A person named Wiener15.
5821000	5822000	Um.
5822000	5823000	Peek-a-pee.
5823000	5824000	Wienerdog.
5824000	5826000	Uh, what was I gonna say about, oh, the eggs.
5826000	5832000	The minute you hack an egg, go into your Pokemon screen, swipe to the right, and put that egg in an incubator.
5832000	5838000	You can buy more incubators on the store if you want, or I think you get an incubator when you hit level 10.
5838000	5840000	You get one in the beginning.
5840000	5842000	Yeah, you do, you do have an infinite use one in the beginning.
5842000	5847000	And then I got another one like at five, or five or six at five.
5847000	5852000	But my point is, incubate that egg, because when the egg hatches, you'll probably get a new Pokemon.
5852000	5857000	But even if you get something like a Pidgey or a Rattata or something that's everywhere, you get a ton of candy.
5857000	5860000	You get way more candy than you get when you catch them.
5860000	5863000	And that can really help in evolving and upgrading the Pokemon.
5864000	5869000	And then the other little quick tip I'd throw in there as well, don't forget to collect your defender bonus.
5869000	5876000	And since right now it's like fucking impossible to hold gyms, I would just say the minute you control a gym, get your defender bonus.
5876000	5887000	Because you get 500 Stardust and 10, it's not a lot, but it adds up, 10 of the gold coin currency that is like the premium currency that you can spend in the store.
5887000	5893000	Not $10, 10, which I think 100 costs 99 cents, like 10 cents basically.
5893000	5901000	But that adds up. If there's like a cluster of three gyms downtown and you can take them every day, then catch that defender bonus and get your...
5901000	5906000	In the beta you could have up to 10 in the defender bonus that you claim every day.
5906000	5914000	I kind of don't think you're going to be able to hold 10 gyms, but if you want to prove me wrong and get your free dollar and Poke currency every day, you can do it.
5914000	5915000	Go for it.
5915000	5920000	All right. Any tips that you've come across Dark Soccer that you would want to throw out there for people?
5920000	5924000	Whip it out in the bathroom. You never know what you'll get.
5926000	5932000	Moving on. Talking about Play Anywhere. You remember when this was announced to E3 this year?
5932000	5941000	Microsoft talked about Play Anywhere saying that every new title coming out on Xbox One will be shared between Xbox One and Windows 10.
5941000	5948000	Well, Microsoft kind of changed that a little bit this week. It's not every new title.
5948000	5956000	You see, it was every title that was at E3 by Microsoft Studios is going to be a part of this.
5956000	5959000	But at least we have confirmed for this list.
5959000	5973000	Gears of War 4, Forza Horizon 3, ReCore, Sea of Thieves, Halo Wars 2, Scalebound, Killer Instinct Season 3, State of Decay 2, Ark Survival Evolved, Cuphead, We Happy Few, and Crackdown 3.
5973000	5980000	Those games are confirmed will be part of Play Anywhere, but not every game is necessarily confirmed.
5980000	5982000	But those are some big ones. Forza Horizon.
5982000	5984000	Crackdown 3 and PC.
5984000	5985000	Yeah, right?
5985000	5986000	That could be fun.
5986000	5987000	Sounds like fun.
5987000	5988000	I'm excited.
5988000	5992000	All right, let's take a moment to go to our mailbag.
5992000	5994000	Every week you guys email us.
5994000	5999000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to actually send us an email.
5999000	6002000	Again, that's Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6002000	6009000	Dark Soccer dives into the mailbag every week head first and pulls out some of our favorite emails to read here on air.
6009000	6010000	Squish, squish.
6011000	6013000	Hey OLR Crew, AZHP here.
6013000	6025000	Just wanted to chime in since you were all confused as to why Apple no longer releases things the day they announce them and why it would also be difficult to release a game console the day of an announcement.
6025000	6031000	The FCC requires all devices with a wireless antenna be submitted to certification before it can be sold.
6031000	6040000	These submissions for certification take time and are public record, meaning people can find out about unannounced products by watching the certification list.
6040000	6042000	Sorry, certification list.
6042000	6049000	This is the reason why manufacturers announce the devices ahead of their release because it would be spoiled by an FCC listing otherwise.
6049000	6051000	Hope this clears things up.
6051000	6054000	Keep up the great work. You're truly AZHP.
6054000	6057000	You know, I didn't think about the wireless thing. That's a really good FYI.
6058000	6065000	You know, we see things about, we even have stories on this show about patent leaks and trademark names and rating board leaks.
6065000	6068000	So all these sorts of certifications tend to leak things.
6068000	6073000	I just think, I still, you know, the wireless thing makes a lot of sense, don't get me wrong.
6073000	6080000	But I still think it's just because of the internet, we live in a day and age where something like the Sega Saturn just ain't ever going to happen again.
6080000	6082000	So, but you're right.
6082000	6083000	People aren't looking for it.
6083000	6090000	You're right. I did ask last week about, well, didn't Apple used to do that at one point and now things are delayed a little bit even though they get them out really fast?
6090000	6094000	But that makes an awful lot of sense what AZHP says in the email.
6094000	6095000	So, cool.
6096000	6097000	Last email?
6097000	6098000	Last email.
6098000	6104000	It's needlessly pedantic, but I don't care for the use of 8-bit to mean blocky.
6104000	6110000	There's no way an NES or Master System could have ever produced anything even remotely resembling Minecraft.
6110000	6117000	And the story cutscenes of Five Nights at Freddy's reminds me of more of Atari 2600 graphics.
6117000	6122000	A console which I believe, despite never advertised as such, is referred to as a 4-bit system.
6122000	6129000	Come to think of it, nobody ever refers to blank bit before 8 or after 64, maybe 128.
6129000	6133000	What exactly does blank bit mean in this context?
6133000	6136000	How many bits is, say, the PlayStation 4? Thanks.
6137000	6144000	I don't know a lot. I'm not as technical-minded as, say, Bobby Blackwolf or Loki or somebody.
6144000	6149000	But my understanding is 8 bits is in the chip.
6149000	6155000	Every value can be a certain length and it literally means 8 bits.
6155000	6161000	So it can be like a number between, what, 2 to the power of 8 would be a number between 0 and 256, right?
6161000	6169000	So the words, so to speak, in the programming code are that long and that's limited in the NES, the 8-bit.
6169000	6174000	I believe the Atari 2600 is technically also an 8-bit console.
6174000	6177000	Some people call it 4-bit. It's not. It's 8-bit.
6177000	6182000	And the thing that might surprise you, PlayStation 4, you ask how many bits is that?
6182000	6186000	And most people will refer to the generations of video game consoles to say,
6186000	6193000	So it's, you know, NES was 8-bit, Super Nintendo was 16-bit, then the Nintendo 64 was 64-bit,
6193000	6196000	and then the PlayStation 2 was 128-bit.
6196000	6205000	Actually, no. This might surprise you, but my understanding is the PlayStation 4 is also 64-bits.
6205000	6207000	It has not gone up from 64-bit.
6207000	6212000	Chips are out there that go higher, but 64-bit is kind of the standard,
6212000	6215000	and the analogy for this would be your Windows operating system.
6215000	6220000	You hear a lot about 64-bit mode versus 32-bit mode, right?
6220000	6224000	So 64 is kind of the, again, maybe somebody tech-minded,
6224000	6229000	because I'm giving you a really, like, what I've collected from articles I've read over the years,
6229000	6233000	but 64 is essentially as high as most mainstream things go right now.
6233000	6238000	In the end, it's also really irrelevant these days anyway.
6238000	6244000	There's no real call for it, because what people look more for is actual raw processing power
6244000	6251000	when it comes to a system now, so it's really just fallen into the way of irrelevancy.
6251000	6254000	Dungeonbuster, of course, our chat room jumping in here, too.
6254000	6256000	Dungeonbuster in chat says,
6256000	6259000	Bit in Sky's context refers to the code instruction length.
6259000	6262000	More bits enables more complex instructions.
6262000	6264000	That's the TLDR explanation for it.
6264000	6268000	I like TLDR explanations. I think they're easier to understand.
6268000	6270000	So, cool.
6270000	6275000	I apologize. I think there was another question buried in that email
6275000	6280000	besides just what does bit mean and what is the PlayStation 4?
6280000	6282000	How many bits are we at now?
6282000	6284000	Was there another question in there that I missed?
6284000	6285000	I don't think so.
6285000	6286000	I don't think so either.
6286000	6290000	How many came next? We don't really use it.
6290000	6299000	Yeah, I think you can read stuff about, I think it goes as high as 512 bits,
6299000	6302000	but I don't think anything practical out there really uses that.
6302000	6307000	That's expensive, yo.
6307000	6313000	But I do understand the whole Minecraft would have never been possible on the NES.
6313000	6315000	I think it's just the graphical style.
6315000	6322000	I think just the pop culture words that are on people's tongue for a lot of people,
6322000	6326000	retro and 8-bit are like the same thing for a lot of people,
6326000	6330000	even though technically that may not necessarily be true.
6330000	6331000	That's all.
6331000	6334000	Good email, though. Good discussion.
6334000	6337000	All right. Well, if that's it for the emails, I'll beg for some more.
6337000	6342000	Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.
6342000	6345000	And Stopby and Chat with a good point. Don't test them.
6345000	6348000	They just got Cave Story to work on the Genesis.
6348000	6351000	D-Makes can be a lot of fun, though.
6351000	6353000	Remember Halo 2600, anybody?
6353000	6355000	D-Makes can be an awful lot of fun.
6355000	6360000	All right. Let's get to the FUs of the week, because sometimes on this show we have to get ranty.
6376000	6378000	I've got a list.
6378000	6382000	FU to racist assholes.
6382000	6387000	FU to people defending murderers.
6387000	6394000	FU to all of the weird, I guess, injuries I've amassed over the past week
6394000	6401000	and having to get them all taken care of over the course of this month and pain in general.
6401000	6409000	And, yeah, it's just been a shitty week ready for something, you know,
6409000	6411000	ready for something a little nice to happen instead.
6411000	6413000	I'm done.
6415000	6425000	I guess, just after you two not having access to my TV because my damn wife is watching stupid Grey's Anatomy all over again.
6425000	6431000	It's also fucking distracting, because anything that's on TV, whether it be my stupid kids,
6431000	6435000	not to say my kids are stupid, but their stupid shows that they watch,
6436000	6440000	or Grey's Anatomy, or just whatever is on TV.
6440000	6447000	I'm, I guess, predisposed to watch what's on TV, even if it's fucking uninteresting.
6447000	6452000	And I hate that, because I want to work on programming games and stuff, and my brain's like,
6452000	6457000	Shiny! Watch TV! And it's fucking annoying.
6457000	6459000	I guess I go to the other room.
6459000	6464000	But then when I go to the other room, I just end up playing fucking Tap My Katamari, so that doesn't work either.
6465000	6470000	Alright, my FU of the week goes to the restaurant where we had dinner last night,
6470000	6475000	because I had reservations for 7.30, but thanks to the front door person,
6475000	6478000	I guess not really being able to effectively communicate with me,
6478000	6482000	she did not realize that I was telling her our whole party was here, even though she had said to me,
6482000	6485000	it'll be just a few minutes, there's a couple tables in front of you.
6485000	6488000	Thirty minutes later, finally, one of the other gals comes out and says,
6488000	6493000	Oh, you guys weren't checked in. You guys are all here? Yes.
6493000	6499000	And so, yeah, that was unfortunate that even with the reservation, we still ended up waiting a good 45 minutes,
6499000	6503000	but the food was still really, really good, and yeah.
6503000	6507000	The manager hooked us up with some freebies, so that's always nice when they realize they screw up.
6507000	6508000	Free flan?
6508000	6514000	No, no free flan at this place. It was free appetizers.
6514000	6520000	So, I'll take it. I like food. Otherwise, FU to the fact that I drank a lot this weekend.
6520000	6526000	I went out with Grandpa last night, that's all you need to know.
6526000	6529000	That boy likes to drink, if you never heard Hoard House back in its heyday.
6529000	6532000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the Skype line,
6532000	6538000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Loki.
6538000	6541000	So this is kind of a neat little incentive, but apparently,
6541000	6545000	Ubisoft will give you the full version of Trials of the Blood Dragon,
6545000	6548000	if you're very good at Trials of the Blood Dragon.
6548000	6551000	And the way you prove this is by playing the demo.
6551000	6556000	And if you play the demo and complete the demo with less than 15 faults,
6556000	6560000	you get the game for free.
6560000	6563000	And of course, it's going to be on the PC version.
6563000	6566000	They don't have that working yet on any other version of the game,
6566000	6569000	but PC version, though, if you download it and complete it,
6569000	6572000	then you get the free version of the game.
6572000	6575000	It's alright.
6575000	6580000	I mean, if you're a fan of Trials, you might as well try it.
6580000	6585000	But I already bought it, so, you know.
6585000	6586000	So that's it.
6586000	6590000	Alright. So you already bought it, so no freebie for you, huh?
6590000	6593000	Well, I bought it on PlayStation 4, like when it first came out,
6593000	6597000	and then I tried it and it was like, okay, and I kind of got bored of it.
6597000	6600000	I'll play it again later.
6600000	6604000	What I need to do is buy Trackmania.
6604000	6607000	That's what I should really do because that game is pretty fun.
6607000	6611000	Well, you know what we like to do on this show is judge Konami
6611000	6614000	about all the freaking pachinko machines that they make
6614000	6616000	because it seems like that's their only business now
6616000	6621000	is making pachinko machines of all your favorite 8-bit, ha ha,
6621000	6625000	video game franchises such as Castlevania and Metal Gear and so on.
6625000	6630000	Well, there may be another publisher that we're going to have to start teasing pretty soon,
6630000	6633000	and that is Squeenix.
6633000	6637000	That's right, Square Enix, apparently getting into the pachinko business.
6637000	6643000	There's a leaflet going around in Japan that shows that the Star Ocean series
6643000	6647000	and Lord of Vermillion are going to be the first pachinko machines that are out there.
6647000	6651000	I don't care, and the reason why is because they're still making games.
6651000	6654000	Fuck, if you want to make games, you want to make pachinko slot machines,
6654000	6657000	by all means, go right ahead and do that.
6657000	6659000	It's when you say, fuck you guys, we're not making games anymore,
6659000	6661000	we're just going to make pachinko slot machines, and I have a problem.
6661000	6666000	Now, apparently Square Enix actually did kind of follow up some of this story
6666000	6672000	going around saying that, well, actually we're not officially entering the pachii slot business.
6672000	6676000	Let's see, in the document it was stated that Square Enix is entering the business,
6676000	6678000	but that's not a fact.
6678000	6681000	Again, we used the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy logos without permission,
6681000	6684000	which resulted in a misunderstanding from our company and our services,
6684000	6691000	so I guess that was the company that sent out the original brochure or whatever,
6691000	6696000	but it does seem like Lord of Vermillion is going to end up being a machine.
6696000	6700000	I just feel like Square Enix is probably trying to distance themselves from it a little bit.
6700000	6704000	Probably what Loki says, they've still got another bread and butter here,
6704000	6709000	so if they're just licensing this out to somebody else to make a machine, then whatever, right?
6709000	6715000	It's like how they have Price is Right and Wheel of Fortune slot machines everywhere in Reno and Vegas.
6715000	6717000	Those shows are still on, right?
6717000	6723000	All right. Well, believe it or not, that is the last story that we have on our show roll tonight.
6723000	6727000	I need to get our Skype line open. I don't even have Skype open yet. I need to get on that.
6727000	6732000	But shortly here you will be able to call us at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6732000	6737000	We also do have the old school phone number as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6737000	6742000	Of course, my Skype is not coming up right away here. I forgot to launch it during the break, and I usually do.
6742000	6746000	Do we have any last minute stories while I get this up and running?
6746000	6750000	One thing we haven't talked about, because I don't know how many people are interested or know about it,
6750000	6757000	but apparently there is a whole Counter-Strike GO gambling scene with skins and everything.
6757000	6759000	Yeah, I heard a little bit about this.
6759000	6764000	With that, there's a few websites that kind of facilitate that.
6764000	6774000	One of those being CSGO Lotto, and apparently it was owned by some YouTubers who didn't make any mention that they owned it,
6774000	6779000	and were kind of saying, hey, look at this cool site we found, and look at all this money that we're winning off of it.
6779000	6784000	And so they didn't disclose that, and they were trying to get people to go to it.
6785000	6791000	They're actually the owners of the actual website, so there's that kind of drama.
6791000	6798000	And so now, because of that, they've been kind of called out on by H3H3 and a lot of other people.
6799000	6804000	Losing trust with your viewers is really not something you want to do on YouTube.
6804000	6809000	Remember what happened with the Fine Brothers a few months ago with that whole mess about the whole Let's...
6809000	6813000	Not Let's Play, but Kids React or whatever it was. The word React. Yeah, yeah.
6813000	6815000	Yeah, so that sucks.
6815000	6821000	Well, our Skype is up and running, and some folks have figured that out because we are getting calls here right now.
6821000	6823000	Hi, you're on Orange Hospital. Who's this?
6823000	6825000	It's Trainer Rama. How is everyone tonight?
6825000	6828000	Great, Rama. How are you doing? How's Pokémon GO going for you?
6828000	6836000	It's going pretty well. I'm actually considering to buy an external, you know, a protection case for my phone with a built-in battery.
6836000	6842000	Even though I already walk around with the extra battery pack and a charger.
6842000	6847000	I'm sorry. I'm just laughing my ass off because, again and again, here I am, that old man sitting back on the chair going,
6847000	6852000	Yep, I was there for Ingress, and I ended up buying two external batteries.
6852000	6859000	We got a battery big enough that Allen and I can both plug into it when we go to the Anomalies events.
6859000	6863000	So when you play the game nonstop for five hours, we have a battery that can charge both of us.
6863000	6869000	So it's just so funny to hear that now all the Pogo players are like, oh, the struggle, the struggle for battery life.
6869000	6871000	Yes, I know that struggle, kid.
6871000	6880000	See, here's the funny part. On the anime cosplay convention aspect, we've already been walking around with these big old battery packs
6880000	6885000	because we want to take pictures and post them all over social media, and now that everybody's jumping on getting these,
6885000	6891000	we're like, oh, I remember getting this, having this already at this price. I've already had this. Welcome to the club, kid.
6891000	6896000	I see. It is a different way, but yeah, I got it.
6896000	6898000	Have you picked your team yet?
6898000	6901000	Absolutely. We are all team Mystic here in the studio.
6901000	6904000	I'm going to see about getting y'all some patches.
6904000	6909000	Oh, that's awesome. Dark Soccer apparently knows somebody that does decals.
6909000	6910000	He ordered them.
6910000	6911000	That's awesome.
6911000	6913000	He didn't make them. He ordered them.
6913000	6918000	I'm sure they'll sell the official stuff soon. Niantic does that for Ingress.
6919000	6922000	Niantic fucked up not having that stuff already out there day one.
6922000	6924000	The hoodies and everything.
6926000	6931000	Look, I'm having a great time with this. Friday night, I walked out of my house.
6931000	6936000	I'm like, okay, I'm going to do a quick 30-minute walk around the house, around the neighborhood, and come home.
6936000	6943000	That turned into a one-hour trek, and I was running into caravans of people going out collecting Pokémon.
6943000	6950000	I'm running into little groups of 2, 3, and 4 walking around doing this. Mind you, it's 11 o'clock at night.
6952000	6954000	I was amazed by it.
6954000	6958000	One of my Ingress people, or my Ingress hangouts, I should say.
6958000	6964000	One of my Ingress hangouts just during the taping of the show about 30 minutes ago has posted some pictures.
6964000	6970000	One of the gals is playing Ingress downtown in one of the parks and sent some pictures from the park.
6970000	6974000	It's swarming with people on a Sunday night.
6974000	6979000	I'm looking in this picture. There's easily 30 people in this photograph all staring at their phones.
6979000	6982000	Then she sent a picture of what Pokémon GO looks like in-game.
6982000	6986000	There's 5 lures going off all at the park at once, and there's just people everywhere.
6986000	6991000	Again, when I talk about the whole Pokémon GO as a social phenomenon, this is it.
6991000	6999000	Even if you yourself aren't playing, just go to the park on a weeknight, or better yet, on a Saturday as the sun is setting.
7000000	7003000	Look at this, what's going on right now.
7003000	7006000	This is why I'm saying this is a social phenomenon.
7006000	7010000	This is new. This is uncharted territory for gaming in a way.
7010000	7012000	Yes, I even say that as a long time ago.
7012000	7013000	Getting so many people out of their houses.
7013000	7014000	As a long time ago.
7014000	7016000	Can you come in and steal their shit?
7016000	7019000	Don't be stupid when it comes to leaving your house.
7021000	7026000	I got recruited to be part of a team, Mystic Facebook group.
7026000	7031000	They're pointing out, you know, I'm having a meetup here, let's go do a walk.
7031000	7035000	I'm seeing a post of, this team is taking over, I need backup.
7035000	7036000	It's just been amazing.
7036000	7040000	I'm seeing the memes, and I'm already seeing a couple of people talking like,
7040000	7043000	well if you're this team, we can't be friends anymore, this and that.
7043000	7047000	I'm just like, I'm waiting for someone to come to me and give me shit for being Team Mystic.
7047000	7049000	It doesn't matter, there's no game yet.
7049000	7051000	Yeah, the teams kind of don't matter.
7051000	7053000	It's not even like it is in Ingress.
7053000	7058000	Like in Ingress, it's like, seriously Shane, if you roll blue in Ingress, I can't help you.
7058000	7060000	I cannot help you in this game.
7060000	7062000	There is nothing I can do for you.
7062000	7065000	You can't play this game when you're over at my house if you choose the team.
7065000	7068000	But in Pokemon Go, it's like whatever, do whatever the fuck you want.
7068000	7070000	It's not serious.
7070000	7072000	People are taking it to that level though.
7072000	7073000	That's sad.
7073000	7074000	What's that?
7074000	7077000	People are taking it to that level and it's kind of sad.
7077000	7080000	Yeah, and I don't think Pokemon Go is ever going to be constructed to be.
7080000	7084000	I think they kind of learned some things from Ingress and some of the darker things that have happened in that game.
7084000	7090000	And I think they don't want, especially a game that quote unquote is targeted for kids even though we all know it's their parents that are really playing.
7090000	7094000	I don't think they want something to kind of go to that level.
7094000	7106000	But a couple quick things I wanted to mention because you mentioned that story is that I have a buddy that runs a Facebook group about, you know, Pokemon Go started one for our area.
7106000	7114000	And there is an event for a Pokey pub crawl Friday or Saturday, I don't know, at some point during the weekend next weekend.
7114000	7121000	There are currently 850 people who have said yes I'm going on that invite to a pub crawl.
7121000	7126000	I just want you to know every year at PAX East they have a Pokey crawl like that Thursday night.
7126000	7129000	Oh, it's going to get interesting next year when it rolls around.
7129000	7131000	Yeah, seriously.
7131000	7137000	And then the other funny story I have is that you know Shane Allen and I were all walking around downtown yesterday, and we came across a gym.
7137000	7145000	And Shane goes, we should we should take this gym because it just turned yellow and it just has some really low level Pokemon on it let's get it.
7145000	7159000	And these two people that are sitting on the curb the girl there I shouldn't say girl she was more of like probably a young 20 she looks that up up at us and says, Hey, we just took that and spent time buffing that.
7159000	7176000	And it was kind of an awkward moment, but it wasn't like serious like she was kind of like laughing. Yeah, she's kind of laughing as she said amateur move you know the if you played ingress that's right if you play ingress you know to shut the fuck up until it's time to strike.
7176000	7178000	Fucking amateurs.
7178000	7181000	God damn it Shane didn't you learn anything from ingress.
7181000	7192000	All joking aside it was just one of those fun funny interactions, and you know what we ended we just said you know what, let's just keep on moving we're not going to waste the time to attack this gym and we didn't we just kept on moving.
7192000	7196000	So, which would have never happened in ingress and ingress I would have blew it up anyway.
7196000	7207000	I was at a party last night, and like, maybe an hour into I look around, half the people are on their phones playing Pokemon go. Oh yeah, it's crazy.
7207000	7216000	Yeah, I mean the people who are not playing Pokemon go I've really got to be irritated by how popular.
7216000	7224000	That's life you know hey, it happens. Let people have their fun as long as they're not hurting anybody over right.
7224000	7227000	Damn right. Anything else you want to share with us tonight Rama.
7227000	7249000	Quick thing I caught the whole thing about the whole Blizzard lawsuit thing, something similar is happening in the anime fandom, real story short, guy runs a convention sued a local blogger for bad press pretty much he hated the review of his conventionally suing him over that, and the lawsuit got thrown out because of jurisdiction.
7249000	7262000	They actually set up shop in the guy's town, just to counter, just to refile. So knowing Blizzard if they're going to do this, go this way, they're going to probably set up like a set up shop in Germany, just so they can push ahead with this lawsuit.
7262000	7264000	Wow.
7264000	7270000	Well, you know, Blizzard's not a small company they have the resources to do something like that so we'll see.
7270000	7278000	All right. All right, my friend I'm gonna let you go so we get some more calls, I'm sure they can hear more about this story you just referenced on anime jam session.
7278000	7279000	Yes, they will.
7279000	7281000	All right, awesome. I'm gonna let you go buddy take care.
7281000	7282000	All right, you too.
7282000	7284000	Yep. Bye.
7284000	7290000	Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype but the phones ringing ringing ringing so let's get to another call. Hi on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
7290000	7291000	Hey, it's Toppy. How you guys doing?
7291000	7294000	Hey, great, Toppy. Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?
7294000	7308000	Hey, I just wanted to compliment Loki because he brought up that story about CSGO betting because that is huge and there is just so much bad shit that's coming out from that. I mean, I can't believe that those guys even did that on their channel.
7309000	7330000	What's your perspective on all this and your take? Because I have to admit because I don't follow a lot of YouTube gaming channels and maybe that's just the old man in me which we've heard a lot from tonight and I don't know how I feel about that but the reality is because my heart's always been with podcasting, I've never kind of gone full in on following a lot of these YouTubers.
7330000	7340000	So I kind of look at it from the outside and I kind of go, well, that does seem really shady but I didn't really see it all go down. So what's happening from your perspective?
7340000	7350000	From my perspective, I think that it's really a couple of guys who have gone totally out of touch with reality which seems to happen a lot with these big YouTubers and he really just wanted to take advantage of his community.
7350000	7364000	I mean, lead them to this horrible gambling site that he owns that we don't know the full story of it but some people are saying that these bets were rigged in the favor that a lot of people would lose and then these guys could just win anytime that they want.
7364000	7374000	We don't know if that's true yet but it seems to be the case that it's leading in that direction but so far no concrete evidence. But even then, I mean, they know who their audience is.
7374000	7385000	You could watch those videos where, you know, the infamous video where he's talking about, hey guys, I just found this new site where you could bet on these cool skins and all this other stuff and you could tell he is not talking to adults there.
7385000	7396000	He knows that his channel is marketed towards kids and he's telling kids to go to a gambling site because it's so cool and you can make so many thousands of dollars. It's just really, really scummy stuff.
7396000	7399000	How is that legal though? Is the site hosted not in the U.S. or something?
7399000	7409000	Well, no, because it's with skins and the skins don't have monetary value but on Valve, on Steam, you can sell them for people to sign them on.
7410000	7419000	Loki has it right. But yeah, apparently the skins, you can kind of think of them as poker chips kind of. So they're not dealing directly with money but they are worth money.
7419000	7435000	At least as I understand it, I didn't even know that this was a thing before it popped up in the news but you can take those skins and apparently go to another site where you can exchange it for, I think it translates almost directly into Steam credit.
7435000	7446000	So if you have a $400 skin, you could trade it for $400 in games and then sell off the game keys and then you take a little bit of a hit on that but you could walk away with $300 right there.
7446000	7452000	There's different ways that you can actually sell this or just find somebody who will pay you $400 for a skin.
7452000	7466000	Wow. Okay, so now I understand a little more of the science behind it but you said something that I think is a very, very valid point and that some of these YouTubers kind of get lost in their own fame, basically.
7466000	7478000	And I say this a lot about people who do Twitch for a living and who do YouTube for a living and congrats. Sometimes you get very lucky in getting those breaks and so forth.
7478000	7492000	But I always kind of say, you know, the internet gave it to you, the internet can take it away. So, you know, trust is so important with a lot of these and I think these guys are kind of hosed with this whole thing coming out and probably rightfully so it sounds like.
7492000	7504000	And I don't know all the facts, but it definitely sounds like these guys are pretty hosed and you got to wonder like, you know, when you're making your living off of Twitch or YouTube, are you thinking about things like retirement?
7505000	7522000	And the serious fact that these things don't last forever. Now, most of the people that I think are getting into Twitch and YouTube, they're probably in their low 20s anyway where, shit, the job I had in my low 20s in the beginning, I didn't really save or plan well either.
7522000	7533000	So it's not like all hope is lost forever. But as the years go on, you know, you got to kind of wonder, are people that are getting into this, are they planning for the future and what they're going to do when it's all over?
7534000	7547000	You know, Dark Soccer and I love to, on this show, get on tangents about drag queens. But I bring that up for an appropriate reason because, you know, drag is very popular right now thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race and these queens that go on the show.
7547000	7561000	They make a lot of money doing shows and all that stuff. But Michelle Visage, one of the judges on the show, you know, I saw, I listened to a podcast that she was on and she was kind of talking about that she tells them all the time, this will all go away someday.
7561000	7573000	Your fame will not last forever in this. You need to think about every dollar you make. You need to save 75 cents or 50 cents. You need to put money away so that you can ride this out when it's gone.
7573000	7574000	Yeah.
7574000	7575000	So it's-
7575000	7579000	That drag body doesn't last forever. You don't want to be the Joe Pesci of drag queens, you know?
7580000	7582000	But you could be DMed them.
7582000	7583000	Now wait a minute.
7587000	7589000	Work it while you have it, baby. Work it.
7589000	7597000	I feel like that would be my calling card is that I would be the Joe Pesci of drag queens. I'm going to remember that one.
7597000	7598000	You'd be an angry man?
7600000	7601000	That'll be my name.
7601000	7610000	We always joke, like myself and my coworker, about opening a restaurant chain called Pesci's where we just act like complete assholes to people.
7610000	7626000	I thought that really was a chain of restaurants somewhere like in Southern California or something where like the whole deal was to get smack talked by the staff or anything. Anyway, we digress way away from the original topic, but that's what happens here at Orange Lounge Radio.
7626000	7633000	Rama does bring us another really good point, kind of bringing it back though. All this talk is quite the reality in the cosplay community.
7633000	7644000	And that's another community where, you know, you got folks who, you know, get a lot of business from the photo shoots and the celebrity they basically, excuse me, build up online.
7644000	7645000	That goes with any modeling job.
7645000	7653000	Of course. You know, one day you're not going to have a six pack anymore. You're going to have a bowling ball. It happens to everybody, you know?
7654000	7656000	And that day could come a lot sooner than you think.
7657000	7658000	That's right.
7659000	7668000	And the part that really gets to me is, the part that I haven't seen anybody else bring up, is that there's no penalty for these guys on YouTube. Their channels are not at stake or anything.
7669000	7679000	And that's what really gets to me because pretty much they committed their crimes on their channel, but they have no fear that their channel is going to be locked up or anything. That's a total point that nobody has brought up yet.
7680000	7692000	And I actually create content on YouTube and whenever you get a content ID strike, whenever you get like that copyright notice or whatever, which I've had some and they've been wrongful and I've fought them and I won.
7692000	7700000	But every time you get one of those, YouTube sends you the ugliest fucking letter in the world, you know, saying, you know, this is strike one, three strikes, we're going to delete all your stuff.
7701000	7706000	They send you a terrible letter and this guy, it doesn't seem like he has any of those problems to worry about. They're just sending him a check.
7707000	7714000	So that's the part that really gets me. At least on YouTube, his channel is not at risk right now and I don't think that's something that anybody else has brought up.
7715000	7724000	YouTube is so out of control in so many ways, especially when it comes to copyright and all this stuff. I feel like I've been waiting for three years at least for the bubble to burst on YouTube with all this stuff.
7725000	7732000	And it's just like, you know, it's just, there's not enough. I mean, I keep saying YouTube needs to moderate more. They need to moderate more. I just, I don't think they can.
7733000	7740000	There's so much content on YouTube. It's impossible to moderate, but they kind of have to, especially some of these big money making channels.
7741000	7749000	I think any channel that makes above X amount of dollars, a real person's got to look out once in a while to make sure they're not breaking the rules and not rely on some fucking automated system to do it.
7749000	7759000	I would hope so. I would hope that they could just put one, one rule, one simple rule out there. If you are using your channel to commit a crime, then that's it. Your channel is gone. Zero tolerance. I would hope.
7760000	7762000	I don't know. This guy pulls in a lot of water, I guess.
7763000	7772000	And then YouTube gets to pocket a good portion of that money. So maybe they bend the rules. Who knows? I've been waiting for that YouTube competitor to step up. I haven't seen it yet, but who knows?
7773000	7779000	I mean, there's, there's been talk that Amazon's been trying something, which you kind of get the sense of with Twitch and we'll see. We'll see.
7780000	7782000	We're gonna have to do it, Rob. RobTube. Let's get it started.
7783000	7785000	RobTube. That sounds too similar to RedTube, but it might be okay with that.
7786000	7789000	Oh, shoot. We might be misdirecting our fans.
7790000	7796000	Then again, though, you'd probably be inviting the people like that to join your service because, you know, in the name, I mean.
7797000	7801000	That's right. We're going to rob you blind. Yeah. I don't have, I don't have the best name for that. I don't know.
7802000	7807000	TubeGo. Go is really big right now. So maybe, you know, TubeGo. Who knows?
7808000	7809000	PornGo. Porn.
7810000	7813000	I think we need to end this phone call and it's totally not your fault, Stoppy. I apologize.
7814000	7815000	No problem at all.
7816000	7817000	All right. Thanks for the call. I appreciate it, buddy.
7818000	7819000	Take it easy, guys.
7820000	7821000	All right. You too. Bye bye.
7822000	7823000	I mean, that would be awesome. You can catch wild porn and just by walking around to your park.
7824000	7826000	All right. Any other last minute stories tonight, Logie?
7827000	7837000	No, but I do need to, I bet, you know, I keep forgetting or remembering like late Saturday each week that they're doing that PlayStation VR demo thing at Best Buy.
7838000	7839000	I need to go over there and actually do that.
7840000	7841000	All right.
7842000	7849000	No, this is not a story, but Kotaku, the evil K, has a headline for...
7850000	7857000	Which, to be fair, has gotten a little better over the years once I first read the riot act at them on this program.
7858000	7859000	But they still have some real clickbait headlines.
7860000	7862000	Like Pokemon Go could be a death sentence for a black man.
7863000	7867000	Oh, yeah. I've heard about that story. That taps into a lot of...
7867000	7869000	That wasn't a Kotaku story, though, was it? I don't think it was.
7870000	7880000	It was something that was out there on Twitter, which ties into a lot of other issues that are going on in the world right now that I think some of us play video games to escape a lot of that fuckery.
7881000	7888000	But, I mean, I would think that's not necessarily the case, considering that, you know, it seems like a ton of people are playing, so you're gonna be in a big group of people.
7889000	7895000	I'll close on this note without going too much into the controversy that's out there in the world.
7895000	7905000	It's just the whole fact that there's some really heartwarming stories about how Pokemon Go has brought people together, and it's what the world needs right now.
7906000	7921000	It's what we need right now, is to just fucking get along in our common goal of catching little creatures to do our bidding for us in fighting to the death in the honor of our arbitrarily chosen team. Isn't that right?
7922000	7923000	Yeah.
7923000	7934000	Alright. Anyhow. Any other thoughts here at the end of the show? Any other last minute stories or anything like that? DarkSock, are you doing okay? She's ready to go catch that Raichu if it's still out there.
7935000	7936000	I think it's wandered off by now.
7937000	7938000	Ah, I ran away.
7939000	7940000	I didn't see it when I checked last time.
7941000	7942000	Someone else caught it.
7942000	7949000	It seems like though it hangs out for a bit, because there was a Golem at the park yesterday, which is Geodude's fully evolved form, right?
7950000	7956000	And all three of us were able to catch it. Myself, Alan, and Shane. I think it stays around for a little bit so everybody has a chance and then disappears.
7957000	7959000	So, I think they're just on a timer. I don't know.
7960000	7967000	Kaijuto in chat says, can't we all just get along and catch Pokemon? I think I agree. Let's just go catch some Pokemon.
7967000	7973000	Dungeon Buster says, I was thankful there was some summer games done quick to watch this past week. Me too, my friend. Me too.
7974000	7978000	That's going to bring us to a close of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
7979000	7983000	And I want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight and participating with the show.
7984000	7992000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please consider leaving us a five star review on a place like iTunes or Google Podcast or wherever it is that you found this show.
7992000	7999000	And tell a friend. It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if we're able to actually have those voices heard.
8000000	8004000	Let's go right into everybody's final thought. Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
8005000	8009000	I want Cheesecake or Pinkberry. Or both. And a Raichu.
8010000	8011000	Cheesecake flavored Pinkberry.
8012000	8013000	And a Raichu.
8014000	8015000	And cooked Raichu.
8015000	8029000	My final thought for tonight is, all the angry old man on the lawn chair stuff aside, I think it is so awesome that people are out there moving and that the community is growing and that we're meeting people.
8030000	8040000	And I think, you know, again, as kind of referenced in that last little bit there, I think that's what the world needs right now is just, you know, Pokemon and just be safe out there when you're playing the game.
8041000	8050000	Don't make bad decisions in the pursuit to catch those Pokemon. Like, don't listen to Loki. Never play the game while you're driving. That's a bad idea.
8051000	8058000	And just be safe when you're crossing the street, all that stuff. Because we don't want anybody to end up on the news and ruin Pokemon Go for all of us.
8059000	8061000	Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
8064000	8066000	I really need to stop playing this stupid game.
8067000	8068000	Tap my Katamari?
8069000	8074000	If it's not one thing, it's another. So, we'll see what game takes over next week.
8075000	8082000	I do know which game will take over next week because I purchased, since I don't own an Xbox One, and I already have Red Dead Redemption, so that's no big deal.
8083000	8090000	The other game that came out this week on PlayStation 4 was the PS2 version of The Warriors.
8091000	8092000	Oh, I didn't realize that.
8093000	8096000	So, that is a fucking awesome game if you haven't played it yet. So, I purchased that.
8097000	8100000	Alright. We'll look forward to hearing more about that next week.
8101000	8105000	So, have fun this week. Be safe out there catching your Pokemon and playing all the video games out there.
8106000	8108000	For those of you in Japan, enjoy Yo-kai Watch 3 this week.
8109000	8115000	And all the other games that are playing. Those of you continuing to play Overwatch here in the States, have fun. Don't be a jerk online.
8116000	8119000	We'll see you in 7 days with Episode 650 here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
