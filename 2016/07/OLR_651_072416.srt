00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,200
This week, Google has announced their entry into the gaming festival circuit, bringing

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,760
a venue and date out for Android game developers.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,520
And that's just one tidbit of tonight's news.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,640
Join us for this and the rest of the week's video gaming news, and it all starts right

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,520
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,840
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,240
and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,720
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 651 for this July the 24th

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,440
of 2016.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,000
We are here broadcasting from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, assembled to talk

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,440
about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,720
Here in studio is myself, Rob Roberts, on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,280
Not joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,940
She actually had to bow out, and you'll have to excuse us, we're going to have to kind

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,800
of change our flow on the fly tonight because we were planning on her being here, but unfortunately

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,280
you guys, if you were listening to last week's show, she had that surgery, right?

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,760
I guess it was maybe Monday before the last episode, and something is flared up with it

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,560
or something, so she has a lot of pain and she can't drive, so getting over to the studio

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,300
does require driving, so sadly she's going to bow out.

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,920
She could have come on on Skype or something, but I think she'd rather rest up, and hopefully

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,160
she feels better, so send your hearts emotes to her at DarkSakura on Twitter.

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
She will be back.

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,920
She said she'll be back come hell or high water next week.

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,480
Joining us, though, live in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Hello.

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
How are you?

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm fine.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,680
So, we were chatting a little bit before the show, and you said you are living in Bizarro

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
World right now, right?

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Yes, I am.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
What's going on?

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm living in Bizarro World because I was playing Pokemon Go, and then on Friday, my

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,440
wife, because originally I'd want to take my son out to downtown Sacramento to go play

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,600
Pokemon Go because I have a phone for him to play on and he wanted to do that, but then

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,840
it became 105 degrees on the weekend, so I was like, eh, no, we'll go to a mall that's

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,320
air-conditioned and go play.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,040
That's a good idea.

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,140
No, it's not a good idea.

39
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,060
The GPS in malls, they're just, no, it is absolute shit.

40
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,200
It's worse in, I guess, okay, we're going to get Sacramento on y'all for a minute.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,280
It's way worse, from my Ingress experiences, it's way worse in Sunrise Mall than it is

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,320
in Arden Mall.

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Like Sunrise Mall?

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
It's in Galleria, yeah.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Oh, interesting.

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
I've never had a problem in Galleria.

47
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,520
Yeah, Galleria, it was just, I was in the ocean most of the time because, yeah, that's

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,740
what happens when you can't.

49
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,440
Because Roosevelt's so close to the ocean.

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,480
No, it's because that's what happens when you go to 0-0 on your GPS.

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,200
We did end up finding a spot that was nice and, you know, between two PokeStops, it was

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,040
in the sun, which I wasn't too happy with, but it was all right, it was air-conditioned

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,960
as well, so we played there for a little bit.

54
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,480
But anyways, long story short, yeah, she was not going to let me take him there because

55
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,760
she thought he was going to get kidnapped or something.

56
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,680
Like I couldn't pay attention to playing a phone game and taking him with something in

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
the mall.

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm like, this is ridiculous.

59
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,580
We have this hangout for Ingress players who are playing Pokemon Go, and Loki and I are

60
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,600
obviously both in it because we're Ingress players playing Pokemon Go, and you guys actually

61
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,640
were like venting to the chat about this, going, help, does anyone else think this sounds

62
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,040
rational that my wife will not let me take the kid to the mall to play Pokemon Go because

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,240
the kid's going to get kidnapped?

64
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,600
And I said, buy a leash.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,240
That's why they make kid leashes.

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,760
I mean, he had more trouble, you know, playing in the mall because he was walking around

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,200
and like almost running into people because he's not used to that.

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Me on the other hand, I can commute to work and like, she's like, I can't catch these.

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,320
Oh, sorry.

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,520
Spoiler a little bit.

71
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
So yeah.

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,600
So anyways, Friday she decided to download Pokemon Go on her phone for whatever reason.

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Everyone else is doing it.

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
There must be something about it.

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,500
So, um, so she did it and I did one of the mom blogs post about, Oh no, it doesn't matter.

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,200
But like it was, you know, so she did that and she's been obsessed with this entire weekend.

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,880
Like we've had to make special trips to Sutter street, which is like a nearby, like old town,

78
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,360
the gold Folsom Bay basically has a lot of near the prison, a much safer place to, it

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,120
has a lot more, but while we didn't take the child, the child stayed with, you know, the

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
grandparents.

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,160
So she, she wanted to just go down there and to do that.

82
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm like, it's a hundred degrees outside.

83
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm like, you want to go?

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
So?

85
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Yeah.

86
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,440
She's like, so we can go to like, we at least go to the ice cream store over there and you

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
get some ice cream.

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,680
It is, it is really a tragedy that in 651 episodes of the show, Mrs. Loki, I think she,

89
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,000
she cameoed on some of the earliest episodes before you guys were even married.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But like, there, there's no, I don't even know if we'll ever get her on again, but she's

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,120
so fricking funny.

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,280
Like, that's, that's the part that Loki doesn't explain very well.

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
She is one of the most hilarious people you will ever meet.

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Yeah.

95
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,080
She, we always like when we're driving like home today, like first, like we're going to

96
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,920
the grocery store and she's like, okay, go buy the pokestop first.

97
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
You know?

98
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm like, all right, now, now did the wife tease you for Ingress?

99
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,720
Cause this is, oh yeah, all the time, all the fucking time.

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,880
And like, let's be honest here, like this weekend she's played it more than I have as

101
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,480
far as Pokemon goes.

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,900
I mean like, I mean, I guess I took the kid to the mall and so I played a little bit there

103
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,660
and with her, but most of the time I was just kind of sitting there.

104
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,480
But yeah, she's been playing it, you know, most of the time and like we have to make

105
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,160
stops so she can do, and like I have to catch Pokemon for her cause she doesn't know how

106
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,960
to throw the Pokeballs yet and stuff.

107
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,440
And I mean, it's just, I don't know.

108
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
She like texted me earlier.

109
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,680
I was like, yeah, we went to the, this park, you know, and did that.

110
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm like, okay.

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
This is Bizarro World.

112
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
So in Bizarro World, your wife is playing more video games than you.

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
And I'm trying to put the kids to bed.

114
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm like, can you maybe stop playing that game so we can put the kids to bed right now?

115
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,200
And that's when I was like, what the hell just happened with my life?

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
What is my life?

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,600
Uh, I've got to introduce the chatters cause they're, they're hilarious.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Real quick.

120
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,560
You know, you know how like you do something and it's pretty cool, then your parents start

121
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,160
doing it and it's not so cool anymore.

122
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Yeah.

123
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
It's kind of getting that vibe.

124
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm like, okay with it.

125
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,220
I can't really think of a lot of things like that.

126
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,080
Maybe when my mom got really into South Park, which yes, is a thing that happened.

127
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,160
My mom loved, like my mom's favorite TV show is South Park and so like, I can't watch it

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
anymore.

129
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,160
But no, it's all right.

130
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
It's fun.

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
She's getting into it.

132
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
But like, I don't know.

133
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I mean, whatever it is, what it is.

134
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
All right.

135
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
She's having fun.

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
I guess.

137
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,360
I got to get to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night

138
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,000
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show turned

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,880
11 years old tonight, by the way, happy 11th anniversary, Bobby Black Wolf.

140
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,880
One of the longest running video gaming shows out there.

141
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,240
There's a very small club of shows that are 10 plus years and we're fortunate enough to

142
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
be in it.

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
And Bobby is as well.

144
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
And of course we have our chat room.

145
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,960
So if you are listening live here on Sunday night, you can join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

146
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
And there's a lot of chat here.

147
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,320
Stoppy in chat says, bizarre world for Loki as in everything is happy and not at all frustrating.

148
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,080
No, that's just, yeah, I don't, yeah, it is bizarre world.

149
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,600
No, that's never a thing.

150
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,020
And obviously with all this Pokemon chat, a very kind plug from William Murderface in

151
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,180
chat saying, Sky, I've been listening to the new Pokestop podcast and as usual, you're

152
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,180
doing a great job.

153
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,180
Well, thank you very much.

154
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,500
We're having a lot of fun doing that show.

155
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,540
The fever around Pokemon Go, which I already had a love for AR gaming because of Ingress

156
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,700
has just basically fueled my love for Pokemon in general.

157
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,940
And now I'm getting into the handheld games and Shane is living in bizarro world because

158
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,260
it's like, wait, Rob wants to talk about Pokemon now.

159
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,860
So it's kind of, I guess, a similar thing.

160
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,860
Let's see.

161
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,100
Rob in chat says, I just came back from a big Pokemon Go event here in my city.

162
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,260
Tigerclaw with a question saying, tried to catch some Pokemon this weekend, but don't

163
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,920
have any Pokeballs.

164
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,460
How do you get Pokeballs without going to some stuff?

165
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,860
Do they give you some free ones per week?

166
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,060
You get some when you level up, but, but yeah, I had a problem where I ran a Pokeballs this

167
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,060
weekend as well.

168
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,820
And the problem is like, I go to the, I go to a lot of the Pokestops, but I get like

169
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,820
potions.

170
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,180
I like, I had to dump.

171
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,940
I've been dumping tons of potions and revives cause I have like a hundred of each and I

172
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,220
don't need that shit.

173
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,500
You'll have to find a very dense area of portals, Tigerclaw.

174
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,460
And honestly, some of the best places for that is cemeteries, downtowns, colleges, um,

175
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,020
anything that's going to have a lot of artistic type of landmarks.

176
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,420
So if you have a very artistic part of town, uh, that would be one, uh, you have to find

177
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,080
a portal dense area and just walk around.

178
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,300
Think of it, think of it too as, um, you can hatch eggs while you're doing it.

179
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,480
So you put some eggs in the incubator and you can do that.

180
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,740
And uh, yeah, unfortunately that's one way to do it.

181
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,360
You could spend money and buy them in the shop, but I think that is one of the worst

182
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
things to buy in the shop.

183
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
I really do.

184
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
It is.

185
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,820
And I had to do it though because like I was seriously just sitting there spinning that

186
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,460
shit and getting nothing and, and, and on top of that being the level that we are now,

187
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,700
you get all these like bullshit that happens with the fucking Pokemon, not excluding when

188
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,160
the game is all fucked up.

189
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,940
So like they'll pop out of the fucking shit, like I'll throw down fucking a raspberry and

190
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,380
use it, you know, a great ball to try to catch a fucking low level Pidgey that just won't

191
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,700
fucking stay in the goddamn ball forever.

192
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Yeah.

193
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,940
I saw an article this week that was talking about, cause you know, there's, there's people

194
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,340
out there that want to, want to hate on Pokemon go, but this was, this was pretty fair.

195
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,940
It's talking about the end game struggle, you know, that the game gets a lot harder,

196
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,260
but then, you know, I don't want to repeat myself from Pokestop, but I will just say

197
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
this.

198
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,620
Remember that these games are not designed to be beat in two weeks.

199
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,980
This game is supposed to last a very long time.

200
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,820
They don't want you to catch them all in two weeks.

201
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,520
I realized somebody did, if you don't count six of them that nobody has, you know, somebody's

202
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,660
gotten closer than anyone else will say, I realized that news is around there and they

203
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,180
found out the level cap is 40 and all this stuff.

204
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,240
But just remember these games are not meant to beat in two weeks.

205
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,020
And I think if you are trying to beat it that fast, you're going to burn it, you burn yourself

206
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,020
out.

207
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,020
It's just like burning.

208
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,620
That's where half of my Poke balls goes like from this shit or when the game decides, Hey,

209
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
guess what?

210
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,620
You're gonna throw curve balls forever.

211
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,460
Now it's like, I didn't like to throw curve ball.

212
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,220
It's an actual, like I've actually purposely done it before, which I still don't understand.

213
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,040
I mean, it's supposed to make it easier to catch them, which is bullshit.

214
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,840
That's like saying, you know, it'd be a whole lot easier for me to throw this baseball with

215
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,120
my left hand blindfolded and backwards.

216
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,160
I mean, that's kind of what they're asking there, but to actually throw a curve ball,

217
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,920
you have to like spin the Poke ball around.

218
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,320
You'll actually draw circles with your finger on the screen and it spins and then you throw

219
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
it.

220
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,560
But there's this wonderful glitch that happens, especially when you're using your great balls

221
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,280
or whatever that for whatever fucking reason decides, Hey, it's just going to throw a curve

222
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,800
ball randomly.

223
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Like as if there's some magical force field blocking the fucking Poke balls.

224
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,600
Or as if your phone did like a hiccup because something in the background refreshed and

225
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,960
so it reads the touches wrong.

226
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,560
I kind of think that's what causes it.

227
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,120
But anyway, I will say this, you know, for what it's worth, again, longtime Ingress player,

228
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,460
the current Ingress version that's out there is, if I'm not mistaken, it's 1.104.0.

229
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,560
That's the version number they're on.

230
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,000
They've done 104 updates to Ingress since, when did they go into 1.0?

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,320
When did they officially launch it?

232
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
About three years ago?

233
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,720
We'll say about three years ago.

234
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,920
It was four years because they did a three year thing at the center.

235
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,400
Yeah, but it was in beta for the earliest stuff.

236
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,720
So I think it's just about three years.

237
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,520
So my point is that, you know, and not every update has been substantial, but like power

238
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,520
cubes were not in the game in the beginning.

239
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,720
They did not have, certainly didn't have like Lawson cubes and some of these other items

240
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
that are there now.

241
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,800
Axeshields and stuff, those were not around in the first few versions and the, you know,

242
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
portal network grew.

243
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,640
So there's, there's a lot that changed and I really do believe Pokemon Go will get this

244
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
as well.

245
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,680
It's just probably going to take them a little time to get the amount of people on the team

246
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,040
that they really need because somehow they underestimated the amount of people that would

247
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,860
want to play Pokemon, but it's a lot.

248
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,400
So I think it'll get better though.

249
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I really do.

250
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,880
Boy, how about that?

251
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,600
Three weeks in a row, we're opening up talking about Pokemon Go.

252
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,960
This is not a lot of news otherwise.

253
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Well, and it really, I mean, it really is the biggest thing in gaming right now.

254
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,360
Anybody who's a gamer, anybody who's not a gamer is playing it.

255
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,800
It's really blowing my mind on just what a big cultural phenomenon this thing is.

256
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,680
But there is something else big going on this weekend I want to talk about here at the top

257
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,680
of the show and that's Comic-Con, which I feel like, especially in the general geek

258
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,660
universe, you know, I know we don't talk a lot about the geek movies and stuff.

259
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,900
We have other shows at VOG Network that do that, but there definitely was a lot of that

260
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
news this weekend.

261
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Right?

262
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,500
You saw like the Wonder Woman trailer, which looked hot.

263
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,900
Even the Justice League trailer didn't look that bad.

264
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,860
The Justice League trailer was not bad.

265
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,060
It was a lot better than the last movie.

266
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
Yeah, exactly.

267
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,060
It's coming with a secret.

268
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
Okay.

269
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
Well, it wasn't bad, so it's good.

270
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
Let's see.

271
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
And then what else?

272
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,740
We know that Brie Larson is now Miss Marvel or Captain Marvel, excuse me.

273
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,140
Well, you know, whatever, but, you know, I'm sure Dark Soccer would have a lot to say

274
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,140
about that.

275
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,780
Brie Larson, a local girl, you know, she's a Sacramento, California native.

276
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,540
So yeah, local connection there.

277
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,540
And let's see.

278
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
What else did they announce this weekend?

279
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
It seems like there's just a lot.

280
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,540
There's a lot of new.

281
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,500
Oh, the Star Trek is huge.

282
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
They have it.

283
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,220
It's called Star Trek Discovery is the name now.

284
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
That's huge.

285
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,660
The CBS All Access show.

286
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,180
The new Doctor Strange trailer was pretty cool.

287
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Oh, yeah.

288
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,100
The new, they had another trailer for a lot of Warner stuff.

289
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,760
So another trailer for Suicide Squad, which that looks fantastic.

290
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,800
And then another trailer for the Lego Batman movie, which just looks fucking hilarious

291
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,020
with the origin of Robin in this.

292
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,220
Sorry, I'm just catching up on chat over at live.vognetwork.com and this joke about Pokemon

293
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Go is pretty good.

294
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,060
Kaijuto in chat says, I use the Tinder app a lot.

295
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,620
So my curve swipe is great.

296
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,020
You like that?

297
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
That's good.

298
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,820
All these balls just keep going to the left.

299
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Go figure.

300
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,460
Let's see.

301
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,620
Brad from Pod Culture says the Flash and the Arrow trailers were cool.

302
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,420
I know, like, I know a lot of other shows on our network like Pod Culture, Critical

303
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,820
Myth love that CW universe of shows.

304
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,380
So that's the Netflix universe of shows with all the Defenders.

305
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,720
They also had Iron Fist and Luke Cage.

306
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,180
And I know this isn't necessarily comic books, but I do feel like there's a lot of geek crossover

307
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,180
with this.

308
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,940
But you, first thing you said when you walked in here tonight was about Netflix and everybody's

309
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,980
talking about this show, right?

310
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Yes.

311
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,700
So I've been watching, I just started watching Stranger Things.

312
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,660
Well, I should say, I'm not started, I'm halfway through it now.

313
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,860
It's fantastic.

314
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,940
It's absolutely fantastic.

315
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,740
All the good things people are saying about it is absolutely true.

316
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,540
It's well shot.

317
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,820
It's got great music.

318
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,340
It's got a great story.

319
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,340
Great cast.

320
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,420
It's one of the best TV shows I've ever seen.

321
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,980
And it's like it's an 80s throwback.

322
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
It's basically like an 80s throwback.

323
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,540
There's a very, a lot of Spielberg, John Carpenter.

324
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,420
Winona Ryder's the star, for fuck's sake.

325
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,180
She's not a, I mean, she's a supporting star.

326
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
She's the biggest name.

327
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,180
She's the biggest name.

328
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,180
But yeah, it's fantastic.

329
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,540
I mean, seriously, even just start watching the first episode and as soon as that title

330
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,900
sequence hits, you're just like, fuck yes, I'm watching the rest of this.

331
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,220
That's pretty much it.

332
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,500
It's just like, this is so fucking awesome.

333
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,740
You played that for me and I did get a very Unsolved Mysteries vibe from it.

334
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,860
It's so good.

335
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,660
Any person our age, you hear that Unsolved Mysteries theme and you just like, it's PTSD.

336
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,180
Like you just, I shouldn't make a lie if something's so serious, but you know what I mean?

337
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,980
Like you just, you just suddenly like, oh my God, oh my God, this guy's going to be

338
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,300
on TV and scare the hell out of me and there's going to be some dramatic reenactment that's

339
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,460
going to scare the hell out of me.

340
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,860
But yeah, it's pretty good and I don't know what they're going to do for like a second

341
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,860
season.

342
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,300
I've heard things that I don't know if it's going to be the same since I haven't finished

343
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
this one yet.

344
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,700
Um, we don't know like what the end is, but you know, I don't know if they're going to

345
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,140
do this, like it's going to be just a different thing altogether because the way they broke

346
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,820
it out, each episode is a chapter.

347
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,180
So it's like chapter two, blah, blah, blah.

348
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,100
It's very much like a, you know, science fiction book.

349
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
So I don't know.

350
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
It'd be pretty cool.

351
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,940
Well, so the whole reason I brought up Comic-Con and comics and stuff was to talk about comic

352
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:24,060
based video games and maybe ones that you've enjoyed because I do kind of feel like a lot

353
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,500
of them have not been so great.

354
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,580
Like it kind of suffers from that movie syndrome too, is that a lot of the stuff they release

355
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,460
is really kind of, I don't know, I don't know.

356
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,020
Marvel Ultimate Alliance kind of recently definitely had its fans, right?

357
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,500
You know, so I'm not saying they're all bad.

358
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,580
I remember, well, see, I, my brain goes to Batman on the NES, but that really was more

359
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,300
of a movie game than it was a comic game.

360
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,540
But Batman on the Commodore 64 back in the day, that was a comic game for sure.

361
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,720
What do you, what do you think, Loki, comic book based video games that you can think

362
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
of that were good?

363
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,500
How about you guys in chat over at live.vognetware.com?

364
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,940
Well, I mean, you know, my son and I, we play the Lego Marvel stuff, so those are pretty

365
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
good.

366
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,340
And even though I played a little bit of Lego, Lego DC or Lego Batman 2, which is basically

367
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,580
Lego DC, that was all right.

368
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,740
I mean, the Lego universe games are kind of fun, but like even all those, you see all

369
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,300
the little characters and everything, and there's like a bunch of characters since I

370
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,940
don't read a lot of the comics, like who are these people?

371
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,940
Then you see, like my son has a poster now, Marvel poster, I got him, and I'm like, oh,

372
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
hey, there's that guy.

373
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,540
There's Absorbent Man, you know, I recognize him from the Lego game, you know, that kind

374
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,540
of stuff.

375
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,180
I don't know, I think a lot of it kind of gets me back into like the actual, like the

376
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,540
Marvel universe and everything, especially the cinematic stuff.

377
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:50,020
Yeah, I can't really think of a lot of like games I've played.

378
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,240
I mean, before that, I would say Marvel versus Capcom.

379
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
That series is pretty cool.

380
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,140
Okay, that's a damn good answer.

381
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,940
I don't know if there is a better answer to be honest, but we'll see.

382
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,380
Looking at chat, let's look at chat because they've got some ideas.

383
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,740
Stoppy in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says, my favorite comic-based game is Spider-Man

384
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,740
on the PlayStation 1.

385
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,060
There's a lot of chat right now about Injustice 2, which I guess they talked about this weekend

386
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,980
at Comic-Con, Tiger Claw saying they did two new characters, Wonder Woman and Blue Beetle.

387
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,020
Injustice 1 is a pretty good game though.

388
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,020
You know, it's really not bad.

389
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,080
Honestly, still haven't played it yet, and I haven't in my queue because it was free

390
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
with the...

391
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
It was free on PlayStation.

392
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Yeah, I haven't.

393
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
I have not played it.

394
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
You should check it out.

395
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,800
It's on that same engine as Mortal Kombat, the newer ones, so it plays really well.

396
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,200
I mean, obviously it doesn't have fatalities or any of that stuff, but they do different

397
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
things.

398
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
It's fun.

399
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
I like it.

400
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I guess I'll try it.

401
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Let's see.

402
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,720
Dungeon Buster says, Ultimate Alliance is pretty good.

403
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,680
The sequel is kind of meh, but worth playing if only to hear Thor spew anti-registration

404
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
lines.

405
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's see, Tiger Claw says, I learned about the Marvel universe by playing Ultimate Alliance.

406
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,920
I like how the game introduces you to these characters, and you can get all sorts of backstories

407
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
about them.

408
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,320
And Dungeon Buster says, the X-Men Legends game by Raven Software were really good.

409
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,280
Are those the old ones from the early 90s?

410
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,080
There were some X-Men games in the early 90s that were boss.

411
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,240
X-Men Legends were PlayStation 2, I want to say.

412
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Is that the...

413
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,400
Well, there's also the X-Men arcade game, which was pretty awesome.

414
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
That was definitely more about the...

415
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,720
Well, was it the comics, or was it the 90s animation?

416
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,480
I think the arcade was maybe the animation.

417
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,160
Maybe, because I think it was to try and copy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' success, which

418
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,120
was also a big animation in the 90s, and the arcade definitely had a lot of vibe from that.

419
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,640
Speaking of which, a little tangent here, I happened to catch an episode of the Ninja

420
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:48,200
Turtles show on Nickelodeon, and what the fuck happened to that show?

421
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,880
I did not fucking recognize that shit at all.

422
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
You grew up.

423
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
You grew up.

424
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
No, no, no.

425
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Get off my lawn.

426
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Stop.

427
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Okay, here's what happened.

428
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,800
I'm not sure if this is maybe a mini story arc spinoff of the actual show or something

429
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,920
like that, or if this is what the fucking show's become.

430
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,960
Basically the Ninja Turtles show is pull the fucking Saints bro, where it's just...

431
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,840
The 80s cartoon was, they're in New York, they're fighting in the other foot clan, and

432
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,680
the craziest thing you have is like Krang and all that shit.

433
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,520
What I watched the fucking other day was, they're in space with this robot.

434
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,760
There's fucking frog people, some sort of triceratops people, and they're doing space

435
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
battles.

436
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm like, this is not fucking close to Ninja Turtles at all.

437
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,600
At all.

438
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,080
What the fuck is going on?

439
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,280
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

440
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,220
Comics zone on Genesis, says Stopy, is good but hard.

441
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,120
Not based on a specific comic though, as far as I know.

442
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,960
There are some original comic games, there's not a lot, but I remember one on the Commodore

443
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,000
64 that was one of my absolute favorites that was ever on that system, it was called Accolade

444
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Comics.

445
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,080
Man, if I'd thought of this before the show, I would have totally done this as a classic

446
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,520
game this week, but I guess I'll have to save it for another week.

447
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,720
You actually, it was like a choose your own adventure thing, where the comic would load

448
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,400
on the screen, and each panel would load as you chose your own adventure.

449
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,040
And you might choose something that leads you to death, which is bad, or you might choose

450
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,680
something that leads you to an arcade game sequence that you would have to play to get

451
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,700
to the next sequence of comics.

452
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
That game was badass.

453
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,160
I think it was one of the later Commodore 64 releases, but I remember that was one of

454
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,320
my favorites, Accolade Comics, I think that was the company, Accolade Software that made

455
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
that.

456
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,400
Yeah, that was one of my favorites.

457
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,760
Looking back on comic based games, we have some-

458
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,960
And as Tigerclaw mentions, yes, did you notice Raph having a girlfriend in the series?

459
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,920
Yes, because that's how the fucking episode ended with him about to kiss her, and that

460
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
was it.

461
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,840
I was like, what the fuck is going on with this show?

462
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,800
I thought all the episodes were supposed to end with a pizza party.

463
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,720
I just don't, I don't, when you take your fucking series into space is when I think

464
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,080
it starts to, you lose it for me, Saints Row.

465
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:21,160
Alright, we're going to move on, we've got some gaming news to get into for this week,

466
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:28,480
but I do want to, of course, do a few plugs here, vognetwork.com, if you guys have seen

467
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,920
Star Trek Beyond, which I still need to see, there's a review up there from one of the

468
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,120
guys at Critical Myth, Bronzethumb, and I still need to see this, but I see some of

469
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,420
the response reviews already coming in, it seems like people are loving Beyond compared

470
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,480
to the last movie, which is a good sign for me, because I didn't really care for the last

471
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,840
movie, I liked the first one, not the second one, so yeah, maybe Kelvin Timeline is all

472
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,200
about the odd-numbered movies, I don't know, so.

473
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,800
Or like, you know, would they refer to it like the alternate, well, I guess like alternate

474
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,400
universe in the show I'm watching is the upside down?

475
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,480
Maybe, I don't know.

476
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,880
Now you're making me think this is the introduction to the opposite sketch, but let's see, so

477
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,720
yeah, check that out, Flacco's got another summer movie preview as well, so you can rank

478
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,920
the cool movies that you want to see, although I'm very upset that he left the absolutely

479
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,400
fabulous movie off the list, because that's my most anticipated movie of summer, but I

480
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,280
suppose not everybody remembers the British original, so yeah, definitely check that out

481
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,200
and rank those, and I've got like a ton of stuff in the queue, because I'm so far behind,

482
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,400
because I've been doing way too many podcasts lately, so lots of great stuff coming up.

483
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:49,320
I do want to also plug, Bobby Blackwolf did a video about, kind of like a response to

484
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,240
all the controversy about Tesla Autopilot.

485
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,840
Yeah, I had to talk someone down while I was getting my smog check, you know, because they

486
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,120
were saying, garbage, like, oh yeah, did you hear about that guy that got killed by one

487
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
of the self-driving cars?

488
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm like.

489
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,440
Did you hear about the 50,000 that got killed by the non-self-driving car?

490
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,120
I mean, whatever, anyway, I think, now you have a video you can show.

491
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,960
Bobby's got a great kind of response to that whole thing, and you can check that out on

492
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,800
our YouTube channel, at VOG Network, very exciting.

493
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,600
Let's see, what else do I have to say?

494
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,000
We will be off on Labor Day weekend, because I will be at DragonCon, so I hope to meet

495
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,240
you guys in Atlanta.

496
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,880
I don't know yet if we actually have any panels this year, I haven't heard back from Podcast

497
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,360
Track, so I hope we'll be around regardless, even if we don't get invited to do an official

498
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,760
panel, we'll still be lurking around that area, and probably shooting our own stuff,

499
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,160
now that Bobby's got all the video stuff, so we'll kind of be doing a slightly different

500
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,920
approach to DragonCon this year, so that's really exciting.

501
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,200
Who knows what's going to happen.

502
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,200
And I think that's it, otherwise, plug in my own podcast, Pokestop Podcast, guys on

503
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,520
the show, everything that's at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

504
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,080
Let's get into some gaming news this week.

505
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,400
Look, you want to start us off.

506
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,120
All right, so there is some information that's kind of come out from Pokemon Go, and this

507
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,760
is due to some data mining.

508
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,400
So for example, we found out that there is an actual cap to the trainer level, which

509
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,340
is 40, and it's going to take you a while to get there, though, because in order to

510
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:29,000
level up to 40, actually from one to 40 is 20 million experience points.

511
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,120
And in fact, just level 39 to 40 is five million, so that definitely steps up quite a bit after

512
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
level 20.

513
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,640
Pokemon themselves also have level caps, they only go up to 30, so pretty much anything

514
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,200
you catch at 30 or greater is only going to be that same level until you actually increase

515
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,960
its stats using the Stardust and Candy and all that fun stuff.

516
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,080
Each Pokemon also has their own capture and flee rates.

517
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,840
There's also some Pokemon do become harder to catch as you level up, no shit, and we

518
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,360
figured that out quite a long time ago.

519
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:12,480
Of course, you know, it's pretty obvious that you get bonus, or it makes, it helps to get

520
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,600
those nice, great throws or whatever, and the curveball throws help capture Pokemon

521
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
as well.

522
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,120
It kind of works into that whole flee rate and everything.

523
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,560
You know, of course, the other, we know that the Mewtwo, Moltres, Zapdos, Artuno, and Lead,

524
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,960
other, I guess those four are legendary Pokemon, so probably going to be something to do with

525
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,080
the actual, you know, events that they do.

526
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,440
They said that Farfetch'd is out there, and actually I did see that someone did catch

527
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,880
it in Japan, so there is Farfetch'd as well.

528
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,600
They said each Pokemon now also has their base, like a base attack amount, and of all

529
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,260
the Pokemon that are available in the game, the strongest for the non-legendary is Dragonite,

530
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:07,020
and then, of course, Mewtwo has a base attack of 284, so slightly higher, and then they're

531
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:15,380
also saying that there's, let's see here, that there's, now I'm not familiar with the

532
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:23,980
game too much, but that there's the same type attack bonus in this game as well as in the

533
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,740
portable games, so if you're using, for example, a Grass Pokemon and you use a Grass move,

534
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,060
you get a 25% bonus to attack, so that's kind of nice.

535
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,700
And then apparently the Master Ball's in the game, because it was in the beta, but no one's

536
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,180
come across it yet.

537
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
Hmm.

538
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:46,060
All right, well, I guess there's still more to be unveiled as people progress in this

539
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,260
game and so on.

540
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:54,180
Let's see, going to the chat over at live.voggenetwork.com, JD is saying Farfetch'd is a regional exclusive,

541
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:00,460
so are Konguskon, Taros, and Mr. Mime, which Taros is the one that's here in the US, and

542
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:06,300
they say Mr. Mime I think is Europe, and what Konguskon I guess would be Eurasia?

543
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,420
So how did that one guy catch them all?

544
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
Did he actually go traveling?

545
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
Australia, what am I saying here?

546
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,940
Did he actually go traveling or did he travel using the power of GPS spoofing?

547
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,500
Well, they may hatch in eggs, I think they all hatch in eggs, so if you get lucky with

548
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,140
the eggs, you get that.

549
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,140
Yeah, that's what Alan Alchemy says, they are hatchable from 5k eggs, they are just

550
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,980
region locked finding on the street.

551
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,300
I have 10k eggs, so I wonder what that is.

552
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,380
Usually it's evolved Pokemon I think at that point, you get more advanced stuff.

553
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,900
Well those are ultra rare ones, they're like the 10k, so.

554
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,140
Yeah, yeah, so he gets good stuff in there.

555
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,020
JD says Serebii has a list of what's in eggs, I've seen a chart float around on Twitter

556
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:50,340
out there, and not all the 2k eggs are bad, because your Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtles

557
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
are in those 2k eggs.

558
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,020
I've been trying to find more Charmanders in starting Pokemon and stuff, because how

559
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,380
the fuck am I supposed to level this guy up?

560
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,620
Did I tell you what happened at work?

561
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,460
I don't usually talk about work on this show, but I think the stories we're sharing.

562
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,060
So I'm sitting at my desk doing my job, writing a training guide, this is what I do, and one

563
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,860
of the managers comes through the office and whispers in a very loud voice, Charmander,

564
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,900
Charmander, and suddenly everybody discreetly is taking out their phones and sure enough

565
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,980
there's a Charmander at the front of the building.

566
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:26,820
We had one of those, the dragon ones, actually, was in front of one of our buildings, everyone

567
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,420
was running out to the parking lot to get it and stuff.

568
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,140
I didn't because I heard it too late, and unfortunately, you know.

569
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,740
Well you don't live far, you don't work far from where that Dratini farm is.

570
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,980
No, yeah, that's definitely there.

571
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,900
What's kind of nice, we have like a local, they have like a Google Maps that people are

572
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,500
adding stuff like, you know, stuff that's on the actual map, like all the different

573
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,940
and pokestops and everything, and also where different farms are.

574
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,420
So there's like a Dratini farm, I was actually browsing using that pokivision.com website,

575
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,300
which I recommend you check out while it's still up, although they've been having trouble

576
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,500
staying up because of the demand and the servers, you know, so if they get hit too hard or the

577
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,600
servers get hit too hard, it goes down.

578
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,900
But it's fucking useful, like my son wanted to get a Pikachu, so I searched the area,

579
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,980
and oh there's a Pikachu right here on this street, drove over to right where it was,

580
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,420
boom there's a Pikachu.

581
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:23,380
So it actually uses the API in the game somehow, I know it has to do with, it logs in somehow

582
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,080
using the Poke Club stuff, because I know they were saying they were having trouble

583
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,380
getting it to work when that's down, and then it tells you where the stuff is, and you can

584
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,420
scan every 30 seconds and check out the whole area and find all this stuff.

585
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,980
It's pretty crazy.

586
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,460
And I'm sure not what Niantic intended to be done, so we'll see what happens with that.

587
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,960
JD in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, I'm wondering if the API pokivision uses has

588
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,360
anything to do with the wearable.

589
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,900
And Bobby is realizing by scanning his house, it turns out my house is a Pokemon hotspot.

590
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,300
Pikachu has spawned in our backyard I don't know how many times.

591
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
So you're not alone.

592
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,140
One of the things I heard is that the spawn points for these, I mean whereas they'd spawn

593
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:15,240
randomly, are set, so like if a Pikachu spawns in one spot, it'll keep spawning there eventually

594
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
later on.

595
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,740
I was almost, I was convinced that it is tied to the what they call XM distribution in Ingress.

596
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,180
Yeah, it could be, and I think a lot of, definitely population density has a lot to do with it

597
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:31,440
because in the areas that are more dense, you'd find there's more Pokemon there.

598
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,820
So where I'd get more points for creating a field over that, that's where the Pokemon

599
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,820
are.

600
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Makes sense, makes sense.

601
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,540
Alright, well let's move on and talk about Ubisoft with a comment that they've made on

602
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,820
Nintendo NX.

603
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,100
Oh, we couldn't go a week without an NX story even though Nintendo's-

604
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Oh wait, wait, wait.

605
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
Wait.

606
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
What?

607
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,100
Since we were just talking about Pokemon, I got a text from my wife.

608
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,740
I wanted to make sure that I mentioned this real quick.

609
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
We all hear this.

610
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,740
Okay.

611
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,820
She said, I put down an Incense, I, one got away, I caught one, then the game glitched

612
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,580
out while I was catching one, restarted it, it wouldn't let me back in.

613
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,900
By the time I did, 10 seconds were left on the Incense.

614
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:13,380
Poopy emoji.

615
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,340
It's really the poopy emoji that made that story.

616
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,820
Same thing happened to me the first day the game launched, so yeah, it's just, hopefully

617
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,300
Niantic gets those server issues worked out, but it seems like it's gotten a lot better.

618
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,120
Well she has like an iPhone 5 and for some reason that thing takes forever to log in.

619
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
I bet.

620
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
I don't know what the problem is.

621
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
I bet.

622
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Alright, let's see.

623
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,520
So, the CEO of Ubisoft has talked about Nintendo NX and he's actually saying it's really great,

624
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,200
saying quote, on the NX, what we have seen is really great, so we think having a new

625
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,960
machine coming is going to help the industry to continue to grow and take lots more casual

626
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,200
players back in the industry.

627
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,040
Of course, we have no idea what the specs are or anything, but this is noteworthy because

628
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:05,680
of course Ubisoft kind of went all in on the Wii U in the beginning, creating one of

629
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:11,720
the best third party games that was on the Wii U, or probably even the best, Zombie U,

630
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:17,360
which was great, and then they promptly abandoned the Wii U when that game didn't sell up to

631
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,800
expectations because the Wii U wasn't selling, except for Just Dance, but we don't count

632
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
that.

633
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,000
I just don't know if I can trust Ubisoft with telling me what's good and what's not.

634
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,520
After all, Ubisoft decided, hey, you know that Wii Fit volatility sensor that you guys

635
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,400
want to push to never getting them out with, we're going to come and release something

636
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,640
like that as well for meditation or something.

637
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,820
Hey, you guys are really into video games and stuff, how about we release a laser tag

638
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,820
set instead?

639
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:52,200
So, they don't necessarily have a good judge of hardware, it seems like.

640
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,040
So, I'll wait and see.

641
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Fair enough.

642
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,880
Alright, why don't you do this next, because you feel passionate about this story that

643
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,080
Jamie was going to tell us about, so I think you should do this.

644
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,640
Ah yes, so Sonic Mania, this is kind of cool, they had some stuff, well aside from the really

645
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,400
fucking terrible livestream that they did, they did have some announcements, so one of

646
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,440
those is being Sonic Mania.

647
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,680
It is a throwback to the classic Sonic games, so they've got the Sonic, the Hedgehog 1,

648
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,360
2, 3, I think Knuckles and all that stuff is there.

649
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:34,380
And then, this brand new fan-made game that's being endorsed as well, and it's got the three

650
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,880
main characters, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.

651
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,540
And they're going to have new twists and new stages and that kind of stuff.

652
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,200
And that's supposed to be coming out on all major platforms in the spring of 2017.

653
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,840
Okay, but you had some pretty strong thoughts on this when you saw the trailer, right?

654
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
The trailer for this?

655
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,320
I thought the trailer for this looked okay.

656
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,760
Oh no, this is something else, the livestream or something.

657
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,000
The livestream was fucking terrible.

658
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,760
They had like, buzzing the entire time in the audio, and it's just really awkward.

659
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,080
If you want like a good summary of it, because, I mean, just to explain, it would, it doesn't

660
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
do it justice.

661
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:19,200
Go check out Jim Sterling, he's got a kind of a shit show compilation of what they did

662
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,320
during the livestream, and it's just, it's very awkward.

663
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
It's very awkward.

664
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,640
Like, they were trying to show footage of, or show the trailer for Sonic Mania, and it

665
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,560
wasn't fucking working, just as their audio wasn't working, and they're like, we've got

666
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,720
some great news for you, you know, you guys watching at home, and you know, the fans of

667
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,420
the Sonic series, and the great news is, and the audio cut out during the whole fucking

668
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,220
news that they were talking about, it was hilarious.

669
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:56,180
So yeah, show, not great, trailer for this looked pretty cool, so I'm down with that.

670
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,340
The also, I was gonna say, I don't remember if this was on our show rollout, no.

671
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:07,780
So they also did have, aside from Sonic Mania, there's, I wanna say projects, was it Sonic

672
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,000
Project 2017 or something like that, I don't remember what it's called, but basically they're

673
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,280
doing a new Sonic Generations game, and they showed Sonic, you know, the classic Sonic,

674
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,980
and then there's a third Sonic, which may be a Sonic Boom Sonic, which no one really

675
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,340
wants him, but he wasn't in the trailer, I just know there's three of them, and they're

676
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,200
basically fighting off against some giant robots or something, and it was just, it was

677
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,860
completely CG animated, it wasn't like an actual gameplay thing or anything, but that's

678
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,740
coming as well, and that'll be Holiday 2017, so there is another game coming, so two games

679
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
next year.

680
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,740
They don't look bad.

681
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,420
Yeah, the Sonic Mania especially, it looked like what Sonic Episode 4 should have been,

682
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
or Sonic Part 4.

683
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,100
Yeah, and Sonic Mania basically is like saying, hey, this is, you know, made by the people

684
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,340
that made Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors, you know, the two good games, so that's hopeful.

685
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,880
Going to the chat for some comments over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, Sonic

686
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,720
Mania looks legit, I'm down for it, but I'm cautious.

687
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,880
Bob Coffee says, the live stream only reached 6 out of 10 on the Konami E3 2010 scale.

688
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
I don't know.

689
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,480
I think it was probably worse than Konami.

690
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,640
Lizzie Dartitsuya says, I did like the Studiopolis level, had a ton of neat Sega Easter eggs

691
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,480
hidden throughout the level, and one thing I didn't know, Studiopolis is the name of

692
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,480
the recording studio where they do the dialogue for all the modern Sonic games and the Sonic

693
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Boom cartoon.

694
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Well, I don't know.

695
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,440
Is that a good thing, though?

696
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
I'm just kidding.

697
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
I'm kidding.

698
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Maybe.

699
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
I guess.

700
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Maybe.

701
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
All right, what else is in the news, Logie?

702
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,480
All right, so we can talk a little bit about, oh God, in it, about, we talked about Sonic,

703
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,160
and you know, Sonic Boom, really terrible.

704
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,960
I mean, it's just not a great series.

705
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,360
The games aren't that great either.

706
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,360
But this is like, this is kind of confusing, because now we have Mega Man, which is a great

707
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:05,800
game series, which is getting an animated cartoon which looks like absolute shit.

708
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,720
At least I don't agree with the art style.

709
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
It just, no.

710
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
No.

711
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,360
And why is there a tiny Mega Man on his head?

712
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,320
It makes no fucking sense.

713
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:20,600
But they're doing a new Mega Man game, which, you know, they chose to make it based on the

714
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:27,880
upcoming Mega Man, Man of Action cartoon, rumored that to be, they're saying that they're

715
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,760
going to be developing two different versions of the game.

716
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,080
One's going to be like the main version of the game, which is for, you know, the consoles

717
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
and everything, more powerful stuff.

718
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,600
Then the other one's going to be for 3DS and mobile, and that's going to be Outsource.

719
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,160
The 3DS and mobile one's going to be obviously the weaker of the two.

720
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:50,200
They're saying one thing about the game that they did notice that the naming, the way they

721
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,120
named the characters isn't necessarily going to be like, you know, Fireman, you know, that

722
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
type of stuff.

723
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,720
It's going to be based off of like musical names.

724
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,200
So like they're given examples of Flare Symphony, Frostbite, Sonata, Saber, Waltz.

725
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,600
What are these Castlevania titles?

726
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,120
So it sounds like, is there going to be a boss named Nocturne of the Moonlight?

727
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Is that?

728
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,240
But basically they said that the game is going to look like, you know, like a Mega Man game,

729
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:20,320
just, you know, with, you know, better graphics, which makes me worry that, oh God, it's going

730
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,000
to be a Capcom version of fucking Mighty No. 9.

731
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,320
I mean, cause like, that's what happens when you make a copy of a copy.

732
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,960
The quality really starts to degrade.

733
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,360
Didn't anyone watch Multiplicity?

734
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,440
I mean, don't we know what happens when you keep cloning?

735
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:43,680
It's just, it's not, I just like, oh God, the cartoon does not look good.

736
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,960
It just does not look good.

737
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,260
It looks like, yeah, you know, we were totally respected franchise.

738
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,300
We want to go in a different direction with it.

739
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,040
It's like, no.

740
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,920
And then, hey, you know what?

741
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,120
Fans want a new Mega Man game.

742
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,820
So we really want to push this new cartoon that we have.

743
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,880
So we're going to make it based off that.

744
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
Why?

745
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,520
Uh, JD does have a good point in our chat over at live.vognetware.com.

746
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,880
Mega Man's always had music references, rock and roll, et cetera.

747
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,480
So they're always, you know, rock man.

748
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
That's true.

749
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,520
But no, I, I don't even think it really matters what we call them.

750
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,820
You literally just did this.

751
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,660
You make a very good point and I'm going to choose to ignore it.

752
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,660
I'm sorry.

753
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:35,300
It's just like, I have, I have the artwork of Mega Man staring at me and it's just like,

754
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,620
no, it does not work for me.

755
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,620
It doesn't.

756
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,620
I mean, it's fine.

757
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:47,940
Let's, let's give it the benefit that maybe it's good.

758
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,180
You really don't know till you play it.

759
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,220
You don't know, Loki.

760
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,860
I don't know until I watch the reviews for it.

761
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,900
I ain't fucking touching that thing.

762
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
Uh, let's see.

763
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,660
And dark Tetsuya says rush.

764
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,940
Don't forget rush.

765
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,780
Well, what truly one of the greatest bands of all time, right?

766
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,740
We need a new robot dog named journey.

767
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,900
That's what we need.

768
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Mark my words.

769
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
I'd be fine with that.

770
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
Me too.

771
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
All right.

772
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,420
Anyhow, uh, let's move on now.

773
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,500
Let's talk about a re-imagining of a franchise that I think looks great.

774
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,340
I'm really excited about this based on the trailer, uh, kind of a follow up to something

775
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,900
we had talked about, um, a few weeks ago on the show, because this had leaked through

776
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,940
a ratings board or something like that, but it was officially announced with a trailer

777
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:33,180
this week that Pac-Man championship edition two is happening.

778
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,180
So I'm playing a little bit of the trailer here in the background.

779
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,980
Uh, so you can hear some of the music, which the music is almost some of the best part

780
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,420
of any of these Pac-Man games, but I'm very excited about this.

781
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,500
Uh, it just, it just looks different.

782
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,660
Like now the board tilts in different directions, which looks weird.

783
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:55,700
And the ghost trails will kind of like pop up and it does this weird like tempest thing

784
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,860
where it zooms through the middle of the board, jump onto a new board.

785
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,860
I think so.

786
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,340
But that isn't completely out of character for Pac-Man because that was Pac-Mania.

787
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:07,900
I think the ghosts are jumping jumping over walls and stuff because that's kind of cool.

788
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,900
Yeah.

789
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
I don't know.

790
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,900
And see like the board like tilts and shifts and stuff.

791
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,660
And then there's that when he flies through the air and he eats the trail of ghosts.

792
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,740
So I'm really, I mean, obviously trailers are meant to show you all the best parts of

793
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,740
the game.

794
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,240
I'm really curious what this is going to look like actually in motion there.

795
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,620
So, uh, yeah, and boss battles are in this too.

796
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:31,320
So, uh, God, I, I want this to be out now, but, uh, apparently I'm going to have to wait

797
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,320
a little bit longer.

798
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:37,100
I think they say at the end of the trailer, it is going to be September of 2016.

799
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,060
It's going to be out on the Xbox one, the PlayStation four and steam of course.

800
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,120
And they are saying it is a digital only release.

801
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,920
And sorry, I do not see Wii U on the list or any handheld, but then again, I don't know.

802
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,960
I guess Pac-Man championship edition never did release on those consoles, but I guess

803
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,120
anything's possible with the NX, right?

804
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
Who knows?

805
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,680
You can't handle the power of Pac-Man.

806
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,720
It's so much to render.

807
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
Yeah.

808
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,520
I'm very, very, very excited about that.

809
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,880
So let's see, I'll talk about this one as well.

810
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,380
Dar Sakura was going to bring this to the table tonight, but as I mentioned earlier

811
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:17,140
in the show, she had to bow out at the last minute due to some pain related to the surgery

812
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
she had.

813
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:23,900
Um, anyhow, Overwatch, uh, got an update, uh, this week and actually this, uh, specifically

814
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,380
the console's got updated with this as well.

815
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,060
The PC got this, I think very early in the week, like Monday, and then the console's

816
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,180
got it a little later in the week, but that new character, Anna is now available in the

817
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:40,220
game and the console patch actually nerfs two of the characters, Torbjorn and Symmetra,

818
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,180
which they said they were going to do.

819
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,260
And, uh, it is not the same on PC.

820
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,740
I mean, obviously both platforms got Anna, but the nerves for Torbjorn and Symmetra and

821
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,460
their turret damage, uh, being reduced by 30%, that's only on consoles.

822
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,020
That is not on PC.

823
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:03,140
And this is apparently because it is harder to have the precision aiming on a controller

824
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,020
as opposed to keyboard and mouse.

825
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:10,700
And since the turrets are auto attack, people are winning every time with Torbjorn and Symmetra

826
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:15,780
because it's basically like a smart attack where you don't have to aim at all with those.

827
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,460
So it was too overpowering, so they've nerfed it by 30%.

828
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:25,460
Also in this patch for PC and console, buffs for Zenyatta, who probably one of the least

829
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,380
used support classes, I think people don't realize that Zenyatta can actually attack

830
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,380
pretty well.

831
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,780
So, you know, if you want to heal and do damage, he's a good choice.

832
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,660
But they've buffed him a little bit, which is great.

833
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,660
And then they also did D.Va.

834
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,140
They've changed a lot.

835
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,140
She was already pretty popular, but that's probably just because it's a character.

836
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,340
People really like her.

837
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:50,540
But now, um, the defense matrix move is an alternate fire and there's a recharge meter

838
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,060
for it and self-destruct is faster as well.

839
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:00,080
But they are saying Anna is causing crashes on Xbox One and Mei's ice walls are not breaking

840
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,400
when they normally should.

841
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,840
Blizzard did confirm this pretty quickly and that they're working on fixes.

842
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,640
For all I know, this has already been fixed, but since I don't play the game on Xbox One,

843
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,040
I'm not sure.

844
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,040
So, awesome.

845
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,280
Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com has been following over.

846
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,440
He plays a lot more Overwatch than I do.

847
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,740
He says, the Symmetra nerf was a surprise to everyone and everyone on the console forums

848
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,560
thinks it's totally ridiculous and not needed.

849
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,240
But the Torbjorn nerf they knew was coming and everyone was welcome.

850
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,520
But he says, Blizzard leaked it out like a fart so when people saw it in the patch notes

851
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,100
they were like, what?

852
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:41,840
And he says, going into the game mechanics a little bit, her turrets are so easy to kill

853
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,800
and if you run into a room with her turrets and don't run out, that's your problem.

854
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,520
So a little confusion there on why Symmetra got the nerf just like Torbjorn did, but having

855
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,160
played both those characters, even on PC, I love Torbjorn's turret.

856
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,320
I mean, okay, yeah, it's pretty cool that it automatically does damage, but if you can

857
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,000
place that thing in just the right place, you can really piss the opposing team off

858
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,800
and it's a lot of fun and it makes it super, a lot of fun as well.

859
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,080
So there you go, some Overwatch changes.

860
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,320
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some upcoming video

861
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,320
games.

862
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,320
We'll start in the US with Loki.

863
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:25,420
Alright, so this week we've got Phantom Brave on PC, Quadrilateral Cowboy also on PC, Fairy

864
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:34,380
Fencer F, Advent, Dark Force on Playstation 4, Headlander on PC and Playstation 4, Minecraft

865
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:41,260
Story Mode Episode 7, Access Denied coming out on PC, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Xbox

866
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:47,380
360, Xbox One, and mobile, and then Hyper Light Drifter coming out on Playstation 4 and

867
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,900
Xbox One.

868
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:54,580
We're getting the HD remasters of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1 and 2 this week on PC, Playstation

869
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:02,020
4 and Xbox One, Mutant Mud Super Challenge on PC, Playstation 4, and Playstation Vita,

870
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:13,580
and then, let's see, it looks like Blade Arcus from Shining EX on PC, and Tokidin 2 on Playstation

871
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,900
3, Playstation 4, and Vita.

872
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,160
Sounds like a busier week than we've had recently.

873
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,500
And apparently a little bit of a delay, but Stardew Valley on Mac and Linux.

874
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,300
Oh, I did not know they were even getting a port, that's great.

875
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,380
Maybe you want to work on getting the UK dates up while I read the Japanese ones here.

876
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:35,700
So while we go over to Japan, we're going to look at a new Idolmaster game is out in

877
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,860
Japan this week on the 28th.

878
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,820
How many of y'all are Idolmaster fans out there?

879
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,580
Well, Idolmaster Platinum Stars is coming out on the Playstation 4.

880
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,580
This is actually the first Idolmaster game on the Playstation 4.

881
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,820
They're saying in this game, new character models, new facial expressions, dynamic camera

882
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:58,240
work during concert scenes, and you can even get crowds of up to 50,000 people.

883
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,900
You pick one of 13 idols to produce and focus your training efforts on.

884
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,700
I don't know why Idolmaster never really showed up over here, or did it?

885
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,700
Did they ever try Idolmaster over here?

886
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,700
I don't think they did.

887
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,540
No, the closest thing you had to it was Hatsune Miku.

888
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:14,540
Yeah, I know Hatsune Miku, and that's kind of a very, I don't want to say cult game,

889
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:18,180
but it's kind of, you know, it's got its following, but it's not a triple-A title by

890
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,180
any means.

891
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,180
Well, who knows?

892
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,660
Maybe, I wish they just would try releasing it digitally or something, you know?

893
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,100
I don't know, anyway.

894
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,740
But Idolmaster is out in Japan on the Playstation 4 this week on July 28th.

895
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:35,940
You can also look forward to, in Japan this week, Tokaiden 2 comes out in regular and

896
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,180
Treasure Box editions.

897
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,420
That's from Koei Tecmo this week.

898
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,860
Look forward to that on the Playstation 4.

899
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:52,580
Also, a price reduction on Dragon Ball Xenoverse and Guilty Gear Revelator gets, I guess, some

900
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,140
type of re-release there with new subtitles this week.

901
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,900
Also, Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force this week.

902
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:07,780
Going to some of the other consoles, the Vita this week has Sekaiichi Nagai 5 Funkan comes

903
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:15,080
out this week, Mega Tagmension Blanc plus Neptune vs. Zombies, that's a mouthful.

904
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,860
That is out this week as well.

905
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:23,500
Tokaiden 2 is out on Vita as well, and Strawberry Knots in regular and limited edition.

906
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,660
I do not know what Strawberry Knots is, but it is not actually about strawberry.

907
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:35,060
I think this anime girl wearing a very short skirt who's about to show you her knots, her

908
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,580
name is probably Strawberry, or at least that's how that goes in my mind.

909
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:44,020
Let me lastly quick look at the 3DS to see if there's anything this week.

910
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,500
Oh, Puzzle and Dragons has two new releases this week.

911
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:52,800
There's Ryu no Shu and Kami no Shu both come out this week on the 3DS in Japan, so if you

912
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,980
are into Puzzle and Dragons, you have that to look forward to.

913
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,700
So how about the UK, Loki?

914
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,920
I'm not sure how accurate this list is, but I'm going to read it anyway.

915
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:07,040
So we have AW Phoenix Festa on, looks like Vita.

916
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,640
Help the game on PC, is that like, no, I don't know what that is, anyways, and then they

917
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,080
are saying that the Batman, the remasters are coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

918
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,440
which I believe those are deleted at the end of the year, but whatever.

919
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,680
So yeah, they're saying Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City on PlayStation 4 and Xbox

920
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,680
One.

921
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,280
I won't buy that though, so I'm not sure if that's accurate, however, I do have a second

922
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,560
list I was going to take a look at here real fast.

923
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:42,440
Furry Fencer F Advent Dark Force on PlayStation 4, they're saying We Have a Few coming out

924
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:48,520
as well digitally on Xbox One and PC, and Olli Olli Epic Combo Edition on PlayStation

925
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
4.

926
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:56,160
Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, AkumaJP says, Idle Master died with Xbox 360.

927
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,640
I didn't realize that, but then why are they bothering with PlayStation 4?

928
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,560
Maybe it was cheap to put together, who knows.

929
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,880
Orange Right says, I thought it was released as a very expensive iOS game.

930
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,880
Really?

931
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,880
I did not know.

932
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,880
If that's the case, I did not know that.

933
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,880
Huh.

934
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,880
I'll have to look that up.

935
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,600
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week,

936
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,920
which I'm going to take over tonight, since I had to think of something last minute here.

937
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,740
I'm going to let Dark Soccer, Dark Soccer had picked a pretty big one for this week,

938
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,960
so I think she'd rather talk about it in a future week.

939
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,080
So I picked another one that I bet a lot of you haven't heard of, but it's timely.

940
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,640
We'll get into that after a couple more news stories here.

941
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,640
Loki.

942
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,860
So Google has announced that they're going to be hosting a brand new independent games

943
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,240
festival in San Francisco.

944
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,200
It's going to take place at the Terra Gallery on September 24th.

945
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:51,640
It's going to be dubbed the Google Play Indie Games Festival, and they're taking submissions

946
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:59,520
right now for Android developers for different, you know, games that are both fun and innovative.

947
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,200
And yeah, so they're really only interested in games from development teams, or smaller

948
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,240
development teams, so like 15 or less, or fewer, I guess, employees.

949
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,280
And then, yeah, so that's kind of cool that they're going to be doing that.

950
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,640
I'm going to be curious to see what the turnout is on that, especially, you know, there's

951
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,440
a lot of Android games out there.

952
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,800
I mean, it'd be nice to see if some of these submissions are getting a little bit of a

953
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,120
highlight on the Google Play Store or something like that.

954
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,000
I mean, it'd be interesting to see what they've got planned here.

955
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,400
Yeah, and let's not forget, you know, Pokemon Go from Niantic.

956
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,720
Niantic used to be a part of Google, so one could say that Niantic was once one of these

957
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,320
little indie studios.

958
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,600
You know, I guess it's hard to call something indie that's an offshoot of Google, but still,

959
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,120
you know, Google's got their eye on that stuff.

960
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,120
Right.

961
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,120
Yeah.

962
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,000
Does this mean they're going to be getting more gaming stuff?

963
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,880
I mean, because I know for a while there they were talking about maybe like, maybe the rumors

964
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,360
were like they were going to be doing like a set-top box like Ouya or something, but

965
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,880
I don't know if that's going to ever happen anymore.

966
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,760
It could be partially because of the phones.

967
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,040
It could be like an Android thing, but I think what I think it really is, you know, Google

968
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,040
is kind of interested in society's next big thing, whatever that may be.

969
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,840
You know, and you can credit a lot of what's happening with Pokemon Go.

970
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,320
You can kind of trace that back to Google, but you know, when you look at some of these

971
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:25,120
indie games that have been downright phenomenons, and I'm talking things like Minecraft, indie

972
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,000
game, Five Nights at Freddy's, indie game, Stardew Valley, I think is kind of coming

973
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,660
up on one of these, indie game.

974
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:37,560
You know, I think Google would want to have a piece of that, even if they aren't normally

975
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,640
a gaming company.

976
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,180
I think they would love to, you know, if they can kind of find and nurture that next big

977
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:48,900
thing, which you know, again, some would argue they did with Pokemon Go, I think they

978
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,980
would, I would very much like to have a part of that, so this could be part of it.

979
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,060
Some would like to also think it's just good guy Google, you know?

980
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,060
Maybe.

981
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,060
Maybe.

982
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:05,420
Let's see, going to chat over at live.fognetwork.com, Stoppy says, I'm always interested in what

983
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,460
games get featured.

984
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,980
It seems these guys can never get enough coverage.

985
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,500
Pretty sad because some games are really great.

986
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,740
And JD reminding us that Ouya got bought by Razer.

987
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,500
So Ouya's long gone at this point, right?

988
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,460
Because they just merged it into the Razer thing, right?

989
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,460
What's the Razer thing?

990
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,140
Didn't Razer have their own set-top box at some point?

991
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,140
Oh god, everybody does.

992
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,140
They still have, what is it?

993
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,140
The Nvidia Shield.

994
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,340
The only reason I know that's even a thing is because when I was looking for my, you

995
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,060
know, Bluetooth controller.

996
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:39,020
Brad says, I bought the, Brad from Pod Culture in chat says, I bought the Razer Forge, aka

997
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,020
Ouya 2.

998
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,020
It was the Razer Forge.

999
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,500
How are you liking your Forge?

1000
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,740
Have you forged some new gaming experiences with it?

1001
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,180
Does it make you go, ooh yeah, or uhh, no.

1002
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:56,020
I can't imagine it's that much different from owning like a Steam box in some way, or not

1003
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,140
the Steam TV thing.

1004
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,140
I don't know.

1005
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,580
Except that's not Steam coming out.

1006
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:05,060
Brad from Pod Culture says, it isn't bad actually.

1007
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,060
Okay.

1008
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,060
Alright.

1009
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,060
Anyhow, let's see.

1010
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,180
I want to talk about Rock Band Rivals.

1011
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,180
Rock Band Rivals.

1012
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,240
Some details on this, they talked about it at E3, but now we know some more details on

1013
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,240
Rock Band Rivals.

1014
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,340
It's going to be a $30 expansion that will bring new features to Rock Band 4.

1015
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:27,140
A story-based career mode and a series first, they're saying, a synchronous multiplayer

1016
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:31,740
mode with both cooperative and competitive options.

1017
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,860
So this is the first time I think that Rock Band's getting competitive play.

1018
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:40,500
They are saying that regular online multiplayer will hit Rock Band 4 for a free update, but

1019
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,740
they're saying that Rock Band Rivals is supposed to be like a counterpart for online play.

1020
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,380
I guess it kind of expands on this.

1021
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,780
You can team up with other players to create crews, which are in-game groups, and then

1022
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:56,200
you compete in challenges each week, which will, you know, contribute to the group's

1023
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,780
success as a whole if you pass, you fail, or what have you.

1024
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,940
And so it's trying to get people back on to check with Rock Band 4 and play it pretty

1025
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,940
regularly.

1026
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:09,900
There's also what's called a Rock You Drama mode that's supposed to be like VH1's

1027
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:16,260
Behind the Music that takes live-action footage and Rock Band gameplay, and it will make a

1028
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,980
documentary about your rise to stardom.

1029
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:23,220
See, the only way I could see you, you know, crashing and burning in this, you know, at

1030
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:29,460
the end of that documentary thing is, you remember the Rock Band's intros, you know,

1031
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,140
where they're just playing, you know, music on top of cars in front of trains and like

1032
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,820
crazy stuff like that.

1033
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,820
That's how you die.

1034
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:42,740
You play your final show on top of a car, train, and you die.

1035
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:46,400
This is interesting because it sounds to me kind of like, you know, like Guitar Hero,

1036
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,300
the new Guitar Hero, kind of had the live-action footage with it, and it was actually pretty

1037
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,300
well received.

1038
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,220
So it's interesting that Rock Band, they aren't copying it, they're doing their own

1039
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,540
take on it, which is kind of interesting.

1040
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:02,200
I don't know, this is something I might want to check out, and I wasn't feeling so

1041
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:07,080
great about Rock Band 4, but now it sounds like this might be the Rock Band 4 that I

1042
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,080
wanted to play.

1043
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,360
I'm not sure how I feel about 30 extra dollars to play it, but at least it sounds like some

1044
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,680
of that is coming over into the regular game, so you can maybe like test it out before you

1045
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,680
buy.

1046
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,680
I don't know.

1047
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,800
You also do get 10 tracks for your time for what it's worth, including Semisonic's closing

1048
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,800
time.

1049
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,240
You get some pre-order bonuses too.

1050
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:33,720
One More Time from Maroon 5, 3 AM by Matchbox 20, and one of the other 10 tracks worth pointing

1051
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,920
out, Sia's Chandelier.

1052
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,040
And if you can do the dance that the girl does in the video while you play the song,

1053
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,280
I think you should be able to get bonus points.

1054
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,600
So that's some talented dancing going on there.

1055
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,860
Or if you can play like Sia does, with the hair completely covering your eyes so you

1056
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,840
can't actually see the notes on the screen.

1057
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,240
That might be pretty cool as well.

1058
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,800
Anyhow, 30 bucks for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, or you can get a bundle of everything

1059
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,960
together for $60 if you don't yet own Rock Band 4.

1060
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,560
So in other words, if you waited to buy Rock Band 4, then for the price of Rock Band 4,

1061
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,560
you're going to get both.

1062
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,600
Doesn't that make you feel good early adopters?

1063
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,760
I'm trying to be hopeful.

1064
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,760
All two of you.

1065
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,480
I'm very much trying to be hopeful.

1066
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,960
We'll see.

1067
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,920
Comments and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1068
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,360
Stoppie says, a $30 expansion?

1069
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,360
Ouch.

1070
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,880
JD says, I didn't realize they were still making Rock Band games.

1071
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,160
Yeah, Harmonics is kind of having a problem with that.

1072
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,160
Exactly that.

1073
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,160
Let's see.

1074
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,360
Brad from Pod Culture says, where is all my previous Rock Band content?

1075
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,680
God damn it.

1076
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,480
And I kind of agree with that.

1077
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,480
And let's see.

1078
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,000
Stoppie says, you can make your own band and play for beer like the good old days.

1079
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Hopefully that will be in the docudrama.

1080
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
We'll see.

1081
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
I don't know.

1082
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:56,640
Anyway, let's go back to a more classic time, shall we?

1083
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,280
Back when games, you know, if they were broken on the first release, then that's it.

1084
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,280
No patch.

1085
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,280
Nothing to do.

1086
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,040
I'm going way back this week with my pick because Dark Soccer, she will usually step

1087
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,360
into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be playing this this

1088
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,360
week.

1089
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,360
But she's not here.

1090
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,360
So I'm taking over.

1091
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,920
And the criteria is that the game does need to be 10 years old or more.

1092
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,680
And I think tonight's game, if I'm not mistaken, is over 30 years old, which I'm going to date

1093
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,920
myself a little bit.

1094
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,760
Yeah, this game was released in 1984, so it's over 30 years old.

1095
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,780
But maybe some of you will recognize it.

1096
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,400
This is a timely choice.

1097
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,600
Some of you may recognize it from this theme.

1098
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,600
That's right.

1099
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,880
The classic game of the week is Summer Games by Epyx on the Commodore 64.

1100
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,360
Of course I picked the Commodore 64.

1101
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,880
And by the way, this is one of the only parts of the game where music actually plays.

1102
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,000
Otherwise it's a lot of ambient noise in the background.

1103
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,640
So don't be surprised if the music in the background kind of cuts in and out.

1104
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,920
So anyway, yes, the pick this week is Summer Games, which was one of the Epyx games.

1105
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,880
That's E-P-Y-X games that was released on the Commodore 64 in 1984, but it was also

1106
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:17,760
ported to the Apple II, the Atari 2600, believe it or not, the 7800, the XL and XE.

1107
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,160
And it was on the Sega Master System, which I didn't realize that, and I never played

1108
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,440
that version.

1109
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:30,020
There was also an Amiga version, a Spectrum version, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST versions.

1110
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:36,000
And then it actually came out on the Commodore 64 Direct-to-TV that was released in 2004.

1111
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,520
I don't know if you guys remember that, but like how we're getting a mini NES this year.

1112
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,360
There was a Commodore 64, one of those in 2004, which I never bought, and I really should

1113
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,440
have as a single tear rolls down my face.

1114
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,240
Maybe I could find one on eBay.

1115
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,240
I don't know.

1116
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:56,280
Anyhow, interesting thing about this, this really was basically the Olympics on the Commodore

1117
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,280
64.

1118
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,920
Without getting the Olympics license.

1119
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,920
That's right.

1120
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,360
This game never uses the word Olympics, and you aren't playing in the Olympics, you were

1121
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,080
playing in the Epyx games, and you can represent one of several countries.

1122
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,720
I think there was like, I don't know, maybe like 18 or maybe 27 countries, but one of

1123
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,680
the countries, and I'm using my quotey fingers, was Epyx.

1124
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,200
You could actually play, you could represent the US, you could represent Canada, you could

1125
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,920
represent, you know, Mexico, you could represent all these different companies, or you could

1126
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,240
represent Epyx, which would play the Jumpman Jr. theme.

1127
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,000
If you represented, because like you're, when you won a medal in the game, it would actually

1128
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,340
play the theme for whatever, you know, country you were.

1129
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:40,000
And so as a kid, this was a way that I got to learn national anthems besides just the

1130
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
US.

1131
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Who knew?

1132
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,200
Did you ever play this as a kid, Logie?

1133
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,960
I don't think I ever did.

1134
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,640
But no, it's funny though, like, so that would totally make like some of the track and field

1135
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:55,040
events, you know, more unique if that bullet was chasing after you.

1136
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,200
Let's see, so there are eight events in the game, I'm sorry, seven events I think in the

1137
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,200
game.

1138
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:07,500
Pole vault, platform diving, sprinting, gymnastics, freestyle swimming, skeet shooting, and rowing.

1139
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:12,900
And I can tell you like three of those four events was just how fast can you wiggle the

1140
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,540
joystick back and forth.

1141
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,540
That's how you ran in the game was just, it was like track and field, you remember Konami's

1142
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,420
old arcade game track and field?

1143
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,240
Some of the events were a lot like that, and I would say summer games almost had more in

1144
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,920
common with track and field than some other stuff.

1145
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,620
You could save your world records to the disc, which you know, was kind of a big deal in

1146
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,040
the 1984.

1147
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,100
But what I also think was really cool about this, let's talk about the sequel because

1148
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,460
who knows if they'll ever make, or if we'll ever talk about this game again.

1149
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:45,500
But the sequel to the game was summer games two, and summer games two had some new events,

1150
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,300
and actually summer games two was the one I happened to play first.

1151
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:54,420
And that had, it also had rowing in it, it had equestrian, it had fencing and cycling,

1152
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,140
like it had some different events.

1153
01:03:56,140 --> 01:04:00,380
But what was really cool is that if you had summer games two, you could actually link

1154
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:05,780
to summer games one, and you could do all the events in one giant Olympics, and it would

1155
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:09,620
just tell you to put in the disc for summer games one when those events came up.

1156
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:13,300
So that's really cool, like that makes me think like, come on, you DDR fans remember

1157
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,940
append mode in DDR third mix, right, where you'd switch out the disc and put in second

1158
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,940
mix?

1159
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,940
It's like that.

1160
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,940
But in the 80s.

1161
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,280
So that's really cool, I think.

1162
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,780
And of course, there was a winter games as well that many of you are talking about in

1163
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,540
chat over at live.vog network.com.

1164
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:33,300
And yeah, that was another kind of sequel-ish, I don't know, I always played California games.

1165
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,180
I don't see the interesting thing about California games.

1166
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,280
Was that an epics game?

1167
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,280
It was an epics game.

1168
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,280
What is?

1169
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:43,040
So maybe, you know, this was a huge game, you know, the reason why I bring this up,

1170
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,680
it's not just the timeliness of the Olympics being around the corner and all that.

1171
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,760
But this was a very successful game for the Commodore 64.

1172
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,440
And I guess some historians actually refer to it as the most sustainably popular in the

1173
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,740
long life of the Commodore 64, which of course, was one of the most popular home computing

1174
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,480
devices in the 1980s.

1175
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,480
So yeah, I mean, summer games is really a legend on this system.

1176
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,120
And so yeah, I guess I'm not, I always thought California games had more in common with skate

1177
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,120
or die.

1178
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,040
I don't know why I'm thinking of that as an EA game.

1179
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:20,520
Not really mean, I mean, it had like, it had a half pipe, well, what did it have?

1180
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:27,000
It had like, it had BMX, I'm thinking of the Atari Lynx version, so, had BMX, Hacky Sack,

1181
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,920
Surfing, and...

1182
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,120
You're right, California games was a derivative of summer games and winter games, I never

1183
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,120
realized it.

1184
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:40,360
It was half pipe, roller skating, surfing, BMX, foot bag, and flying disc.

1185
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,200
Did you know there was a California games too?

1186
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,640
I never realized that.

1187
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,520
That was hang gliding, jet ski, snowboarding, body surfing, and skateboarding.

1188
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,520
That's pretty cool.

1189
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,080
Maybe that's why I associated it more with the skater die.

1190
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,800
Skater die really needs to come back.

1191
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,560
Well, and then they had, there was skier die, was the direct-

1192
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,560
Skater die.

1193
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,560
Yeah.

1194
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,560
Skater die too, though.

1195
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,560
Yeah, that's right.

1196
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,560
There was.

1197
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,760
But yeah, seriously, skater die needs to come.

1198
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,400
That's a game that like this year made, modern skater die.

1199
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,400
Absolutely.

1200
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:15,040
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says, I have VCR California

1201
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,240
games from Epyx.

1202
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,240
I never realized that they did one of those.

1203
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,560
How'd you do that?

1204
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:24,680
Well, you know, VCR games were like huge for like a year.

1205
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,200
Yeah, I know.

1206
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,960
I owned the Action Max at one time.

1207
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,480
So that was like, that was an awkward time.

1208
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:36,480
Let's see, this is, this is from my dad who said he was never a gamer yet had a Coleco

1209
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,280
vision with like 80 games, bought the Action Max and like a Nintendo and all these other

1210
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,080
obscure things.

1211
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,080
Interesting.

1212
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,800
And Bobby Blackwolf says it was a traditional board game, but some spaces would say play

1213
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,160
the next clip and the clip would show if you succeeded or failed.

1214
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,400
So it sounds super basic.

1215
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,400
Okay.

1216
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,400
Yeah.

1217
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,400
Interesting.

1218
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,240
Bobby Blackwolf also saying summer games two is my favorite game back in the day.

1219
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,240
Yeah.

1220
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:03,480
I like summer games too, because the events weren't just the wiggling of the joystick

1221
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,480
and all that.

1222
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,720
You had some other stuff, like, especially like fencing and stuff.

1223
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,560
And especially in winter games, like when you did the ice skating events and stuff,

1224
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,080
you really had to think about, okay, I want to do a jump here.

1225
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:17,000
I want to do a, you know, and actually had a little soundtrack that would play during

1226
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
the event.

1227
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,600
So those games were a lot of fun.

1228
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:23,360
So I wanted to acknowledge as we head into the Olympics this year, I thought this was

1229
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:27,000
a good week to acknowledge summer games, your classic game of the week on the Commodore

1230
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,040
64 and a variety of other systems.

1231
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,040
I'm sorry.

1232
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:37,160
It wasn't halo when Jamie isn't here, but she did put out a, um, a decree on Twitter

1233
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,840
that she had the right to veto it if it was ever halo.

1234
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:45,680
So she's thinking ahead to, to the inevitable week when, when Loki tries to, uh, your decrees

1235
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,480
have no power here, she, she might have an issue with that.

1236
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,480
Loki.

1237
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,480
She might have an issue with that.

1238
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,480
All right.

1239
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,320
Uh, when we take a break, we're going to come back with plenty more show.

1240
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,400
We've got some rapid fire news coming at you.

1241
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:02,440
We also have some more, um, news stories to get into and, um, Hey, we forgot to talk about

1242
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,440
our gaming weeks.

1243
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,440
I just realized we never got into your, we talked about your wife's gaming week.

1244
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,960
We didn't talk about ours, speaking of living in Bizarro world.

1245
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,640
So we'll get into our gaming weeks as well.

1246
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,840
We'll get into that a little late.

1247
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:18,520
Uh, we may have some guests joining us in studio, supposedly heading back from where

1248
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,520
they were at.

1249
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,640
So we'll see who knows what awaits us when we come back with more of orange lounge radio,

1250
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:32,760
right after this.

1251
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:38,200
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on July the 24th, 2016 with episode

1252
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:44,360
number 651 of our show already in progress, myself and Loki here in studio.

1253
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,560
And I already know what Loki's playing on his phone over there because I see his fingers

1254
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,080
going tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

1255
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:53,040
I haven't played it most of the, well, I have played it most of the week, but I didn't play

1256
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,040
it this weekend.

1257
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,800
And of course we're talking about tap Mike Katamari if you have no idea what, what we're

1258
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,800
talking about there.

1259
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:03,520
Uh, which, um, I've been playing a little bit of that, but not a ton.

1260
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,520
I like you.

1261
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,600
I kind of went a few days without playing it.

1262
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,080
I think because like, you know, between Pokemon go and ingress, it's boring after a while.

1263
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,000
It's like, it's, it's, I don't know.

1264
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,800
It's just something to do while I'm sitting here because, well, I'm sorry that this show

1265
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,800
is boring.

1266
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,800
It's not boring me.

1267
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,320
It's just like, it doesn't require me to pay attention to it at all.

1268
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,320
It is.

1269
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,320
It is.

1270
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,320
It's kind of a Zen thing to do.

1271
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,680
It's like, uh, you know, like when you are sitting in like a classroom or something,

1272
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:28,000
you're playing with like slinky Rubik's cube or something that kind of, you know, something

1273
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,760
keeps you, you're tactile or whatever.

1274
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,760
All right.

1275
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,600
Anyhow, uh, we're into some rapid fire news, uh, quickly here and then we'll get into our

1276
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,600
gaming weeks.

1277
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,120
So, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

1278
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,120
All right.

1279
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:42,480
So, um, as I mentioned, you know, during our release dates, Marvel ultimate Alliance is

1280
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:47,880
going to be coming out of the agency remastered, they announced it at San Diego comic con.

1281
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,440
And um, not only will he be able to purchase those separately, um, individually they're

1282
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:56,000
going to be sold for $39.99, but you can also get a bundle that saves you a little

1283
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,760
bit of money for $60 and get one and two.

1284
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:06,920
And it'll be Marvel ultimate Alliance's first time on PC as well.

1285
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,920
I will have to wait.

1286
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,920
I don't know.

1287
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,920
Those are supposed to be pretty good games.

1288
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,760
I haven't actually played them yet, so I may have to check those out when they're on sale.

1289
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,100
I might check it out, but I feel like if I can hold off till black Friday, they'll be

1290
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,800
even cheaper.

1291
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:29,360
So this is unfortunate, but apparently, um, uh, Shuhei Yoshida's Twitter has been hacked

1292
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,800
as you know, a lot of different people have been, especially celebrities that are on the

1293
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,200
internet have been hacked.

1294
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:42,600
Um, you know, he, uh, as unfortunately, I'm not sure if it's the same kind of the same

1295
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,520
method as how they were, um, getting into other celebrities out there using two factor

1296
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,440
authentication and cloning their phones.

1297
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:58,580
But in this case, a hacking group called our mine, um, had taken it over for a little bit

1298
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:05,320
and they're also the same ones claiming that they were hacking Pokemon Go servers.

1299
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:10,240
To be honest, I don't think Pokemon Go servers needed any help.

1300
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,760
No one would even know.

1301
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,760
Yeah.

1302
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,160
I think Pokemon Go kind of went down on its own.

1303
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,160
Yeah.

1304
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:21,960
So, uh, well, yeah, so they just basically, you know, they posted a few tweets and that

1305
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:22,960
was about it.

1306
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:28,360
You know, basically saying it's our mind and X-Box forever, ha ha funny.

1307
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,360
No one cares.

1308
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,360
All right.

1309
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,520
Uh, well, let's, uh, go to some other stories here, including, uh, and by the way, maybe

1310
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,600
you want to pull up what Jamie was going to talk about already.

1311
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,600
So this is interesting.

1312
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,360
So they're going to be making a Pokemon movie, but it might not be what you think, uh, and

1313
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,160
maybe Pokemon Go is to thank for this.

1314
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:52,640
I don't know, but deadline, which is usually a, a, a website or a blog that reports a little

1315
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,880
more on a movie news than they do on gaming news.

1316
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:01,600
Uh, apparently the studio legendary pictures who made the recent Warcraft movie, but they've

1317
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,760
done a lot of big, big movies.

1318
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,200
Like the Batman BN series is all them.

1319
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,600
And you know, uh, they, they do a lot of big stuff.

1320
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,800
Uh, Jurassic world was them too, right?

1321
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:14,020
I think it was maybe anyway, uh, legendary has gotten Nintendo and the Pokemon company

1322
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:18,140
to sign off on a live action Pokemon movie.

1323
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:23,460
Uh, apparently legendary is going to make a movie specifically about detective Pikachu,

1324
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:26,260
Danny DeVito for Pikachu's voice.

1325
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,260
I know, right?

1326
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,540
Somebody get Danny DeVito on this immediately.

1327
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:33,900
Like this is where now fans dreams can come true.

1328
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,020
And Danny DeVito can be the voice.

1329
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:40,120
I feel like Nintendo would never sign off on it, but we can dream.

1330
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:44,200
So yeah, uh, it's going to be a mystery tale in the Pokemon universe starring detective

1331
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,200
Pikachu production expected to begin in 2017.

1332
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:53,740
But I would not get too excited until we know a voice, a director, you could do with, it's

1333
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,740
always sunny in Philadelphia.

1334
01:12:54,740 --> 01:13:02,800
You can just be like there that, you know, the gang collects Pokemon or, uh, Alan alchemy

1335
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,120
and chat over at live.vogmentwork.com suggests a Pokemon movie directed by Lars Von Trier

1336
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,560
rated NC 17.

1337
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,560
That shot that.

1338
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,560
So what's his style called where it's like you just, you basically are shooting something

1339
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,620
on a fucking home cam quarter.

1340
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:24,080
You're doing your whole movie natural, like dog dogmo was a Kevin Smith film, but it's

1341
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:28,560
something he has like this certain method of shooting movies that's just basically like

1342
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,560
cheap.

1343
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,980
No, not found footage either.

1344
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:31,980
I don't know.

1345
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:32,980
It's yeah, I don't know.

1346
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:36,740
Speaking of found footage, do you see there's another trailer or new trailer for a Blair

1347
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:37,740
witch movie?

1348
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:43,060
Apparently the woods is in fact a Blair witch sequel and everybody's losing their fucking

1349
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:46,120
mind about it because this is a proper sequel.

1350
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:50,980
Unlike the big studio one they did a couple of years after the first movie, I guess they're

1351
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,540
kind of, I thought it was like a reboot or something.

1352
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:56,280
I didn't actually know this is a set in the same universe.

1353
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,100
It's the girl's brother from the first movie.

1354
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,100
Yeah.

1355
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,660
So I guess there is, are they doing all found footage like, or still, you know, it didn't

1356
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:05,660
seem like it.

1357
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:10,700
It was a trailer cause it didn't look like it kind of, it didn't look like found footage,

1358
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:15,940
but they shot it like a shaky movie kind of like, I think they're, so I think they wanted

1359
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,920
to get away from found footage cause a lot of movies do that now, the horror movies,

1360
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,800
but they still kind of wanted to keep that cause remember the big thing with the original

1361
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,660
was that like the camera shakes so much you're going to barf cause it's just like on the

1362
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:28,660
big screen in the theater.

1363
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,400
It was a big problem when it first came out.

1364
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:35,740
So I think they still want to kind of keep that style of like violent, you know, movie,

1365
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,740
but violent nausea.

1366
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,740
Yeah.

1367
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:42,160
Anyway, I don't know what that has to do with games, but maybe, maybe there'll be a video

1368
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,160
game tie in.

1369
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,640
They had a Blair Witch video game.

1370
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,640
Did they have a Blair Witch video game?

1371
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,640
I think it was a PC game.

1372
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,400
I think you're on PlayStation one.

1373
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,680
I feel like there was something maybe, maybe, I don't know, maybe not.

1374
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,000
I could have made that up anyway.

1375
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
This is kind of cute.

1376
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:04,120
A Twitter account for Xbox in the UK posted re-imagined Xbox games as Pokemon Go.

1377
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,120
That's right.

1378
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,200
You can check this out on their Twitter from Xbox UK that says we've caught the Pokemon

1379
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,520
Go fever and couldn't help but wonder what some of our games might look like.

1380
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:18,340
And there's some doctored screens of Forza Go, Crackdown Go, and Halo Go.

1381
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,320
And obviously it's just a little tongue in cheek thing, you know, making a joke about

1382
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,840
Pokemon Go like a lot of companies are doing.

1383
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,380
But what was funny about it is that they're all showing that they're running on Windows

1384
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:30,640
phones, which Pokemon Go, they don't have Windows phone support.

1385
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,640
That's why they have to.

1386
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,040
So they have to come up with their own thing.

1387
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:39,820
But then it also kind of made me think like I would totally play Forza Go, but they have

1388
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:44,440
to think of a way to keep it safe because obviously it can't be about racing and the

1389
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,000
things that you do in Forza.

1390
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,400
It's all the opposite stuff that like Ingress and Pokemon Go, it's like it only counts your

1391
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,820
distance if you're moving, you know, below, you know, 20 some miles an hour.

1392
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,560
It's like it only counts your distance if you're moving over that.

1393
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,680
Over the speed limit is what would count the speed limit.

1394
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,880
They have to do something safe.

1395
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,880
I don't know.

1396
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:07,440
Yyr in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Crackdown Go sounds awesome.

1397
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,320
Skills for kills agents, skills for kills.

1398
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,080
I think wasn't there supposed to be some game somebody was talking about in one of the Ingress

1399
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,040
Hangouts I think where like you actually use your phone to like kill people.

1400
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,040
Yes, actually.

1401
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,040
No, it is a thing.

1402
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,960
It's an Indiegogo project right now.

1403
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,720
I don't remember the fuck it's called.

1404
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,880
It's like laser tag.

1405
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:30,560
So you you get a case that goes on your phone and you use your phone like you hold your

1406
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,440
phone out in front of you to basically shoot the other players.

1407
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,440
Huh.

1408
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,440
So it is a thing.

1409
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,480
DarkTetsuya in chat suggests a future list list on Go game we want to see.

1410
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,760
We might have to schedule that for a future week.

1411
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,200
Also Tigerclaw wanted to link us to this before we get to your news.

1412
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:53,480
There was a Blair Witch trilogy of video games, in fact, on Windows based PCs.

1413
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:59,240
There was Blair Witch Volume 1, Rust and Par, Volume 2, The Legend of Coffin Rock, and Volume

1414
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,240
3.

1415
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,240
Oh, that's what it was called.

1416
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,240
It was called Father I.O.

1417
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,280
The Ellie Kedward tale.

1418
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:12,400
Yeah, Father I.O. is the laser tag game that's on Indiegogo and they're saying or it's the

1419
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,880
I'm sorry, Father I.O.

1420
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,160
It's what is it called here?

1421
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:19,120
It's I don't think it's actually called Father I.O.

1422
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:25,000
It's the god load you stupid page.

1423
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Internet difficulties.

1424
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,360
No, they're just like, it's garbage.

1425
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:37,080
Basically, no, no, we're just not going to do this fucking have to log in to see your

1426
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,080
stupid page.

1427
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,680
No, that's not going to happen.

1428
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:45,760
They have like, yeah, the interceptor is what they're calling the actual like gun thing.

1429
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:51,280
And it looks like it's basically they're calling it the first real life, massively multiplayer

1430
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,120
laser tag game.

1431
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,700
So let me see if I can spin this around here.

1432
01:17:55,700 --> 01:18:00,720
So this is basically what it looks like, which is great radio for you to be a visual right

1433
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,720
now.

1434
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:07,560
Go search the Googles for father that I.O. or OK, Indiegogo laser tag.

1435
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,560
Looks very Tron.

1436
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,560
Yeah.

1437
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,920
So you get that thing and then you basically slap it on your phone and it has, you know,

1438
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,480
they're saying it's Bluetooth.

1439
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:21,760
It's got some infrared receivers, emitters and a built in battery so that you can play

1440
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,760
a little bit longer.

1441
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,360
But yeah, that's the game is basically we're running around shooting each other.

1442
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,360
All right.

1443
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,400
I don't know how we got on that topic from Pokemon Go clones, but that's all right.

1444
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,920
Let's move on.

1445
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,400
What what what what would have dark soccer talk to us about tonight?

1446
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,780
Should we talk about grandiose three?

1447
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:43,980
It's now going to be available on the PlayStation store.

1448
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:48,160
And yeah, it's under the PlayStation two classics banner.

1449
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,100
You can check it out.

1450
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,500
Also, I think, yeah, it's going to be ten dollars.

1451
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,460
I will wait until a sale or something.

1452
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:01,300
Yeah, again, one of those games to wait for Black Friday.

1453
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,700
Yeah, exactly.

1454
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,700
Or the flash sale.

1455
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,700
Not necessarily.

1456
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:12,220
Animal Crossing New Leaf is getting some amiibo based updates later this year.

1457
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:16,940
So they're going to be adding content, of course, before the Amiibos only worked with

1458
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:21,780
that happy home designer, which, I'll be honest, is kind of a waste of a Pokemon game animal

1459
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,240
crossing game.

1460
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,060
But they're going to be adding compatibility later this year.

1461
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:30,940
And it's going to basically be supporting both the Amiibos and the Amiibo cards.

1462
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:34,180
And what exactly is it going to do?

1463
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:35,340
I don't know.

1464
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:39,300
Basically, they're saying that they have new animals as well.

1465
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:42,900
They're going to be showing off them, including some that look like Callie and Marie from

1466
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:49,540
Splatoon, as well as a squid themed house, or, you know, I don't know.

1467
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:51,300
That'd be kind of neat.

1468
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,900
And new figures, I guess, are going to be released as well.

1469
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:59,660
So it looks neat.

1470
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,660
I don't know.

1471
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:03,820
I didn't play this really on the 3DS, but I mean, it's kind of cool that they're adding

1472
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:08,740
this, especially for a game that came out back in 2012, I mean, it's kind of amazing

1473
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,820
to even see updates for that.

1474
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:16,380
But I guess if you can do that and sell some more Amiibos in the process, why not?

1475
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:20,300
I never really understood the point of happy home designer, but I think, you know, full

1476
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,220
fledged animal crossing game is pretty cool.

1477
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:25,060
Does this mean we're going to see some more updates for older games as well?

1478
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:28,820
I mean, other older games, that'd be kind of cool.

1479
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:33,780
I love that they're going back and like updating a really old title, even if it's, you know,

1480
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:36,420
Amiibo stuff, but still, I think that's pretty cool.

1481
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,420
Yeah.

1482
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:41,860
And like they're showing that, like I said, you know, they have the Amiibo stuff for like,

1483
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,940
they have Splatoon themed stuff in there.

1484
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:46,620
So that's kind of neat that you'll be able to use your Amiibos for something.

1485
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:52,140
I'm always about, you know, having more, you know, make those things have a purpose, you

1486
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,580
know, have some more support in these games and there should be more of them that support

1487
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,340
them if you're going to push this platform.

1488
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:02,700
YYR in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Nintendo has announced that the primary function

1489
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:06,460
of Animal Crossing New Leaf's Amiibo support is to incite a Loki rant.

1490
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,460
I know this is true.

1491
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,460
I read it on the internet.

1492
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:13,740
And they have also got, was it, they're showing off, let's see, what else do they have here?

1493
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,740
Oh, that's about it.

1494
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:15,740
Yeah.

1495
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:16,740
So neat.

1496
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,740
Okay.

1497
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,740
Yeah.

1498
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,180
I mean, I don't really care too much about Pokemon on 3DS.

1499
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:28,180
I mean, it's, I don't know Pokemon, Animal Crossing.

1500
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,180
It's cool.

1501
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,460
I mean, might as well support these older titles.

1502
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:36,100
I mean, I'm just surprised that we haven't heard of a new Animal Crossing game yet, but

1503
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:37,100
I guess that's for the NX.

1504
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:42,660
If the NX really is a console slash handheld hybrid, Animal Crossing seems like a perfect

1505
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,660
fit for that, but we'll see.

1506
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:46,660
Time will tell.

1507
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:47,660
Yeah.

1508
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,660
All right.

1509
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:51,460
Let's, let's go to, how was your gaming week?

1510
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:52,900
Cause we never did that at the beginning of the show.

1511
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:56,980
So I think now's a good opportunity for us to take a trip and talk about what we've been

1512
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,660
playing this week.

1513
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:02,220
I think I probably forgot cause I don't have a lot of new stuff in my gaming week, but

1514
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,540
maybe you, you had a different experience.

1515
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,540
Loki, I don't know.

1516
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:05,540
No, I did not.

1517
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,820
And I didn't get to play any console games this week because once again, my wife has

1518
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,420
been monopolizing the TV.

1519
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:13,540
Thankfully we've taken a break or as I used to say, she's taking a break from watching

1520
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:19,260
Grazing Anatomy so that we can watch, um, Stranger Things, but, and you know, eventually

1521
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:25,980
that's going to end and it's just going to be the Grazing Anatomy repeat of all 10 seasons

1522
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,980
again.

1523
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:27,980
God.

1524
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,100
I hate that show.

1525
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:35,900
Uh, so no, this week I've been playing Pokemon Go a little bit.

1526
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,180
Um, a lot of it's been mainly just to and from work.

1527
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:42,580
I've never really been playing, you know, the only time I actually went out and played

1528
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:47,580
was like, uh, you know, this weekend I took my son to the mall to play it.

1529
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:52,220
Um, we wanted to go downtown or somewhere outdoors, but it just didn't work out.

1530
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:57,700
Like you know, the weather that we have right now, it's like 90 like at 10 o'clock.

1531
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:02,380
It's just, it's not good unless you get out there like super early, which we just didn't

1532
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,940
cause I had to get my car as long.

1533
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:09,620
Um, so I played that, I played Ingress just enough to, um, you know, keep all my streaks

1534
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:10,620
going and everything.

1535
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:14,660
And I actually did do some fielding stuff because I was in the areas to do that and

1536
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:18,780
it's been a lot easier now that with the local drama and everything to be able to take over

1537
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:19,780
certain areas.

1538
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:24,260
Um, so been doing that and then of course, you know, tap my katamari, been playing that

1539
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:25,260
a little bit.

1540
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:28,740
Um, this game really has no point, so eventually I'll get bored with it.

1541
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:35,100
Um, but for now I just, you know, playing for really no reason cause there's no point

1542
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,100
to the game.

1543
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:39,940
Uh, I have to admit my gaming week has not been that exciting.

1544
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:44,460
I was still playing Final Fantasy 14, which got the deep dungeon patch this week, which

1545
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:49,220
was, it was okay, but I was just, I was hoping it would be a little more solo friendly and

1546
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:54,420
it definitely seems like the deep dungeon is, and, and you know, if you don't know or

1547
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:58,220
following Final Fantasy 14 news, it's basically like a randomly generated dungeon that you

1548
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:03,540
can run, um, over and over again as a, it's kind of like a different, like little side

1549
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:07,180
thing, like an exploration side thing that they've put in the game basically.

1550
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:11,620
Um, but it's not tuned very well for solo play.

1551
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:16,380
Uh, I mean if you want to do like super hard mode and I guess that's the point of it, you

1552
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,540
can do solo play, but then if you're playing with like four people, you can practically

1553
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:20,700
steamroll through it.

1554
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:24,300
So I don't know, I feel like I would have liked the balance to have been a little different

1555
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:28,300
or even maybe customizable with different rewards and that would have been very cool.

1556
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,300
But uh, yeah, I don't know.

1557
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:34,820
It just, I like it more than the last exploration thing they tried to do, which was the Diadem.

1558
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:38,060
Um, but uh, it's, I was kind of hoping for more.

1559
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:42,700
Um, I also checked out on the PlayStation 4 this week and I did a quick live stream earlier.

1560
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:47,420
Uh, I did a live stream for Gradius 2, which they released on the PlayStation 4 as part

1561
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:49,040
of the Arcade Archives.

1562
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:54,020
And one thing I learned during the live stream is that boy, am I fucking terrible at Gradius

1563
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:58,700
2, which is the song that, or which is the game that Burning Heat came from, uh, in the

1564
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,700
first stage.

1565
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,060
Remember that old, uh, DDR 2DX song?

1566
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,060
Yeah.

1567
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:06,860
So, uh, you could watch me play that game for a little while and be very, very, very

1568
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:10,340
terrible at it on the archives on my Twitch channel at Rob Rogers.

1569
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,540
So like all games you play.

1570
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,540
Oh, hi Shane.

1571
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,540
How are you?

1572
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:14,540
Hello.

1573
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:15,540
Fine.

1574
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:16,540
I'm tired.

1575
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:17,540
Thank you for randomly dropping in the show and blessing us with your presence.

1576
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:18,540
How are you?

1577
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,540
You're welcome.

1578
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:20,540
I'm so sleepy.

1579
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,540
Why are you late?

1580
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,060
You could have been here to fill in for Dark Sakura.

1581
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,100
Okay.

1582
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:27,460
So I've been moving all day, so I'm exhausted.

1583
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:33,460
And me and my friend, we went and saw Spirited Away in the theaters on 35.

1584
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,740
I thought your friend was going to stay and be on the show.

1585
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,180
No, he's got stuff he needs to do.

1586
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:39,300
He'd probably be more interesting than you, but.

1587
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,300
Wow.

1588
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:44,220
Well, I guess we're going to turn off this mic a whole bunch tonight just to annoy you.

1589
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:48,100
Oh, and I've got all these things I can rustle too, because I haven't finished my food.

1590
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:52,420
He knows that's my pet peeve when he rustles the fricking paper on the microphone.

1591
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:53,780
Okay.

1592
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:54,780
No, all kidding aside.

1593
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:55,780
So you went in some movies.

1594
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:56,780
Yeah.

1595
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:57,780
Yeah.

1596
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:58,780
We saw Spirited Away at a local theater.

1597
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,940
They had it on 35 millimeter film.

1598
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,860
I've never even seen that movie.

1599
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:06,460
So it was my first time seeing it and it was subbed, not dubbed.

1600
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,460
Oh, interesting.

1601
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,460
What'd you think?

1602
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,460
It was good.

1603
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:15,820
It, like, I don't know, the way they kind of wrapped everything up really quick at the

1604
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:20,060
end was annoying, but I also didn't want to sit there for another two hours just so they

1605
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:21,740
could wrap everything up.

1606
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,500
But it was still a good movie, despite it sounding like I'm complaining about it.

1607
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,500
I'd see it again.

1608
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,060
And that theater was cool.

1609
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,060
I really liked that theater.

1610
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,060
Oh, yeah.

1611
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,060
It's a gorgeous theater.

1612
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,060
Yeah.

1613
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:33,060
Akuma JP in chat asks, why?

1614
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,660
And I'm not sure if that's a question about Gradius 2 or if that's a question about Spirited

1615
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,700
Away, because this is kind of a random thing to just show on the big screen out of nowhere,

1616
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,700
but.

1617
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,700
Yeah.

1618
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:42,700
They're doing another one.

1619
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:43,700
They're doing Howl's Moving Castle on August 14th.

1620
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:44,700
Oh, that's a really good one.

1621
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,340
I'll be at Power Morphicon, so I'll be able to see it.

1622
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,340
I'll go without you.

1623
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:49,340
All right.

1624
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,340
Sounds like a plan.

1625
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,340
Yeah.

1626
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:52,940
And it says, OK, why now?

1627
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:53,940
Spirited Away.

1628
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:54,940
I don't know.

1629
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:56,420
I just they I don't know.

1630
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:00,420
Apparently, they showed it yesterday and the demand was so great that they decided to do

1631
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:01,420
it again today.

1632
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:04,780
And it was like packed that entire theater was full.

1633
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,740
This is also like one of the art house cinemas downtown.

1634
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:11,660
It's not one that usually plays a lot of mainstream movies.

1635
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:15,500
So I think once in a while they do special screenings to play all the Pokemon movies

1636
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,860
out of there.

1637
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:19,540
I'm using my quotey fingers, cult movies.

1638
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:20,820
They seem to do that once in a while.

1639
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:21,820
Yeah.

1640
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,060
They also like it's the theater that will play A Wonderful Life.

1641
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,380
It's a Wonderful Life at Christmas.

1642
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:26,380
Yeah.

1643
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,380
On their marquee.

1644
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:29,980
They had like they're going to have weird science there and Lethal Weapon.

1645
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:30,980
Awesome.

1646
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,220
So, yeah, they do that, I guess.

1647
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:35,860
But not Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1648
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,860
Thank goodness.

1649
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:37,860
Shut up.

1650
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,460
We've been trying to do that at that theater for years.

1651
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,540
I can see why it has a stage and everything.

1652
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:44,540
Well, so does the one we do it at now has all that, too.

1653
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:47,420
But the location for that one is great.

1654
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:48,420
Anyway.

1655
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,420
All right.

1656
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:50,420
So we were talking about How Was Your Gaming Week?

1657
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:52,020
So I was talking about Gradius 2.

1658
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:58,380
And then I wanted to mention real quick, I also this week may have spent a little money

1659
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,900
to reactivate World of Warcraft.

1660
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:06,300
And yeah, I've been playing with the guys from gamebuoy.org in their guild.

1661
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,580
I don't know.

1662
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,580
They had a big patch this week.

1663
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,460
I was curious.

1664
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,580
Fourteen has kind of slowed down a lot.

1665
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:17,080
I mean, yeah, they had the deep dungeon patch, but I don't know, I'm kind of just waiting

1666
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,940
on the expansion for Fourteen.

1667
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:23,540
So now seemed like a good time to check out WoW and see what's kind of changed and different.

1668
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:27,500
And you know, it's inevitable that as somebody who did play WoW for years and years and even

1669
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:32,020
had a podcast on it at one time, I have to at least check out the expansion.

1670
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:36,900
I think as a player that played so long, you are required to like even I'm required to.

1671
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:37,900
Yeah.

1672
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:40,740
And so as much as you might want to roll your eyes, you know, I am rolling my eyes because

1673
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:43,340
you pay like I wanted to see the changes.

1674
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,620
And so I just made a trial character.

1675
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:51,860
It's not a great way to see the changes, but I'm not paying Blizzard yet.

1676
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,020
Yet is the key word there.

1677
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:54,020
Just saying.

1678
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,020
Yeah.

1679
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:56,020
All right.

1680
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,260
Um, let's see.

1681
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,620
That's really it for my gaming week.

1682
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:01,380
Isn't that enough between all the standard stuff?

1683
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,020
I mean, I dipped into Diablo three.

1684
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:06,680
I didn't even realize season six ended at some point and they're starting season seven

1685
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,680
in a couple of weeks.

1686
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,620
I had to dip into Diablo three, but not a lot, a lot of L's.

1687
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:11,980
Shane, how about you?

1688
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:12,980
So she just joined us.

1689
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:13,980
How was your gaming week?

1690
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:14,980
What kind of video games you played this week?

1691
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:17,340
Um, I played Pokemon.

1692
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:18,540
That's that's how I play.

1693
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:25,140
Like for real, I can't not Pokemon go cause I'm like, as I talked about on the podcast

1694
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:32,460
that we have for Pokemon, um, which I forget the name of it right now, um, just things

1695
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,460
slipped my mind.

1696
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:34,460
The pokey.

1697
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,460
Stop podcast.

1698
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:36,460
There you go.

1699
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,460
Stop for all the Pokemon chat.

1700
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:42,500
Anyway, that three foot bug or whatever is just really, really terrible.

1701
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,580
But that's why you use pokey vision.

1702
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:49,900
But I don't want to have to use something extra just to be able to hunt them down because

1703
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,620
I like going saves you.

1704
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:55,060
It saves you time for having to hunt them down because you can go, okay, I need this

1705
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:56,060
one.

1706
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,060
Oh, it's right there.

1707
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,060
But that's not the fun of Pokemon.

1708
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,060
Go for me.

1709
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,940
The fun of Pokemon go is getting with friends and then just like looking at the radar and

1710
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:06,220
seeing what's near and then if something pops up, we start to hunt it.

1711
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:10,300
It's not like I'm, I do want to go to like the Dratini farm that's in Sacramento.

1712
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:16,440
But beyond that, I just like driving around and oh look, there's a freaking something

1713
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,440
or other.

1714
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,740
I don't even know why I'm missing at this point, but I like that aspect and that bug

1715
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,940
is ruining it for me.

1716
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:27,860
But I'm talking about Pokemon X, Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire.

1717
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:33,700
I just play that constantly shiny hunting and I redid or I'm still in the process of

1718
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:37,460
redoing my info chart thing.

1719
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:41,180
Just so you know, Pokevision says there's a Vulpix down the street.

1720
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,180
Don't even care.

1721
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:43,520
Four minutes left on it.

1722
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,660
That's cool for that Vulpix who's going to go get murdered by people.

1723
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:53,900
But I redid my little spreadsheet and I, you know, I was on our podcast, I was like, oh,

1724
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,900
I'm just like above 60 barely maybe.

1725
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:59,660
No, I'm pushing 70 now apparently after doing all my updates.

1726
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:03,300
So I am over 10% of the way done.

1727
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,140
So that makes me happy.

1728
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,140
And that's it.

1729
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,140
Cause I don't play any other games.

1730
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,140
All right.

1731
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,620
Well, Pokemon is a big investment.

1732
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,620
Yeah.

1733
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:13,620
Let's yeah.

1734
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:20,140
Between all the copies I'm getting for Sun and Moon at this point, I'm at eight copies

1735
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:26,300
of that game total when it comes out between the games I'm going to keep and the ones I'm

1736
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,500
gifting.

1737
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:34,180
So Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, remember he lives in Japan and says my Yo-kai

1738
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:39,340
Watch 3 is like collecting dust now ever since Pokemon Go released here.

1739
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,820
Interesting timing how that worked.

1740
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:47,980
I wonder if they did that on purpose because what didn't Yo-kai Watch 3 have like no competition

1741
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:48,980
right when it came out.

1742
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:49,980
Like no other games released.

1743
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:53,860
Yeah, we did the, we went over the releases the other week and yeah, nothing else was

1744
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:54,860
out that week.

1745
01:31:54,860 --> 01:32:00,340
So that is some clever timing because a lot of people are like that.

1746
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:02,220
Whether it was intentional or not.

1747
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,220
That's gotta be intentional.

1748
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:07,420
I gotta say though, I think the Yo-kai event that's coming to Final Fantasy 14 looks really

1749
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:08,420
cute.

1750
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,420
I really want that ghost mount.

1751
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:17,100
Yeah, it is a, it's a cute event that's coming, but still, that's crazy that that had to be

1752
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,100
planned.

1753
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,940
You know what, you can actually get that Vulpix right now because it's within distance from

1754
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:20,940
us.

1755
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:23,580
I should turn on Pokemon Go.

1756
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:24,580
I haven't done it all today.

1757
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,420
Well, now that's a different story, right Shane?

1758
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:28,700
Yeah, cause I don't have to get up.

1759
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:29,700
Just sit right here.

1760
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:34,340
I think I should bring up my phone as well and make Loki do another story here at Orange

1761
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,340
Lounge Radio.

1762
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:38,060
I would assume by now you caught the Vulpix anyway.

1763
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:40,220
No, I don't know.

1764
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:44,200
I know I did in the beta, but like, you know, a lot of these Pokemon that were in the beta

1765
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,380
that were just all over the place, you know, like, oh, hey, cool.

1766
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:50,220
It's doing the fucking curveball glitch again.

1767
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:51,220
That's awesome.

1768
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:52,220
Curveball glitch?

1769
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:54,500
I fucking like just throwing my balls in nowhere.

1770
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:59,260
Out of context, that's an amazing, even Shane's laughing.

1771
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:02,100
Okay, seriously, fuck this bullshit.

1772
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:07,900
Well, we'll just put you on hold for a while.

1773
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,420
Anyways, seriously, fix your shit.

1774
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:17,220
This is kind of tragic, you know, because it was a promo for like a video game that

1775
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:18,620
is kind of okay.

1776
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:24,100
I mean, I don't know, but they were doing a promo shoot for that brand new Ubisoft extreme

1777
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:31,260
sports game called Steep, and there was a pro skier, Matilda Rapinport, who got caught

1778
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:35,060
in an avalanche during the shoot and died.

1779
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:36,620
So absolutely tragic.

1780
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:41,140
That's got to be a terrible way to go, but of course, you know, they're deeply saddened

1781
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:47,940
to learn that she's died, and, you know, she's a remarkable free-skiing athlete.

1782
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:50,620
And yeah, that was pretty terrible.

1783
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:53,860
That's, yeah, that's tragic that that happened.

1784
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:58,700
I mean, I guess it's not totally about video games, but it just also goes to show that

1785
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:04,100
these commercials and stuff, you know, sometimes they do some really extreme stuff to show

1786
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,100
on the television.

1787
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:09,100
I wonder if they'll memorialize certain games somehow.

1788
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,380
I think they would have to.

1789
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:11,380
I really hope they do.

1790
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,380
I really hope they do.

1791
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:16,460
Well, to try and lighten the mood a little bit, let's talk about LEGO Dimensions and

1792
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:19,060
some new expansion packs that are coming out for LEGO Dimensions.

1793
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,540
Now, we already knew about this because of E3.

1794
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:26,500
They've already talked about these new packs, but we got some of the details about when

1795
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,940
and what we're getting.

1796
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:33,460
So, first off, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which will be, I guess, six

1797
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:37,380
new levels and new bricks for the LEGO Gateway.

1798
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,180
It's, yeah, that's pretty cool.

1799
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:42,460
I guess there's two packs that actually come with this.

1800
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:46,300
There's a story pack and a second pack that's like a fun pack.

1801
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,780
So they're doing a lot for this, but they're expecting this movie to be...

1802
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:52,340
So is the story pack not fun because they had to make a fun pack also?

1803
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:56,820
No, I think the fun pack is just a different figure and I don't think it actually has the

1804
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:59,980
levels in it, so there are probably different prices is what it is.

1805
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:04,020
The Sonic the Hedgehog pack will have a new level with locations from Sonic games, including

1806
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:07,020
Green Hill, Emerald Coast, Labyrinth, and more.

1807
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:11,060
They'll have a Sonic mini figure and a three-in-one Sonic speedster.

1808
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:15,720
Wait, real quick, speaking of Sonic, did we already cover the Sonic stuff from this week?

1809
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,420
We did, but I'm sure you have something to say.

1810
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,340
I just want to talk about the music from the trailer, how I kept that on loop like crazy

1811
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,260
because it was so good.

1812
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,780
And I also want to talk about for Loki right now that I caught that Vulpix.

1813
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:26,780
Yeah, I did too.

1814
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:27,780
That was like an hour ago.

1815
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:32,020
Yes, let me describe the series of events that happened with Vulpix.

1816
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:36,940
So first we had the stupid, you know, curveball glitch thing, which didn't fucking work.

1817
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,060
What is the curveball glitch?

1818
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:41,700
The curveball glitch is basically where when you're throwing, normally to do a curveball

1819
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:44,300
you have to make little circles and then you throw.

1820
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:48,060
A curveball glitch means it just fucking does it when it fucking feels like it.

1821
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:49,060
Oh, well that...

1822
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:51,940
And it will keep doing it just because it fucking feels like it.

1823
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:52,940
And then on top of that...

1824
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:54,020
I think it's Logi's phone.

1825
01:35:54,020 --> 01:36:01,460
And then on top of that, so I, you know, I closed the app down, put it back up, and then,

1826
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:08,140
or no, I'm sorry, I, you know, put it to sleep, brought it back up again, that was fixed.

1827
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:12,300
I threw the thing and then it started doing it again.

1828
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:15,980
Close it, put it back up again, or, you know, put it to sleep, put it back.

1829
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:19,900
GPS lost, the whole thing fucking froze.

1830
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:24,420
Closed the whole app down, brought it back, Vulpix spawned again, and immediately disappeared.

1831
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:27,660
So fuck this fucking game.

1832
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,580
Can I, can I go back to talking about Legos, please?

1833
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:33,620
Because the next one is Gremlins, and I kind of think Shane wants to know the details about

1834
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,620
the Gremlins pack.

1835
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:35,620
Yes, please, because I do love Gremlins.

1836
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:41,420
Okay, so the Gremlins team pack will have rivals Gizmo and Stripe Lego minifigures.

1837
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:47,660
You can rebuild the 3-in-1 RC Racer vehicle into the Gadget, Omatic, and Scarlet Scorpion,

1838
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:52,100
and the 3-in-1 Flash and Finish into Rampage, Record Player, and Stripe's Throne.

1839
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:57,300
I wish they were doing Gremlins 2 instead, because I think that would lend itself better

1840
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:02,380
to Lego Dimensions because it's so goofy, whereas Gremlins 1, while kind of goofy, was

1841
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:04,060
also pretty dark.

1842
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:07,840
ET, the Extra Terrestrial, is out also.

1843
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,260
It will have an ET Lego minifigure, and you can build the Phone Home device and rebuild

1844
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:16,320
it into Mobile Uplink and Supercharged Satellite.

1845
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,520
And then lastly, Adventure Time.

1846
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:23,760
The Adventure Time fun pack will have Marceline the Vampire Queen as a Lego minifigure, and

1847
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,980
then you can build the Lunatic Amp to make some noise and rebuild it into the Shadow

1848
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:32,120
Scorpion and Heavy Metal Monster for extra in-game powers.

1849
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,120
So there you go.

1850
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:37,080
That is some details on the upcoming Lego packs.

1851
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,480
Cool.

1852
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,680
They're all coming out in November, by the way.

1853
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:46,320
Let's move on with, I guess I'll do this one, unless you have it up, Loki.

1854
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,320
Jamie's next story.

1855
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,680
I have them all up.

1856
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,040
Okay, you want to talk about this then?

1857
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,400
Yeah, we can talk about it.

1858
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,760
So this is kind of different.

1859
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,400
I'm not sure how wide of an audience this is going to be for, but Square Enix is developing

1860
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:06,720
a game specifically for the Apple Watch, and it's a game called Chaos Rings.

1861
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:13,480
Or it's from a series, Chaos Rings, but now it's a spinoff called Cosmos Rings, which

1862
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,160
you can only play on an Apple Watch.

1863
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,640
And they don't really have any other details other than it's going to release later this

1864
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:21,640
summer.

1865
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:26,400
I'm very curious to know how with that tiny screen, but I'm sure that's what a lot of

1866
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,400
people are thinking right now, is how's that going to work with such a tiny screen, but

1867
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,400
we'll see.

1868
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,960
You have some screenshots.

1869
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,680
It doesn't really look like much.

1870
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:43,680
Is it something that maybe teams up with your phone or with a Mac or something that would

1871
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:44,680
maybe elaborate?

1872
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:45,680
I don't know.

1873
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,680
Maybe.

1874
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,680
I don't know.

1875
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,680
It just doesn't look like much.

1876
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,680
I would not be interested to play this.

1877
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:50,680
It almost looks like...

1878
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:57,480
It reminds me of a higher definition version of those PocketStation games.

1879
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:03,800
They're very limited, lower resolution, they kind of played in conjunction with other things,

1880
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:07,320
but it just doesn't look that great at all.

1881
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,480
I don't really know what the point of it is.

1882
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:11,200
All right.

1883
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,240
So you also have some Pokemon Go news for us.

1884
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,560
Boy, we can't stop talking about this game.

1885
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,480
Make this quick, because some people in chat are like, oh God, they're talking about Go

1886
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,480
again.

1887
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,480
It's the biggest thing in gaming right now.

1888
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:22,460
Yeah, so Pokemon Go, it's launched in Japan.

1889
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,720
That's a pretty big deal.

1890
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,640
So they did that.

1891
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:28,120
And also France, actually.

1892
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,520
So it launched in France as well.

1893
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:36,040
And then, this is a little bit more regional, but Zipcar, which is I guess like an Uber

1894
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:41,080
or something like that, they're doing free chauffeured rides for Pokemon Go players in

1895
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,080
Boston.

1896
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:47,960
So you can, you know, normally you would rent those cars, I guess.

1897
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:53,640
So Zalenny reserved the cars to go play around the city.

1898
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:58,120
Neat, I guess.

1899
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,120
I guess, yeah.

1900
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,000
How did you make money off that, though?

1901
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,400
Maybe it's a brand awareness thing.

1902
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:10,880
Yeah, they're also supplying snacks, water, and phone chargers for those playing Pokemon

1903
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,880
Go.

1904
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,800
All right.

1905
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,440
Let's talk about something that might be too little, too late.

1906
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,440
I don't know.

1907
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,280
But Nintendo this week released a demo to Star Fox Zero.

1908
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:23,280
That's right.

1909
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,440
If you want to check out Star Fox Zero, you can actually check out a free downloadable

1910
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,440
demo.

1911
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:31,440
There's pretty much the game's tutorial mode, and there's also the Battle Begins animated

1912
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,240
short tacked on there.

1913
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:36,640
So it should give you a good feel if you're going to actually enjoy the game or not, which

1914
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,720
a lot of critics didn't.

1915
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:41,600
But a lot of people seem to like it well enough.

1916
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,960
I don't think I was hearing a lot of bad feedback, but I don't think the game sold very well

1917
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,960
either.

1918
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,280
So I'm really surprised that Nintendo didn't try to push this demo a lot sooner.

1919
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,660
I mean, I understand if maybe they didn't want it out there week one, but I'm really

1920
01:40:55,660 --> 01:41:00,340
surprised they didn't get it out there within the first month because Star Fox Zero came

1921
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,300
out what, like three months ago?

1922
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:03,300
I don't know.

1923
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:07,980
Anyway, Nintendo may be changing things up because a free version of Metroid Prime Blast

1924
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:14,220
Ball also came out, and this is before Federation Force, which is supposed to include this as

1925
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:15,220
a part of it.

1926
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:20,140
So interesting that they are putting that out a little early to try to raise awareness

1927
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:23,820
for Federation Force, which I didn't realize is only a month away.

1928
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,220
Holy moly.

1929
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:31,300
Maybe I'll check out the Star Fox Zero demo just to see if, kind of what I think.

1930
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:35,020
How many times do they get to play the demo because of this bullshit that they have these

1931
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:38,460
stupid play limited demos?

1932
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:41,180
I don't know if it has a play limit or if it does, they're not talking about it.

1933
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,620
It probably does.

1934
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:43,900
Like all their demos do.

1935
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:47,540
Yeah, but have you ever hit or even gotten close to the limit?

1936
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:48,540
Even Bravely Default?

1937
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:49,720
But why even have a limit?

1938
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,720
It's a fucking demo.

1939
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,260
I don't understand that.

1940
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:55,940
Oh well, if they could play the demo a bunch of times, then you're just not gonna buy the

1941
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:56,940
game.

1942
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:01,780
If your game is that fucking lame that a demo can suffice for you, the gameplay in it, then

1943
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:04,980
your game is not good enough.

1944
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,980
I don't know.

1945
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:10,420
I don't know the logic behind it either, but I'm assuming it's so that it can't exist years

1946
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,220
and years and years from now or something.

1947
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:13,220
I don't know.

1948
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:14,220
That's dumb.

1949
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:21,060
Or it's like everybody learned their lesson after Konami with P.T., like that overshadowed

1950
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:23,820
anything that they're ever gonna do for the rest of their history.

1951
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:25,260
Good point.

1952
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:33,900
All right, let's go to our mailbag.

1953
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:39,340
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and usually Dark

1954
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:43,700
Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read her favorite emails for you.

1955
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:49,340
However, since she is out unexpectedly tonight, I will be taking on that role bravely in her

1956
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:50,340
behalf.

1957
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:55,260
Maybe you can still, of course, always send us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1958
01:42:55,260 --> 01:43:00,500
Let's get to our first email tonight from Andy R., who's emailing us about, guess what?

1959
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,500
Pokemon Go.

1960
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,500
That's right, Pokemon Go.

1961
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:06,220
Hey, some more Pokemon Go for you, because why not?

1962
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:09,340
It's almost like he knew what tonight's show is gonna turn into.

1963
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:12,180
First, I do wanna say that I agree with Loki.

1964
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:14,620
The game's mechanics really aren't that good.

1965
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:18,300
The gym fighting is especially boring and exacerbated by the server troubles that make

1966
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:21,460
it near impossible for me to even fight gyms.

1967
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:25,760
Somehow the game has its hooks in me, though, and I've been taking a lot of midnight walks

1968
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:30,020
to catch Pokemon when I would otherwise be avoiding this Phoenix heat.

1969
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:34,120
Side note, my FU of the week goes to Niantic for releasing this during the time of year

1970
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:37,100
when it's 110 degrees almost every day.

1971
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:38,100
You poor soul.

1972
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:42,900
Anyway, uh, second, and what I really wanna get to, but why is this game bringing out

1973
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,880
the assholes so much?

1974
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:49,000
Maybe it's just my Twitter or Facebook, but recently the number of Pogo posts is starting

1975
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,240
to be outweighed by the I'm not playing Pokemon Go because I'm not 10 years old posts.

1976
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:58,020
On a base level I can get it, the pushback against something that's popular or getting

1977
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:59,020
a lot of hype.

1978
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:04,400
I feel the same every Superb Owl season, or when people are going nuts for a new Call

1979
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,840
of Duty game, a series I've never been into.

1980
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,480
But I feel like what sets the Pogo hate apart is how much it seems to be targeting the players

1981
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,420
more than the game itself.

1982
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:17,660
The cultural zeitgeist that preceded the Star Wars movie last year was certainly accompanied

1983
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:22,660
by a ton of the the Star Wars movies really aren't that good counterculture, but I didn't

1984
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:25,940
see anyone calling Star Wars fans fat or lazy.

1985
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:30,740
Meanwhile, every other anti-Pogo post insinuates that players are basement-dwelling neonates

1986
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:35,780
with a severe lack of social skills or talking about how the poster doesn't need a stupid

1987
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:37,780
app to get them to exercise.

1988
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:42,060
Andy, when they say those things, they're only talking about team instinct.

1989
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:44,980
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm not...

1990
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:50,460
Don't take that seriously, I'm not getting into the team war hype, but sometimes it's

1991
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,740
a little fun to throw a little shade, a little shade.

1992
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:57,380
Andy R. concludes, what do you think of the reactions to this game, or is this just the

1993
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:58,860
internet being the internet?

1994
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:02,260
Thanks, Andy R. What do you think?

1995
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:06,980
Shane, what do you think of all the anti-Pogo stuff that's out there?

1996
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:08,540
I don't really see it, to be honest.

1997
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,580
Well, you don't even log into Facebook, really, right?

1998
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,580
Is that why?

1999
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:15,700
It's on Twitter, and what did I see today after I got out of the movie?

2000
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:24,060
Everybody going crazy over actual artwork of the leaders from Pokemon Go, and it's like

2001
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:30,700
everybody's still having a good time, and I see an occasional celebrity or faux celebrity

2002
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:35,420
have to say something like, oh, this is worthless, go do something better.

2003
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:41,020
But that's it, normal, genuine people on Twitter seem to be like, this is so much fun, and

2004
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:44,300
I love socializing with everybody and getting out and doing this.

2005
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:50,500
I think it is a large part the internet being the internet, and because on social media,

2006
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:56,860
a lot of people crave attention, because it's very easy to get on social media.

2007
01:45:56,860 --> 01:46:02,780
And sometimes the quickest way to get attention is to run counterculture against whatever

2008
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:05,060
is the big thing right now.

2009
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,660
And I think this happens with a lot of stuff.

2010
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:09,220
I don't think it's necessarily limited to video games.

2011
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:14,420
Like you illustrated in your email, it's about movies.

2012
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:21,860
I think it's a huge part of why politics is so fucking gross this year, even compared

2013
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:25,140
to eight years ago, four years ago.

2014
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:30,260
I think just more of the whole me, me, me, listen to me, and if you disagree with me,

2015
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:37,220
block unfriend and all that type of stuff, I think a lot of that plays into it, in my

2016
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:38,220
opinion.

2017
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:39,220
I don't know.

2018
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:42,620
Loki, what do you think about the whole, why do people feel the need to shout from the

2019
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:44,860
rooftops that Pokemon Go is stupid?

2020
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:46,860
Because people want attention.

2021
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:47,860
Yeah.

2022
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:48,860
That's pretty much it.

2023
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:51,860
Is it getting them attention, though?

2024
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:55,020
Besides an eye roll, are they getting attention from these posts?

2025
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,020
Well, I think sometimes-

2026
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:57,020
I don't know.

2027
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:58,020
It depends who's saying it.

2028
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:02,380
Especially when these celebrities are like, I don't get this stuff, and then they'll be

2029
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:05,540
the ones that denounce it, and then they'll try it, and they'll be the ones that are like,

2030
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:06,540
oh, this is so awesome.

2031
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,780
Why aren't you doing this?

2032
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:13,100
And they'll completely, it's like, well, hey, but didn't a couple weeks ago you say that?

2033
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:15,420
And it's just like, no, they're not going to acknowledge that.

2034
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:17,640
So quick little story about that.

2035
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:23,380
There is a former Power Ranger actor on Instagram decided to post something trying to rally

2036
01:47:23,380 --> 01:47:26,180
support about how stupid this all was.

2037
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:29,380
He got no support and took that post down.

2038
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,380
I thought that was hilarious.

2039
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:34,140
It's like, nope, nobody's going to bite for your attention right there.

2040
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,140
Interesting.

2041
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:36,140
Yes.

2042
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:38,900
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2043
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:42,780
Vid Power says, we need some Team Harmony up in here.

2044
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:47,780
Every time somebody says Team Harmony, this is my brain, I immediately think of the Harmony

2045
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:49,860
Hut from Addams Family Values.

2046
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:50,860
Do you remember this?

2047
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:51,860
No.

2048
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:52,860
What is that?

2049
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:53,860
Oh, come on.

2050
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:54,860
Somebody.

2051
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:57,580
They had to go to the Harmony Hut.

2052
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:01,820
It was kind of like the punishment where they had to watch Disney movies and it would force

2053
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:02,820
them to turn happy.

2054
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:04,200
I saw that movie so long ago.

2055
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,200
Somebody out there.

2056
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:06,200
I've never seen that movie.

2057
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,200
Somebody has to fucking know what I'm talking about.

2058
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,940
Cause it's exactly what I think of when you talk about Team Harmony.

2059
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:09,940
Oh, thank you.

2060
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:11,780
Akuma JB says, yes.

2061
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:12,780
Okay.

2062
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:18,160
JD says in chat, a lot of the hate comes from Facebook, the same kind of people who post

2063
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:20,820
minions images.

2064
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:21,940
It's honest to God.

2065
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:25,540
It's really time for Facebook to die.

2066
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:29,480
And on a side note, some people have been asking me lately, like, where's the Fugu question

2067
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:30,780
of the week?

2068
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:34,740
And here I'm torn because did you not do in this week?

2069
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:35,740
I forgot.

2070
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:36,740
I forgot.

2071
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:39,060
And I've been forgetting a lot recently, honestly.

2072
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:40,420
And you know, that's my bad.

2073
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:45,800
I find that I've been logging into Facebook less and less and once in a while I'll go

2074
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:51,020
post something, but I'm almost like, then there's things like, I'll try to reply to

2075
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:52,020
someone's post.

2076
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:55,820
Like I replied to someone's post the other day with something like very well intentioned.

2077
01:48:55,820 --> 01:49:02,780
And I got this, like, I kid you not six paragraph reply on how what I said was not taken the

2078
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:04,540
way that I meant to say it.

2079
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:07,420
And that I was like, you know what, fuck Facebook.

2080
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:08,420
Fuck you.

2081
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:09,420
Fuck Facebook.

2082
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:10,420
Fuck all this.

2083
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,420
Fuck your high horses.

2084
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:12,420
I'm out.

2085
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,420
It's not Facebook.

2086
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:15,660
It's just dumb people and dumb people are everywhere.

2087
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:16,660
But no way.

2088
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,280
Here's the problem I have with Facebook.

2089
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,100
People are not inherently dumb.

2090
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,500
I really don't believe I'm not that cynical.

2091
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:28,280
That's not me, but Facebook really gives everybody a platform to fucking be dumb.

2092
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:29,280
That's what it is.

2093
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,700
It extracts the dumbness out of people.

2094
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:31,740
That's what Facebook does.

2095
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:35,460
So there's a part of me, honest to God, even though I love that you guys participated in

2096
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:39,460
it, it's probably with one of our, one of our most like interactive segments.

2097
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:43,900
There's a part of me that just wants to not contribute to Facebook culture.

2098
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:45,820
Is that so wrong?

2099
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:48,900
That's my honest to God answer for where did the Facebook question of the week go?

2100
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:51,260
I don't want to help Facebook anymore.

2101
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,260
It sucks.

2102
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:57,580
That's why I just took my email, post the question at the end of the show, send in your

2103
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:58,580
emails.

2104
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:01,340
That's what we do on, on ranger pride.

2105
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:02,340
Kind of.

2106
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:08,060
We do put it on Facebook sometimes when either of us remembers, but Facebook to me lends

2107
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:14,160
itself to giving people a really long winded platform to explain all of their thoughts

2108
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,820
and stupid rationale.

2109
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:19,160
Sometimes like Twitter, you got this much room to try to type it in.

2110
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,920
So you only have this much room to be stupid.

2111
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,900
And so it just works out better in my opinion.

2112
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:27,800
Now, what I was going to say about Facebook though, is their fucking notifications are

2113
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,980
still fucking pissing me off.

2114
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:31,380
And I do everything in my power.

2115
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:34,480
Like I've made sure that I dialed those notifications back.

2116
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:40,820
Why am I getting fucking notified when a friend is commenting on his own picture or made it

2117
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:43,860
a, you know, posted that picture and made a comment on it.

2118
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:45,540
I didn't fucking like that picture.

2119
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:47,400
I didn't even see that picture.

2120
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:51,380
I should not be getting fucking notifications on that shit.

2121
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:57,120
And I thought I turned that off and I know I've turned that off several times or in why

2122
01:50:57,120 --> 01:51:01,040
like even comment on anybody's posts anymore because as soon as you do get fucking chain

2123
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:05,100
of all the different people that have commented on it because Facebook needs to let you know,

2124
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:09,400
you need to know, uh, JD and chat says, I missed the live journal days.

2125
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,400
I do too.

2126
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,400
And you know what?

2127
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,500
The one big difference between live journal and Facebook was, was that I could disable

2128
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,980
the fucking comments anytime I wanted to on, on live journal.

2129
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:18,980
And I can't do that on Facebook.

2130
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:22,260
And I swear to God, it's the one thing that really, really, really holds Facebook back

2131
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,260
sometimes.

2132
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:24,260
I don't know.

2133
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:25,940
I'm just, I'm just kind of over it.

2134
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:31,440
So I didn't mean for that to be a tangent and ER, but I guess, I guess the answer to

2135
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,320
this question hit a fucking nerve somewhere along the line.

2136
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:37,940
And I, I, I, I guess that's the, my answer to your question.

2137
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:41,860
Why do people feel the need to shout from the rooftops that they're anti something because

2138
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:44,160
social media fucking sucks sometimes.

2139
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:46,180
That's that's, that's my answer.

2140
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:48,180
So why, why should I continue to support it?

2141
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,180
I don't know.

2142
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:50,180
Anyway.

2143
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:51,180
Uh, let's see.

2144
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:55,120
I'm looking at some other comments, uh, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2145
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:59,360
Fifth dream says, Twitter is worse for that now I turned off show tweets I might like,

2146
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,600
Oh, I think he's talking about more of the reordering thing.

2147
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:02,600
The thing I do kind of like,

2148
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:05,520
Yeah, no Twitter with it's all here's stuff he missed.

2149
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,520
I'm like, I don't care.

2150
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:07,520
I can scroll down.

2151
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,520
Here's people who should follow.

2152
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:09,520
Nope.

2153
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,520
I would have followed them by now.

2154
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,920
Here's a like top tweets.

2155
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,700
No, I don't care about that at all.

2156
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:14,700
That stuff is annoying.

2157
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:19,240
I just really like on Twitter that it forces people to keep it brief and it is very easy

2158
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:22,060
for me to filter out stuff I don't want to see.

2159
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:25,700
I also don't like it how the Twitter app starts me off where I was last time.

2160
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:29,460
So I have to scroll up through three days or two days, however long it's been since

2161
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:32,180
I logged in to see the top tweets again.

2162
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:36,600
Um, but of course, Twitter, I mean not, I'm not praising Twitter cause Twitter has its

2163
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:41,940
own issues and we Lord knows we saw a ton of those this past week, but whatever.

2164
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:48,460
Anyway, um, where else am I, uh, looking at more comments now the chat room is lighting

2165
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,340
up over at live.vognetwork.com.

2166
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:55,780
Uh, let's see, Dar Tetsuya says, okay, stuff I missed is nice just so I don't have to spend

2167
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:59,020
all day on Twitter, but yeah, tweets you might like is dumb usually.

2168
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:00,020
I don't like that either.

2169
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:01,020
Um, okay.

2170
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:02,020
Anyway, sorry.

2171
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:06,660
Sorry for the tangent Andy R, but I hope you, I hope you're satisfied with the answer to

2172
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:09,020
the question.

2173
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:14,980
One more email tonight at participate at orangesontrader.com from Y Y R who says, hello L R I'm following

2174
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:17,780
up my email from last week with an update.

2175
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:21,620
Following customer feedback, Dave and busters has decided to change course on their pricing

2176
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:27,500
for premium play on DDRA and now cost one credit as opposed to two and by now the setting

2177
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,580
should have been adjusted at all locations.

2178
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:33,140
So as of now, normal and premium play both cost one credit.

2179
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:37,820
In other words, there's no reason not to choose premium as you get extra insurance against

2180
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:42,580
failing out before your third song, the ability to earn extra stages and more for no extra

2181
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:43,580
charge.

2182
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:46,700
Note that this feature does require an E amusement card.

2183
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:50,780
Well, that would be the extra charge, but that's okay.

2184
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,940
It's a little bit, it's much less than what it was before.

2185
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:56,260
Uh, if you don't use a card, the option will not be available.

2186
01:53:56,260 --> 01:54:00,940
Rob to answer your question, yes, all United States round one locations should also have

2187
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:03,860
the new North American version of DDRA as well.

2188
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:08,740
I will end my email by saying this, Rob, your game request from last week's episode has

2189
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:09,740
been heard.

2190
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:10,740
Oh joy.

2191
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:11,740
I don't even remember.

2192
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:12,740
What are you talking?

2193
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,540
I don't remember which game it was last week.

2194
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:15,540
I have a short term memory.

2195
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:16,740
Was it the grandma on the gun thing?

2196
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:17,740
I don't know.

2197
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:20,540
Look, YYR will deliver it and I will be happy.

2198
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:21,540
I know that.

2199
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:25,680
But um, I just, you know, one game at a time, YYR, you gotta, you gotta make sure multitasking

2200
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,860
gets out first.

2201
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:29,860
You know, I heard he submitted snake party today though.

2202
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:30,860
That's exciting.

2203
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:36,620
I'm going to hit up round one on my trip back up to here in August and I will go look at

2204
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:41,660
their DDR ace or whatever it's called machine and I'm not going to play it, but I just want

2205
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:43,500
to see if my songs are still on it.

2206
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:46,740
Like, do I still have songs I made on there?

2207
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:48,140
Can't you just go up to Roseville?

2208
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:50,140
I mean, yeah, it's a Dave and Busters.

2209
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:54,220
I have to go to Dave and Busters.

2210
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:56,980
What's some of the step art that you did in DDR games recently?

2211
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:02,860
I thought, yeah, because it still had Hottest Party stuff and I think that's kind of what's

2212
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:05,460
keeping my stuff alive is the Hottest Party stuff.

2213
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:10,140
What are some of the songs you did the step art for that people might not know?

2214
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:17,340
Beautiful Inside from Hottest Party and what else did I do?

2215
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:21,420
There were two songs in the next Hottest Party that I did.

2216
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:25,540
I don't remember the names, but I don't even know if they ever made it to the arcade, but

2217
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:29,220
I still have MP3s of them somewhere.

2218
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:31,020
Would your name still be in the credits of the game?

2219
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:32,420
I'm sure it's not anymore.

2220
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:35,220
I was going to say, if they used your step art from all those years ago, is your name?

2221
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:36,220
Sue.

2222
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:41,140
That's kind of awesome though.

2223
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:44,740
You hypothetically might be able to play one of Shane's step charts.

2224
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:50,780
When we went to Sunnydale Golf Land two years ago, because it was the same day as PT coming

2225
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:54,900
out for everybody, they had a DDR machine there, whatever DDR that was, which was the

2226
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:59,580
most recent at the time, it still had stuff I did on it because I made Jim and Annie play

2227
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:00,580
it.

2228
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:04,940
I was like, I just want to feed my ego, play these songs.

2229
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:06,100
That's awesome.

2230
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:12,500
Orange Right in chat says, can confirm Beautiful Inside Cube Hard Mix is in DDR-A still.

2231
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:13,500
There you go.

2232
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:16,500
So I'm still in it.

2233
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:21,620
And his ego, literally his head just swelled by a few inches here in the room while we

2234
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:22,620
read that.

2235
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:23,620
That was a fun song to make.

2236
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:24,620
Memories.

2237
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:26,740
Oh, is memories hidden in the game?

2238
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:30,300
That would be terrible because that's a garbage sound of a song.

2239
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:31,300
All right.

2240
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:32,300
That's it for emails.

2241
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,300
You guys should email us as well.

2242
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:38,420
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.

2243
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:40,700
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2244
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:44,380
Just because Dark Sakura isn't here doesn't mean we don't get angsty once in a while.

2245
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:47,420
So let's get to it.

2246
01:56:47,420 --> 01:57:02,660
Loki, why don't you start us off?

2247
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:11,300
I guess just FU2 and FU2 Pokemon Go for being so fucking glitchy.

2248
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,300
I don't know.

2249
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:14,620
That's mainly it.

2250
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:16,620
It's just...

2251
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:17,620
Come on.

2252
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:22,580
I understand that the game is, you know, it's early and stuff, but dude, this shit should

2253
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:24,260
not be this fucking buggy.

2254
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:29,260
I mean, come on, Niantic, seriously, fix this shit.

2255
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:36,420
Um, let's see, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I have a car payment again because

2256
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:42,140
I bought a new car yesterday and actually I'm really excited.

2257
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:43,180
It's a nice car.

2258
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:44,180
Yeah, I like it a lot.

2259
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:45,180
It's pretty too.

2260
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:49,100
So, um, yeah, I, um, I like my new car a lot.

2261
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:54,460
I guess I can say on it, is it bad if I say I have a 2016 Prius and, um, I, yeah, I wanted

2262
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:57,740
to go hybrid and I love, yeah, I like driving it.

2263
01:57:57,740 --> 01:57:58,740
It's fun.

2264
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:02,940
Um, so looking forward to driving it more, but I'm not looking forward to the car payment.

2265
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:07,180
So FU2, um, not just being able to pay it all off in one big payment, but that would

2266
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:09,180
be something if I could do that.

2267
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:11,020
Last but not least, Shane, do you have any FUs of the week?

2268
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:16,420
FU2 moving, I'm so exhausted, like so exhausted.

2269
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:17,420
Moving does suck.

2270
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:25,500
And FU2 having to go to work tomorrow because today was not a day off because of the moving.

2271
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,500
All right.

2272
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:31,860
Uh, you know, I was thinking, um, since, uh, that song that you did is still in DDR, beautiful

2273
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:38,400
inside, you know, to, to, to feed your ego even more, should we request that people take

2274
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:43,800
a picture of them playing DDR, playing your song in DDR and tweet it to you?

2275
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:48,120
Can someone in the chat room, cause I don't have access to the chat cause I don't know

2276
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:49,120
how to do it.

2277
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:52,760
Um, can someone linked an entire song list for ACE so I can look at it.

2278
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:54,280
I just want to see what else is on there.

2279
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:55,280
Just go to Wikipedia.

2280
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,160
No, cause when I went there last time, it just showed their new stuff and the things

2281
01:58:58,160 --> 01:58:59,160
they removed.

2282
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:00,560
But if you're not in chat, how are you going to see the list?

2283
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,720
Cause you can tell me and then you can text it to me.

2284
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,720
I'm not going to read 700 song names here on air.

2285
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,720
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2286
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,200
But just, you can, you can read me a link.

2287
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:08,920
You just got a Bomani style.

2288
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,720
I'm sure they've got a Bomani style.

2289
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,920
I just said Wikipedia.

2290
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:12,920
Okay.

2291
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:13,920
Orange, right?

2292
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,920
Remy Wiki.

2293
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:15,920
Remember that?

2294
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:16,920
No, I don't.

2295
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:17,920
I'll find it though.

2296
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:20,920
Go to Remy Wiki.com and there's a dance, dance revolution, a full song list article.

2297
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:22,640
Is that good enough?

2298
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:23,960
All right.

2299
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:24,960
We'll see.

2300
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:25,960
Probably.

2301
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:26,960
Yes.

2302
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:27,960
Thank you.

2303
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:28,960
Orange, right?

2304
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:29,960
I'm trying.

2305
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:30,960
I'm trying to help him out.

2306
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:31,960
All right.

2307
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:32,960
Thank you for the suggestion.

2308
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:33,960
I forgot about Remy Wiki.

2309
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:34,960
How do I search this?

2310
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:35,960
Look at the upper, right?

2311
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:36,960
Where Wikis usually have a search bar.

2312
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:38,720
Okay.

2313
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:39,720
Lord.

2314
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:40,720
All right.

2315
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:41,720
Let's move on.

2316
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:43,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2317
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,360
And then we're going to get to your phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

2318
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:48,880
on Skype.

2319
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,280
Actually though, Shane, pay attention because this may be of interest to you.

2320
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,960
Loki, what do you have?

2321
01:59:52,960 --> 02:00:00,040
So there's been like social economy, social media rep on Reddit who's been just responding

2322
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:04,080
to some questions and comments and that type of thing.

2323
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,440
I guess his name is Ben.

2324
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:10,480
And he's of course, you know, criticism I should add to that as well.

2325
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:21,640
Basically saying that, you know, they want, Konami wants to earn you back.

2326
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:25,160
Are they giving us like two for one plays on their pachinko machines or something?

2327
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:28,920
No, they're basically saying that, you know, they're not, you know, totally doing away

2328
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,980
with console games.

2329
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:35,120
Saying that they may have, or, well, I wouldn't say it's constantly, yeah, Metal Gear Solid

2330
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:40,400
is going to possibly have an announcement to come next year in celebration of the 30th

2331
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:41,400
anniversary.

2332
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:42,400
Yeah.

2333
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:51,040
And then basically, you know, saying if they find, you know, they're reviewing their IP

2334
02:00:51,040 --> 02:01:00,600
and they're trying to see if they have a good fit for Silent Hill because I just can't take

2335
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:01,600
this seriously.

2336
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:02,600
I'm sorry.

2337
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:03,600
I just like, sorry.

2338
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:04,600
Yeah.

2339
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:06,080
Well, I hope to have you back.

2340
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:07,480
Well, you know what?

2341
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:10,680
I hope to have a million dollars and that ain't going to fucking happen.

2342
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:13,480
Your hope is worth fucking nothing.

2343
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:15,300
You know who says that a lot, actually?

2344
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:17,160
I hope to have stuff.

2345
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:22,680
My son, he's all, man, he's all, I really wish I could have that ice cream right there,

2346
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:29,720
or I really wish I could have, you know, a new video game, or I really wish I could have,

2347
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:32,640
you know, that pizza that you're eating.

2348
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:36,120
This is just like the Konami version of this.

2349
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:38,560
I really wish we could earn our fan base back.

2350
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,560
Well, I really wish you weren't fucking stupid in fucking alienating your entire fan base,

2351
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,360
canceled one of the most anticipated games that your company was producing and decided

2352
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:49,720
to go to the pachinkos and said, fuck you to everybody else.

2353
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:53,040
That's kind of how I wish you, oh, and then how you treated your developers, you know,

2354
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,040
like shit.

2355
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:58,440
Look, I don't blame this social media guy though, because I feel like he kind of knows

2356
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:02,580
what has to be done that like somebody has to apologize for what the fuck is happening.

2357
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:06,460
So I kind of give this guy massive kudos for literally putting himself in the line

2358
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:07,460
of fire.

2359
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:08,940
But it's also giving us false hope.

2360
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:09,940
Yeah.

2361
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:13,180
And I think, I think honestly, you know, it speaks more than anything else is results.

2362
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:16,260
And I'm kind of with JD in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2363
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:22,180
JD says, Konami, if you want me back, release home versions of 2DX and Poppin and DDR.

2364
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,260
Well, I mean, I don't know.

2365
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:28,380
I think some of those games aren't necessarily going to sell well, but I, I would really

2366
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:30,500
love BeatMania 2DX to make a comeback.

2367
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:34,260
There's a user, it's on Reddit, he goes by Konami US social.

2368
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:38,380
So that people are in the assumption that's the social media rep for Konami.

2369
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:41,660
Although it could be a complete troll account, so who knows, but it doesn't seem like he's

2370
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:43,660
trolling too much.

2371
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:45,360
I don't know.

2372
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:48,660
I just going to say it's going to take a lot to fucking get us back.

2373
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:54,340
And even if you announce a fucking new game for consoles for Metal Gear Solid, at most

2374
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:58,220
it's probably going to be a remake and good luck.

2375
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:02,660
I mean, I'd be curious though, what kind of talent they might try to bring into these

2376
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:05,820
games to try to woo people over to them.

2377
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:08,980
I mean, they could recruit some really big name out there.

2378
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:12,140
We just don't know about it because we don't, haven't heard of it, but Metal Gear could

2379
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:17,540
land a really big name or, um, you know, Silent Hill might get a scary movie director or something

2380
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:19,860
that's going to surprise us behind it.

2381
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:23,420
Like, I don't know, the people that made Saw, although I hate Saw, I really hope that doesn't

2382
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:24,420
happen.

2383
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:25,420
Why did I say that?

2384
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:26,420
That's a horrible thing to suggest.

2385
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:29,580
Maybe he gets like, like John Carpenter from Halloween or something.

2386
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:31,540
No, that is not the spirit of Silent Hill.

2387
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:38,100
That's the spirit of the garbage Western Silent Hills, which are garbage and they're garbage.

2388
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:39,100
Are they garbage?

2389
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,100
Yes.

2390
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:41,100
I don't.

2391
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,100
What about a Japanese horror movie director?

2392
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:43,740
No, you have to have.

2393
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:44,740
Okay.

2394
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:45,740
So I was on board for PT.

2395
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:47,300
How about David Lynch with Twin Peaks?

2396
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,300
No.

2397
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:49,300
Well, that could work.

2398
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:50,300
Aha.

2399
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:51,660
That could, that could possibly be okay.

2400
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:52,660
All right.

2401
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:54,460
Now we're onto something.

2402
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:58,220
But no, you can't, you can't do Silent Hill anymore, Konami.

2403
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:01,260
You just need to give it up to somebody that cares, because you guys don't.

2404
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:03,300
Several people in chat are yelling Guillermo del Toro.

2405
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,340
Well, they've already, they've already burned the bridge.

2406
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:07,540
Oh yeah, they super burned that bridge.

2407
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,540
Yeah, I don't.

2408
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:13,260
Well, and it's kind of sad because he's not in Kojima's latest game.

2409
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:15,540
No, he's not.

2410
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:22,020
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Alliance Radio at vognetwork.com,

2411
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:23,780
use the pass phrase, ground.

2412
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:24,780
All right.

2413
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:25,780
All right.

2414
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:30,660
So let's move on with one more story here about Uno going to be making a comeback.

2415
02:04:30,660 --> 02:04:34,100
You remember Uno on the Xbox 360?

2416
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:37,820
Those of you that weren't really gaming a lot 10 years ago may forget that Uno on the

2417
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:40,540
360 was actually kind of a big deal.

2418
02:04:40,540 --> 02:04:44,740
Like it was one of those Xbox live arcade games that did very, very, very well in the

2419
02:04:44,740 --> 02:04:46,300
early days of the Xbox 360.

2420
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:48,580
And Uno is going to be making a comeback.

2421
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:52,900
It was announced that Uno is going to be getting a game adaptation for the PC, PlayStation

2422
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:57,500
4 and Xbox One, and it even has a release date, August 9th, 2016.

2423
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:59,420
But does it have camera support?

2424
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:02,540
Yes, it has camera support.

2425
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:09,340
Most importantly, we will have camera support, which, you know, just means it's only a matter

2426
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:13,960
of time before someone exposes themselves while playing Uno, which I never really understood

2427
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:15,140
camera support in Uno.

2428
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:19,580
I think it was really a novelty on the Xbox 360, because remember, that was before Kinect.

2429
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:22,780
Xbox 360 had those little cameras things, right?

2430
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:23,780
So anyway.

2431
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:29,700
No, dude, I don't know why I said dude, but breaking news, I have tons of songs in this

2432
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:32,620
DDR game still.

2433
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:36,420
Let me finish the story and then you can tell us while we wait for some calls what songs.

2434
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:40,420
We don't know exactly what Uno will have in it, like if it's going to have Uno Rush and

2435
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:44,220
all that stuff too, but it's Ubisoft that is doing it.

2436
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:46,960
And yes, voice and video chat will be a part of it.

2437
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:52,020
So I'm sure some Twitch streams are going to be a hoot and a holler by the time this

2438
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:53,020
release is there.

2439
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:54,020
So yeah.

2440
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:55,020
Let's see.

2441
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:57,500
I'm looking at some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

2442
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:01,640
Vidpower in chat says, Uno was such an important Xbox Live arcade game.

2443
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:04,500
It really was, despite all the fact that we kind of make jokes about it.

2444
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:09,660
Like it was a really, I mean, people bought that camera for Uno of all things.

2445
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:11,460
It was a crazy thing.

2446
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:13,160
Let's see.

2447
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:18,440
Other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com fifth dream says Uno VR please.

2448
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:19,440
That might be a bit much.

2449
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,440
Let's let's be real.

2450
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:21,440
It's a bit much.

2451
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,440
Okay.

2452
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,160
Um, that is it for the stories we have.

2453
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:28,840
We're going to open up our Skype line over at a one eight seven seven game OLR or username

2454
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:31,360
on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word.

2455
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:32,360
The Skype line is open.

2456
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:35,080
If you want to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight or maybe something

2457
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:36,080
that we missed.

2458
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,080
Shane.

2459
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:42,300
So your, your games or your steps charts that remain in DDR or what?

2460
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:43,820
So I future list is still there.

2461
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:44,820
That's awesome.

2462
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:45,820
Oh, that's awesome.

2463
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:46,820
I love that.

2464
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:47,820
I didn't know you did the art for that.

2465
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:48,820
Or step step or whatever.

2466
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:49,820
Yeah, I did that.

2467
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:55,140
Um, I'm starting at the bottom now and going up, uh, uh, Bilela Samba still there.

2468
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:56,140
Wow.

2469
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:59,020
Uh, yeah, I know that's, that should have been gone by now.

2470
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:05,900
Um, soul crash is there, uh, freeway shuffle is there.

2471
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:09,620
The flyaway remix is there, fires there every day.

2472
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:10,620
Every night is there.

2473
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:11,620
All right, that's enough.

2474
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:14,380
Good for you that you still have a lot of songs in the game.

2475
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:16,660
So should people tweet you pictures of themselves playing it?

2476
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:17,660
Sure.

2477
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:19,780
And they can say how garbage some of them are because some of them are really garbage.

2478
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:20,780
All right.

2479
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:21,780
We got a phone call coming in.

2480
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:22,780
Let's get to it.

2481
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:23,780
Hi.

2482
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:24,780
You're on orange lounge radio.

2483
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:25,780
Who's this?

2484
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:26,780
Uh, this is a YYR.

2485
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:27,780
Hey, YYR.

2486
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:28,780
How you doing, buddy?

2487
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:29,780
Uh, not too bad.

2488
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:30,780
Actually pretty good.

2489
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:36,220
Considering, uh, finally after probably a good six, seven years, snake party is in peer

2490
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:37,220
review.

2491
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:38,220
Congratulations on that.

2492
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:42,260
How long does the game usually take from a peer review to actually release on the console?

2493
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:47,180
Well, uh, now is probably not the best time to really judge.

2494
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:52,380
Um, simply because we're at the very tail end of Xbox live indie games, like six weeks

2495
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:54,180
from now, it's all over.

2496
02:07:54,180 --> 02:08:01,820
Um, so there aren't that many reviewers now, so I'm hoping less than six weeks, but generally

2497
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:07,540
when it was more populated anywhere from, uh, one to three weeks, depending on volume

2498
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:13,500
and also if you had any problems that people could fail you on, that would obviously make

2499
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:14,500
it take longer.

2500
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:17,500
Cause then you had to wait a week, uh, they call it jail.

2501
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:18,660
You're in jail for a week.

2502
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:21,740
You can't resubmit for at least another week.

2503
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:26,340
And then, you know, you fix your problems, you resubmit and then you start over.

2504
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:33,620
Um, so, uh, you said in six weeks everything is gone, but that's just the new submissions

2505
02:08:33,620 --> 02:08:34,620
part, right?

2506
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:35,620
Not like the store and all this stuff.

2507
02:08:35,700 --> 02:08:38,340
The new submissions, peer review, all of that goes away.

2508
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:42,820
Um, the games that are on there, the, you know, 3000 plus games that are on there will

2509
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:45,060
remain on sale for another one year.

2510
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:46,060
Okay.

2511
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:50,060
So at least it's not like when you released, um, pixel poops on the PlayStation Vita where

2512
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:52,900
it was like up for four weeks and that was it.

2513
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:53,900
Yeah.

2514
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:58,860
But, uh, I, I really send my thanks to the 60 or so people who, uh, who bought it.

2515
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:00,620
Hey, it's not a bad number.

2516
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:02,620
Listen to this show.

2517
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:03,620
That's not bad.

2518
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:04,620
I was one of those people.

2519
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:06,500
You have 60 people that listen to the show.

2520
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,500
What the hell?

2521
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:08,500
That's great.

2522
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:09,500
That's awesome.

2523
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:13,460
Hey, by the way, did you know we have a celebrity here in studio?

2524
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:16,060
We have the, uh, world renowned step chart artist.

2525
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:17,540
Shane is here.

2526
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:24,660
I was really psyched when he showed up because it's just, Oh my God, I have played some of

2527
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:26,660
those songs.

2528
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:30,100
So apparently some of my favorite ones are not on here.

2529
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,780
I'm looking at you in chat.

2530
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:34,820
Some of the chat is responding to some of these songs that, and again, if you're just

2531
02:09:34,820 --> 02:09:39,700
joining us, uh, if you've played dance, dance revolution, ACE or a, which is the new one

2532
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:44,020
that's a Dave and busters and round one, Ooh, saberwing stayed on apparently songs that

2533
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:45,900
Shane worked on when he was at Konami.

2534
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:46,900
What?

2535
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:47,900
That was 10 years ago at this point.

2536
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:50,380
Yeah, I actually are still in the game.

2537
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:52,980
So, uh, some, some folks in chat, orange, right?

2538
02:09:52,980 --> 02:09:55,540
Here's, here's ready for this ego inflation.

2539
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:57,140
Fire was a good chart.

2540
02:09:57,140 --> 02:09:58,140
You're welcome.

2541
02:09:58,140 --> 02:09:59,140
And orange.

2542
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:00,140
Right.

2543
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:02,220
Notice it's like anytime I remotely reference anything, Bamani orange, right.

2544
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:03,500
Is right there to save my ass.

2545
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:08,100
If I stay at state something incorrect, uh, let's see, uh, dark Tetsuya says, Oh, Shane

2546
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:09,100
did freeway shuffle.

2547
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:10,100
Yep.

2548
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,100
I did.

2549
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:12,100
Oh, those are good steps.

2550
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:13,100
I played the double chart.

2551
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:14,100
Did you write the double chart?

2552
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:15,100
Yeah.

2553
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:16,100
I did all of those.

2554
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:20,700
Uh, JD says, Shane should make a list and put it on the OLR Wiki or something.

2555
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:25,780
Uh, and dark Tetsuya is offering to help you if you can like send him a list from this

2556
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:26,780
game, at least I could.

2557
02:10:26,780 --> 02:10:27,780
Yeah.

2558
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:29,420
I don't know if I can remember.

2559
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:31,340
Like that's a decade ago.

2560
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:36,060
Well, and our pal, what we have other friends of all our pal Mel B would have done a lot

2561
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:37,260
of step charts too.

2562
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:38,260
Right.

2563
02:10:38,260 --> 02:10:39,260
I thought so.

2564
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:40,260
Huh?

2565
02:10:40,260 --> 02:10:41,820
Interesting.

2566
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:45,060
Some other folks that were affiliated with the show, I can get the credits to roll.

2567
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:49,020
And if, uh, if your name's not still in there, I'll, uh, I'll send the lawyers after.

2568
02:10:49,020 --> 02:10:50,020
Thank you.

2569
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:54,340
I want rights to sweet code and in silent Hills and I won't, that that'll be enough

2570
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:55,340
for me.

2571
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:56,340
Here's the thing though.

2572
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:57,340
Did they put you as Shane?

2573
02:10:57,900 --> 02:10:58,900
Yeah.

2574
02:10:58,900 --> 02:10:59,900
Oh, okay.

2575
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:00,900
Yeah.

2576
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:01,900
Shane uses, Shane uses his middle name.

2577
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:02,900
Like I do.

2578
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:03,900
So I was just curious.

2579
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:04,900
Anyway.

2580
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:05,900
Uh, let's see.

2581
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:06,900
So I'm sorry.

2582
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:10,460
Sorry to derail, but you know, when you have a celebrity in studio, they, their ego takes

2583
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:11,460
priority.

2584
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:12,460
It does.

2585
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:14,940
Uh, what else did you want to share with us tonight?

2586
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:15,940
Why?

2587
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:16,940
Why?

2588
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:21,500
Well, actually the reason I called, I don't usually do this, but, um, because this concept

2589
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:26,140
is so early and I'm honestly not sure if it would be worth buying, I'm going to remind

2590
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:29,500
you of what you said last week and I'm going to share what I have here.

2591
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,500
Oh God.

2592
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:31,500
I'm so excited.

2593
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:32,500
Okay.

2594
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:39,020
So this started when Loki was complaining about his wife watching Grey's Anatomy's 8,000

2595
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:42,380
episodes back to back for the second time, by the way, because we've already gone through

2596
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:46,340
all the episodes and that she's like, there's nothing else on, we're just going to watch

2597
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:47,340
it again.

2598
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:50,580
I'm like, why doesn't she watch the other Shonda shows?

2599
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:51,580
Like scandal?

2600
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:55,460
Like even I like scandal, she was in the scandal and she tried to watch it again, but like,

2601
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:56,460
I don't know.

2602
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:57,460
She just stopped again.

2603
02:11:57,460 --> 02:12:01,100
So she didn't remember what happened when she left off and God, I don't want to watch

2604
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:02,100
all that again.

2605
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:03,100
All right.

2606
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:07,060
So yes, Loki was ranting about the wife monopolizing the television with the Shonda verse, which

2607
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:13,180
left him with his PC with his, you know, 500 steam games on it and therefore he has nothing

2608
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:14,180
to play.

2609
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:15,180
Exactly.

2610
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:16,180
Oh yes.

2611
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:17,180
Okay.

2612
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:18,180
Yes.

2613
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:19,180
I remember.

2614
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:20,180
Go ahead.

2615
02:12:20,180 --> 02:12:21,180
Go ahead.

2616
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:22,180
I remember now though.

2617
02:12:22,180 --> 02:12:23,180
So you suggested there should be a game called I have nothing to play.

2618
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:24,180
Yes.

2619
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:25,180
Okay.

2620
02:12:25,900 --> 02:12:26,900
All right.

2621
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:27,900
I'm with you.

2622
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:28,900
I do remember this.

2623
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:32,340
So, so basically what you have is you have this game where you're essentially sitting

2624
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:38,020
in a web browser and there are three storefronts available that you can visit at any time.

2625
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:40,700
The gray station store.

2626
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:48,900
I think a smog and a also mumble bundle.com and I love it.

2627
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:49,900
I approve.

2628
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:54,620
And of course there's always something on sale, like ridiculous sales.

2629
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:59,980
They'll, um, they'll be, uh, running, give me an, uh, uh, early August sale sale for

2630
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:00,980
no reason.

2631
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:07,620
Genre sale, sale, sale, like, um, and basically this game is, uh, a Christmas sale in July.

2632
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:08,940
Can you put that in there for me?

2633
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:14,100
A Christmas sale in July, because I swear to God, I was at the mall the earlier this

2634
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:17,900
week and I had to text Shane, there was five nights at Freddy's dolls and I was looking

2635
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:21,160
at the mall like, Oh, and I texted Shane pictures of the dolls.

2636
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:25,980
And as I'm sitting there looking at these five nights at Freddy's dolls, the first Noel,

2637
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:31,820
the Christmas Carol starts playing on the radio and I was like, it is fucking July.

2638
02:13:31,820 --> 02:13:33,140
Why is it Christmas Carol?

2639
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:37,220
Um, Best Buy just did like a black Friday in July sale.

2640
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:39,500
Yeah, I guess it's your Amazon did their thing too.

2641
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,500
So okay.

2642
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:41,500
So anyway, yes.

2643
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:42,500
Uh, that, that's my other request.

2644
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:45,140
A Christmas in July sale.

2645
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:47,420
So basically, and I don't know if this is fun.

2646
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:51,140
I don't know if anyone would actually buy this, but the point of this game is to buy

2647
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:58,040
games and add them to your library, your smoke library and your, your, um, your gray station

2648
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:01,200
for library and to not actually play anything.

2649
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:05,340
And it'll track like how much money you've saved, how much money you actually spent.

2650
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:09,680
Um, the ratio of spent to save the number of games purchased and there'll be leaderboards

2651
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:10,940
for all that crap.

2652
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:15,620
I don't know if I know the online multiplayer stuff is really hard and it might complicate

2653
02:14:15,620 --> 02:14:19,540
things too much, but I almost feel like why, why are, what you're describing to me would

2654
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:23,660
be a brilliant card game card game.

2655
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:24,660
Huh?

2656
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:25,660
Yeah.

2657
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:26,660
Right.

2658
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:30,740
Because then that way it's kind of like, that's how the sales are controlled and you buy the

2659
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:33,380
games in your hand that are like cards.

2660
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:35,380
But maybe if somebody could get a better deal, I don't know.

2661
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:38,820
I haven't really thought this out, but as you're describing it to me and maybe it's

2662
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:43,300
the fact that we just talked about Uno and what a big game that was, I'm like, this almost

2663
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:46,780
sounds like a card game because it's like you're trying to kind of like, like, like

2664
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:50,580
monopoly or something like you're buying and selling and exchanging properties and stuff.

2665
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:51,580
So it's like you're trying to hoard.

2666
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:56,220
You have to have the biggest hoard of games that you bought at the cheapest possible.

2667
02:14:56,220 --> 02:15:00,780
That fixes the biggest problem with this concept, which is it's funny, but there really isn't

2668
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:02,140
much of a game there.

2669
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:06,420
I mean, basically I put a whole bunch of, of work into this.

2670
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:10,060
Um, there are several different possible types of developers.

2671
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:14,300
You've got your triple A developer, your middle tier, your indie, you're just straight

2672
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:20,100
up awful developer with poorly translated descriptions and cobbled together graphics.

2673
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:25,060
Um, and then, you know, it would randomly choose one of those and then randomly generate

2674
02:15:25,060 --> 02:15:29,920
a game, um, based on a genre, which is also randomly chosen.

2675
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:36,380
You have your simulator games like grandma simulator, pushup simulator, 2017, uh, you

2676
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:41,380
have slice of life narrative games like my sister's anxiety or before showering.

2677
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:47,380
I mean, this is just, uh, you know, randomly generated games with randomly generated descriptions

2678
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:50,620
and you know, cobbled together screens and things like that.

2679
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:51,940
I love this so much.

2680
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:52,940
I love this so much.

2681
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:56,620
You, you, you, you make dreams a reality while I are, you're the person that makes dreams

2682
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:57,620
come true.

2683
02:15:57,620 --> 02:16:00,500
And I gotta say, I have to read some of these comments in chat because they're so amazing.

2684
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:03,980
Uh, dark Tetsuya says, okay, this sounds hilariously meta.

2685
02:16:03,980 --> 02:16:05,420
Uh, let's see.

2686
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:08,540
Fifth dream says, the best part is when you click anything in the game, it just opens

2687
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:11,780
your steam client and starts a random game and tells you to fuck off.

2688
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:13,020
I don't know if it should do that.

2689
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:14,020
I don't know if it should do that.

2690
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:17,740
Uh, Rama says, rage nator would be the first person to buy this game.

2691
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:18,740
Okay.

2692
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:19,780
Real talk, real talk.

2693
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:24,060
You have to have the little mascot that teaches you how to play the game that pops up in the

2694
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:28,300
corner that says, and his name is going to be sale inator.

2695
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:29,300
Okay.

2696
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:33,460
After our favorite caller here at OLR and he's going to pop and he always has to start

2697
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:40,780
off by saying, hi, this is sale inator here and I have a tip or like, did you know that

2698
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:43,740
this is on sale or there's a hot sale or something like this.

2699
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:47,580
And so like sale inator would actually advise you to where all the good sales are at.

2700
02:16:47,580 --> 02:16:50,580
So I want you to, I want you to think about that.

2701
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:51,580
Okay.

2702
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:52,580
Is he even listening tonight?

2703
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:55,900
I haven't seen him in chat.

2704
02:16:55,900 --> 02:17:01,140
If this actually becomes a thing that comes out on steam, it would, it would be at a list

2705
02:17:01,140 --> 02:17:06,180
price of like $30 and would always be 90% off.

2706
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:07,180
I love it.

2707
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:08,180
Yes.

2708
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:09,180
Always.

2709
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:10,180
Just perpetually a 90% off game.

2710
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:11,180
Uh, let's see.

2711
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:14,380
JD says, uh, Oh, Hey, yeah, that would work.

2712
02:17:14,380 --> 02:17:15,940
A drafting style game.

2713
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:16,940
Like dominion.

2714
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:17,940
Yes.

2715
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:18,940
Card.

2716
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:19,940
Card building games are huge white right now.

2717
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:20,940
Oh my God.

2718
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:25,660
You're building, you're building your library of steam games that you're getting on sale.

2719
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:28,420
This is, this is genius right there.

2720
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:30,420
That's patent pending idea.

2721
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:31,420
Patent pending.

2722
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:32,820
I get, I get half the proceeds.

2723
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:33,820
No, I'm kidding.

2724
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:34,820
I don't.

2725
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:35,820
You, you, you do all the work.

2726
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:36,820
Why?

2727
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:37,820
Why?

2728
02:17:37,820 --> 02:17:38,820
I know.

2729
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:39,820
I know you will be kind and put in some OLR jokes and plugs for indie podcasting and I'll

2730
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:40,820
be happy.

2731
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:41,820
Oh my God.

2732
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:42,820
This is, wow.

2733
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:43,820
All right.

2734
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:46,220
Well I'm still, honestly, I still have to work on multitasking.

2735
02:17:46,220 --> 02:17:47,220
You do.

2736
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:48,220
Yeah.

2737
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:49,220
Um, put it on the list.

2738
02:17:49,220 --> 02:17:50,220
This is actually something to think about.

2739
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:51,220
And you know what?

2740
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:57,020
Amy, Amy was, Amy always tells me how she feels and she's like, this sounds stupid, you know,

2741
02:17:57,020 --> 02:17:58,020
as a game.

2742
02:17:58,020 --> 02:17:59,020
Period.

2743
02:17:59,020 --> 02:18:03,060
I mean, maybe it's funny, but this sounds stupid because all you'd be doing is buying

2744
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:05,740
games and adding them to your library.

2745
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:09,340
So to actually put a card game in there that actually, wow.

2746
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:10,340
Okay.

2747
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:11,340
All right.

2748
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:12,340
Something to think about now.

2749
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:15,740
I, I, I, it's why we are, I'm like your consultant.

2750
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:21,420
By the way, if you posted ideas in chat, um, message me your names so I can get you in

2751
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:22,420
there.

2752
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:23,420
Um, let's see.

2753
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:26,580
Raginator in chat says, I'm here and listening.

2754
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:27,580
Oops.

2755
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:28,580
All right.

2756
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:33,860
Um, Hey, Raginator, the whole thing is a compliment and you know it, you know, we're, we are about

2757
02:18:33,860 --> 02:18:40,180
to immortalize you in a video game, uh, on steam nonetheless, uh, SSG100 Matt says, wow,

2758
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:44,580
this is something, hopefully nobody steals the idea and makes it before YYR does.

2759
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:45,840
Patent pending.

2760
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,560
You listening, Bobby Black Wolf?

2761
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:55,320
I know people, I know celebrities here in studio that have lawyers.

2762
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:56,320
Don't you dare.

2763
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:57,400
All right.

2764
02:18:57,400 --> 02:19:01,200
I have homework clearly, and I've already taken almost 12 minutes of your time.

2765
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:04,640
No, it was worth every goddamn minute and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

2766
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:05,640
All right.

2767
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:08,300
All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go for now though so we can get some other calls.

2768
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:09,300
Good luck.

2769
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:10,300
Good luck with multitasking.

2770
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:11,300
Good luck.

2771
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:12,300
Start, get your notepad.

2772
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:14,680
And every time you think of a good idea for this, uh, and if you want to talk further,

2773
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:15,680
we totally can.

2774
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:16,680
I love this brainstorming.

2775
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:18,240
Thanks for the feedback and suggestions.

2776
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:19,240
Thank you everybody.

2777
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:20,240
You're welcome.

2778
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:21,240
Anytime my friend.

2779
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:22,620
Hey, have a great week guys.

2780
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:23,620
You too.

2781
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:24,620
Bye buddy.

2782
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:25,620
Yep.

2783
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:26,620
Bye bye.

2784
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:29,600
I think, you know what, the beautiful thing about that phone call is I really feel like

2785
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:30,600
he's going to do it.

2786
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:35,840
Like I just, it may not be this year, it may not be next year, but I feel like that is

2787
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:39,960
going to be a game at some point that I will play at magfest and I'm going to be like,

2788
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:42,280
Salinator was my idea.

2789
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:48,560
All right, uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on skype if you want to, uh, give us

2790
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:54,800
a call, uh, and Akuma JP says, we must always have a game or excuse me, we must have a game

2791
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:57,880
that is always coming soon by Loki.

2792
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:03,760
Hey, yeah, there has to be like a, you can't call it green light, but maybe there's like

2793
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:08,920
smog has like a yield division or something and uh, you know, yield to the new games that

2794
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:12,280
are coming and Loki just has one there that never seems to get made.

2795
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:13,280
I don't know.

2796
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,280
We'll see.

2797
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:16,480
And it'll be called half life three.

2798
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:20,320
All right.

2799
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:22,460
No games of the number three, you're not allowed.

2800
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:23,460
That could be okay.

2801
02:20:23,460 --> 02:20:26,560
There's a little rule twist for your card thing.

2802
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:30,760
Games with the number three in them are not allowed on the smog store.

2803
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:31,760
Things like that.

2804
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:32,760
All right.

2805
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:36,200
Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on skype.

2806
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:38,880
Really just the problem is we've been asking the wrong questions.

2807
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:42,600
They're going to pull a Microsoft and it's just going to jump the half flight for everyone.

2808
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:43,600
Yay.

2809
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:47,800
Gabe's like, Hey, listen, you guys have been just asking about half life three all the

2810
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:50,960
time when that's coming out and I'm just saying, I don't know when it's coming.

2811
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:57,160
If only you'd asked about half life four, I could have said, yeah.

2812
02:20:57,160 --> 02:20:58,160
All right.

2813
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:01,160
Uh, now the chats are a lighting up there.

2814
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:04,800
Bobby Black Wolf suggests half life for the search for half life three.

2815
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:08,480
Uh, dark to see you says, isn't that what the developer of leisure suit Larry did?

2816
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,480
Wow.

2817
02:21:09,480 --> 02:21:10,480
Way to throw it back.

2818
02:21:10,480 --> 02:21:11,480
But I think you're actually right.

2819
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:12,480
I think that did happen.

2820
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:13,480
Anyway.

2821
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:14,480
Um, one more shout out for calls.

2822
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:17,120
Orange launch radio, all one word on skype.

2823
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:18,900
Are you, are you still looking at the Wiki, Shane?

2824
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:19,900
Like stroking your ego?

2825
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:21,440
No, I'm reading big brother stuff.

2826
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:22,440
Oh no.

2827
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:24,200
I saw the songs I've done.

2828
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:25,960
Uh, they stop at a certain point.

2829
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,360
So I stopped watching big brother.

2830
02:21:27,360 --> 02:21:28,360
I've been bad.

2831
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:31,160
I watched the first week or so and then I just kind of fell out.

2832
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:33,400
It's hard because the show is on Sunday night, right?

2833
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:37,640
It's on like Sundays and Wednesdays and Thursdays, all the nights I have podcasts.

2834
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:38,640
Yeah.

2835
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:40,520
So I just read about it.

2836
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:42,360
I don't think I've seen an episode in forever.

2837
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:43,360
That's okay.

2838
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:48,040
You just finished editing the show and then you go and watch stranger things and then

2839
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:49,040
you're done.

2840
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,600
I have another FU of the week.

2841
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:51,840
Oh, well go ahead.

2842
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:59,680
Since we, um, FU to the fact that not all of the Danganronpa anime is out because I

2843
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:05,000
need to know what happens and I literally did a free trial to Funimation just so I could

2844
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,360
watch it.

2845
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:10,840
So what the hell is a bullet hell game anime like?

2846
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:12,200
Is it just like, what was it?

2847
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:13,920
The game's not a bullet hell game.

2848
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:17,320
I mean it's a, it's like a Phoenix Wright style.

2849
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:18,320
That's right.

2850
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:19,320
I'm sorry.

2851
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:20,320
But they use bullets.

2852
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:25,640
They use like truth bullets and stuff during the trials, but it's just two episodes in.

2853
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:27,200
They have two different versions going on.

2854
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:30,720
They have one that takes place after three and one that takes place before one with the

2855
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:32,800
cast of two.

2856
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:37,120
And I'm just like so engrossed already is so good.

2857
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:41,840
And it makes me annoyed that I don't have all my episodes yet, but we get them same

2858
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:43,040
day as Japan does.

2859
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,520
So it's not like I'm even behind.

2860
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:47,480
I just have to wait.

2861
02:22:47,480 --> 02:22:49,040
It's frustrating.

2862
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,480
All right.

2863
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:53,360
Well unfortunately there's no more calls coming in, so I'm going to go ahead and close up

2864
02:22:53,360 --> 02:22:55,360
the Skype line for tonight.

2865
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:58,800
But Hey, if you want to, it's probably because a lot of our regular callers called into Bobby

2866
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:00,720
tonight because he had his 11th anniversary.

2867
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:03,120
So I understand it's no big deal.

2868
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:06,360
But if you want to email us your thoughts, you can always send us an email, participate

2869
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:07,360
at orangesonsradio.com.

2870
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:11,720
Of course you can always tweet us as well, twitter.com slash O L R, but we are going

2871
02:23:11,720 --> 02:23:13,480
to go ahead and start to wrap up for tonight.

2872
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:18,120
I want to thank you guys for downloading our show and checking it out or listening to us

2873
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:19,120
live.

2874
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:20,560
However you consumed orange on radio this week.

2875
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:21,860
Thank you so much for being here.

2876
02:23:21,860 --> 02:23:24,840
If you like what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or five about

2877
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:25,840
the show.

2878
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:29,720
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only

2879
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:32,160
if the gamers are here to listen to it.

2880
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:35,860
So, um, uh, you know, again, help us spread the word.

2881
02:23:35,860 --> 02:23:36,860
That's all we ask.

2882
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:37,960
Uh, that's going to do it.

2883
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:41,720
We're done a little early tonight, but I guess that gives us time to go hunt Pokemon or something.

2884
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:42,720
I don't know.

2885
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:43,720
We'll see.

2886
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:44,720
It's all common shit around here.

2887
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:45,720
Oh, excuse me.

2888
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:46,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

2889
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:54,000
Oh, since after I caught like the 120th Pidgey, it's like, we're going to start saying it.

2890
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I could use a different.

2891
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:56,720
Oh, that's a lot of XP for evolving them over.

2892
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:57,720
It is.

2893
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:58,720
That's I got the 17.

2894
02:23:58,720 --> 02:23:59,720
All right.

2895
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:00,720
Anyway.

2896
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:01,720
Uh, any final thoughts for us tonight?

2897
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:02,720
Loki.

2898
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:04,840
I guess I should get on working on a game.

2899
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:05,840
Yeah.

2900
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:10,040
I want to have, you know, have a reputation for not releasing anything.

2901
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:11,040
Yeah.

2902
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:13,040
Uh, Shane, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

2903
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:15,040
Thank you for filling in for a little bit of the show here.

2904
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:16,040
You're welcome.

2905
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:17,040
No, I just want to sleep.

2906
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,040
All right.

2907
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:21,720
Well, don't sleep there on the chair cause that'll be awkward in the morning.

2908
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:24,760
Um, Alan stepped into studio randomly wanting to say something.

2909
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:25,760
Yes, Alan.

2910
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:32,000
I have an emergency F you of the week F you to the fact that I was, I had like three or

2911
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,720
four dollars in loose change in my hand and then I was picking up little bits of trash

2912
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:36,720
off my desk.

2913
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:41,280
And when I went to the garbage whole handful went in and I'm not rooting through the trash

2914
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:43,960
for like a bunch of dimes and nickels.

2915
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:48,400
So F you to throwing away $4 and change for $4 for $4.

2916
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:49,400
I dig through the trash.

2917
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:50,400
Well, it depends.

2918
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:51,400
What's in there.

2919
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,400
Do you have like day old food?

2920
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:53,400
Cause I don't know about that.

2921
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:56,840
But I think if it's just papers, it's all you work.

2922
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:58,800
Anything at your work is just papers.

2923
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:01,640
I dig through that for $4 being lazy.

2924
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:02,640
All right.

2925
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:05,480
Thank you for interrupting the show to share your tragedy with us.

2926
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:08,920
Uh, my final thought is a feel better dark Sakura.

2927
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:12,960
And uh, if you're listening, I hope you are here next week.

2928
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:15,480
That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

2929
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:16,600
Have a great week, everybody.

2930
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:21,120
Happy gaming, happy Pokemon hunting or whatever game it is you decide to play this week.

2932
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:25,200
No Bobby next week.

2933
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:28,640
Cause he's at a, um, uh, convention in Kentucky.

2934
