00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Extroverts rejoice! DVR-Ace is out and receiving positive reviews, and Pokemon GO is out in the US!

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Now if only we could prevent Team Rocket from shutting it down from time to time.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Introverts, enjoy your personal comfort along with this week's news on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Hey, you know, I think I know some introverts playing both those things too.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
But hey, welcome back everybody. It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
Live tonight on July the 10th, 2016 with episode number 649 of our show.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Robertson, joining me here in lovely Studio N7, located in Sacramento, California.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Home of many Pikachus and Eevees, apparently. Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
And Caterpie's in your bathroom.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, I hope it wasn't in the litter box, because somebody else Caterpie's in there.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
No, it was hanging on the shower curtain.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh great, that's good to know. How are you, DarkSakura?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm okay.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Good. We missed you last week.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I missed me too.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
But I know, did you have a good 4th of July?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
It was alright.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
It was okay. It was alright.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
I managed to shut my thumb in the sliding glass door, so I have to get it, I guess, burned through to lancet.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Well, that's scary.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
It's ugly.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
So, you are not going to be here next week though, right?

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
I don't know. I'm probably not, or I might be late.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
The California Extreme is next week too, I think, is something else going on.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh my god.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Busy, busy time.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Well, it's just that I'm going to be a judge at an event.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Oh, fun.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
For, hold on, let me get the event information, so go ahead and go to Loki.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Alright, Dirty Housekeeping, remind me, we'll plug that event.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Say hello also to Techmaster Loki.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Hello.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
With a mouthful of breadsticks, complete radio professionalism going on over there, but I know how it goes.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
You only got here to the show with minutes to spare, so you gotta eat.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
You can't, those rants tonight have to be fueled somehow, so there you go.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Right.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
How are you doing, Techmaster?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I'm doing fine.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah? Busy week?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
No.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
No, not really?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
No, not really.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh, good, then you had a chance to play lots of games, I'm sure.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
No.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
It sounded like you said tech bastard.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Tech bastard Loki. Some might call him that.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
That's fine.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I don't know about that.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Hey, you guys can also join us.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm fathered by Edward Stark.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Technology.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Hey, it's live, of course, every Sunday night. Our show is live.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
vog.network.com, vognetwork.com.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Although our pal Bobby did have the night off, he is at another engagement right now, so he could not make his own show,

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
but usually he will have his fun little show leading into what we do here, and he's got an anniversary show coming up.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
You know, we just had an anniversary show. He's got one coming up as well, so we're all having birthdays right now.

03:14.000 --> 03:25.000
You can, of course, join us live in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where Dungeon Buster theorizes Loki's restoring his mana for casting rants later.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
Yes, that's how it works. You eat the food, you get the mana back, and then you can put everybody on blast later in the show.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Rob, I'm disappointed.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
What?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Because everyone knows that drinking stuff restores your mana, and food restores your HP.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
Sorry, sorry. Maybe I was thinking of one of those weird games that went against the grain and changed that formula.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
No Go Deft in our chat room, I believe that's ActDeft under a new name, says Loki's rants are powered by breadsticks and hate.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
I was going to say, I think in Final Fantasy though, at least Eleven, eating pies would give you...

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
There you go. So some things would challenge the formula.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Pizza pie, breadsticks sort of like a pizza pie. That kind of works, right?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
That kind of works.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I just want pie, really. Just pie.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Pizza pie, apple pie, pizza apple pie, I don't care.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Chocolate cream pie. Specifically. Or Boston cream, which is cake pie.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Look, I know we've talked a lot about cake on this show, we've talked a lot about pie, but Alan's birthday was this past weekend.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
So Friday night we went to the Brazilian Grill out in Roseville, and you know, they're really yummy, but you know what we had for dessert?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
We didn't have cake or pie. We had flan.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
And I feel like we don't give flan enough respect on OLR in our little dessert debates.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
So I just want to show a little love for flan tonight.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Have you eaten a flan recently?

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
No, but I did have egg custard in my milk tea.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I feel like we should have a little PSA. The more you know.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
A little thing that flies by after...

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
We'll have Katy Perry standing on it.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Flying in on a giant tub of flan.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
You realize someone should Photoshop that now?

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
Dartit Studio says, I like Tech Bastard. Maybe there'll have to be a new name in the future. Who knows?

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Stoppy in chat says, I can't stand flan. It's like an earwax cake.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
You know what, Stoppy, I'm going to need you to leave.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
You know what I can't stand? People who are wrong.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
It's the show...

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
Brad, you're asking what the hell is flan in a chat room when you could just look it up on the internet.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Wikipedia.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
I think it's a yummy custard type of thing.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
It's a custard.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
It's like if they made milk in the jello and then sprinkled paprika on top or something.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
No, it's more like a cinnamon.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
It tastes like a churro.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
It's like a gelatinous churro.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
When you look at it, you don't think it's going to be as delicious as it is.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So if you're a picky eater who judges things a lot by what it looks like...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
It is a subtle flavor though.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
I always get the chocolate mousse or cake or whatever that they have there.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
And I always regret it because it's just like, I don't know, too intensely chocolate.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It's like, okay, this is too much chocolate.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Hold on there buddy, this is too much chocolate.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Alright, and Brad from Pod Culture says, you assume I care enough to do that.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
You should, you should if you've never had it.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
Alright look, we could talk about desserts all night long I'm sure, but it is a show about video games.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
I want to get into gaming because even though our gaming news tonight is a little bit light compared to recent weeks,

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
I truly feel a gaming, and you know, you know how sometimes I like to get a little dramatic on this show

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
and sometimes I have the tin foil hat on, but I truly believe this.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I kind of think a gaming revolution has occurred this week.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
And as much as we talk about World of Warcraft changed gaming

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
and we talked about how Xbox Live changed gaming.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
I really, really think PokÃ©mon Go has changed gaming this week.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Fuck that, we were doing fucking Ingress at least a year before that.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
I know right, the hipster old man in me is like, you sons of bitches pulling over at my park.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
You know what?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Fucking amateur.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
I stumbled upon a dead body, fucking amateur.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
We've been finding dead bodies for years now.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
I was cruising parks, I was in cemeteries at questionable hours.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
I was in places that said restricted access, but I went there anyways just to hack a portal.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
You fucking kids don't even understand.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
PokÃ©mon can be anywhere. If you want a portal, you gotta hike to it.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Who got you those portals? We did, fuckers, we did.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
That's right, those pictures on your PokÃ©stop? That was us.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
You ungrateful sons of bitches.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
You want to know who put the PokÃ©stop at the strip club? I did.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Niantic.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah, but Niantic approved it.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
It was actually, I felt my nerd cred shoot up a little bit, and then I was like, oh my god, what's wrong with me?

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
When I commented on a YouTube video, the one about the strip club, and they were like, thanks Nintendo.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
I was like, Nintendo didn't really have anything to do with that, it was an Ingress portal.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
You didn't get your ass thrown out of that strip club with a camera phone in a strip club.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
We didn't go into the strip club, it was right behind it in the graveyard.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
No, but I saw a picture of someone like they were catching a PokÃ©mon in a fucking strip club.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
You can see the dancer on stage.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Because PokÃ©mon are everywhere, you can capture it.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, but that shit's gonna get your ass beat.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
She just caught a Caterpie in the potty.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
But here's, okay, this is the thing, listen to this talk right now about the PokÃ©mon and everything.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
This is, I'm telling you guys, and you guys have probably experienced this a little bit, this is a social phenomenon right now.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
And look, I understand there's a few of you guys out there that are gonna be like, I don't get it, PokÃ©mon sucks, da da da.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah, I don't get it either because there's no fucking game.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Well, hold on, we'll get to that in a minute.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
But honestly, a lot of that talk, I'm gonna keep it real, because I like you guys.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
A lot of that talk just screams to me, I haven't downloaded and tried the game yet.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Now, is the game perfect? Fuck no, it's got a lot of problems.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And Loki will have no problem addressing those problems shortly.

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
However, I gotta tell you guys, okay, first off, and even though I am an Ingress Hipster and we make those jokes and all that stuff,

09:02.000 --> 09:11.000
the reality is, Alan, myself, Shane, we walked around downtown yesterday for a good three hours, probably got a good two mile walk in,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
just walking to all these random places. Why? PokÃ©mon.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
We put off a lure at the park, and you know one thing I've learned about lures?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
They don't just lure PokÃ©mon, they lure trainers.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
We met like six other people playing this.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
The thing about Ingress is that in comparison to PokÃ©mon GO, nobody's fucking playing Ingress.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
And look, I love my Ingressers, I love you guys that are playing and so forth, but the reality is, because of the brand of PokÃ©mon,

09:36.000 --> 09:44.000
and the ease of getting into this game and so forth, PokÃ©mon GO has just blown the fuck up in a way that Ingress just wasn't able to do.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
But the Hipster in me is very happy that we laid the foundation for this game.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
Just two things. Number one, me fussing at my phone at the post office, and the ten year old next to me going,

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Oh my god, I know, right? When I couldn't connect to the server.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
And number two, Trixie Mattel on Twitter.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
It's kids, it's adults, it's grandparents.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
You know, to be fair, it's a lot of the same demographics we'd seen in Ingress.

10:12.000 --> 10:20.000
It was literally a little bit of everybody, but I mean again, in PokÃ©mon GO, I have co-workers that I never suspected were playing video games at all.

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
That are obsessed, well I don't want to say obsessed with PokÃ©mon GO, but that are talking about it at work and how on a lunch break they want to go lure PokÃ©mon and stuff.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Like this is, gaming changed this week.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
And yeah, it's got, it's broken and it has a lot of progress it needs to make.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
You replace the word PokÃ©mon with small children and they're pedophiles.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
But they're not, they're small children, or they're small PokÃ©mon.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
God damn you.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Anyway, okay, so look, Loki, I know you've got issues with the game.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Let's talk about it. What's wrong with the game?

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
Did they fix anything from when I played the beta? Because I think they just said, hey, you know what, this is ready to go, let's put a fucking store in there.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And we're done.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
I mean, I don't fucking get it. There's no game to it.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I mean, there really isn't. You can, you know, capture gyms.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
For what? There's no points. There's nothing.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
If there's no factions, there's no actual competitive portion of it other than like, cool, I captured the gym.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
That'll be held for like two hours until some other person comes by and captures it again.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.000
And it's just so fucking buggy. I understand it's free to play, but my fucking god, you did nothing.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
Give it some more time to fix some of those fucking bugs. It is just broken.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah, the gym thing is like unplayable. And even if you could play it, like you'll hold a gym, like you said.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I think the gym should be a team thing.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, I mean, there's a gym within Aisha. Obviously, I don't want to give away where I live, but I'm sure most of you have a similar scenario.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Everywhere.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
I live in suburbia and when I fire up my scanner, I can see a gym not that far away.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
It's not next to my house, but it's where I can kind of see it and see what color it is.

12:06.000 --> 12:14.000
That thing changes hand several times a day. In Ingress, I own that portal and when anybody comes to fuck with it, I take it right back.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.000
But in PokÃ©mon GO, I can't do it. I would have to live on that fucking gym.

12:21.000 --> 12:30.000
Well, it's because these people are playing like, I don't know, to be honest, I don't know how people are leveling so fast because like, I played it quite a bit when the beta was going on for two weeks.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
And we had unlimited fucking everything. Like, all that shit you got to pay money for at the store, it was unlimited.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
So like, I was using the XP boost thing, fucking lures, you know, all that shit got to level 7 in two weeks.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
And there's like people that are level 19 and 20. It's like, dude, what the fuck are you? Are you just doing this all the time now?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I mean, do you work?

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
That's some of the questions we used to ask about certain Ingress players.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
I still ask it about those players, but I mean, like at least then I can understand, you know, when they're hitting stuff at like three in the mornings.

13:01.000 --> 13:09.000
I mean, that makes sense. But like, what the hell? I mean, I get it. But people are excited about PokÃ©mon. I'll give them that.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
But don't give Niantic a fucking pass for this level of shit. No one.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
But Ingress doesn't let me catch an Eevee in the bathroom.

13:17.000 --> 13:26.000
I don't, you know, first off, fucking AR people with that shit turned on in fucking amateurs, man. Just turn that shit off right away.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
And all these people in the car wrecks playing PokÃ©mon, please. I caught like six PokÃ©mon on the fucking freeway here today.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Like, that is just, there is no excuse to that shit.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
It is a lot easier to catch PokÃ©mon if you just turn that AR thing off.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
It's also going to save your battery.

13:43.000 --> 13:56.000
But I mean, the novelty of it. I mean, even bringing up my Twitter feed, one out of every five tweets is a camera picture of like, look, there's a Squirtle on my toilet.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
Or look, there's a PokÃ©mon. I even posted one last night. We were at Benihana.

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
And I thought it was funny because one of the little Paras or something, the little crab guys was standing on the grill.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
And I thought it made for a funny picture. I was like, oh, seafood time.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
You know, I thought it was funny, but like, that's a lot of what's going on on Twitter right now is just, you know, a lot of memes and things that have to do with this game.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
And it'll pass. People will calm down about it. And I, you know, I'm going to be the pessimist here. Shocking.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
I think people are going to get bored of this really fast.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
And I got bored of this really fast before because if people are catching everything that quickly and people are leveling up that quickly,

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
and then they're going to find, okay, all I can do is really take over gym, it's going to get boring really fast.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
It's not like Ingress where you can kind of, at least, you know, there's team scores.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
It's never ending Calvin Ball. Everything flips.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah, there's like actual scores that you're paying attention to and stuff like that. It's just now it doesn't really seem like a point.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Well, here's the thing, you know, look, every MMO is botched in its first week, every single one.

14:59.000 --> 15:07.000
And, you know, to Niantic's credit, like, sure, this game was going to be popular because it was a free PokÃ©mon game,

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
but even I am sitting here going, I didn't think it would be that popular with all these people playing it.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.000
And it's a lot of people. And so there's a part of me that's like, okay, maybe Niantic really wasn't ready for how many people wanted this.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
And to be fair, and I know we have a worldwide audience, so I want to, you know, acknowledge,

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
we probably have listeners in Canada and the UK that are like, fuck you guys, I can't even play the fucking thing. Shut up, Loki.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Don't worry, if you have a PokÃ©mon club membership, you know, you can't fucking play the thing either.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Well, and we'll address some of those things later in the show, because PokÃ©mon GO is in our news a little later in the show,

15:44.000 --> 15:53.000
so we'll address some of those world issues and that. But, you know, I do believe, just based on what I've seen with Ingress

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
and having played, you know, that for a couple years, Niantic is really good about every couple weeks there's a new version of Ingress

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
where they've done something. They added the Lawson power cubes or they put the cubes on the bar with the XM.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
Like, they do change that and regularly update it. So I feel like PokÃ©mon GO, you know, even during the beta,

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
we got several client updates there too. So, you know, I think the client that we have now in PokÃ©mon GO,

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
it's not going to stay that way forever. And I think these issues will get worked out and there will be new versions of the client that come out pretty soon.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
And so once things stabilize, then I think the real question is, and you do bring up some valid points, Loki,

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
what happens when I catch them all? Now what? Because I've been going balls to the wall, running in every park and everything around town.

16:41.000 --> 16:50.000
I've caught them all. Now what? Although I would speculate it's impossible to catch them all because they teased in that trailer

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
all those people in what was in New York City that were all capturing Mewtwo, you get the sense that like Ingress,

16:58.000 --> 17:06.000
Niantic will probably do live events with some of the legendary PokÃ©mon. So I imagine not every PokÃ©mon is in the game right now.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
There are some like Mewtwo.

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
You know, the only way, if I've learned anything from the movie industry, the only way you're going to be able to catch Mewtwo

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
is by everybody throwing their PokÃ©balls directly into his dick at the same time.

17:22.000 --> 17:31.000
Stop. Let's see. Fifth Dream in chat says $5 to download your PokÃ©dex completion certificate. Referencing a news story from last week, I think.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
Kaijuto in chat says they need PokÃ©mon battles. Or maybe not. Maybe the fake, it's just an AR PokÃ©dex is what draws people to it.

17:38.000 --> 17:46.000
They don't have to learn about EVs and all that stuff. That is a valid point is that they kind of simplified PokÃ©mon, maybe too much for some.

17:46.000 --> 17:54.000
Brad mentions, you know, catch a thousand of one type PokÃ©mon, morph it into a shiny. Heaven helps Shane if they add shinies.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
Oh, he's already told me. Like, he asked, he's like, are there shinies in PokÃ©mon Go? I'm like, no, I don't think so.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
It's just the first gen PokÃ©mon. He's like, oh yeah, shinies weren't added until third or fourth gen or something like that.

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
And so, he's like, yeah, I'm screwed once that comes out. Once the shiny thing happens.

18:13.000 --> 18:21.000
But, you know, again, the gym thing, the balance is really off. Like, the thing for the gym, it doesn't work right.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
Like, we all try to attack a gym. It just freezes or the thing gets down to one hit point and it won't die.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
They added AR for the gym, which is fucking unnecessary, but they did that.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah, but whatever. So, but again, I think Niantic's gonna fix this.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
But then here's the question. Where does the game bottom out?

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
And is this hype train gonna continue for weeks and weeks and weeks? Or is it gonna bottom out?

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
Because when Mitomo first came out, I think a lot of people were checking that out, but who's still playing Mitomo now?

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
Even I finally fell off the wagon. I kind of stopped checking Mitomo and I was doing it for a while.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Darsak, are you still playing Mitomo regularly?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Every day.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Wow. Okay. So, there's some.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Especially now that they've added more level, levels now.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So, I'm having a good time with it.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
Okay. Well, that's fair. But it still would be fair to say there's not as many people playing Mitomo as there were in the beginning, certainly.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
So, I mean, Pokemon Go is gonna have a bottom at some point.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I think, like, you know, kind of just going back.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Or is it? Maybe it won't.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I think some of the things that would help or some of the things they have in, like, Ingress.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
Like, granted, I think the attacking, you know, and stuff, they're not gonna ever implement anything like that.

19:29.000 --> 19:38.000
But the missions are kind of cool, you know, where you go and visit locations and, you know, maybe, you know, visit the PokeStops or something like that.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
They could do something like that. It would be kind of cool.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
Yeah, that'd be really cool if they took some of those missions from Ingress and put them in Pokemon where maybe you actually get a Pokemon as a reward for doing a mission.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
Or candy or stardust or something that's, you know, currency. You don't really get a lot of ways in the game right now.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
That would be pretty cool, I think.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
I think that would help. I mean, I don't know.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
Really, I know one of the things they're probably gonna add is just more Pokemon. I mean, they're gonna keep adding stuff to it eventually.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
So it's never gonna run out, but, like, after a while, it's just gonna be like, eh, you know, where do I go to get these Pokemon?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I mean, it doesn't seem there's any rhyme or reason to some of them.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
Well, we'll see. I don't know. I'm not quite as pessimistic as Loki.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
I don't think you're gonna have the fever around it that we have right now, at least this week.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
But I think in about a month's time, I think people will still be playing it.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
You know, people might say, oh, once a week we're gonna go out and hunt Pokemon together. Like, it might become a thing for some people.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Thank God there's no fucking Sojourner equivalent in this game.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
But I think for the most part, it's gonna, I think it'll still be a thing.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
And I think, you know what's funny? Go listen to the very first show that was put out this year.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
Not to swell my ego too much, but, you know, once in a while I have to pat myself on the back.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
We did our predictions for the year, and I said on that show, I said Pokemon Go is gonna be the biggest mobile phone game of all time.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
And if what we're seeing this week is any indication, absolutely right on that call.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
It's way too early for that.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Bigger than Candy Crush? Bigger than Draw Something? Absolutely.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
No, I think it's gonna just fizz out in a couple weeks.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
Can't wait to see where we're at six months from now, where they're adding Gen 3 or 4 Pokemon into the game and people are still-

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
Make it more interesting. Like, I don't know. I just, I understand that, yes, Niantic will add updates and stuff.

21:27.000 --> 21:37.000
But, dude, like, the way the app has been released so far is, it just like, network issues aside, it is just fucking broken.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Like, why is that acceptable for any publisher at all?

21:41.000 --> 21:50.000
I thought the whole reason you have this beta test was to fix the problems, not rush it out because, oh, god damn it, we need to, you know, get those people to pay for, you know.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
I was surprised it came out as soon as it did. I was thinking it wasn't gonna be till the end of the month.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Yeah, I was like, you know, when this thing ended, I'm like, dude, this thing needs time to cook.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
I mean, even by the end of July, I think it's gonna be too quick and then they're like, oh, hey, it's coming out tomorrow.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
It's like, holy shit, why? Why would you do that?

22:08.000 --> 22:15.000
You know, ActDeft does remind of an interesting point. Loki, you have to keep in mind, Pokemon Go hasn't gotten an official international release.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah, and you-

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Not all people in the world have it.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
You know why? Because they're like, holy shit, this shit is fucking broken and that's why they, like, stop their-

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So, we're all beta testing it here in the States.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah, we're beta test number two, I guess.

22:27.000 --> 22:42.000
Huh, interesting. Well, we'll see what develops. I still think this game is here to stay, but I do agree that it's got a lot of broken stuff, but I think Niantic's track record shows they're gonna evolve it, lol.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
The game will continue and I think there will be more of a game in there pretty soon for people to use their caught Pokemon.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
We'll see. We'll see what develops with this.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
Again, if you guys want to chat along with the show, live.vognetwork.com and we'll take your calls later.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm sure some of you want to talk about Pokemon Go later on. We'll take your calls.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, but-

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Well, I also did have the event for next week.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Sure.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
It's gonna say what it was.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah, go ahead. I wanted to finish a thought on Pokemon Go, but-

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Oh, sorry.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
No, that's okay. Go ahead.

23:14.000 --> 23:28.000
It's a game merge that it's gonna be held in our Sacramento area and it's produced by IDGA Sacramento and Women Who Code Sacramento, so that's awesome.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
And you're gonna be at that?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
I'm gonna be a judge.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Meet Dark Sakura.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Make your game not suck.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Awesome.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I'm a strict judge.

23:36.000 --> 23:49.000
What was the other thing I was gonna say about Pokemon Go? Oh, this is the other thing. One last thought on that is that, you know, I still think the social phenomenon that's going on with this game is not to be ignored and it's huge.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
I mean, everybody's talking about this game that has a remote interest in video games.

23:55.000 --> 24:13.000
It's going to- and the reason why I say gaming is forever changed this week, and even though Loki kind of laughs at that because the game's a little bit broken, you know every other company out there, especially ones that make mobile games and shitty ones at that, are looking at how do we make the next Pokemon Go?

24:13.000 --> 24:20.000
And there's gonna be so many knockoffs of this game coming your way real soon. Real soon.

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
And I'm not even talking about the obvious stuff, like I'm sure there's a lot of people going, oh, LOL, there could be a Digimon game or-

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I would quit Pokemon Go for a Digimon game.

24:29.000 --> 24:39.000
Or whatever other Mon games are out there, but I think, you know, any successful cell phone game is usually followed by clones. Look at what fucking happened to Flappy Bird.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Ooh, we're gonna catch some Skylanders soon?

24:41.000 --> 24:49.000
Yep, yep. You know every other company is looking at this going, why didn't we fucking think of that? So-

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
Because you're fucking dumb, because Ingress has been out for three years, you stupid idiots!

24:53.000 --> 25:03.000
Well, but, you know, again, without sounding too hipster grandpa-y, Ingress players built that network that Niantic is profiting off of big time.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
Yeah, prof for my fucking paycheck, where's my fucking paycheck?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
You get paid in bursters.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
No I'm not.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I don't take payment in bursters.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, Final Fantasy Go. Dardichia says, Puzzle and Dragons Go. Fifth Dream says, I would battle flans everywhere.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
Stoppy says, Oregon Trail Go. You could actually go down the Oregon Trail.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I don't know if I want to go down the Oregon Trail.

25:35.000 --> 25:43.000
Let's see, Kaijuto says, Pokemon Go is a ripoff of Invisimals for the PSP and Vita, so it's been ripped off already. Oh, interesting.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Yeah, but Invisimals is crap.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
AgDef says, Your paycheck is with every Oculus Rift backers check for selling to Facebook.

25:54.000 --> 26:02.000
Alright, we'll see what develops with Pokemon Go in the coming weeks. I kind of think- I'm interested to see the news stories.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.000
I did like the funny, you know, because people are making funny photoshops and stuff like that, so Dark Souls Go.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
That's really funny.

26:12.000 --> 26:22.000
I like- well, I don't like, but I think it's interesting that there's all this stuff in the media. Like, you know, a girl finds body by the river because she was trying to look for a Pikachu or whatever it was.

26:22.000 --> 26:33.000
So there's that. There's the whole unfortunate story about people are using the lure on the Pokestops to actually lure people out of their houses to rob them while the Pokemon lure is going.

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm like, that's kind of- that's actually really clever, even though it's really fucked up.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Yeah, you can't catch your wallet.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
So, don't steal things, assholes. It's not nice.

26:44.000 --> 26:55.000
Alright, we're going to get to the rest of our show, but of course every week we like to start off with a little bit of how was your gaming week, and what other games have you been playing this week besides Pokemon Go?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
If anything, Dark Sakura.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Other than Pokemon Go? Well, some Ingress.

27:06.000 --> 27:18.000
Oh yeah, Sims 4. I'm building houses. I'm going to fill a whole town full of nothing but pretty Sims that I make, and that's kind of it right now.

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
Alright. Yeah, Pokemon Go took up a lot of my week too, so I didn't end up playing an awful, awful lot, but let's check in with Loki first.

27:27.000 --> 27:34.000
You know, with Konami in mobile games, maybe we can see, you know, like, a mobile game from them, like Pokemon Go.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Oh, P.T. Go.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
P.T. Go. Silent Hills Go.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
That'd be fun.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
That'd be cool.

27:41.000 --> 27:55.000
You know, I have a problem. I really do have a problem. That problem is with clicker game addiction, and unfortunately I have played way too much fucking Tap my Katamari.

27:56.000 --> 28:04.000
Fuck you for bringing that into my life, by the way. Fuck you. Fuck you a hundred times or something hard and sandpapery because I can't stop playing that game either.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
I hate you.

28:05.000 --> 28:12.000
It's a good time sink because Pokemon Go wasn't fucking working, so I couldn't play it from my house like I used to, but, um, yes.

28:12.000 --> 28:20.000
It's just like, it's got that where you set yourself like a goal, okay, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna level this up a little bit.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Oh, wait, I got some more money.

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
Okay, well, I got to spend that money because, I mean, you know, you want to have the most cousins rolling while you're not playing, and then you get more money.

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh, well, I got to spend that money too, and it just fucking goes forever, and it never stops.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
I'm still playing it because it's entertaining, so whatever, you know, it's fine.

28:41.000 --> 28:50.000
And then, yeah, I played a little bit of Ingress because that's required, and a little bit of Pokemon Go just because, you know, it's kind of sucks.

28:50.000 --> 29:01.000
I actually leveled myself to, well, I leveled to five. I had leveled to four before on another, so I had an account through Pokemon Club, and their servers are fucked, so I was like, fuck this.

29:01.000 --> 29:13.000
I could wait until this, you know, gets fixed, which could be forever, or I'll just create one through Google Play, which, you know, my Google account is usually easier to log into, so I did that.

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
I created another account, and I thought, oh shit, you know, now I'm gonna have to come up with a new username and all that.

29:19.000 --> 29:25.000
Nope, it fucking let me have the same username, so I don't know how that's possible, but whatever.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
So yeah, so I created a new account, leveled it up to five, so now I have one that's four and one that's five.

29:32.000 --> 29:39.000
The four probably never get played again, but I'm surprised it let me do that, and yeah.

29:40.000 --> 29:47.000
I have no intention to spend any money in this game whatsoever because those prices in that fucking store are fucking ridiculous.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Oh, but let's put that $99 option out there.

29:50.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah, but every game has an obscene, you know, money to spend cost thing in it, you know.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Like Tap My Katamari, doesn't that have like a $75 candy bin or something?

30:01.000 --> 30:11.000
Yes, but, I mean, if you're willing to watch the ads, which I did, and actually I'd like to get on a tangent about that too, since I do play a lot of it, so I watch a lot of the ads.

30:11.000 --> 30:18.000
Or I shouldn't say I watch a lot of the ads, I actually take a break from looking at the screen for about 30 seconds while those ads are playing, but I did actually see a lot of them.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
And holy shit, do all the mobile games that are on those ads, like all the fucking same.

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
And there's like some shit I'm like, what the fuck kind of game? Do people actually play this shit?

30:30.000 --> 30:43.000
Like they had some Willy Wonka slot machine thing, which it's kind of cool that it was the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka, so not the Johnny Depp one, but what the hell?

30:43.000 --> 30:51.000
I mean, there's like some weird lotto shit on there, you know, people are getting pissed off at Counter Strike gambling and shit, and then they've got all this lottery shit on there.

30:51.000 --> 30:58.000
I don't know. A lot of really crappy games on there. And then fucking Angry Birds has like a fucking Bust-A-Move game now.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
So, I don't know, that's weird. But yeah, I'm not going to play any of those games either, so.

31:04.000 --> 31:13.000
But I'll take the free candy, and you know, they dole it out so often that it doesn't really matter, you don't need to pay real money to get that stuff.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
That's it.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Alright, before I get to my gaming week, I have an important announcement for Dark Sakura.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Uh oh.

31:21.000 --> 31:31.000
That Raichu's back, and it's showing three feet somewhere from the ice. You're going to have to go to the park to find it or something, it's showing, it's a ways away, but it's in the radar.

31:32.000 --> 31:41.000
Dark Sakura may leave the show. For the first time ever, Dark Sakura may leave the show, right in the middle of it, to go find her fucking Raichu.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
Don't even try me, I am, uh, fuck.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Would you really be mad?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Dude, like seriously, like, since we started-

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
You're really leaving to go get the fucking Raichu. She's gone. She's going.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
You know, since we started this show, that gym has changed colors twice already.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Yeah, I know, I know, it's crazy.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
I am doing the right thing. I put down the phone.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
Dark Sakura changed her mind, she will not be hunting the Raichu right now. Alright.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
It better be there tonight.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Ah, tangled!

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Oh cool, I'm almost level six.

32:15.000 --> 32:27.000
Alright, anyway, um, so unlike Loki, I may have spent twenty dollars on Pokemon Go, and I may be level eleven already, which is really nothing compared to most people right now in that game.

32:27.000 --> 32:34.000
Like, I couldn't really play the damn game for the first two days, so it wasn't really until this weekend when I was able to really start playing, so-

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Yeah, I think the leveling must be-

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Oh, it's completely different than it was in the beta. It's much faster.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
Yeah, the beta, that's probably why I only got the level, the level seven or whatever, I don't know what the equivalent was.

32:43.000 --> 32:50.000
Well, in the beta, they gave you great balls at level two, ultra balls at level three, and all that stuff, right? Great balls are at level twelve now.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
So, they definitely changed-

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
But everything seems a lot easier to catch, so that's kinda nice.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
That's true too.

32:56.000 --> 33:10.000
It's none of that, oh hey rat, hey, let's uh, hey Pidgey, how about you jump out of that fuckin' ball like eighty times, oh hey, or like, you know, you throw like a master ball at it or something, and it's like, yeah, fuck you, I'm just gonna jump out of this anyways, even though you got a nice throw and all that.

33:11.000 --> 33:17.000
So, yeah, it seems like some balancing and tweaking has happened there.

33:17.000 --> 33:27.000
As far as other games I've been playing this week that aren't Pokemon GO, I've been playing Pokemon 3DS, actually. I'm continuing my quest in Alpha Sapphire.

33:27.000 --> 33:37.000
I have definitely progressed more in that game than any other Pokemon game that I've played, save for maybe Pokemon Yellow, so at least in a very long time, so there is that.

33:37.000 --> 33:45.000
Other ways, when it comes to like console stuff, I played a little bit more Grand Theft Auto, but not a lot, and then some other random console stuff, but nothing really new.

33:45.000 --> 33:55.000
I didn't really get into any other new games this week, so same thing with PC, I played a few matches of Overwatch, Alan's been really into the ranked mode thing.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
I am still not level twenty-five, cause I can't binge play that game the way other people do.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
I play a match or two, and I'm like, okay, I'm good, I'm done, I don't need to, I need to play a ton more.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
But, you know, Overwatch is still a thing that I'm playing a couple times a week, even if just for a little bit.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
So, that's really it for my gaming week.

34:14.000 --> 34:23.000
So for housekeeping, since Darsakha got her plug-in, I don't really have a lot else left, just a reminder we won't be here Labor Day weekend, but that's still a good six weeks away.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
So, that's that.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
All that being said, let's get into some other gaming news.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Things happened in the gaming industry that wasn't just Pokemon this week.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So, let's get into it. Loki.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Alright. Man, I'm full.

34:43.000 --> 34:50.000
Anyways, so Blizzard is going after some creators of some Overwatch cheats.

34:50.000 --> 35:01.000
So they have a cheat program that basically you pay a subscription to this company, and they give you special abilities, like the ability to see people on the map.

35:02.000 --> 35:09.000
Different, I guess, aside from map hacks and stuff.

35:09.000 --> 35:17.000
I don't know, but they were charging $1450 a month, so now they're going after the actual company that's making that.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
And they kind of did something similar, I think, with their MOBA game as well.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
I think they had something like that, some other cheating thing.

35:28.000 --> 35:39.000
But the suit, basically they're using the DMCA, you know, as the reason for the case since, you know, obviously they had to reverse engineer something to get it to work.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
But yeah. Cheaters suck.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
And basically they're gonna, you know, ban people that are caught using this.

35:48.000 --> 35:56.000
The interesting thing is, though, that the company, I think I was reading about it, maybe on another site, says that there's nothing Blizzard can do.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
Because they're in Germany or something, and so they're not subject to the laws here.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
So Blizzard can basically go suck it, is what the cheating company is saying.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
And I agree, cheaters suck, and Blizzard needs to put the ban hammer on people that are using this software, but, you know.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
I don't know if that works if they're doing business, though, in the United States.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
Yeah, I mean, again, that's just what they say, is that they're immune.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
That doesn't mean they really are, because you're right, if they're selling it in the United States, then they're kind of...

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
And plus, Blizzard also has a presence overseas.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
They also had a bot for Diablo, was the other thing, Diablo 3.

36:30.000 --> 36:40.000
They had a bot, and apparently they had the company that made that actually won against Blizzard in Europe in 2013 for their honor bot.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Really?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
For honor buddy bot.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
I seem to remember that came up on the show a while ago, so I kind of wonder if that sets a precedent.

36:48.000 --> 36:54.000
And they also had a storm buddy heroes, or storm buddy bot that was for Heroes of the Storm.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And they, I guess, won against them as well.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
Well, hey, shit, if you've won twice against Blizzard so far, I guess it wouldn't be a stretch that you win a third time.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
Alright, but don't let Blizzard catch you using that software, they're probably gonna ban you.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
So, enjoy that.

37:07.000 --> 37:14.000
Let's talk about something a little more positive, and something that's awesome, and that is breaking games legitimately.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
And something that was on full display this past week.

37:17.000 --> 37:26.000
We talked about it a little bit on last week's show, but Summer Games Done Quick happened during this past week, and it officially ended yesterday.

37:26.000 --> 37:39.000
Grand total, $1,295,326 raised for charity, which was the Doctors Without Borders charity, I think based in France.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Because it had a different name.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Medicines Sans Frontieres.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
That's it, thank you very much.

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
And, just in case you were wondering, Kill the Animals did end up winning for Super Metroid for this year's speedrun.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
So, they died.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
But don't worry, they're only pixels, and they do come back in one of the later games.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Metroid Fusion.

37:56.000 --> 38:09.000
Also, let's see, they did announce the dates for the next awesome games done quick, which will be January 8th of 2017 through January 15th of 2017.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Did you guys watch any of the Summer Games, er, yeah, Summer Games Done Quick? What did you guys think?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Cool like it always is.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Pepsi Man!

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
Everybody's talking about this Pepsi Man thing. I didn't see it.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
You guys were watching it.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
It's pretty funny.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
Yeah? Is it like one of those games that's so bad it's good type of thing?

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
Yeah, it was a game that came out in Japan on PlayStation 1, I want to say.

38:31.000 --> 38:41.000
And, it was all in English. They had like Japanese text on the bottom, but it was all voice acted in English, and they had these really terrible cutscenes, like full motion video cutscenes.

38:41.000 --> 38:50.000
With some like, redneck looking guy just drinking Pepsi and talking about Pepsi, and it was stupid. It had nothing to do with the game.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Huh. Interesting.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
And the game itself is just weird.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
I'll have to see it on YouTube.

38:54.000 --> 39:00.000
It's like, you run and run and you avoid obstacles. It's kind of Paperboy-like. Except you just run.

39:01.000 --> 39:11.000
I did watch the one I watched the biggest chunk of. We actually, yesterday after our Pokemon run downtown, we came back here to cool off for a little bit. We were watching Summer Games done quick.

39:11.000 --> 39:19.000
I saw a little bit of the Pokemon Red run that they were doing. I saw just the very beginning of that, and I thought that was interesting.

39:19.000 --> 39:28.000
Because, you know, I didn't realize you could beat so many Pokemon without really leveling anything. I kind of thought that was something you had to do, but they sure knew their way around that.

39:29.000 --> 39:36.000
But then I also watched quite a bit, probably a good hour, of the Final Fantasy 6 speedrun that they were doing yesterday.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
And so that was pretty cool to see, because they have to bug out the game in some places.

39:40.000 --> 39:47.000
So like, Locke ends up wearing the merchant outfit that he steals for like, a good chunk of the game.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
And there's just other interesting little ways that they kind of...

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
That'd be kind of cool to watch.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, there's other ways that they kind of break that game that I thought were really interesting.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
I was looking for, like, I heard they had some pretty cool stuff with Taskbot this year again.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
But I was trying to search, because I normally watch it just through the archives, because I never catch it when it's on.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
But, you know, I wanted to watch what they did this year with Taskbot.

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
Yeah, actually I'm hearing a lot about how Tetris the Grandmaster getting a lot of props for that.

40:15.000 --> 40:21.000
And of course, you know, I know one of the guys who used to listen to OLR a bit is now really heavily involved with that.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
So that's pretty cool how that all runs around.

40:23.000 --> 40:31.000
A lot of folks... I didn't see this, but I certainly saw the response on Twitter and Facebook and so forth.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
SHO 100 Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
The moment where the disabled gamer completed that indie game one-handed.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
He gave a really emotional speech after doing an amazing job on his run.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
I didn't see it, so it's hard for me to comment on, but I'm gonna have to find that.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Because a lot of folks on Twitter were saying the same thing.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
I guess donated during that and they had called it out or something.

40:52.000 --> 40:57.000
Oh, did he? Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. I heard he donated, but I didn't realize it was during that. That's awesome.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
It was some of the Super Mario RPG stuff was pretty cool, too.

41:02.000 --> 41:09.000
So getting the 12 flowers in the Bowser chase or the... what was the guy's name?

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
I can never remember the bad guy who kidnapped Peach right at the beginning.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
Bust Boomer? Buster? Anyway, chasing him down.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
And someone accurately predicted out loud like how many flowers would get there in that chase. It was pretty fun.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
It was neat. Yeah, those guys really know that game inside and out.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Or those games, anything they're speedrunning, they know them inside and out.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
So it was pretty cool to see. So big props to everyone involved with that.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
And we'll be talking about it again in six months when it's time for awesome games done quick.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
Fingers crossed for our buddy Flocko and his submission for P.T.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
I think he said he's going to try it every time until he gets in, so we'll see what happens.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
Meanwhile, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

41:49.000 --> 41:57.000
Well, we have hit a year anniversary since Iwata passed away.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
I always hate the term passed away. I just prefer died.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
Because why should you lessen the impact of something like that that happens?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
You know? But that's me.

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
Anyway, it has been a year as of...

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
Well, it's already July 11th in Japan, I believe.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
So it's been a year over there since everything went down.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
And it just makes me wonder, what do you think about Nintendo now?

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Kind of the direction it's going in.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
Or even just seeing Pokemon go, I mean.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
Yeah, right. Actually, that was an interesting tweet I saw yesterday.

42:38.000 --> 42:47.000
Not to be too much of a downer, but it's a real bummer that Iwata can't see the cultural impact that Pokemon Go is having right now.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
But in a way, even though it's a really sad thing to say, in a way it's also kind of uplifting.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
It's like, oh, but he knew that that was going to happen.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
And he'd probably be really thrilled that people are responding to it the way that they are.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
So in a way, it's actually a little bit uplifting, I think.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I've had them look forward to it.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
Yes. But I wonder how he'd feel about the NX delay.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
I think that ended up happening a little later.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Then that one would be, it can't be helped.

43:15.000 --> 43:23.000
I think there's a lot of people definitely still thinking about Iwata and just the impact that he's had on gaming that's going to be felt for a very, very long time.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
It's very similar to when Steve Jobs passed for Apple.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
The last product that he had worked on didn't come out for several years until after.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
So again, not to be a downer, but these things happen.

43:39.000 --> 43:50.000
So it's going to be several years before Iwata's presence on the gaming industry truly fades and moves into a newer generation of Nintendo.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
But anyway, a moment to tip our hats and remember Satoru Iwata one year later.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
Well, that being said, let's move on. Loki.

44:00.000 --> 44:07.000
All right. So this is pretty cool. Red Dead Redemption has finally made it to the Xbox One backwards compatibility.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
And that was on Friday.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
And they're actually offering it now if you're a gold member for $7.49.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
And not only with that, you will also get some of the DLC for free.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
So they've got the Myths and Mavericks bonus pack and Legends and Killers pack are free.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
So go check that out and go play it if you have it on backwards compatibility, because it's awesome.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
They even did like a thing with what was it?

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
The website that does all the like frame rate tests and stuff. Digital Foundry, I think.

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
They did a test on the frame rates and everything for the game.

44:45.000 --> 44:54.000
And actually now it's all pretty much 30 frames per second consistently and not any sort of slowdowns or anything like they had before.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
So definitely check it out.

44:57.000 --> 45:03.000
Is that maybe why it kind of took a little longer for that to come out even though the beta had released some time?

45:03.000 --> 45:09.000
Or not the beta. It kind of leaked out, remember, for like a day that Red Dead Redemption was going to be backwards compatible?

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
So they kind of were taking time to actually tweak some things and make it better?

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
Possibly. Maybe for the consistent frame rate.

45:17.000 --> 45:24.000
But pretty much a lot of the games that are on backwards compatibility end up running better than they do on their original systems.

45:24.000 --> 45:30.000
That's pretty cool though that it gives you a whole reason to go back and kind of look at it again, right?

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Yep.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Alright.

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
Kaijuto in chat says, do yourself a favor and just buy the game of the year edition for cheap and play it that way.

45:39.000 --> 45:44.000
But some of the add-ons are all included and stuff, right? With the backwards compatibility?

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
Yeah, so definitely if you can get it digitally that way, that would be a way to go.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
It's a great game. Just play it if you haven't.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
Alright, well moving on to another Nintendo game and that's Splatoon.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
And as you guys know, Splatoon is in a way winding down because the Splatfest will be ending.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
The last Splatfest is going to be on July 22nd.

46:06.000 --> 46:13.000
We already talked a little bit about that last week and there's the whole Team Cali and Marie and all that and who's going to join what team.

46:13.000 --> 46:21.000
But Nintendo did take a moment this week to just reiterate that they're not pulling support for online in Splatoon anytime soon.

46:21.000 --> 46:27.000
They have said that the quote general online experience and service will continue.

46:27.000 --> 46:33.000
So they're not ending the game or anything like that or going to pull the servers like EA would or something like that.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
The game will continue for the foreseeable future.

46:37.000 --> 46:45.000
Probably until the inevitable Splatoon 2 or Splatoon on NX or whatever it's going to be.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
Because y'all know this game is getting a sequel because pretty much everybody who played it loved it.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
So we'll see what develops with that.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
And good luck to everybody on that final Splatfest that's happening in a couple weeks.

46:56.000 --> 47:02.000
I was worried that it was happening this weekend because usually they announce it.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
You pick your teams and it kind of happens the next weekend.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
But they gave a really big lead time this time.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
So you actually have until the weekend of the 22nd to do this.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
So good luck everybody who's going to be doing that.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
Alright, moving on before we get to release dates.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Dark Sakura.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
Well I'm sure everyone knows I'm a big fan of the King of Fighters series.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
And not so much Fatal Fury but I love the characters in it.

47:27.000 --> 47:34.000
So coming out to Dead or Alive 5 is going to be Shiranui Mai.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Yes, everyone's favorite ninja lady.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
Me bouncy! Because that's what she says when she wins the match.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
That's not what she says.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
She says, me bouncy!

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
That's not what she says.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
She shows a little bounce.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
That's not what she says.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
That's what I always heard as a kid.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
She says, me bouncy.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
So, anyway.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
But, she was also my favorite character to play and not because of that.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
Because she was a badass with the flame kick and the fan throws and all that stuff.

48:04.000 --> 48:12.000
Yeah, the whole thing that I kind of hope is that they were saying like a KOF versus Dead or Alive.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
Is I'd like to see more of the King of Fighters folks in the game.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
I'd love to actually see a full versus series.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
That would be pretty awesome.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
And also Team Ninja, well let me rewind.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
She's going to be available in September.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
Team Ninja is also adding in new costumes based on some of the KOF outfits.

48:34.000 --> 48:43.000
And then this month there's also a bunch of costumes and a stage based on Shingeki no Kyojin Attack on Titan.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I watched the trailer for that.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
It was pretty badass.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I have to say it looked pretty interesting.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
So, there you go.

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the pass phrase Zoo.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
I'm getting some backup and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, I always thought me bouncy too.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
Oh good, it wasn't just my immature mind.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I did use her in Fatal Fury Special.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I think that was my favorite installment.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
Yeah, honestly Fatal Fury Special still is one of my favorite fighting games.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
She first showed up in Fatal Fury 2.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Yeah, she was first in Fatal Fury 2.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
But then of course I loved her in Capcom SNK 2 as well.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
That's one of those games we used to play at Golf Land right after DDR.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
It was Capcom SNK 2.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
Oh man, I wish they would have made a 3 to this day.

49:36.000 --> 49:41.000
I realize both companies are very different now, but that was a fighting game I'm always going to love.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
I liked when their artists did each other's characters.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
That was the best.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
Oh yeah, because SNK vs Capcom is also kind of a trip.

49:52.000 --> 49:59.000
I loved seeing the differences in the style and how awesome it was.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
It's kind of a bummer we never got Tekken X Street Fighter.

50:04.000 --> 50:10.000
I know we got Street Fighter X Tekken, but remember we were supposed to get Tekken X Street Fighter and that kind of didn't happen.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Yeah, you get Akuma.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Yeah, you get one character.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Are you satisfied?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
No, I'm not.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
Unless they're using that engine to then ultimately do Tekken X Street Fighter.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
Unless there's going to be DLC that's Tekken X Street Fighter.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
Oh, bite your tongue. Bite your tongue.

50:29.000 --> 50:39.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some things that you'll be playing a lot sooner than Tekken X Street Fighter, that's for sure.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Loki, starting in the US.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Alright, I know there's not a whole lot this week.

50:44.000 --> 50:51.000
Let's see, so starting off, we've got, oh actually quite a bit.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
So, 7th Dragon 3 code VFD on the 3DS.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
Assault Suit Lanos on PC and Playstation 4.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.000
They're doing a new Ghostbusters game that's going to be on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Kerbal Space Program on Playstation 4.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Force on Playstation Vita.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
Necropolis on PC, Mac and Linux.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Poly Bridge on PC, Mac and Linux.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
Song of the Deep on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
Tumble Stone on PC, Playstation 4 and Wii U.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
Under Night, In Birth, EXE, Late.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
These are Japanese titles, seriously, just throw random words in there.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
That's going to be coming out on PC.

51:46.000 --> 51:51.000
And a game called Video Ball on PC, Mac and Linux, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
And then, we've got some more stuff coming out a little later in the week.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Push Me, Pull You on PC, Mac and Linux.

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
Adrift on Playstation 4, which is, that's almost like I think a VR title at some point.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
But I guess it can be played without VR.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
And then we have Monster Hunter Generations on 3DS.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
And Obliteracers on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Which I love that, I love that name by the way.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
And then actually on the weekend, Tumble Stone on Xbox One.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
And then that's it.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
Alright, well traveling to Japan, it's kind of a different story with the releases.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
Because as I was looking at the calendar, I was like, wow, there's nothing.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
There's nothing on Playstation 4, there's nothing on Wii U, there's like nothing coming out in Japan.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
But then I got to the 3DS and I realized why there is nothing else coming out this week.

52:41.000 --> 52:49.000
Because out this week in Japan, Yokai Watch 3 version Sushi and version Tempura are both out.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
Yes, those are the names of the two versions. Sushi and Tempura.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I'm a big Tempura fan. I like fried fatty foods.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Team Sushi.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
So, Yokai Watch 3, Sushi and Tempura are out on the DS this week.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
I realize those games did alright here, but they're huge in Japan.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
You know, all those Splatfest names and titles, they're really just testing out subtitles for the new Pokemon games.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Perhaps.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
You're going to have Pokemon Hot Dog, Pokemon Ice Cream, and...

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Pokemon Callie and Pokemon Marie? I don't know about that.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Pokemon Autobots, Pokemon Decepticons.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
Stoppy in chat says, I'm waiting for Yokai Watch McRib.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
So, this is kind of cool, to interrupt the show.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
So, someone apparently is battling a Pokemon at the gym right now and I can actually see...

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Yeah, you can see the animation in the scanner.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Oh yeah, it's pretty cool.

53:39.000 --> 53:47.000
Yeah, when a fight is actually happening at a gym, you see like a little puff cloud of smoke and electricity and stuff coming off the gym, like there's a fight going on.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Like, you know, cartoons of cats and dogs fighting, that whole thing.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Oh, like fights in the Sims?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Gang, fight, gang, fight.

53:57.000 --> 54:06.000
Oh my gosh, it almost, like, every time you see that happening, don't you just want to run down to the park and go, nerds!

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
Even though you're totally a nerd too, like...

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Oh, it's a Nidorino.

54:12.000 --> 54:19.000
Anyhow, let's see, going back, Tigerclaw says, Skye, have any of you guys found any Pokemon at the OLR studio?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
You must have missed the very beginning of the show, Tigerclaw.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
I caught an Eevee on the table, a Caterpie in the bathroom, and I just caught a Nidorino.

54:27.000 --> 54:42.000
I did catch, I want to say I did catch a water Pokemon in a gutter, apparently, because I was on a walking trail, and there was like some drain runoff that was right there, and I guess there was like a seal bathing in the drain runoff.

54:43.000 --> 54:50.000
I got a Staryu, whatever those things are, I got one of those today at a winery. Those are the water types I can go for.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
I just got a Pidgey on my computer.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Congrats.

54:54.000 --> 55:05.000
Alright, let's see, Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I wonder if Loki is going to run out and go, what are you doing? There isn't fun! This isn't a game yet! Stop it!

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
He very well might. Don't tempt him.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
There's a Flareon up there now.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
Loki, what do you got for us first, while I catch this Nidorino, which is very important because I don't have this in my Pokedex yet.

55:26.000 --> 55:37.000
I like the people's names, though, that are on that gem. Sarah's Got Balls, Lifted Ideas, and Ricky the Prowler. If that doesn't sound like a pedophile name, I don't know what will.

55:38.000 --> 55:46.000
I love some of the Pokemon names. Like, I'm sure a lot of you have seen that story about the Pidgey that was on the White House that's called Murica, right?

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
And then somebody put a...

55:50.000 --> 55:57.000
Can you see the Pokemon names? Because I had, like before in the beta, I had a... was it a Raticate that was Donald Trump?

55:58.000 --> 56:04.000
On the gems you can. Yeah, and somebody has a Pokemon somewhere called Fuck Trump that was on a gem. I don't remember, I just saw that floating around on Twitter.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
You saw one too. Is the Westboro Church had one?

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Yeah, that's Love is Love with the Clefairy.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Appropriate. Love it.

56:12.000 --> 56:19.000
If I got a Pikachu, I would name it after this old, like, Flash animation that was out in late 1999, and call him Fuckachu.

56:21.000 --> 56:29.000
It was this guy who turned himself into a Pokemon named Calic. It was the dumbest thing ever. I have it somewhere on a hard drive.

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
Act F'ed is correcting you in Chat Dark Soccer. It was a Clefable, not a Clefairy.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Whatever! It's one of the pink ones that I don't like.

56:39.000 --> 56:45.000
However, I will have everybody know, I accomplished something I couldn't ever accomplish in the beta on day one.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Did you become the very best?

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
Yes, because I caught a Pikachu, which for some reason, I fucking live in a neighborhood of Pikachus. I'm not complaining.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
But I also caught the very first day, Jigglypuff. Thank you, goodnight.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
It's the one Pokemon I wanted. I got a Jigglypuff. Jigglypuff was like the fifth Pokemon I got.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
No one can see that. Rob just pulled a Gia gun.

57:06.000 --> 57:12.000
There's a reason why we're not a video show here at Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, Loki, what's Loki got for us in the news before we wrap things up?

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
More exciting news than actual Pokemon Go.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Did I do my game releases? I didn't?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Oh, no you didn't. So we should go to the UK first.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Yeah, I guess.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Meanwhile, I will sit here and name Pokemon after drag queens.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
Oh my god, that's what we should do. We should just give them like, just make up drag names anyway.

57:31.000 --> 57:36.000
Just the same rules apply as was at, um, it was a horse game.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Oh, um, uh, Derby Owners Club.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Yeah, the same rules apply as Derby Owners Club.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Rob had Politary.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
I did, I had Politary.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Raichu is now the closest Pokemon showing on my radar.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
What? Oh, girl. I've got Incense on right now.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
We gotta get to break.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
On the 13th is Fru for Xbox One.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
And the 15th, Ghostbusters on three different systems.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
And Obliteracers, which is actually kind of a neat name.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Okay, I'm done. Loki.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Alright. So, um.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Bitch better show up.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
No more delays in the future. It is coming. No Man's Sky has gone gold.

58:15.000 --> 58:21.000
And they posted to Twitter showing, hey, look, we got this wonderful DVD, Blu-ray that we're gonna, you know, have them press.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
And, yeah, woo! So it is coming now, August 9th.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
Congratulations. You did it.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Yes.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
Oh, shit, we lost the DVD. Or the Blu-ray. No, I'm just kidding.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
It failed Sony quality check. We have to go back to it.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
So, I'm excited. I can't wait to play that.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
Yeah, it's about time. Because I've been looking forward to that game.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
It was supposed to be out for my birthday. That didn't happen.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
So, now, now I will get it in the coming weeks.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
But, but, but, but you got Mighty No. 9.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Mighty No. 2.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
I can't wait.

58:59.000 --> 59:07.000
Actually, although, if, you know, Captain Spike over at Gameboi.org, they did, which is also here on the VOG Network, they did a show on Mighty No. 9 recently.

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
And they kind of, you know, Spike said he played it and it's not bad. Like, the internet is really giving this game way too much shit.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
The internet is wrong.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
What's that?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
The internet is wrong.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Believe, imagine that. The internet is wrong.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
I just caught a vetinet on your butt.

59:24.000 --> 59:30.000
Oh, God. I imagine, at the end of the day, it's probably just not the game people expected it to be.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Well, it's probably not what the footage they showed originally was.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
I doubt it's Pepsiman bad. Like, that's probably the point.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
There's worse games than Pepsiman.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Yeah, Pepsiman. I think that was a better game than Mighty No. 9.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I think Temple Run was actually inspired by Pepsiman.

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
Well, I don't know if you guys love this game or hate this game, but you're going to have a real easy way to try this game out soon, and that is the game Evolve.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
You remember Evolve? That came out not that long ago. It was a 4v1 type of game.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Well, what's interesting about the future of Evolve is that Evolve is going to be going free to play, at least on PC.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You know, Turtle Rock, who developed the game, has said a lot of very interesting things about the game, and they even called some of the things that happened behind the game a, quote, DLC shitstorm.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So, there's going to be balance changes, UI improvements, map improvements, bug fixes, customization, and all that stuff.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
On July 7th, all that package will be free as a beta to test server loads.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:41.000
If you have previously bought the game, you are now a founder, and your content will transfer, and you're supposed to get some other type of extra gifts at some point.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Turtle Rock also saying if this is successful on PC, they are considering transferring it over to consoles as well.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So, we'll see. It's going to be interesting to see how this changes the game and what it could do to sequel potentials.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Be very curious about that, because I kind of figured this game was going to be getting a sequel, but maybe that's going to be in question now. We'll see.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Anyway, let's travel back to a time when, you know what, there wasn't, free to play games, no such thing.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000
No such thing. You would pay $40 for shit Atari 2600 games that were completely commercialized, like the Purina.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Purina Chuck Weiningen.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Okay, she went a little more recent than that.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But, anyway, every week here on the show, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you little shits, stop capturing your caterpies.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Stop capturing them and become partners with them.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And enjoy this classic game of the week.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Get chosen.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Digimon World.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I see what you did there.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Digimon World is, it was put up by Bandai on PlayStation. It released in 1999.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And it's about being a, you know, having a partner Digimon and raising them and helping save their island.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So, you start off as a person who is brought to File City on File Island by Digimon to save everybody there.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000
The Digimon were losing their memories and turning feral, and so you have to help save them.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
You have to recover their memory and return back to the city.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000
So, you raise a single Digimon from its egg form, going into all the different levels of it.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
After a while, it will start to fade with age and then turn back to an egg, so you have to raise it again.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:50.000
But as you go through the game, it's actually based on certain questions depend on if you start with Agumon or Gabumon.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000
So, it was pretty, you know, I mean the game itself, it was really a game for the fans.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
They had a crazy, crazy marketing campaign to compete with Pokemon.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Because at the time, yeah, that was around when Pokemon Red and Blue were both out.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
There was a Digimon trading card game that came out with this.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And then the game actually, the trading card game actually came out with Digimon World 2 in 2000.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It didn't get the highest rating for Famitsu. It got a 23 out of 40.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.000
But it sold well enough in the US to get a greatest hits release in a platinum range in Europe.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
But it really was just a game made for the fans.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Because you'd have to know more about, I think, the series to be able to really get the game.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And I've played through it. I actually really enjoyed it, but I was also a pretty diehard Digimon fan.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
It was really neat and it had other versions that came out.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000
There was Digimon World DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, Digimon World Data Squad, and Digimon World Championship.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Even though they weren't really official games that were in the series, they were just localized that way.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000
There was Digimon World Re-Digitized, where it came for PSP.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And then there was Digimon World Next Order that came out in 2015 for Vita.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And there was also, I was trying to find the thing on it.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
There was the Digimon V, what was it? Barcode Scanner. Do you remember that?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Where this one brand of cereal would give you the best stats ever.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
It was crazy, but I was always a bigger fan of Digimon than Pokemon, especially in terms of watching the anime.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I liked the concept better. I didn't like that they're not your little pets.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I liked that you actually teamed up with them and they could communicate with you.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I liked the whole series better.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Digimon World and I want a new Digimon game. I've been totally enjoying watching Digimon Adventure Try.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
So, there you go.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Done.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Digimon World on the PlayStation. What an appropriate selection for everything going on in the world this week, Darsakra.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
No, I love it. I love it. It's a little bit of a, hey, don't forget this one as well. Love it.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Anyhow, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, some folks are remembering some of this.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Dark Tetsuya says, oh, Barcode Battler. At least that's how I remember it.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
But the story, it was a specific brand of ramen that breed a powerful monster.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000
That was it. And to answer Act Deaf's question about if I've tried the new Digimon game on PS4, not yet.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
You should put that on your to-do list.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I should, but I've got, built 20 million other things I'm playing.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
The gamer struggle, the very big gamer struggle.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Let's see, Ragenator says, I did see some of the original Pokemon and Digimon anime series.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Admittedly, the Digimon theme was slightly catchy, but the shows themselves were, I don't know, obnoxious for lack of a better term.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
You gotta watch them in Japanese.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And I was gonna say, you didn't, your fandom was not about the US ones, you always watched the Japanese.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:35.000
No, because I, my first exposure to the Digimon was watching the Japanese one, so that's sort of what I stuck with.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I know those voices, so it's like going to watch, and Ranma and I have had this discussion.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It's like going, like when I start to watch Ranma one half, I have to watch it in Japanese because those are the voices that I know better.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You know, for people who watched it in English, they know the American voices better, so that's their preference, so.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I hear you. Alright, it's like when they change the voices. Like in Final Fantasy XIV, they changed voices in the expansion.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
It's like, wait a minute, these aren't the same people. Who are these new people doing the voices?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
One of them is dead.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Well, she died after Heavensward came out. That wasn't the reason why.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
The new expansion.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Well, the new expansion is now yet, but yes, her voice will have to change. Although her character's story kind of wrapped up, so they just may not put the character in the game anymore.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
We'll see. We'll see what they do.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Anyway, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, there's more of Orange Lounge Radio, including, yes, a FUGO Question of the Week this week.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Some rapid fire news. We'll talk about some changes to Xbox avatars that are pretty awesome.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
We'll talk a little more about Pokemon Go, because it does impact the news in some ways as well.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
We'll talk about your emails and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 649 for this July the 10th of 2016.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Our show in progress. If you missed the first part of our show, we spent some time in the beginning talking about the phenomenon that is Pokemon Go.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Just talking about the big impact that it has. Loki talked about some things he'd like to see improved, for lack of a better term.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
We are going to get into some rapid fire news in this segment as well.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Next week on our show, I didn't realize this, I guess multiples of 50 are kind of a big deal. Next week would be episode 650.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Although, I don't know, I guess we already did something for episode 600, so we just have the quiciniera to look forward to at this point.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
We need episode evil.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
That's right, episode 666 is in sight.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Yeah, I actually looked at that earlier today. That's going to fall sometime in November.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Is that accounting for Labor Day being off?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Uh, yes.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Oh, you know what? I will also be gone gamer X week, so you gotta push it back one more week.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Yeah, because we'll be gone gamer X week.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
My mom might be in town.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
A few more weeks and we can hit.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I know, I'm like, we might make Christmas.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Hopefully, Orange Launch Radio episode 666 will be visited by Satan Claus.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
We'll summon the Krampus.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Hey, you know what? My one wish, and I hope he's out there listening, for episode 666, I need him to be out there listening.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I want Travis Donovan as DJ Satan to call into episode 666, Orange Launch Radio. It's the one thing I want in life.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Make it happen.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Tweet him or something. Let him know. He has to be here.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It's time to prepare.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000
For those of you that don't know, when he had his show, Understation Live, he always closed each episode as DJ Satan.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Although, I don't know if I was supposed to give away that it was actually him, just like you're not supposed to know that I'm Mr. Spanky.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Like, we couldn't all tell.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I gave away big secrets here on Orange Launch Radio. Big secrets, my bad.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I'm going to get a hate mail tomorrow.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Alright, let's do some rapid fire news, and then of course we will get to your calls in a little bit here.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
But first, rapid fire news. Loki.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
So, here's what I love about Grand Theft Auto 5, and I really need to go back and play this.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And actually, I think this is probably going to get me to do that.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Especially Grand Theft Auto Online, because I really got out of that.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I don't know. I didn't have as much fun as I thought I would in it.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
But, there's a brand new expansion coming out called Grand Theft Auto Online, Cunning Stuns.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And what it does is it adds a bunch of new pieces to make up your own stunt tracks in the race creator.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Because I don't know if you know, Rob, that in Grand Theft Auto Online you can go in there and make your own death matches, make your own racetracks and whatnot.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.000
And one of the things that people like doing, especially in the mod community on PC, is making giant fucking ramps and all sorts of stunt races and stuff like that.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
And they actually do that in the real game as well.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:06.000
But now it's going to get ridiculous. They've got metal tubes you can race through with boost panels and fucking fan blades and all sorts of ramps and crazy shit.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Fucking can't wait. It looks awesome.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Perhaps they will have one where you can play as the badass librarian in a future expansion called Cunning Linguists.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Cunning Linguists. Yes, maybe. That'd be awesome.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I would look forward to that. DarkSakura, would you play the Cunning Linguists expansion?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
You like grammar. I'm getting an eye roll.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
There we go.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:39.000
They're also adding new supercars, sports cars, motorcycles, and stunt themed apparel. And they'll be coming out on July 12th. Just a couple more days. For free, by the way.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I like free.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And I'm sure you'll be looking forward to a wonderful... Well, at least you installed all the patches and everything and you have yours in standby. It'll automatically install it.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Nice.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:05.000
And then, on top of that, Final Fantasy VII is coming to Android for the premium price of $16. No thanks.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Can you tell me I can play Final Fantasy VII on my phone without any fucking controls? For $16, which is probably more than they charge on the Playstation Store? Oh, fucking sign me up.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I think it does have controller support. I would hope that it has controller support. But it is going to be available. Check it out. Go grab it.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
DarkSakura, can you do your story six?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Sure. Why not?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:54.000
For folks who are playing Gunvolt 2, Shovel Knight's going to be a guest boss in that game. And the trailer actually looks pretty neat, but he looks like he's going to be pretty hard to beat in that one. If you haven't seen the trailer, go check it out because it's pretty cool.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:18.000
And then, perk up at death, there is going to be a Kirby Cafe in Japan. It's going to, actually there's not really a whole bunch more information on that, but it's probably going to be really, really good food. Probably fluffy, adorable, Kirby things.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I bet it'll be like some marshmallow dishes, which actually sounds pretty disgusting to me, but other than that though.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
It's really one of those adult cafes and you know, well, it's Kirby themed. They suck, right? He sucks things with his mouth.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Loki, knock it off. Anything else about the Kirby Cafe, DarkSakura?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I'm done. Fucking done.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Hey, that System Shock remake that came up a couple of weeks ago on the show, it made its Kickstarter goal. $900,000 it actually raised. That is of course the remake of the 1994 game.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:07.000
There is still time to go in the Kickstarter though, so I guess this means stretch goals. But yeah, so the System Shock Kickstarter made it, so it's going to be coming.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:16.000
So you can follow progress on that. At Nightdive Studio on Twitter is where you can actually follow that for updates on that.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And some folks in chat are surprised to hear that. Yeah, so pretty cool.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Also, speaking of Kickstarters, there is a game called Pray for the Gods. That's P-R-E-Y.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:37.000
That was a boss climbing action survival game that I think was originally announced some time ago, but now it's like a Kickstarter.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's fucking fantastic, by the way.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Yeah, this is something I guess you've been following because I don't know much about this.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Well, I just saw someone had posted a link to it in Twitter or NeoGaf or something like that and it looks like, you know, it has a very big Shadow of the Colossus vibe to it.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Like they show the guy, he's fighting this giant bird thing and he grapples onto it with a grappling hook and he's climbing on the fur just like he would in Shadow of the Colossus.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
It looks pretty awesome.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Well, they're looking to raise $300,000, which seems a little low for something that looks this good graphically, but they do have an interesting plan.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:25.000
The plan is that they're going to launch it on PC with five bosses and then they will roll it out to like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 after the PC version.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000
So they're not going to do things that held back other games like Mighty No. 9 by trying to launch everywhere at once.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
So it seems like they've got the plan figured out.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I want to see a team of three people making it.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Oh my gosh. That's a pretty intense looking game for coming from just three people. That's pretty awesome.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Every week we ask a question and we read some of our favorite responses here on the show over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and Google Plus.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Yes, Google Plus is still a thing. Google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
You know, I end up saying that every week. Yes, Google Plus is still a thing.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:22.000
We'll actually start on Google Plus tonight if it'll load here for me on this ancient computer that we broadcast the show from as it tries to open our question of the week, which is about Pokemon Go.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:29.000
It's no secret that many gamers everywhere are suddenly staring at their phones as they collect Pokemon as Pokemon Go officially released this week.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
We want to ask you what you think about the staying power of the game.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
We don't hear too much about Miitomo anymore. Candy Crush and Draw Something, they aren't what they once were.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Do you think Pokemon Go will have staying power as a mobile title? Why or why not?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Starting with Act Def tonight who says Pokemon Go is here to stay. It has the potential to grow even further than other games and apps like Miitomo.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Hopefully Niantic solves the problems Go currently has, but I know that people will still be playing it years from now.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Philip W. answers over on Google Plus saying if they don't fix the issues and introduce some more expected features in depth for a Pokemon game, there's definitely going to be a drop off, but it'll likely remain popular.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And then we're going to check in over at Facebook where we ask the same thing at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And we got some answers here starting off tonight from Rageinator who says, I don't know, I'm not part of Pokemon Go's target audience and never cared for the franchise.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:39.000
All I'll say is this, Pokemon as a whole has a lot of staying power and a pretty good sized fan base. How long will Go last? I don't know. The best I can offer as an answer is a while.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.000
You know though honestly though Rageinator, I kind of think Pokemon Go is targeting everybody, at least based on what I see people playing it.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I mean it might seem like it's a kids thing, but because Pokemon's been around 20 years, I know so many 30-somethings who were playing it when they were younger that are like eating this up.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And I may or may not be one of them, just saying.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Fifth Dream says, I'm not sure about staying power. If they periodically add content and new generations of Pokemon, I think it could last a good while.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I'm astonished at how popular and widespread it seems to be at the moment, so it could be around a while. I'll say this, I'm considering buying a better phone so I can play it on a trip next month.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.000
William Murderface says, take whatever the staying power of Ingress is and add a multiplayer of 4 or 5 due to the theme.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Honestly, based on what I've seen, try 30 or 40 as the multiplier.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Anyway, due to the theme and mechanical differences, this assumes that they keep releasing new Pokemon and have regular events, possibly using legendary Pokemon as incentives for mass participation.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Without those, I think it's dead in a few months. With them, well, more than 5 years. With proper maintenance, this game has the potential to be around longer than all those you name combined, plus some.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:00.000
SSG100Matt says, it's too early to say one way or the other. It'll be up to Niantic to keep the game going with events, updates, and improvements as often as possible.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:13.000
As mentioned above, the attention that the game is getting is huge right now. If the game is updated often with plenty of events, then it'll last a while. Otherwise, people will get tired of catching Rattatas all day and it'll phase out by the end of the year. Niantic has their work cut out for them.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:27.000
CainIam says, it depends if they can get their servers issues worked out, and if they add other features like trading or trainer battles between people, then there's a good chance that with the occasional update to the Pokedex to add in some new Pokemon, then yeah, Go has legs.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Redertainment says, I believe Pokemon Go will have a larger and more loyal user base than Ingress because Pokemon Go is an already established property.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Also, Pokemon Go gives me an excuse to go out on walks. I mean, besides exercise and being outside and all that shit.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Degenerate Johnny says, since Pokemon has a strong established fan base, I'm going to say that it has the potential of having a very long lifespan.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Especially considering what was said during E3 when Game Freak mentioned the possibility of integrating Pokemon Go with newer Pokemon games like Sun and Moon.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I just want to address that real quick though, Degenerate Johnny. I really, really, really do not think it's going to be something like you can import your Pokemon from one game into the other.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I mean, for one, Pokemon Go is only Gen 1, but because the way you level Pokemon is so different and the game itself is different, it would just throw off the balance.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.000
You'd probably just get like, hey, you purchase this game, you get a code, hey, now it's like you unlock this.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Yeah, you're going to get items or like maybe a Pokemon that you unlock in one game or the other. I think it'll be something like that.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000
But it's not, I'm not expecting, and maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised, but I'm not expecting a deep integration.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I'm expecting perks for playing both and they're mainly cosmetic or pokey medic.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:54.000
And lastly, Mega Man X400. I've never really been sure how to pronounce my co-host from reading his fundamental, his handle online.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I think it's Mega Man X400 says, almost didn't make it in time because I was out playing Pokemon Go lol.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Wait a minute, aren't you in Canada? I thought the game didn't come out in Canada yet.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Can't you just download the APK or whatever?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Probably, probably.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Of course, if you're on iOS.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:22.000
No, there was even ways to do it on iOS. People were making accounts in foreign countries and all that stuff to get, remember it came out in New Zealand like one whole day before it was out here?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
It did, I didn't even notice.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Anyway, as for the staying power, it's Pokemon, which the original game is still going strong. The game has a lot of potential for future growth.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I have faith they will continue to invest into this game more so than Miitomo or any other mobile game.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
So there you go, those are the answers from our Facebook and Google Plus community, the Fugu Question of the Week.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Since we kind of already answered that earlier in the show, I won't ask everybody in here in the studio to do it again.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Instead, we will move on for more long form news, starting with Loki.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:04.000
So yeah, they've done an update to the Xbox One avatars, and now they have options to have wheelchairs.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Which is kind of great for gamers that might be disabled, or if you want to roll a Professor X type character, then you can go ahead and do that.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
So that's pretty cool, and that's what else they're going to be adding.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Yeah, and they have like an Xbox themed wheelchair.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:32.000
It's one of those things that you really think should have just been in there a long time ago, and then when you hear it wasn't there and they have to add it, you kind of go,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Oh, well, gee, that seems like something they should have done a long time ago, but I suppose...

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:51.000
No, I don't really think it is, because if you look at all the other places that use avatars, like hell, your Miis don't have real bodies, let alone actual wheelchairs or anything like that.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Yeah, but still, representation is awfully nice, so for those gamers...

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Yeah, it's nice that they're doing that, don't get me wrong. I think it's awesome. I just wish the Miis looked better, because they look like shit.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Alright, fair enough. I guess that's a little harder to argue with.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Okay, moving on, let's talk about Capcom and Street Fighter V.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
People are playing Street Fighter V online, but some people are playing with characters they shouldn't be playing with.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Because apparently, when the cinematic story expansion came out last week, players actually got to see Juri and Urian, who have not been released in the game yet, but they are actually in one of the story mode's chapters.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.000
So apparently, some folks went in and figured out how to tweak settings and make both these characters playable online, even though they're not out yet.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I don't know how the hell they did that, but you know what we say on this show, hackers gonna hack. If the data's there, they'll figure out how to get it on.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:57.000
So anyway, producer of Street Fighter V, Kochi Sugiyama, actually went on Twitch as part of Capcom's regular stream that they do there.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000
They actually said that they've seen the videos on how to make the characters playable in online play.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
So when you put this stuff on YouTube, how to do it, good chance is the people behind the game will actually see it too.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:19.000
So they have a good understanding of how to see who's been using them, because the technique is out there for everybody to see, they know how they're doing it and how to figure out who you are.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Don't punish the people doing it, just fix the fucking problem.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Well, they do say that anyone who they know is using the characters will be dealt with strictly.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
They also talked about a glitch that gives Ibuki some frames of invulnerability after landing from a particular type of air throw.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
They are saying that's unintended and will be patched out, but nobody will be banned over that.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Just fix the shit.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I always say like, oh you found a bug in our game and we're gonna ban you.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:59.000
It kinda blows my mind that all the data was there for them to be able to play online in the first place, but at the same time I also realized they had to get story mode out ASAP,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:08.000
because, you know, releasing Street Fighter without the single player story mode was a little, you know, they got razzed for that before, so, I don't know.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Kaijuto in chat says, what are they gonna do to them? Tiger uppercut them? They might, they just might.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Although I don't think Sagat is in Street Fighter 5, right? I don't think he's there.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I could be wrong, but I don't think so.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Anyway, DarkSagra, what do you have for us?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
A good story about Pokemon Go. A very good one.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Apparently it is having a positive effect on the player's mental health for one very big reason.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:49.000
You know why that is? They're going outside. They're being in the world. They're getting sunshine, which, I mean, sunshine, first of all, that's vitamin D.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:26:06.000
It helps give you energy and keeps you healthy, but people are actually going out and experiencing the world and interacting with other people and just walking and generally feeling better, which is having a very positive effect on their mental health.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:23.000
It's helping people who, you know, have been sort of shutting themselves off due to other, you know, mental health issues have more incentive to go out and do things and really having a very positive effect, so, good.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, in regards to being out in the sun, it also burns.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
That's true.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
You know what? Some people will turn to ash when they let the sunlight hit them.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Ash, alright. Ash, catch them.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Fuck off.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Let's see. Alan Alchemy in chat says, not like your cliched basement dweller, though I'm sure they're going outside more too.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:27:03.000
No, all jokes and that stuff aside, it's really cool. And, you know, part of why I said this is like a cultural phenomenon of sorts is that it's really cool that this is having this kind of impact on people that, you know, can really nurture positive change in people's lives.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:13.000
You know, I met a girl who said, yeah, I'm going to lose, you know, she's a bigger gal, and she said to me, she said, I'm going to lose 100 pounds and it's going to be because of this game.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:21.000
She said, I'm walking more, I'm doing this stuff. She's like, I'm so motivated to go out and catch PokÃ©mon, so I'm going to lose 100 pounds, it's going to be because of this game.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
So, we'll see.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Let's see. S2100 Matt says, I went on a hike near a waterfall this weekend and met a couple playing PokÃ©mon Go also.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Yep, they're everywhere. Brad from Pod Culture says, it does if you're a ginger. I got near a 100 watt light bulb, I get a sunburn.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I know those feels, bro. I also am a ginger, and so, yeah, I can't be out in the sun very long or I start to feel really, ugh.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
That's why you play at night.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Well, and the summer this week has been very, very tolerable, especially considering we live in Satan's Taint with temperatures sometimes.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Like, okay, we're not Arizona bad, but, love you guys in Arizona, but we're not that hot bad.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Would they be like Satan's asshole?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:12.000
It gets pretty fucking hot here, but it's actually been pretty merciful this week, so like when we went outside on Saturday it was probably only 80 degrees, so I felt fine.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000
I just wore a hat, and so, you know, I got a little pink on my neck because gingers, we don't tan, we just burn, so I got a little pink on my neck, but that's about it.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:30.000
So, alright. Fifth Dream, kind of following that up in chat, says, I would like Pokemon Go in the autumn, winter. Fuck Pokemon hunting in this heat.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Kaijuto says, I'm in New York City, my local news just ran a story on Pokemon Go. The NYPD put out a don't text and drive poster with Squirtle on it.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Yeah, I'm hearing that local, you know, and there's-

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I'm not texting, I'm fucking catching Pokemon.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I'm not texting, officer. I was throwing balls.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:57.000
You've probably seen these pictures floating around Facebook and stuff, too, of the businesses that have signs that say, you know, Pokemon is for paying customers only,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:07.000
because I guess people, to catch certain Pokemon, would go inside the store, even though, again, my ingress experience tells me that you don't need to be standing right on top of the freaking portal to capture it,

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000
unless they used four axes and you need to ultra strike it, but Jarvis, that son of a bitch, in a nutshell-

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I don't understand either, because you can, like, just, from my driving experience, if you see it on the screen, or even if you turn the screen, you can just tap that shit,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:29.000
and it's like, whoop, there it is. I mean, you don't need to, like, walk right up to it, you just tap it and, oh, hey, look, I can attack it from a mile away.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I mean, I don't understand why people are going places.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Yeah, apparently-

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Getting out of your car, what?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And people are talking about productivity, too. In fact, speaking of Travis, who I name checked earlier in the show, he posted some update where he said,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I had to tell my employees to stop playing Pokemon Go, and I was like, you're no fun, Dad!

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Because how else do you respond to Travis?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Let's see, Stoppy in chat says, police chew catches you when you text and drive.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I like that, you should do posters, Stoppy.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Alan Alchemy says, yeah, I don't get that because the range is pretty large. They should be no reason why five feet inside a business would make a difference.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
You know what's also funny? Just kind of, like, talking about the differences between Ingress and, like, Pokemon Go.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Ingress is like a game, like, you don't want people knowing that you're playing it, because you're, like, being all sneaky and stuff and doing that.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.000
And in Pokemon Go, like, everybody's just like, hey, hey, hi, hi, you know, it's like, you're just hiding your phone.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I'm not doing anything.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I don't want the other team to know.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I don't want them to know my license plate and follow me home, because that sick shit has happened in Ingress, but I won't go there.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Anyway, that's why I'm actually kind of glad Pokemon Go isn't as competitive, because competition will bring out the really gross side of some people.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And I've seen that in the other game, and it's not fun.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
It's also three teams, which has divided everybody.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Yeah, right? Well, let's be, Dark Soccer had the best meme about that whole thing, is that, you know, because we're all Team Mystic, for the record.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
We're all on the blue team, just so y'all know. But Dark Soccer, what was that meme you had?

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000
It had, like, a, I found the home bases of the other teams, and it was, like, a red and a yellow garbage can or something.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah, it was, like, a red trash can and a yellow recycle bin.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Love it. But that, look, a little smack talking is okay.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
A little smack talking is okay, but that's as far as we're gonna take it.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
You can throw shade along with those balls.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
That's right, that's right. We know how to throw a little shade with our balls here on Team Mystic.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Alright, Loki, what do you have for us before we get to the mailbag soon here?

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Speaking of Pokemon Go, Niantic has made comments regarding the whole server problem, saying that, you know, they are holding off on releasing it in other regions, because of server issues.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Now, it has launched in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, but they are holding back on other locations until they figure out what the fuck is going on with their shit.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So, yeah, they've been, the thing's been freezing, the app's been crashing, like, fucking crazy. Like, if it just goes into, like, sleep mode, it's like, oh, yeah, I'm fucked.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So, yeah, I really feel for my friends in the UK that can't get in the game yet, I feel for you guys, but I just need you to understand, we can't have you in the game right now, the servers are bad enough.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:34.000
And by the time you're in, everything will be better, and all these, you're gonna be like, what was Loki so angry about, because this game is so much better than what he was saying.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Yeah, because it's a little rough right now out there, so, you get your Pokemon soon, don't worry, you guys.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Don't worry, if you want your Pokemon fixed, you wanna get in on all that, Ingress, there's no lag in Ingress, it's free, play it, learn where all your portals are.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Yeah, spend some time in Ingress and you're gonna learn where all the stops are, because that's the one advantage us old school, you know, AR gamers have.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
We know where all that shit is.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:12.000
So, including some of the more obscure stuff, because, like, Shane was like, where are we gonna be able to find a gym that isn't taken anywhere, and I was like, there's a cemetery up in the town of El Dorado, I bet nobody's gone to.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Damn it.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Shit, I just said it on my show, god damn it. No, I'll find another.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Speaking of Ingress, I'm actually coming up on some of my portals that I've had for a while, you know, they're actually starting to tick further than my last one.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Oh, are you waiting for the other team to come on day 89 and have a party and sweep them all? Is that what you're waiting for?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I don't think they will, because it involves walking, and I don't know if they're going to, and even if they get that one, I have six more behind a fence that's not gonna open up until October, so I'm still good.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And you probably shouldn't say that here on this program, but we'll see.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And no one gives a shit.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
No one gives a shit.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I don't know, we've met some crazies, Loki, probably haven't met as many as I have.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Alright, moving on, let's, or was that it, or was there, didn't you want to say something about this whole tip?

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Yeah, I was gonna say, also, there's another tip, if you don't want to choose one of the three, start your Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Because basically, it allows you to catch one of the three, and if you don't want to pick one of them, what you can do is say, fuck y'all, I'm walking away.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I'm leaving, yes, so, in the game, it starts off, you can choose between a Charmander, a Bulbasaur, or a Squirrel.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
If you walk far enough away, they'll keep kind of following you, it'll keep reappearing.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
But eventually, Pikachu will appear, and you can choose Pikachu.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Honestly, I don't know why you would want to, because Pikachu is very common, and the other ones I haven't seen at all, so, you know, I would choose one of the other ones who gives a shit, you'll get Pikachu eventually.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Yeah, I know, I'm like, if you want a Pikachu, just come to Studio N7, because they keep spawning here.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Again, I'm not fucking complaining, we even got, apparently there's a Raichu nearby, too, so, I'm not worried about that.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
And that's gonna be mine.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Darusaka's gonna get in her car.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I love Raichu.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
All right.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I've already enlisted you for guard duty.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:09.000
What are some other little tips you guys have learned? I've noticed this is very popular clickbait on Facebook right now, is 12 things about Pokemon Go that you don't know.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
What are some tips that you guys have learned about Pokemon Go?

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Turn the AR off.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Turn the AR off.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Sometimes the AR is funny.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:28.000
It'll save your, well, that's fine, but, like, once you do it a couple times, and you're like, okay, cool, just turn it off, it makes it way easier to catch things, it also makes it, like, a lot easier to not have your battery drained to nothing.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Because this game will drain your battery to nothing really quickly.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:43.000
If you're playing in a car, just know that the GPS is fucking like this shit, because their app is just, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with it.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
But it is, oh, speaking, hey, look at that, there's a fucking Pikachu.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Surprise.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Darusaka's getting on her phone.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Don't judge me.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
But, yeah, so the, the, do you want to get a picture of Pikachu on the table and send it to the OLR Twitter?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000
It's gonna be on my, it's gonna be on my computer while I'm looking at Pokemon Go stuff.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I was gonna say, the GPS is lagged, like, I found that, like, I have to, like, I see the landmark, I'm driving past it, have to count, like, a few seconds, and then spin it, and it goes.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
So, yeah.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I would say the tip that I have for people is don't forget about the eggs, because the game doesn't say anything about the eggs.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
So, the minute you go to a Pokestop and you see that you hack a little Yoshi looking egg.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Someone's put a little lure on you when your Pokestop's there.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.000
If, if it's the certain player name I've seen before, I think that person lives right across the street.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Anyway, isn't that creepy that I know that? Ingress has taught me how to be a creeper. Anyway, um.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I don't know, oh.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Don't, don't say it on air, don't say it on air.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I like the name though.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Wait, now I gotta look. Hold on, show me your phone.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Oh, no, Ashley, that's a new name.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
A peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-tew.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
A person named Wiener15.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Um.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Peek-a-pee.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Wienerdog.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Uh, what was I gonna say about, oh, the eggs.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.000
The minute you hack an egg, go into your Pokemon screen, swipe to the right, and put that egg in an incubator.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000
You can buy more incubators on the store if you want, or I think you get an incubator when you hit level 10.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
You get one in the beginning.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Yeah, you do, you do have an infinite use one in the beginning.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000
And then I got another one like at five, or five or six at five.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000
But my point is, incubate that egg, because when the egg hatches, you'll probably get a new Pokemon.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.000
But even if you get something like a Pidgey or a Rattata or something that's everywhere, you get a ton of candy.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
You get way more candy than you get when you catch them.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And that can really help in evolving and upgrading the Pokemon.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And then the other little quick tip I'd throw in there as well, don't forget to collect your defender bonus.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:56.000
And since right now it's like fucking impossible to hold gyms, I would just say the minute you control a gym, get your defender bonus.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Because you get 500 Stardust and 10, it's not a lot, but it adds up, 10 of the gold coin currency that is like the premium currency that you can spend in the store.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Not $10, 10, which I think 100 costs 99 cents, like 10 cents basically.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:21.000
But that adds up. If there's like a cluster of three gyms downtown and you can take them every day, then catch that defender bonus and get your...

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000
In the beta you could have up to 10 in the defender bonus that you claim every day.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I kind of don't think you're going to be able to hold 10 gyms, but if you want to prove me wrong and get your free dollar and Poke currency every day, you can do it.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Go for it.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000
All right. Any tips that you've come across Dark Soccer that you would want to throw out there for people?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Whip it out in the bathroom. You never know what you'll get.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Moving on. Talking about Play Anywhere. You remember when this was announced to E3 this year?

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Microsoft talked about Play Anywhere saying that every new title coming out on Xbox One will be shared between Xbox One and Windows 10.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Well, Microsoft kind of changed that a little bit this week. It's not every new title.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You see, it was every title that was at E3 by Microsoft Studios is going to be a part of this.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
But at least we have confirmed for this list.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Gears of War 4, Forza Horizon 3, ReCore, Sea of Thieves, Halo Wars 2, Scalebound, Killer Instinct Season 3, State of Decay 2, Ark Survival Evolved, Cuphead, We Happy Few, and Crackdown 3.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Those games are confirmed will be part of Play Anywhere, but not every game is necessarily confirmed.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
But those are some big ones. Forza Horizon.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Crackdown 3 and PC.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Yeah, right?

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
That could be fun.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Sounds like fun.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I'm excited.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
All right, let's take a moment to go to our mailbag.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Dark Soccer dives into the mailbag every week head first and pulls out some of our favorite emails to read here on air.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Squish, squish.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Hey OLR Crew, AZHP here.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Just wanted to chime in since you were all confused as to why Apple no longer releases things the day they announce them and why it would also be difficult to release a game console the day of an announcement.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.000
The FCC requires all devices with a wireless antenna be submitted to certification before it can be sold.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:40.000
These submissions for certification take time and are public record, meaning people can find out about unannounced products by watching the certification list.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Sorry, certification list.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.000
This is the reason why manufacturers announce the devices ahead of their release because it would be spoiled by an FCC listing otherwise.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Hope this clears things up.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Keep up the great work. You're truly AZHP.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
You know, I didn't think about the wireless thing. That's a really good FYI.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:05.000
You know, we see things about, we even have stories on this show about patent leaks and trademark names and rating board leaks.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
So all these sorts of certifications tend to leak things.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I just think, I still, you know, the wireless thing makes a lot of sense, don't get me wrong.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:20.000
But I still think it's just because of the internet, we live in a day and age where something like the Sega Saturn just ain't ever going to happen again.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
So, but you're right.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
People aren't looking for it.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:30.000
You're right. I did ask last week about, well, didn't Apple used to do that at one point and now things are delayed a little bit even though they get them out really fast?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
But that makes an awful lot of sense what AZHP says in the email.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So, cool.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Last email?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Last email.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000
It's needlessly pedantic, but I don't care for the use of 8-bit to mean blocky.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:50.000
There's no way an NES or Master System could have ever produced anything even remotely resembling Minecraft.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:57.000
And the story cutscenes of Five Nights at Freddy's reminds me of more of Atari 2600 graphics.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000
A console which I believe, despite never advertised as such, is referred to as a 4-bit system.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Come to think of it, nobody ever refers to blank bit before 8 or after 64, maybe 128.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000
What exactly does blank bit mean in this context?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
How many bits is, say, the PlayStation 4? Thanks.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I don't know a lot. I'm not as technical-minded as, say, Bobby Blackwolf or Loki or somebody.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.000
But my understanding is 8 bits is in the chip.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Every value can be a certain length and it literally means 8 bits.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:41.000
So it can be like a number between, what, 2 to the power of 8 would be a number between 0 and 256, right?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:49.000
So the words, so to speak, in the programming code are that long and that's limited in the NES, the 8-bit.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I believe the Atari 2600 is technically also an 8-bit console.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Some people call it 4-bit. It's not. It's 8-bit.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And the thing that might surprise you, PlayStation 4, you ask how many bits is that?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
And most people will refer to the generations of video game consoles to say,

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:13.000
So it's, you know, NES was 8-bit, Super Nintendo was 16-bit, then the Nintendo 64 was 64-bit,

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
and then the PlayStation 2 was 128-bit.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Actually, no. This might surprise you, but my understanding is the PlayStation 4 is also 64-bits.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It has not gone up from 64-bit.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Chips are out there that go higher, but 64-bit is kind of the standard,

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
and the analogy for this would be your Windows operating system.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
You hear a lot about 64-bit mode versus 32-bit mode, right?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
So 64 is kind of the, again, maybe somebody tech-minded,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000
because I'm giving you a really, like, what I've collected from articles I've read over the years,

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.000
but 64 is essentially as high as most mainstream things go right now.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000
In the end, it's also really irrelevant these days anyway.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000
There's no real call for it, because what people look more for is actual raw processing power

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:11.000
when it comes to a system now, so it's really just fallen into the way of irrelevancy.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Dungeonbuster, of course, our chat room jumping in here, too.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Bit in Sky's context refers to the code instruction length.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
More bits enables more complex instructions.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
That's the TLDR explanation for it.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I like TLDR explanations. I think they're easier to understand.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
So, cool.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I apologize. I think there was another question buried in that email

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000
besides just what does bit mean and what is the PlayStation 4?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
How many bits are we at now?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Was there another question in there that I missed?

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I don't think so.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I don't think so either.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.000
How many came next? We don't really use it.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Yeah, I think you can read stuff about, I think it goes as high as 512 bits,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
but I don't think anything practical out there really uses that.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
That's expensive, yo.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000
But I do understand the whole Minecraft would have never been possible on the NES.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I think it's just the graphical style.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:22.000
I think just the pop culture words that are on people's tongue for a lot of people,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
retro and 8-bit are like the same thing for a lot of people,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
even though technically that may not necessarily be true.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
That's all.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Good email, though. Good discussion.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
All right. Well, if that's it for the emails, I'll beg for some more.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And Stopby and Chat with a good point. Don't test them.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
They just got Cave Story to work on the Genesis.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
D-Makes can be a lot of fun, though.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Remember Halo 2600, anybody?

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
D-Makes can be an awful lot of fun.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
All right. Let's get to the FUs of the week, because sometimes on this show we have to get ranty.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I've got a list.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
FU to racist assholes.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000
FU to people defending murderers.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:34.000
FU to all of the weird, I guess, injuries I've amassed over the past week

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:41.000
and having to get them all taken care of over the course of this month and pain in general.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And, yeah, it's just been a shitty week ready for something, you know,

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
ready for something a little nice to happen instead.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I'm done.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I guess, just after you two not having access to my TV because my damn wife is watching stupid Grey's Anatomy all over again.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:11.000
It's also fucking distracting, because anything that's on TV, whether it be my stupid kids,

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
not to say my kids are stupid, but their stupid shows that they watch,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
or Grey's Anatomy, or just whatever is on TV.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I'm, I guess, predisposed to watch what's on TV, even if it's fucking uninteresting.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000
And I hate that, because I want to work on programming games and stuff, and my brain's like,

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Shiny! Watch TV! And it's fucking annoying.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I guess I go to the other room.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000
But then when I go to the other room, I just end up playing fucking Tap My Katamari, so that doesn't work either.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Alright, my FU of the week goes to the restaurant where we had dinner last night,

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000
because I had reservations for 7.30, but thanks to the front door person,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
I guess not really being able to effectively communicate with me,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000
she did not realize that I was telling her our whole party was here, even though she had said to me,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
it'll be just a few minutes, there's a couple tables in front of you.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Thirty minutes later, finally, one of the other gals comes out and says,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Oh, you guys weren't checked in. You guys are all here? Yes.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:19.000
And so, yeah, that was unfortunate that even with the reservation, we still ended up waiting a good 45 minutes,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000
but the food was still really, really good, and yeah.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
The manager hooked us up with some freebies, so that's always nice when they realize they screw up.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Free flan?

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.000
No, no free flan at this place. It was free appetizers.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:40.000
So, I'll take it. I like food. Otherwise, FU to the fact that I drank a lot this weekend.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I went out with Grandpa last night, that's all you need to know.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
That boy likes to drink, if you never heard Hoard House back in its heyday.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the Skype line,

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Loki.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
So this is kind of a neat little incentive, but apparently,

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Ubisoft will give you the full version of Trials of the Blood Dragon,

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
if you're very good at Trials of the Blood Dragon.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And the way you prove this is by playing the demo.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000
And if you play the demo and complete the demo with less than 15 faults,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
you get the game for free.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
And of course, it's going to be on the PC version.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000
They don't have that working yet on any other version of the game,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
but PC version, though, if you download it and complete it,

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
then you get the free version of the game.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
It's alright.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I mean, if you're a fan of Trials, you might as well try it.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.000
But I already bought it, so, you know.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
So that's it.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Alright. So you already bought it, so no freebie for you, huh?

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Well, I bought it on PlayStation 4, like when it first came out,

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
and then I tried it and it was like, okay, and I kind of got bored of it.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I'll play it again later.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000
What I need to do is buy Trackmania.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
That's what I should really do because that game is pretty fun.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Well, you know what we like to do on this show is judge Konami

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
about all the freaking pachinko machines that they make

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
because it seems like that's their only business now

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.000
is making pachinko machines of all your favorite 8-bit, ha ha,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
video game franchises such as Castlevania and Metal Gear and so on.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Well, there may be another publisher that we're going to have to start teasing pretty soon,

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
and that is Squeenix.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
That's right, Square Enix, apparently getting into the pachinko business.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:43.000
There's a leaflet going around in Japan that shows that the Star Ocean series

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000
and Lord of Vermillion are going to be the first pachinko machines that are out there.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000
I don't care, and the reason why is because they're still making games.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Fuck, if you want to make games, you want to make pachinko slot machines,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
by all means, go right ahead and do that.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
It's when you say, fuck you guys, we're not making games anymore,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
we're just going to make pachinko slot machines, and I have a problem.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Now, apparently Square Enix actually did kind of follow up some of this story

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.000
going around saying that, well, actually we're not officially entering the pachii slot business.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Let's see, in the document it was stated that Square Enix is entering the business,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
but that's not a fact.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Again, we used the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy logos without permission,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
which resulted in a misunderstanding from our company and our services,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.000
so I guess that was the company that sent out the original brochure or whatever,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000
but it does seem like Lord of Vermillion is going to end up being a machine.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I just feel like Square Enix is probably trying to distance themselves from it a little bit.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Probably what Loki says, they've still got another bread and butter here,

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000
so if they're just licensing this out to somebody else to make a machine, then whatever, right?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:55.000
It's like how they have Price is Right and Wheel of Fortune slot machines everywhere in Reno and Vegas.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Those shows are still on, right?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:03.000
All right. Well, believe it or not, that is the last story that we have on our show roll tonight.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I need to get our Skype line open. I don't even have Skype open yet. I need to get on that.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.000
But shortly here you will be able to call us at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000
We also do have the old school phone number as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Of course, my Skype is not coming up right away here. I forgot to launch it during the break, and I usually do.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Do we have any last minute stories while I get this up and running?

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000
One thing we haven't talked about, because I don't know how many people are interested or know about it,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:37.000
but apparently there is a whole Counter-Strike GO gambling scene with skins and everything.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Yeah, I heard a little bit about this.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:44.000
With that, there's a few websites that kind of facilitate that.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:54.000
One of those being CSGO Lotto, and apparently it was owned by some YouTubers who didn't make any mention that they owned it,

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:59.000
and were kind of saying, hey, look at this cool site we found, and look at all this money that we're winning off of it.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.000
And so they didn't disclose that, and they were trying to get people to go to it.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.000
They're actually the owners of the actual website, so there's that kind of drama.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:18.000
And so now, because of that, they've been kind of called out on by H3H3 and a lot of other people.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Losing trust with your viewers is really not something you want to do on YouTube.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Remember what happened with the Fine Brothers a few months ago with that whole mess about the whole Let's...

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Not Let's Play, but Kids React or whatever it was. The word React. Yeah, yeah.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Yeah, so that sucks.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Well, our Skype is up and running, and some folks have figured that out because we are getting calls here right now.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Hi, you're on Orange Hospital. Who's this?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
It's Trainer Rama. How is everyone tonight?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Great, Rama. How are you doing? How's PokÃ©mon GO going for you?

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:56.000
It's going pretty well. I'm actually considering to buy an external, you know, a protection case for my phone with a built-in battery.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Even though I already walk around with the extra battery pack and a charger.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000
I'm sorry. I'm just laughing my ass off because, again and again, here I am, that old man sitting back on the chair going,

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Yep, I was there for Ingress, and I ended up buying two external batteries.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:19.000
We got a battery big enough that Allen and I can both plug into it when we go to the Anomalies events.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000
So when you play the game nonstop for five hours, we have a battery that can charge both of us.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:29.000
So it's just so funny to hear that now all the Pogo players are like, oh, the struggle, the struggle for battery life.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Yes, I know that struggle, kid.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:40.000
See, here's the funny part. On the anime cosplay convention aspect, we've already been walking around with these big old battery packs

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
because we want to take pictures and post them all over social media, and now that everybody's jumping on getting these,

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:51.000
we're like, oh, I remember getting this, having this already at this price. I've already had this. Welcome to the club, kid.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I see. It is a different way, but yeah, I got it.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Have you picked your team yet?

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Absolutely. We are all team Mystic here in the studio.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
I'm going to see about getting y'all some patches.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Oh, that's awesome. Dark Soccer apparently knows somebody that does decals.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
He ordered them.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
That's awesome.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
He didn't make them. He ordered them.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
I'm sure they'll sell the official stuff soon. Niantic does that for Ingress.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Niantic fucked up not having that stuff already out there day one.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
The hoodies and everything.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Look, I'm having a great time with this. Friday night, I walked out of my house.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000
I'm like, okay, I'm going to do a quick 30-minute walk around the house, around the neighborhood, and come home.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:43.000
That turned into a one-hour trek, and I was running into caravans of people going out collecting PokÃ©mon.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:50.000
I'm running into little groups of 2, 3, and 4 walking around doing this. Mind you, it's 11 o'clock at night.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I was amazed by it.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
One of my Ingress people, or my Ingress hangouts, I should say.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:04.000
One of my Ingress hangouts just during the taping of the show about 30 minutes ago has posted some pictures.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:10.000
One of the gals is playing Ingress downtown in one of the parks and sent some pictures from the park.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
It's swarming with people on a Sunday night.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I'm looking in this picture. There's easily 30 people in this photograph all staring at their phones.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Then she sent a picture of what PokÃ©mon GO looks like in-game.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000
There's 5 lures going off all at the park at once, and there's just people everywhere.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Again, when I talk about the whole PokÃ©mon GO as a social phenomenon, this is it.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Even if you yourself aren't playing, just go to the park on a weeknight, or better yet, on a Saturday as the sun is setting.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Look at this, what's going on right now.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
This is why I'm saying this is a social phenomenon.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000
This is new. This is uncharted territory for gaming in a way.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Yes, I even say that as a long time ago.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Getting so many people out of their houses.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000
As a long time ago.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Can you come in and steal their shit?

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Don't be stupid when it comes to leaving your house.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I got recruited to be part of a team, Mystic Facebook group.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000
They're pointing out, you know, I'm having a meetup here, let's go do a walk.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I'm seeing a post of, this team is taking over, I need backup.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
It's just been amazing.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I'm seeing the memes, and I'm already seeing a couple of people talking like,

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
well if you're this team, we can't be friends anymore, this and that.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
I'm just like, I'm waiting for someone to come to me and give me shit for being Team Mystic.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
It doesn't matter, there's no game yet.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Yeah, the teams kind of don't matter.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
It's not even like it is in Ingress.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Like in Ingress, it's like, seriously Shane, if you roll blue in Ingress, I can't help you.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I cannot help you in this game.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
There is nothing I can do for you.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
You can't play this game when you're over at my house if you choose the team.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
But in Pokemon Go, it's like whatever, do whatever the fuck you want.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
It's not serious.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
People are taking it to that level though.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
That's sad.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
What's that?

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
People are taking it to that level and it's kind of sad.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Yeah, and I don't think Pokemon Go is ever going to be constructed to be.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I think they kind of learned some things from Ingress and some of the darker things that have happened in that game.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.000
And I think they don't want, especially a game that quote unquote is targeted for kids even though we all know it's their parents that are really playing.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000
I don't think they want something to kind of go to that level.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:26.000
But a couple quick things I wanted to mention because you mentioned that story is that I have a buddy that runs a Facebook group about, you know, Pokemon Go started one for our area.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:34.000
And there is an event for a Pokey pub crawl Friday or Saturday, I don't know, at some point during the weekend next weekend.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:41.000
There are currently 850 people who have said yes I'm going on that invite to a pub crawl.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:46.000
I just want you to know every year at PAX East they have a Pokey crawl like that Thursday night.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Oh, it's going to get interesting next year when it rolls around.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Yeah, seriously.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:57.000
And then the other funny story I have is that you know Shane Allen and I were all walking around downtown yesterday, and we came across a gym.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:05.000
And Shane goes, we should we should take this gym because it just turned yellow and it just has some really low level Pokemon on it let's get it.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:19.000
And these two people that are sitting on the curb the girl there I shouldn't say girl she was more of like probably a young 20 she looks that up up at us and says, Hey, we just took that and spent time buffing that.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And it was kind of an awkward moment, but it wasn't like serious like she was kind of like laughing. Yeah, she's kind of laughing as she said amateur move you know the if you played ingress that's right if you play ingress you know to shut the fuck up until it's time to strike.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Fucking amateurs.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
God damn it Shane didn't you learn anything from ingress.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:52.000
All joking aside it was just one of those fun funny interactions, and you know what we ended we just said you know what, let's just keep on moving we're not going to waste the time to attack this gym and we didn't we just kept on moving.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000
So, which would have never happened in ingress and ingress I would have blew it up anyway.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I was at a party last night, and like, maybe an hour into I look around, half the people are on their phones playing Pokemon go. Oh yeah, it's crazy.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Yeah, I mean the people who are not playing Pokemon go I've really got to be irritated by how popular.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:24.000
That's life you know hey, it happens. Let people have their fun as long as they're not hurting anybody over right.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Damn right. Anything else you want to share with us tonight Rama.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Quick thing I caught the whole thing about the whole Blizzard lawsuit thing, something similar is happening in the anime fandom, real story short, guy runs a convention sued a local blogger for bad press pretty much he hated the review of his conventionally suing him over that, and the lawsuit got thrown out because of jurisdiction.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:01:02.000
They actually set up shop in the guy's town, just to counter, just to refile. So knowing Blizzard if they're going to do this, go this way, they're going to probably set up like a set up shop in Germany, just so they can push ahead with this lawsuit.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Wow.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Well, you know, Blizzard's not a small company they have the resources to do something like that so we'll see.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:18.000
All right. All right, my friend I'm gonna let you go so we get some more calls, I'm sure they can hear more about this story you just referenced on anime jam session.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Yes, they will.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
All right, awesome. I'm gonna let you go buddy take care.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
All right, you too.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Yep. Bye.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype but the phones ringing ringing ringing so let's get to another call. Hi on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Hey, it's Toppy. How you guys doing?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Hey, great, Toppy. Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Hey, I just wanted to compliment Loki because he brought up that story about CSGO betting because that is huge and there is just so much bad shit that's coming out from that. I mean, I can't believe that those guys even did that on their channel.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:02:10.000
What's your perspective on all this and your take? Because I have to admit because I don't follow a lot of YouTube gaming channels and maybe that's just the old man in me which we've heard a lot from tonight and I don't know how I feel about that but the reality is because my heart's always been with podcasting, I've never kind of gone full in on following a lot of these YouTubers.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:20.000
So I kind of look at it from the outside and I kind of go, well, that does seem really shady but I didn't really see it all go down. So what's happening from your perspective?

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:30.000
From my perspective, I think that it's really a couple of guys who have gone totally out of touch with reality which seems to happen a lot with these big YouTubers and he really just wanted to take advantage of his community.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I mean, lead them to this horrible gambling site that he owns that we don't know the full story of it but some people are saying that these bets were rigged in the favor that a lot of people would lose and then these guys could just win anytime that they want.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:54.000
We don't know if that's true yet but it seems to be the case that it's leading in that direction but so far no concrete evidence. But even then, I mean, they know who their audience is.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:05.000
You could watch those videos where, you know, the infamous video where he's talking about, hey guys, I just found this new site where you could bet on these cool skins and all this other stuff and you could tell he is not talking to adults there.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:16.000
He knows that his channel is marketed towards kids and he's telling kids to go to a gambling site because it's so cool and you can make so many thousands of dollars. It's just really, really scummy stuff.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
How is that legal though? Is the site hosted not in the U.S. or something?

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Well, no, because it's with skins and the skins don't have monetary value but on Valve, on Steam, you can sell them for people to sign them on.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Loki has it right. But yeah, apparently the skins, you can kind of think of them as poker chips kind of. So they're not dealing directly with money but they are worth money.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:55.000
At least as I understand it, I didn't even know that this was a thing before it popped up in the news but you can take those skins and apparently go to another site where you can exchange it for, I think it translates almost directly into Steam credit.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:06.000
So if you have a $400 skin, you could trade it for $400 in games and then sell off the game keys and then you take a little bit of a hit on that but you could walk away with $300 right there.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.000
There's different ways that you can actually sell this or just find somebody who will pay you $400 for a skin.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Wow. Okay, so now I understand a little more of the science behind it but you said something that I think is a very, very valid point and that some of these YouTubers kind of get lost in their own fame, basically.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:38.000
And I say this a lot about people who do Twitch for a living and who do YouTube for a living and congrats. Sometimes you get very lucky in getting those breaks and so forth.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:52.000
But I always kind of say, you know, the internet gave it to you, the internet can take it away. So, you know, trust is so important with a lot of these and I think these guys are kind of hosed with this whole thing coming out and probably rightfully so it sounds like.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:05:04.000
And I don't know all the facts, but it definitely sounds like these guys are pretty hosed and you got to wonder like, you know, when you're making your living off of Twitch or YouTube, are you thinking about things like retirement?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:22.000
And the serious fact that these things don't last forever. Now, most of the people that I think are getting into Twitch and YouTube, they're probably in their low 20s anyway where, shit, the job I had in my low 20s in the beginning, I didn't really save or plan well either.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:33.000
So it's not like all hope is lost forever. But as the years go on, you know, you got to kind of wonder, are people that are getting into this, are they planning for the future and what they're going to do when it's all over?

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:47.000
You know, Dark Soccer and I love to, on this show, get on tangents about drag queens. But I bring that up for an appropriate reason because, you know, drag is very popular right now thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race and these queens that go on the show.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:06:01.000
They make a lot of money doing shows and all that stuff. But Michelle Visage, one of the judges on the show, you know, I saw, I listened to a podcast that she was on and she was kind of talking about that she tells them all the time, this will all go away someday.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Your fame will not last forever in this. You need to think about every dollar you make. You need to save 75 cents or 50 cents. You need to put money away so that you can ride this out when it's gone.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Yeah.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
So it's-

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:19.000
That drag body doesn't last forever. You don't want to be the Joe Pesci of drag queens, you know?

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
But you could be DMed them.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Now wait a minute.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Work it while you have it, baby. Work it.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I feel like that would be my calling card is that I would be the Joe Pesci of drag queens. I'm going to remember that one.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
You'd be an angry man?

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
That'll be my name.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:50.000
We always joke, like myself and my coworker, about opening a restaurant chain called Pesci's where we just act like complete assholes to people.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:07:06.000
I thought that really was a chain of restaurants somewhere like in Southern California or something where like the whole deal was to get smack talked by the staff or anything. Anyway, we digress way away from the original topic, but that's what happens here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Rama does bring us another really good point, kind of bringing it back though. All this talk is quite the reality in the cosplay community.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:24.000
And that's another community where, you know, you got folks who, you know, get a lot of business from the photo shoots and the celebrity they basically, excuse me, build up online.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
That goes with any modeling job.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Of course. You know, one day you're not going to have a six pack anymore. You're going to have a bowling ball. It happens to everybody, you know?

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
And that day could come a lot sooner than you think.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
That's right.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:48.000
And the part that really gets to me is, the part that I haven't seen anybody else bring up, is that there's no penalty for these guys on YouTube. Their channels are not at stake or anything.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:59.000
And that's what really gets to me because pretty much they committed their crimes on their channel, but they have no fear that their channel is going to be locked up or anything. That's a total point that nobody has brought up yet.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:12.000
And I actually create content on YouTube and whenever you get a content ID strike, whenever you get like that copyright notice or whatever, which I've had some and they've been wrongful and I've fought them and I won.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:20.000
But every time you get one of those, YouTube sends you the ugliest fucking letter in the world, you know, saying, you know, this is strike one, three strikes, we're going to delete all your stuff.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.000
They send you a terrible letter and this guy, it doesn't seem like he has any of those problems to worry about. They're just sending him a check.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:34.000
So that's the part that really gets me. At least on YouTube, his channel is not at risk right now and I don't think that's something that anybody else has brought up.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:44.000
YouTube is so out of control in so many ways, especially when it comes to copyright and all this stuff. I feel like I've been waiting for three years at least for the bubble to burst on YouTube with all this stuff.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:52.000
And it's just like, you know, it's just, there's not enough. I mean, I keep saying YouTube needs to moderate more. They need to moderate more. I just, I don't think they can.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:00.000
There's so much content on YouTube. It's impossible to moderate, but they kind of have to, especially some of these big money making channels.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:09.000
I think any channel that makes above X amount of dollars, a real person's got to look out once in a while to make sure they're not breaking the rules and not rely on some fucking automated system to do it.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:19.000
I would hope so. I would hope that they could just put one, one rule, one simple rule out there. If you are using your channel to commit a crime, then that's it. Your channel is gone. Zero tolerance. I would hope.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
I don't know. This guy pulls in a lot of water, I guess.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:32.000
And then YouTube gets to pocket a good portion of that money. So maybe they bend the rules. Who knows? I've been waiting for that YouTube competitor to step up. I haven't seen it yet, but who knows?

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:39.000
I mean, there's, there's been talk that Amazon's been trying something, which you kind of get the sense of with Twitch and we'll see. We'll see.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
We're gonna have to do it, Rob. RobTube. Let's get it started.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
RobTube. That sounds too similar to RedTube, but it might be okay with that.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Oh, shoot. We might be misdirecting our fans.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Then again, though, you'd probably be inviting the people like that to join your service because, you know, in the name, I mean.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000
That's right. We're going to rob you blind. Yeah. I don't have, I don't have the best name for that. I don't know.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000
TubeGo. Go is really big right now. So maybe, you know, TubeGo. Who knows?

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
PornGo. Porn.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I think we need to end this phone call and it's totally not your fault, Stoppy. I apologize.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
No problem at all.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
All right. Thanks for the call. I appreciate it, buddy.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Take it easy, guys.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
All right. You too. Bye bye.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
I mean, that would be awesome. You can catch wild porn and just by walking around to your park.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
All right. Any other last minute stories tonight, Logie?

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:37.000
No, but I do need to, I bet, you know, I keep forgetting or remembering like late Saturday each week that they're doing that PlayStation VR demo thing at Best Buy.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I need to go over there and actually do that.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
All right.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:49.000
No, this is not a story, but Kotaku, the evil K, has a headline for...

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Which, to be fair, has gotten a little better over the years once I first read the riot act at them on this program.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
But they still have some real clickbait headlines.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Like Pokemon Go could be a death sentence for a black man.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Oh, yeah. I've heard about that story. That taps into a lot of...

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
That wasn't a Kotaku story, though, was it? I don't think it was.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:20.000
It was something that was out there on Twitter, which ties into a lot of other issues that are going on in the world right now that I think some of us play video games to escape a lot of that fuckery.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:28.000
But, I mean, I would think that's not necessarily the case, considering that, you know, it seems like a ton of people are playing, so you're gonna be in a big group of people.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I'll close on this note without going too much into the controversy that's out there in the world.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:45.000
It's just the whole fact that there's some really heartwarming stories about how Pokemon Go has brought people together, and it's what the world needs right now.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:12:01.000
It's what we need right now, is to just fucking get along in our common goal of catching little creatures to do our bidding for us in fighting to the death in the honor of our arbitrarily chosen team. Isn't that right?

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Yeah.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Alright. Anyhow. Any other thoughts here at the end of the show? Any other last minute stories or anything like that? DarkSock, are you doing okay? She's ready to go catch that Raichu if it's still out there.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000
I think it's wandered off by now.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Ah, I ran away.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I didn't see it when I checked last time.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Someone else caught it.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:29.000
It seems like though it hangs out for a bit, because there was a Golem at the park yesterday, which is Geodude's fully evolved form, right?

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:36.000
And all three of us were able to catch it. Myself, Alan, and Shane. I think it stays around for a little bit so everybody has a chance and then disappears.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
So, I think they're just on a timer. I don't know.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Kaijuto in chat says, can't we all just get along and catch Pokemon? I think I agree. Let's just go catch some Pokemon.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Dungeon Buster says, I was thankful there was some summer games done quick to watch this past week. Me too, my friend. Me too.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000
That's going to bring us to a close of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000
And I want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight and participating with the show.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:12.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please consider leaving us a five star review on a place like iTunes or Google Podcast or wherever it is that you found this show.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:19.000
And tell a friend. It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if we're able to actually have those voices heard.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Let's go right into everybody's final thought. Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.000
I want Cheesecake or Pinkberry. Or both. And a Raichu.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Cheesecake flavored Pinkberry.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
And a Raichu.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000
And cooked Raichu.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:49.000
My final thought for tonight is, all the angry old man on the lawn chair stuff aside, I think it is so awesome that people are out there moving and that the community is growing and that we're meeting people.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:14:00.000
And I think, you know, again, as kind of referenced in that last little bit there, I think that's what the world needs right now is just, you know, Pokemon and just be safe out there when you're playing the game.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Don't make bad decisions in the pursuit to catch those Pokemon. Like, don't listen to Loki. Never play the game while you're driving. That's a bad idea.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:18.000
And just be safe when you're crossing the street, all that stuff. Because we don't want anybody to end up on the news and ruin Pokemon Go for all of us.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I really need to stop playing this stupid game.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Tap my Katamari?

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:34.000
If it's not one thing, it's another. So, we'll see what game takes over next week.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.000
I do know which game will take over next week because I purchased, since I don't own an Xbox One, and I already have Red Dead Redemption, so that's no big deal.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:50.000
The other game that came out this week on PlayStation 4 was the PS2 version of The Warriors.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Oh, I didn't realize that.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000
So, that is a fucking awesome game if you haven't played it yet. So, I purchased that.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Alright. We'll look forward to hearing more about that next week.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
So, have fun this week. Be safe out there catching your Pokemon and playing all the video games out there.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
For those of you in Japan, enjoy Yo-kai Watch 3 this week.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:15.000
And all the other games that are playing. Those of you continuing to play Overwatch here in the States, have fun. Don't be a jerk online.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
We'll see you in 7 days with Episode 650 here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
