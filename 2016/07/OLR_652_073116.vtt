This week excitement reaches a bursting point as a leaked copy of No Man's Sky results in a number of gameplay videos becoming available to the thirsty masses. But that's just the surface of 18 quintillion planets. Join us for plenty more news right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live for this July the 31st of 2016, episode number 652 of our show.

00:47.000 --> 01:01.000
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E. And joining me here in Studio N7 here in lovely Sacramento, California. Lovely and hot are my co-hosts. Say hello, welcome back this week, DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hi.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Hi, how are you?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
A combination of very full and sore.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Very full and sore. Did you do yoga today?

01:10.000 --> 01:26.000
No I didn't do yoga. I slept through yoga and I woke up sore and I decided that I just needed to eat. I was not going to get Chinese food until you told me you had Chinese food. And I was like, oh my god that sounds so good.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Let's hold on a minute. There's actually a difference. We had Panda Express today which isn't, I mean it's not really Chinese food.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
It's Chinese.

01:35.000 --> 01:50.000
It's America's perception. It's everything America likes about Chinese food and then kind of amplified. I mean, heaven forbid DarkSakura. It's like saying Taco Bell is Mexican food. Let's be real. Taco Bell is not Mexican food. It's something that kind of resembles Mexican food.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And that's what Panda is. It's good. But like orange chicken.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
If you want to see something hilarious, watch the BuzzFeed about Chinese people eat Panda Express.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh I bet. I bet.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
And the kids are like, this doesn't taste authentic. And the old parents are like, this is pretty good. I like this. I'm going to eat this again.

02:11.000 --> 02:23.000
No I had some. My favorite dish there is like a steak dish. It's like Angus. There's no way this is Chinese but it's really good. It's what I want. So whatever. I wanted it.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
And then I brought Cinnabon Delights.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm going to gain 500 pounds before it's time to go to Dragon Con which is one month away until I leave.

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
I can't. Well I have to go on an elimination diet for 30 days to see what is actually making me sick. So I figured I just make myself really sick anyway.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
And then remember why I'm not eating any of that so that I don't get sick.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
So this is your last kind of binge before that. So make the most of it.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Also joining us to see is every week. Say hello to tech master Loki.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Hello. Hi Loki. How are you? I'm doing good.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Hey I got some news for you.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
So on last week's show you were or maybe it was the week before you were talking about this like show you're obsessed with on Netflix Stranger Things.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh yes yes. So I watched that. I sat down on Friday to watch it. I was like oh everybody freaking raves about this show and won't shut up about it.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Loki won't shut up about it. My Twitter people. So OK I'm going to sit down and watch an episode on Friday.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
I had binged the entire thing by 12 hours later. I went to bed on Friday. I woke up Saturday and I finished it on Saturday.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
So I guess it's kind of like one of those like screw you and thank you all at the same time. No it was great. It was so good.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
The way I describe it is it is like the best Stephen King miniseries ever that Stephen King had nothing to do with.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah pretty much. Pretty accurate right. Yes. Or like Stephen King and Spielberg or something like that.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
And the soundtrack is on point. You're absolutely right. And they're going to release it too.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
I know that's awesome. They have some great like 80s songs and what's interesting is that they have like covers of 80s songs that are really good.

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
Like one of my favorite scenes I'm not going to spoil don't worry but one of my favorite scenes in the whole thing used a cover of David Bowie's Heroes by Peter Gabriel that was released in the 80s.

04:08.000 --> 04:18.000
And I thought that was really really good. Lots of great 80s references. But the thing about it and as like somebody was trying to tell me explain it to me is that it's it's really great.

04:18.000 --> 04:29.000
And the way it refers to the 80s without like shoving it down your throat like everything's very subtle and I think that's what makes the show really work is that it looks like you're watching a show that was made in 1985.

04:30.000 --> 04:41.000
But it's just oh it's high definition on Netflix and widescreen and all that. But it feels like you're just watching something that was made in 1985 except wow Winona Ryder is like 20 years older and now she's the mom instead of the daughter.

04:41.000 --> 04:54.000
And she's great and deserves an Emmy. Absolutely. She deserves an Emmy and the little girl character deserves an Emmy. They all deserve an Emmy. Just get Oprah to hand Emmys to the entire cast.

04:55.000 --> 05:10.000
I mean it's just it's interesting to see all these shows that come to like Netflix now they're just like these really great shows. I mean oh God. And even like even before that you know just like these shows coming to like Annie or you know all the you know like you're walking

05:10.000 --> 05:23.000
deads and just like all these really great series there on these cable channels. Whereas like OK like the normal like basic cable channels like what the fuck are you guys doing. I mean seriously there's nothing. No one gives a shit about your fucking sitcoms.

05:23.000 --> 05:33.000
And I know this is a video game show but I think this is important about that particular TV series too is that the plot was very much like something I would see in a scary video game.

05:33.000 --> 05:47.000
And one thing I really liked about it. You guys know that like I'm cool with scary things but I don't like gore. Like I hate those saw movies and stuff but Stranger Things was very very well done without having any gore or like over the top.

05:47.000 --> 05:57.000
But like there was just only like a couple scenes that were like but it was like it was like PG 13 at worst like it's not. Yeah I wasn't not even too bad. It was just like kind of more creepy than.

05:57.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah exactly. And it it's very obvious again I'm not going to spoil but it's very obvious. And they've even said in interviews the guys who created that who I don't think have done a lot of other stuff. I think they did like one other show that maybe was on cable somewhere.

06:11.000 --> 06:23.000
But this is like kind of their first big thing. But they've said in interviews that they were influenced by Silent Hill. And there is a very like you know again I'm not going to spoil anything but there's very obvious ties like things that I'm like oh this.

06:23.000 --> 06:36.000
Especially not to spoil anything was specially the very very end of the series. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah for sure. So anyway we will. We've got to be careful we don't want to go into spoiler territory but I'm sure a lot of you guys have been watching it anyway.

06:36.000 --> 06:47.000
And yeah I just. So yeah you think we're we're paid off by them but we're not. It really is that good. I really enjoyed it and I hope I hope they do get a second season. My hope. Oh they have a second season. Oh good.

06:47.000 --> 07:02.000
My hope was that they would go kind of the American horror story route and that the second season would have no ties to the first season. But going to be the case. Well yeah. Then in the last 20 minutes obviously they kind of leave it open for a second season.

07:02.000 --> 07:13.000
I was I was actually that was my I have two major issues with it. One of them I can't talk about because it's a total spoiler. The other is that it it didn't need to leave it open for a sequel.

07:13.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't think it was. It wasn't like you know how like some movies do it really cheesy bad how they set up for a sequel. Like it's like one of those like wink type of things. I mean it doesn't do that but it's just like I would have been totally fine if they just kind of put a bow on it and was done and then the second season was just a completely different story.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
It's also very like not plausible it's like yeah this thing just happened to me and I'm not going to tell anybody about it. I'm going to keep it a secret.

07:41.000 --> 08:00.000
Going to our chat. We do tape live of course every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network. VoG Network dot com. 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Except not this week. Bobby was out at I believe it's called Fandom Fest in Kentucky and hopefully was doing some videos there.

08:00.000 --> 08:10.000
I know he was taping with Pod Culture another show here at the Voice of Geeks Network and you'll get to hear that episode with both Pod Culture and Bobby on Monday so you stay tuned for that.

08:10.000 --> 08:21.000
But he was there so he wasn't live tonight but we're live here at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern. If you are listening to our show live you should join our chat over at live dot VoG Network dot com.

08:21.000 --> 08:37.000
SSG100Matt says breaking news. Rob will be starting a Stranger Things podcast starting Thursday. Don't tempt me. Don't tempt me because I could do it. I could do it. Isn't four enough.

08:37.000 --> 08:51.000
I technically already have one. Apparently I was unaware of this but there's a YouTube show that's like after the show or something like that with Netflix or something. They actually talk about shows that are on Netflix and it's sponsored by Netflix.

08:51.000 --> 09:07.000
Of course. Do they do wrap ups of Chelsea? I don't know. That's like the first Netflix show that isn't all at once because it actually is top time and topical so they can't you know she tapes it what three times a week so I'd be curious to see what Netflix is going to do with that format.

09:07.000 --> 09:21.000
But anyway I'm getting off track. Let's see. Other comments from chat over at live dot VoG Network dot com. Act deaf talking about Daredevil. Jessica Jones was fantastic too so and those are shows admittedly I haven't even touched but everybody raves about Jessica Jones as well.

09:21.000 --> 09:39.000
You need to read the comics and see the show and see the show because if you if you read Alias and then go watch this so that you know the differences between the two you can see where they got certain things in the show directly from the comic like whole lines.

09:39.000 --> 09:54.000
And you were a big fan of Kristin Ritter being cast as. Yeah I thought she did great. Yeah Jessica Jones. I've read Alias and the pulse like so many freakin times. She is my favorite character so I thought that she was cast well and everything.

09:54.000 --> 10:05.000
Let's see other comments from chat over at live dot VoG Network dot com. Raginator says sky doesn't like gore but sky. He works so hard advocating for the environment and he invented the Internet.

10:05.000 --> 10:16.000
Ha ha ha. Actually that was one of the that was one of Raginator's first good jokes. So I read that one on air. So good job Raginator. You get a cookie or no you get a Cinnabon delight because we have way too many of those here.

10:17.000 --> 10:32.000
I ate the last cookie. So what exactly is a Cinnabon delight. Have you not eaten it. Eat one. It is so good. Oh wait those are the ones that are like churros right. Kinda. They're even better. It tastes like donuts with like icing inside but it's a really odd texture at first.

10:32.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah. You're so picky. So picky. All right. Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and the rest of the game gaming news.

10:44.000 --> 10:57.000
So there's lots of we're finally getting back into a lot of big stories going on. And this week we have a pretty big one with No Man's Sky is probably the next big release that a lot of people are looking forward to right.

10:57.000 --> 11:14.000
No Man's Sky is going to be out August 9th. Is that right. A week from Tuesday. That's correct. So we're in the home stretch of that. And you know this was a game that for a long time here on this show I used to kind of give a hard time because remember how like they would do this presentation after presentation.

11:14.000 --> 11:28.000
There was an E3 then the PlayStation Expo and every time they would show the game it was like they were showing the exploration which looked really cool. But I was always sitting there going and the game. What's the game. What is the game element in this.

11:28.000 --> 11:45.000
Now to be fair they have since you know talked a little more about the game and there's videos and so forth. But one thing that you know kind of hasn't been out there is a lot of those like early looks or first few minutes or any of that stuff until this week.

11:45.000 --> 12:05.000
Well they have like 20 like long play sessions but it wasn't like the first section of the game. Yes. Yeah. Some portion of the game. So this week somebody to make a long story short somebody bought a copy of the game it was a leaked copy of the game somebody bought it on eBay for thirteen hundred dollars.

12:06.000 --> 12:25.000
OK that's dumb. A user on Reddit named Daimi Un bought that. Wait wait wait hold on. Did you just razz a guy for spending thirteen hundred dollars. Yes that's way too much money for a game especially it's come out one week. Didn't you buy an early copy of Motorstorm Apocalypse that came out several months earlier than the actual release.

12:25.000 --> 12:36.000
It's like wait I just didn't remember you. Thirteen hundred dollars on it either. And it was a collector's edition. And yeah. So no I would never spend thirteen hundred dollars on a game to get it one week early.

12:36.000 --> 12:50.000
I still feel a little pot and kettle going on here but that's OK. So anyway so he bought the game and it was kind of one of those things where it sounds like he didn't really originally set out on putting all this footage out there.

12:50.000 --> 13:02.000
But he would put a little bit like he put the here's the unboxing and of course the internet goes more more more. And then it was like oh I'm going to put a little more more more. So finally he put like twenty five minutes the like from the beginning of the game out there.

13:02.000 --> 13:14.000
And you know the creator of the game is not happy about it Sean Murray who is the Hello Games founder on Twitter put we've spent years filling No Man's Sky with surprises.

13:14.000 --> 13:27.000
You've spent years waiting. Please don't spoil it for yourself frowny face. To Damien's credit he did go back on Reddit in a final post and said you should just wait and experience the game first hands.

13:27.000 --> 13:38.000
The first videos I posted were perfect. They spoiled nothing. There are more spoilers than you probably realize with this game. I'm only a couple hours in barely touched a few planets and I've already had many fuck yeah moments.

13:38.000 --> 13:49.000
On the one hand I'd love to share those with you but on the other hand Sean is right why not just wait and experience them first hand. That almost makes me wonder if the whole thing was scripted but that's okay.

13:49.000 --> 14:11.000
But I'm not I don't really fault the Reddit user for doing what he did especially listening to the cries of everybody and you know people people kind of want to know what it is that they're going to buy you know because the creators of No Man's Sky and everybody they're asking people to drop sixty dollars on this game and in some ways it's a little bit of a leap of faith.

14:11.000 --> 14:23.000
Like we know a little bit about the game but we don't necessarily know as much as we do about a lot of video games when they come out. It's almost like the movie that isn't screened for critics.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
And sometimes you worry a little bit about the movie that isn't screened for critics because what does that usually mean when a movie isn't screened for critics?

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
It's Ghostbusters.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
I guess whatever. Although I think that was screened for critics to be fair but anyway.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
All the reviews are embargoed.

14:42.000 --> 15:00.000
To be fair that's totally normal and I'm sure No Man's Sky I'm sure a lot of critics in the gaming industry have played No Man's Sky and they are probably all embargoed until oh I don't know probably the weekend before the Monday before or just before when they're allowed to release their stuff.

15:00.000 --> 15:19.000
So but is anybody going to wonder about how did a leaked copy end up on eBay in the first place? That to me would be the thing I'd really be ticked off about if I were this guy from Hello Games is how did a copy of my game get on eBay for thirteen hundred dollars?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
It's so easy.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah?

15:21.000 --> 15:29.000
I mean I don't know where this copy came from but I mean stuff gets leaked out early. Shipments get sent accidentally.

15:29.000 --> 15:41.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Stoppy says getting a shady early copy is probably a great way to make your Twitch channel blow up. Maybe that's worth thirteen hundred dollars.

15:41.000 --> 15:54.000
Well actually Twitch could ban you for that. Twitch has in the user agreement that you're not supposed to play games that aren't out yet basically. Especially ones that are obtained through questionable means.

15:54.000 --> 16:05.000
Piracy and stuff like that. And they have banned users of big releases like I'm thinking like the Call of Duty's and the Modern Warfare's and those games release and you're playing them on Twitch. They've banned those users.

16:05.000 --> 16:14.000
So that actually wouldn't work. In fact these videos went on I think Daily Motion because YouTube was pulling them as fast as they were posting them.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And Daily Motion pulled them too so.

16:16.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah well eventually yeah Daily Motion pulled them too. Although I saw it on YouTube but it wasn't like it was through like a. It was like a channel from Brazil or something that probably. Maybe they either flipped the game image or did something with it so it wouldn't get picked up automatically. You know how people do that right?

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
They'll distort the image or slow it down speed it up or you know so.

16:37.000 --> 16:49.000
I don't think this one they'd be able to pull like you know just based off of like it matching it it's more of something manually matching. You know especially with it like all these people reporting on it. This is easier to report the link.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah. Well did you did you actually get to watch any of the footage?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Nope.

16:54.000 --> 17:04.000
I watched a little bit. I didn't sit and watch all 25 minutes but I kind of just pecked around the you know on the seek bar kind of looked at little portions and it looks interesting. I'm excited to try it.

17:04.000 --> 17:14.000
You know it looked like there was like kind of like some crafting type of stuff going on like he was trying to like mine the planet surface for stuff but I don't think that was really anything that we didn't already know about the game.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
No.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah so I guess I was successful in not spoiling any plot details for myself which might be the stuff they're trying to keep.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I heard it runs really nice.

17:23.000 --> 17:44.000
Yeah it seemed to look really good. To me it actually looked like once you have the interface and the UI on it it actually looks different to me than it does in a lot of those previews. I mean not in a bad way it's just like wow this game doesn't look like it did in those previews but those previews like were like UI free like there was nothing in them you know.

17:44.000 --> 17:56.000
It was just like look at the planet surface. So let's see going to chat for more comments over at live dot vog network dot com Tiger class says Yeah I think Twitch has a policy or something about closed betas.

17:56.000 --> 18:09.000
I don't think Twitch allows people streaming games that are on closed betas since those games are under NDA by the beta testers Dungeon Buster points out NBA Elite 11 was canceled and then copies somehow made it to eBay.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I might have been disgruntled developers.

18:11.000 --> 18:25.000
That was actually where they had shipped it late already. It actually had shipped and then got pulled back. Just remember the same thing happened with a little big plant. The first one it had already shipped.

18:25.000 --> 18:34.000
And then they pulled it back to release the new ones because they had that music in there or something objected to that. But I got one anyways.

18:34.000 --> 18:45.000
Well yeah a lot of people still got it anyway so especially it's hard to control what's at every stores as 200 Matt says I thought I heard somewhere that these leaked copies often come from these big box stores.

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
I would be surprised that the big box stores would have the game this early. Wouldn't they know they get FedEx the night before.

18:53.000 --> 19:02.000
No I'm not exactly sometimes they have it like the week before but typically it's not that early. Yeah this seems really early for that distributors maybe.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
Distributors don't get distributors are second classes since compared to big box stores so they're not having that early.

19:09.000 --> 19:18.000
Yes all right. Well so this doesn't change anybody's opinion on no man's sky though right. I'm still I'm totally not buying it now.

19:19.000 --> 19:33.000
Don't lie. Yes you are. Of course I actually haven't bought it yet so I have really that. Oh I mean I'm going to get digitally so OK. Yeah I just I put my Amazon thing in like month. Oh no there's not going to be enough copies of the digital version out there.

19:33.000 --> 19:42.000
Things game stuff. No doesn't that happen sometimes the digital versions sell out. I thought I saw that happening with some game not that long ago. They may have run out like steam keys or something like that.

19:42.000 --> 19:55.000
Depends where you're buying them. Yeah. All right. Let's get to our gaming weeks since no man's sky is now yet. We need to go back and talk about our gaming weeks this week and take a look at some of the video games that we've been playing this week.

19:55.000 --> 20:15.000
Dark Sakura how was your gaming week. Very semi as I pretty much only played Sims 4. Uh huh. And I've played Pokemon Go and that's really about in some pebble because pebble is like my time waster.

20:15.000 --> 20:29.000
But you always have to have that filthy casual game to fill in the gaps with time. I'm rebuilt. I'm actually completely repopulating every village in my game with all custom built houses and custom designed families.

20:29.000 --> 20:43.000
And I have like the family that has like four kids and then I've got like I've just you know just started doing it because it's a good time waster.

20:43.000 --> 20:57.000
While I can't really do a whole lot with my hand because I did have that ganglion sister removed and the sisters back. So it still hurts and I can't really play many things.

20:58.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah I remember when you had your wrist surgery some time ago you were kind of out of controller gaming for a while. You could still do some stuff but yeah I it's not really comfortable to really hold any anything actually as I just switch.

21:13.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah. Anything in my hand for very long. So well I hope the doctors get that all fixed up and resolved. You and me both.

21:22.000 --> 21:29.000
All right. Loki how was your gaming week. Same as the last few weeks unfortunately because I haven't really been able to play any console games.

21:30.000 --> 21:43.000
So I just played a little bit Pokemon Go more than I would have actually wanted to play but my son wanted to go out so we went out and played this weekend.

21:43.000 --> 21:54.000
And then right after that we went and had dinner with some friends and went right back to Sutter Street and Old Folsom.

21:54.000 --> 22:08.000
So it was like playing the entire time. I literally drained my battery to nothing. And my wife is more obsessed with the game than I am. She's 15. I'm level 20 and a half now. And my son's 12.

22:08.000 --> 22:19.000
Geez. I guess I'm not playing enough. I'm about to hit 18. I did the whole trick today where I used an egg and I evolved a bunch of stuff and that got me almost completely through level 17.

22:19.000 --> 22:30.000
That's pretty useful. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm not quite 18 yet but I'm almost there. But yeah I was trying like I don't know it's been kind of annoying because it's just been the same Pokemon over and over and over again.

22:30.000 --> 22:41.000
Although there was a Bulbasaur I saw the other day who was not even that high level. And I had this is right after I got whatever the third type of Pokeball you have.

22:41.000 --> 22:52.000
I don't know if it's a it's not mass. Is it a master ball. I remember with the third water ball ultra ball. That's right. The ultra ball. So I had the ultra ball and with even the raspberry.

22:52.000 --> 23:04.000
And he's just like he got caught in it then popped right out and like fuck you I'm leaving. Fuck you I'm out. Yeah I hate it when the little bastards break out.

23:05.000 --> 23:18.000
So why not just get work gets worse as you level up. Oh yeah. The artificial difficulty is absolutely stupid. And then it doesn't help that the game's glitched out to where you know forces curveball sometimes.

23:18.000 --> 23:29.000
I found a way to sort of fix that for myself. Like if I notice it's doing that I'll try to spin like I'm going to do a curveball and let it kind of cool down and then throw it and then normally go straight.

23:29.000 --> 23:40.000
But it's just kind of annoying that does that especially when you're using something like an ultra ball or something like oh hey I'm just going to curve for no fucking reason. It's annoying. So yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:51.000
And yes we know there's a lot of big Pokemon Go news going on right now we'll get to that in a little bit when we get it. Yes. So aside from that little bit tap my Katamari I'm a horrible cheater.

23:52.000 --> 24:10.000
What did you do now. You see I have my computer and my computer is really fast. And so I can take a script from auto it and I can link my computer basically to my phone and have the computer click the game for me.

24:11.000 --> 24:26.000
And there's really no reason to do this because there's no point to the game. So cheater cheater cheater because I can do. So you built something to click the cookies for because let's be real tap my Katamari is cookie clicker. That's all it is. So you build something to tap the cookies for you.

24:27.000 --> 24:46.000
Sort of. Yeah. Cheater at least at least something like that is a single player game. And what you do doesn't really know anybody else. But it's just oh my gosh you're such a cheater. That's kind of I don't know why I'm laughing so hard that you actually built something to click the cookies for you.

24:46.000 --> 25:09.000
Because you can still I can. That's the reason because you can. Let's see going to chat over at live dot vog network dot com. Somebody named Vote Trump in chat says damn that is some next level hacks. Perhaps this person wants you to work on somebody's campaign. I don't know what those types of next level hacks.

25:10.000 --> 25:27.000
I'm sorry that name's offensive. And then I also played Ingress just a little bit. Usually when Pokemon goes not working and also just to keep my streak going until September when I finally get that last badge. And then I'm just like ah fuck it I'll play it whenever then I'm free.

25:28.000 --> 25:39.000
In Dark Sakura it doesn't say what for. It just says vote Trump. You could vote him for biggest poopy head if you want. It just says vote. Voting is important. Maybe they're talking about the cards.

25:39.000 --> 25:48.000
Maybe it's a game. Yes it's like a Trump card. Vote it's P. Knuckle. It's a big P. Knuckle fan. That's what it is. No it's offensive.

25:49.000 --> 26:08.000
All right. Is that it for your gaming week. Yeah. I think that's basically it. All right. My gaming week. Let's see. Actually it's it's slowed down a little bit. A lot of the same stuff I've been playing like Final Fantasy 14 still checking in with that.

26:09.000 --> 26:24.000
Honestly not a whole lot of new stuff. I can't really think of anything new except Dark Sakura. You missed this chat last week so I'll bring it up again. I did fire up my good old World of Warcraft account once again and you were one of the people that was telling me I should do that.

26:24.000 --> 26:36.000
We should play. You're freaking welcome. I need to finish leveling Sakurina. I started a new priest. I started a new character. You need to play sassy pants. And well I do but I wanted to start a new character so I did.

26:36.000 --> 26:45.000
Because you know everything's changed and I feel like there's no better way to figure out the changes than to just start from scratch. You know start from level one and ramp up slowly.

26:45.000 --> 26:55.000
But I'm already level 51. So that might be why I haven't played a whole lot of other games because I've been playing an awful lot of World of Warcraft.

26:55.000 --> 27:08.000
And then I've been playing a little bit of Overwatch. Alan will sometimes make the sad puppy dog eyes because he's really into Overwatch. He's playing the ranked mode and everything and and he's like don't you want to play and I'm like no because I'm terrible at it.

27:08.000 --> 27:24.000
But once in a while he'll talk me into playing and it once I finally get in there and start playing it is fun especially if we have other friends in there playing too. You know friends equals fun and all that stuff always helps make the experience better so yeah Overwatch has been good.

27:24.000 --> 27:31.000
And I just got a text message from Shane not that long ago that I guess he finally bought Overwatch so now that somebody else I know that will be playing so that'll be good.

27:31.000 --> 27:47.000
So that's really it for my gaming week so let's get into some housekeeping for this week. Dark Sakura let's talk about this so just to get the bad news over with and rip the bandaid off.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
So Dark Sakura is going to be taking a hiatus from OLR.

27:51.000 --> 28:07.000
Yes against my will because okay I'll just put it out here like this at my job we bid for our shifts every three months and this shift bid came out while I was on leave.

28:07.000 --> 28:25.000
So I missed the bid which gave me like the world's worst schedule for me. However someone traded with me for something that won't be five in the morning except it's on Sunday.

28:25.000 --> 28:37.000
So I will be taking the occasional Sunday out early to come but other than that I'm going to be out for about three months.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
So from after Labor Day.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
I mean unless we can do like an early day something or something like that.

28:46.000 --> 28:53.000
Well we had talked about doing an early show for Loki's Kid at some point so that's something we can work in at some point.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
But for the most part we will be Dark Sakura-less from September to December.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Early December.

29:00.000 --> 29:07.000
Which which sucks but you know it's it's the job it's what you got to do to pay the bills and has to come before any of this stuff so.

29:07.000 --> 29:13.000
And I'll probably be recording some of my segments ahead of time so it's not like you're going to be void of my voice.

29:13.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah we've talked about ways to kind of fill in the gap and we'll likely be having her do the classic game of the week in advance and we'll kind of tape and this also prevents Loki from picking Halo when she's gone.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
But Halo 1 this week. Halo 2 next week.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
No because the official word is that I have to approve of something as a classic game.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
So you can say it's a classic game but if I don't approve it it's not official.

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
Did you approve of my choice last week? I don't remember what I picked. Oh I picked Summer Games from the Commodore 64. You like that?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
I approve.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Yeah you know why she's approved? It's not Halo.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
It's not Halo.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
As long as I didn't say Halo.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Hey could I pick ET on the Atari 2600 as my classic game of the week?

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Sure.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Hey could I pick the Purina Chuckwagon Chao game?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Sure.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Can I pick Yaris as the classic game?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
No.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Damn it.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Yaris and Halo. That and Yaris is too new.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Oh that's right. Is it?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Give it a couple more years.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
I don't know. Give it a couple more years. We might have to have some type of...

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
You know what you can vote for instead of Halo? The only thing that remotely sounds like it?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Oh.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Hollow Hollow because it's actually kind of tasty.

30:16.000 --> 30:25.000
To be fair you did Marathon and Marathon 2 at some point which were like the precursors to Halo. I think. You did at least one of them.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Didn't you do Halo Wars as well?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
No I've never done Halo Wars.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
No you did something in the Halo universe I remember.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
I did something that was like an early Bungie game.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Yeah well yeah Marathon.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
I thought you did something in the Halo universe but it wasn't Halo and it was kind of a finger to Loki.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Halo kitty.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Halo kitty.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
But anyway.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Someone needs to make that mod.

30:47.000 --> 30:58.000
I mean I've done Quake and I've done... I've done like a bunch of different first persons. I'm just now not doing Halo out of spite at this point.

30:58.000 --> 31:09.000
It doesn't matter how good it is. I'll do... I will do Red vs. Blue instead of Halo even though it's not a game and made with Halo assets and still not do Halo.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Except...

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
No.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
It's not old enough.

31:12.000 --> 31:21.000
They didn't have Red vs. Blue. I'm thinking there was... I thought there was like a Civil War game that was something in that sense. Was it Blue and Grey or something?

31:21.000 --> 31:29.000
Maybe. Oh yeah it's a mod or something I think. But anyway. Sorry just quick chats over at live.vognetwork.com.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
Let's see some people sympathizing with you there. Sia Tabiri says shift switches suck.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
Stoppy suggests that since we're recording these in advance edit her voice so it says Halo.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
No because I know what I said and that won't hold up in court.

31:43.000 --> 31:52.000
She's gonna check the wiki every week and if Halo pops up my phone... my phone... it's not even gonna... I won't even get the text message. My phone will just melt.

31:54.000 --> 32:03.000
I will suddenly appear in this room going Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob...

32:03.000 --> 32:10.000
It'll be like that scene in Misery where the guy wakes up and Kathy Bates is hovering over him. You dirty birdie.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Oh my god that's a parody I want to do for YouTube.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I'll have the mallet ready.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
Anyway. Sorry I love it. It's great.

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
Sia Tabiri suggests how about the Clue game for Genesis. I love that game actually. I have the cartridge for Super Nintendo which is the same thing.

32:31.000 --> 32:39.000
So you can always you can always send our Sakura your suggestions. You can tweet the matter. She may use them or she might not. Just depends.

32:39.000 --> 32:49.000
I take ideas because I mean I literally looked in the vault. I was like the fuck am I gonna pick and then I pick something that's actually in my garage.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
As if there's a difference to the listeners.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
No there's a difference. Because the vault is an air-conditioned room that I can comfortably sit in and play whatever the fuck I want.

32:59.000 --> 33:11.000
The garage is hot because this is Sacramento aka Satan's armpit. No wait armpits are humid. Satan's uh what isn't very humid on the body. Satan's foot. It's Satan's foot.

33:11.000 --> 33:22.000
It's hot. It's a convection oven of California. So in our garage we have about five pinball tables and three arcade cabinets. So I picked one of the things out there.

33:22.000 --> 33:31.000
Kaijuto suggests Spy vs. Spy. Yeah I was gonna say I know that was done on a previous episode because if if she didn't pick it I did because that was a great game.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I haven't done Raid over Moscow.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
I think I did that one week actually.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I would do that while drinking a Moscow Mule.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Check the wiki orangelaunchradio.wiki.com.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
I think I've done Time Crisis.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
Yeah there's there's a lot of games we have done believe it or not. Anyway um so.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I've done Galaxian.

33:48.000 --> 34:00.000
We will we will make do without dark soccer a few few months it's gonna be weird but you know we we made Loki's baby time work a couple years ago we'll make this work too.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
So you guys are the most important showing up here week after week and supporting the show.

34:05.000 --> 34:15.000
Of course dark soccer can never be replaced but we will try to have some fill ins some substitute teachers visit us over those few months to say hello.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
So.

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
I've done Dragon Spirit by the way because it was the Dragon Ball Z RPG or Dragon Ball RPG sorry not Dragon Ball Z that was before that.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Check the wiki before making suggestions.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Wiki.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Anyways.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Do you speak it?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Well and big thing because we don't I've never touched the wiki.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Why would I do the guy game?

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
I think Loki did the guy game.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
I think Loki did it. I approve of that before I approve of Halo.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
That sounds like something I would do. I remember that.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
But anyway.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
I will approve BMX triple X before.

34:45.000 --> 34:53.000
It was a great game I mean honestly I mean aside from just the ridiculousness of the game but it was a good BMX game.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
BMX triple X? Oh yeah.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
It was ridiculous.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Oh yeah Dragon Power whatever it's Dragon something.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Alright anyway.

35:01.000 --> 35:09.000
So again that starts after Labor Day we will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be at Dragon Con that weekend so it's going to be a little bit of a shift of sorts.

35:09.000 --> 35:18.000
At the end of August leading into September and a live Jamie-less end of the year but we'll make it work.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
We always do here at Orange Laundry.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
I'll be here at the end of the year.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Oh yeah right well yeah.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
You're hoping to be back just in time for episode 666.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah I mean I would make that happen one way or another.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
What a great return wouldn't that be appropriate for your first show back?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Yes.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Alright.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
You know what?

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
I found this wiki of all like deleted scenes and stuff from games.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Oh yeah what is it the Unseen 64 or something like that?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
No it's not Unseen 64.

35:48.000 --> 36:01.000
This is actually just a let me see if I can find the because right now I was looking at the ones for Final Fantasy 7 and yeah it's TCRF.net.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
Oh maybe that maybe I am I may be thinking of the same one I don't I can never remember the names of sites.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
There's Beta64.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Maybe maybe.

36:08.000 --> 36:26.000
Which is a video thing but it's actually just a whole bunch of stuff that I've I've done the I used to have the for a while the Japanese version of Final Fantasy 7 and these were all stuff from the debugs that I had played around with and I couldn't read very well so just kind of neat.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
I would love to see director's cuts of these games with these deleted scenes and everything.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Wouldn't it be awesome?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah for sure.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
I did want to give a shout out.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Although I'm glad that bitch Aerith is dead.

36:36.000 --> 36:54.000
I did want to give a shout out by the way real quick to the people that do edit the wiki for Orange Knowledge Radio because I never touch it but all of us hosts it's very meta because all of us hosts have actually used the wiki as a resource for this show because like what game did we pick before we need to go do a control find on the wiki.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
I look at that thing every week.

36:55.000 --> 37:03.000
Yeah so it's and it's funny because we I've never touched it so props to all of our people that actually make that happen thank you so much really appreciate that.

37:03.000 --> 37:08.000
So let's see some other quick comments here and then we'll move on.

37:08.000 --> 37:15.000
Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com suggests we can have a Dark Sakura séance on episode 666.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Oh that might be something interesting.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Knock three times if you can hear me.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Alright anyway.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
I think it's the time for that.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
We're all past our gaming weeks and housekeeping.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Let's get into gaming news.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Loki.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
So Pokemon Go.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Lots of stuff to talk about.

37:34.000 --> 37:40.000
First off they just had an update recently in fact I noticed it yesterday that changes a little bit of the game.

37:40.000 --> 37:47.000
They've nerfed some of the attacks from the actual Pokemon especially a lot of the ones that have been used.

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
They've also allowed you to re-customize your trainer which is kind of nice because my son says he wants to play as a girl.

37:53.000 --> 38:00.000
And I'm like okay that's fine but I originally created your character to kind of look like you but you can do whatever you want now.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
They also I guess changed some of the animations.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
They've added like actual new pictures for some of the trophies or awards that you get.

38:12.000 --> 38:21.000
And then they've also removed the three foot thing that was on the actual nearby Pokemon.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
So now there's no distance whatsoever indicated with the nearby Pokemon.

38:26.000 --> 38:34.000
Along with that they've done some back end stuff to block PokeVision from working and some of the other tracking applications.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
Because yeah I don't know.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
I guess service stability or something.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
I've to be honest found that the game has been crashing a lot more for me lately but that's just my thing I guess.

38:48.000 --> 38:56.000
There's a lot of I don't know how much you've seen of this on the internet Loki but there's a lot of strong opinions about what's happening with Pokemon GO.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
There's a lot of salt.

38:57.000 --> 39:04.000
They are pissed off at Niantic for not talking to the community and a lot of English players are like.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Well aware of this.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Welcome to our world.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Okay so here's the thing.

39:10.000 --> 39:16.000
So I actually like I'm using my quotey fingers got into it on Twitter a little bit today over this.

39:16.000 --> 39:24.000
Although I don't you know as long as nothing ever blurs the line of personal attacks I don't I don't really get like all bent out of shape on Twitter debates.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
But I was definitely getting into it a little bit today about these changes and so forth.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
Because honestly when I heard that they shut PokeVision down my reaction was good.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I think that site needed to go.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I don't think that site was what the game was intended for.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
And it doesn't really do anything.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
All it does is like shows you exactly where to go to find stuff.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
It's yeah.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
It shows us where to find it because they're fucking tracking shit doesn't work for shit.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
I kind of get that people have that complaint and so forth.

39:53.000 --> 40:00.000
But here's the thing is that a that site is against the terms of service like you can sugarcoat it however you want or whatever.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
But the site is against the terms of service Niantic had a right to pull it down.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Go look up the part about scraping, botting.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
You're just sugarcoating it.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
You're trying to say oh but you know whatever you know it's it is.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
They're going to do it anyways.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
People are going to cheat.

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
But the thing is is that PokeVision shouldn't and I get why people are like upset and so forth.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
But here's the thing.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
The tracking thing is is temporary.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I'm confident in that.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
They're going to bring back the tracking thing.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
And the reason why they disabled it is because the game is playable.

40:35.000 --> 40:42.000
So in my in my opinion based on what I'm seeing off what's going on from the system perspective.

40:42.000 --> 40:51.000
They turned off the tracking the 123 foot and all that they disabled that or nullified it or whatever to make the servers more stable.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
So that way you can play the game at all.

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
So Niantic either has it where people are going to be bitching because the radar thing doesn't work.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
Or people are going to be bitching because they can't log into the game at all.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
Now the one thing I will agree though that Niantic and this never did come up in my Twitter debate earlier.

41:07.000 --> 41:15.000
But it is the thing that I will agree on is that Niantic is doing a pretty crap job at communicating with their player base on some of these reasons why.

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
And everything that is happening with this situation has to be inferred through interviews.

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
Like John Hanke said this offhanded comment about don't expect those sites to last much longer.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
That a lot of people are like really like running with and so forth.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
Like oh he had a personal vendetta against these sites and that's why he shut them down and all this stuff.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
And I'm kind of like okay take a step back.

41:37.000 --> 41:44.000
The creators of Pokemon Go did not disable the radar to intentionally piss off their player base.

41:44.000 --> 41:49.000
They're not out there to piss you off intentionally as a gamer.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
That's a no win situation for them.

41:51.000 --> 41:57.000
But because they don't communicate well with their player base everybody can kind of make up that line and run with it.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
And that's what's happening here because Niantic doesn't really communicate.

42:01.000 --> 42:09.000
And this is where that relationship with Nintendo would come in really freaking handy right about now.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
Is that maybe Nintendo can help them out with some of these communication issues.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
I feel like they did with the Pogo wrist bracelet thing right.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
With it being delayed.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
Yeah I feel like didn't Nintendo come out and talk about that too.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Yeah I don't let's see here.

42:29.000 --> 42:36.000
Yeah basically they're supposed to be coming out at the end of or it's supposed to be coming out now in September.

42:36.000 --> 42:47.000
And this is from Nintendo they actually said you know this delay is due to the preparations for Pokemon Go application update in order to optimize Pokemon Go Plus.

42:47.000 --> 42:59.000
In order for us to offer new experiences to play Pokemon Go with Pokemon Go Plus with all high quality level or a quality level high enough to satisfy many people as possible.

42:59.000 --> 43:06.000
We decided it's necessary to take the time for completion. We ask for your understanding.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.000
So anyway I believe the tracking will be back.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
And you know for all these salty people that are threatening to leave Pokemon Go and so forth honestly.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Bye Felicia.

43:17.000 --> 43:26.000
Well I don't want to sound so like such an asshole but at the same time it's like actually if people would stop playing for a little bit it would help the servers become more stable.

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
And the tracking will probably come back sooner rather than later so like your threat to quit.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
I'm just kind of like yeah actually could you could you stop playing for a little bit.

43:35.000 --> 43:47.000
But that makes me sound like such a colossal asshole I realize but you know and the tweet I'd written earlier was just a very tongue in cheek thing about holding gyms and so forth and obviously I would like to see a game that everybody can play.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
But this is not like seriously guys we've been doing this show what 14 years.

43:52.000 --> 44:02.000
In my opinion Pokemon Go is just another MMO and these are problems that every fucking MMO every single one of them has had when it launched.

44:02.000 --> 44:08.000
Every single one of them has been a shit show in one way or another.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
Has there been any that were not a shit show at least in one way or another.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Has there been a smooth MMO launch.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
I'm trying to think was Wildstar smooth maybe.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
I didn't have a problem. I don't remember a problem with Star Trek online.

44:22.000 --> 44:31.000
Maybe but I just, you know, for the, you know, the big ones like World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, they all had problems, their first couple weeks.

44:31.000 --> 44:37.000
As far as Niantic's track record again, they've done at least 104.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
What?

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
No I do remember there are problems with Star Trek online nevermind.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Yeah there were.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
They've done at least 104 updates to Ingress in the three years it's been out.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
They will keep updating Pokemon Go.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
This first little update they did is just one of many things to come.

44:52.000 --> 44:59.000
So people just need to step back, take a deep breath, Niantic doesn't fucking hate you.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
They're just trying to make the game playable at all.

45:01.000 --> 45:13.000
But at the same time they have a right to close this Pokevision stuff because it's completely removing, like it's one extreme to the other is what it is.

45:13.000 --> 45:22.000
There's already, like there's a subreddit on Reddit of course called Pokemon Go Dev where all these people are developing these third party stuff.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
And they've already gotten past all the stuff that Niantic's done.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
So it'll be just down for a few days and then it's going to be back up again.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
Kaijuto in chat says no worries, more Pokemon nerfing coming, the game is done.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
The game is done. That's funny.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Wow is dead too.

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
The minute they release the second generation Pokemon, everybody will be back.

45:48.000 --> 45:57.000
Listen, you're able to log into the game, so what that they removed the amount of feet that are next to the nearby Pokemon? It's better than nothing.

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
Honestly, yeah. Because that's the alternative from the technical side of things.

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
Remember like the way you would refresh the feet thing? You could kind of force the system to do it the same way you do in Ingress.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
You click on a Poke stop and click out and then it will refresh things.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
Like that's, it's all about the server queries and how often things get pinged to see where the stuff is.

46:21.000 --> 46:28.000
And they, these sites don't help that. It doesn't reduce the number of those queries.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
So those sites being up are just putting Niantic back in the same place essentially.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
So, let's see, going to chat for some more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
SSG100Matt says the people asking for refunds are stupid, you don't need to spend money.

46:44.000 --> 46:51.000
Oh, yeah, did you mention that at all? The people that are calling Apple and Google and all that are getting refunds for it?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
No.

46:52.000 --> 46:59.000
Oh my god, it's off the hook. Because Kotaku ran a story, here's how you get your refunds for Pokemon Go.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Thank you Kotaku.

47:00.000 --> 47:07.000
And people, people go, ooh, free money. And so I just, I'm kind of surprised the companies are letting them do it.

47:07.000 --> 47:16.000
But I also, like, that's not a read on Apple or Google. It's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, I understand the good customer service and all that stuff.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
So, hmm. But anyway, we'll see. We'll see what develops.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
All right, let's move on.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Real quick, I wanted to mention one last thing.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Yeah, yeah.

47:28.000 --> 47:35.000
So this is kind of funny. So remember how Pokemon Go really made Nintendo's stocks kind of skyrocket a little bit?

47:35.000 --> 47:44.000
Well, Nintendo actually came out with a release basically saying, hey, even though Pokemon Go is doing really well,

47:44.000 --> 47:54.000
Nintendo doesn't really fully own the franchise and the amount of money that we're, the revenue that we're receiving from Pokemon Go isn't really going to make a huge difference.

47:55.000 --> 48:05.000
And so because of that, you know, their shares then plummeted back down 17%, you know, where they were up, I think previously like 30% or so.

48:05.000 --> 48:13.000
Yeah, I'd heard about, I'd heard about the whole fact that it declined because people realized that Nintendo hadn't really made the game or whatever.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
It's just funny.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
Oh, well. If only I could get in on that.

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah, well Nintendo could, you know, again, they could kind of own a little, they do own part of Niantic though.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
They own part of Niantic, they own part of the Pokemon company. I mean, they do.

48:27.000 --> 48:34.000
It's kind of like how most of Yahoo's money comes from their investments in Alibaba or whatever that site is in China.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
Alibaba is the name of it. Most of Yahoo's money comes from their investments in that.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Funny.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I think investments can still be worth a lot.

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
Well, now most of their investments are going to be coming from their purchase or being purchased by Verizon.

48:47.000 --> 48:53.000
Yeah. Oh, and a TigerKlon chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, you heard that the boss of Niantic's Twitter account got hacked?

48:53.000 --> 49:01.000
Yeah, I did see that. And it's just one of those things where I just kind of face palmed and I'm like, God dammit gamers, this is why we can't have nice things.

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
No, no, no, no, stop blaming gamers. Seriously. But everybody games. Pokemon Go.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
That is the reputation that's going to be out there.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
No, no, no, that's like saying, damn you white people. I mean, because seriously.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Well, I have said that on several occasions.

49:14.000 --> 49:21.000
Seriously, like, can we just stop doing that? Because why are we assuming that a gamer is the one that hacked this person's thing?

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
Okay, that's fine. Everybody is playing games. Everybody is fucking playing Pokemon Go.

49:26.000 --> 49:33.000
Pokemon Go is a game, therefore you're a fucking gamer. So let's stop labeling people. Damn you food eaters for fucking hacking him.

49:33.000 --> 49:42.000
If you would let me finish my thought, it actually, the hack doesn't seem to do with this recent fuckery about the website getting closed and all that.

49:42.000 --> 49:52.000
But the fact that the game hasn't released in Brazil. So it appears that these are gamers in Brazil that are very anxious about Pokemon Go being released,

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
who actually hacked the account because Niantic has not released the game in Brazil.

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
And to the folks in Brazil, I tell you, there's, again, server stability things.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
There's probably a really good reason why the game isn't out for you yet, because the game needs to be playable.

50:07.000 --> 50:17.000
Although, granted, they did still release the game in Japan, but Japan's a little different because, you know, it's kind of the homeland of Pokemon and Nintendo.

50:17.000 --> 50:23.000
So I think there was a lot more pressure that the game kind of had to release in Japan in a reasonable timeframe.

50:23.000 --> 50:32.000
But unfortunately, Brazil will probably have to wait. It's a very big place. Brazil probably will have to wait until some of these server issues sort themselves out.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.000
But look at the bright side, Brazil. You'll never have to deal with all this junk that we've been talking about this week.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
That'll all be worked out by the time you get the game. So enjoy the Olympics and stuff in the meantime.

50:43.000 --> 50:51.000
Alright. Anyway, let's go and talk about Nintendo NX rumors, because there's never enough Nintendo NX rumors.

50:51.000 --> 50:58.000
But these ones actually seem to be a little more, I guess, believable, plausible.

50:58.000 --> 51:04.000
I don't know. When I look at this, I kind of go, yep, this is probably it. This probably hits the nail on the head.

51:04.000 --> 51:13.000
Eurogamer is the site that kind of broke this. But when I say broke this, it's more like confirmed a lot of speculation that was out there already.

51:13.000 --> 51:22.000
And what the deal is, is that the NX is apparently a handheld, think like a tablet type of device with detachable controllers on the left and the right side.

51:22.000 --> 51:32.000
When you detach those controllers, you can dock the tablet and it will play on your television using those controllers that used to be plugged into the tablet.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
And that is essentially what the NX is. It is a handheld and a console.

51:38.000 --> 51:49.000
So it's not like the earlier speculation that we've had on this show that the NX is a handheld, comma, and a console system, basically.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
Like there's two separate ones, but that it is actually combined in one.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
So it's a Nomad.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
Is that what, did that do the same thing?

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
The Sega Nomad.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Did that kind of do the same thing?

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
It was a handheld Sega Genesis and you could plug it into your TV.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
I guess in a way, yeah, it could be.

52:09.000 --> 52:17.000
Now, some other specs about this, it's going to have the NVIDIA Tegra processor in it, which is kind of the big thing they're talking about.

52:17.000 --> 52:24.000
But that is a change, a big change from the parts that are on the GameCube and on the Wii and the Wii U.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
So a lot of folks are saying don't expect backwards compatibility because that is changing.

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
Also, there is going to be a recommended 32 gigabyte cartridge.

52:35.000 --> 52:47.000
But when we say cartridge, think more a DS cart and less a old school thick gray cartridge because, again, this is a handheld thing that's meant to go with you on the go.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
This makes a lot of sense to me and this is probably right.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
What do you think, Loki?

52:53.000 --> 52:59.000
The only thing that I think was missing is one of the rumors is that it's not the Tegra chip that's out now.

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
It's going to be a brand new Tegra chip because the one that's out now is kind of underpowered a bit.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
But I don't know, we'll just see what it is.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
I mean, honestly, I just don't see how this is going to revolutionize stuff.

53:13.000 --> 53:26.000
Well, it's going to be neat that, again, this is something that was already with the rumors is that it would probably be like a Wii U, except you could really take that tablet part anywhere with you.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
And that's essentially what it sounds like this NX is going to be.

53:29.000 --> 53:40.000
And especially in a culture like Japan, where there's a lot more of the commuting and mass transit and so forth, where somebody could start a game in the morning, literally pick it up and play it on their way to work.

53:40.000 --> 53:45.000
That's pretty cool. Although, I wonder what the size of that tablet is going to be.

53:45.000 --> 53:52.000
Did they say what the size of the tablet is? Are we talking like an iPad size thing or are we talking like the size of a DS?

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
I don't know.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Do we know?

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
I'd be very curious what the size of that thing is going to look like to see what that kind of looks like for mobility.

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
Is it something that's going to fit in my pocket or am I going to have to carry a man bag in order to take that thing with me on the go?

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
That's a big question as well.

54:06.000 --> 54:13.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, it would certainly be in line with when Nintendo was talking about unifying things between handheld and console.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
So just have all the games as console and handheld at the same time.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
That comment from live.vognetwork.com.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
And yeah, I think that's going to be one of the biggest assets of this system.

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
Even though the Wii U kind of lost that third party support after the first year,

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
and a lot of the third party companies stopped making games for it,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
they were still making games for the 3DS and the DS.

54:37.000 --> 54:44.000
So for Nintendo to recover from whatever slump you want to say the Wii U may have put them in,

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
why not leverage that strength in the handheld department and just unify it?

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
And like, hey, if you make a game for the handheld, guess what?

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
It's going to work on the console too.

54:54.000 --> 55:01.000
And then it's also kind of that double sided thing where it's like, hey, that Xbox One or PlayStation 4 game you're making,

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
guess how easy it is to port to the NX and it's now a handheld game.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
It'll run on the tablet.

55:06.000 --> 55:14.000
I think it's going to really open it up to the third party publishers and hopefully keep a repeat problem of the Wii U from happening.

55:14.000 --> 55:19.000
But you know, it is about time for a refresh of the 3DS and the DS technology.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
So I'd be very curious to see what happens with that.

55:22.000 --> 55:32.000
Speaking of that, one other real quick point I wanted to say is that a lot of people are saying don't expect backwards compatibility with the Wii U and the Wii and all that stuff.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
Although I would think a virtual console for at least GameCube would be a given.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
They'll emulate it.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
They don't know how to fucking do networking.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
They'll emulate it.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Is your mic off?

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Lowkey, Lowkey, Lowkey, Lowkey, is your mic off?

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
It doesn't mind me.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Maybe for that it needed to be off.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
But anyway, what was I saying?

55:52.000 --> 55:59.000
So it probably won't play the Wii or the GameCube games, but maybe it'll play the DS or the 3DS games.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Why not?

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
It would make a lot of sense that it would play the old handheld games.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Well, being that an Android phone couldn't emulate those anyways.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
Why not?

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
No, but seriously though, they're going to fucking screw us with the virtual console game.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
Make some excuses like, oh, we just can't figure out how to link those stories together.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
It's, networking is so hard.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
Rama in chat says Tegra ain't going to be able to emulate that, Sky.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
Whatever's in this thing is able to run the new Zelda game.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
It's supposed to be rumored to be a new Tegra chip.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
It's a new chip that hasn't been revealed yet.

56:35.000 --> 56:40.000
And it's supposed to be, the whole thing's supposed to be announced in September, supposedly.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
We'll see.

56:41.000 --> 56:46.000
Yeah, but you know, again, if it's going to play that new Zelda game, it can play the old 3DS games just fine.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
And it can probably do GameCube games too, even though it is a different processor.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
They could probably emulate it, but we'll see.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
We'll see.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
TigerKlon chat says it'll probably be scaled down to run on it.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
That would really surprise me if that ended up being...

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
That would be funny.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
We didn't show you the NX version. I know you guys are expecting a better version, but...

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
Why? That would be shooting that new console in the foot.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
It needs to look better on NX than Wii U.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
Well, this is the same company that fucking thinks that they can play in their own playground

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
and they don't have to compete with the other companies.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Which is a...

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
How well did that fucking work out for you with the Wii U, mister I don't want to compete with other companies?

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah, you won't be competing with the other companies because they will blow you the fuck away.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Is what's going to happen.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
And, I mean, I hope this gimmick is fantastic.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
I hope that this really brings, you know, the third parties to your console.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
But, if it doesn't have the power to keep up with the games that they're developing,

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
I'm sorry you're going to be left in the dust again.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
It's going to be...

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
Yeah, you're going to have the great first party titles, but those are always fucking there.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
So that's not something that...

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
I mean, that's something that...

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
Well, yeah, it really depends on what those launch titles are.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
If they have some must-have stuff at launch, there's going to be a lot of people really into this.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
I do. I think if Nintendo can come out with some strong first party things...

58:00.000 --> 58:07.000
And I kind of feel like they may come out swinging with a bunch of Wii U ports for the NX.

58:07.000 --> 58:12.000
And we've heard rumblings about a remastered Splatoon, a remastered...

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
Was it Mario Maker? Something else on the Wii U recently.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
That they're talking about a remastering for NX.

58:17.000 --> 58:22.000
They'll probably just punch us with all this stuff right at launch.

58:22.000 --> 58:28.000
You know, obviously there needs to be stuff besides recycled Wii U games if they want this to succeed.

58:28.000 --> 58:34.000
But, we're about due for something in the Mario Galaxy or the Mario 3D setting.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
So that would be something I could definitely see as a launch game.

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
And, oh yeah, there's Zelda. That's kind of a big deal as well.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Yeah.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
So, we'll see what happens.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
So, Fifth Dream in chat says, what? Nintendo wants you to buy all your games again?

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
Well, yes and no. Of course they want you to buy them again.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
And they'll do something with this to soup them up.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
And the fact that you can take Splatoon with you on the go and all this stuff will probably be...

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
Although, how would you take it on the go with you and play online?

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
I'm assuming there's no cellular data thing.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
I mean, maybe it's got Wi-Fi, so you could play it at Starbucks or something, but I don't know.

59:10.000 --> 59:17.000
I'm going to take a page out of the fucking Vita and call it asynchronous multiplayer.

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
Or better known as, fuck it, we're not doing multiplayer.

59:22.000 --> 59:29.000
But, Fifth Dream, that also may be an opportunity to try to push this console for people that skipped the Wii U.

59:29.000 --> 59:34.000
And I think that would be more of the strategy behind this is, hey, look at these games that you still haven't played yet.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
You could just buy the better versions on your NX at launch for 40 bucks.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
We'll see what happens. We'll see.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
Alright, let's move on. Something else. Dark Saga.

59:45.000 --> 59:51.000
Well, we have been talking about this for how many years? It's the whole 38 Studio thing?

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
A while. It's been a while.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Well, finally, after a four year investigation into the collapse of 38 Studios, the decision has been made that there will be no criminal charges filed against the company.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And the quote says, a bad business deal does not necessarily make it a crime.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So, the Attorney General, the Rhode Island Attorney General, and the Superintendent of the State Police made the announcement.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And they were, they say, we know taxpayers aren't going to be happy about it.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:49.000
So, yeah. And of course, when asked about it, Curt Schilling's response was that they could have saved tens of millions more by making that statement five years ago.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And the quote on here is, disgusted to see officers sent on fake ass witch hunt.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
So, it's over. Over and done.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I'm not surprised they didn't bring criminal charges. I mean, you know, just, it's done. Let it be. We're past it at this point.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I just don't see the point of dragging what's his name through the mud, even though he's said a lot of other things where, you know, I, bleh.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.000
But for this particular circumstance, specifically, like it's just, you know, why, why do we keep dragging this out? Let's just, it's done.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It costs the state a lot of money. Let's move on.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
That they never should have given him in the first place. But, you know, hindsight's 20-20. What can he do?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Better to be done.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
All right. Let's move on. Loki, what do you have for us next?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So, I mean, I guess this was to be expected after they announced that they weren't going to be making any more of these games.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But Disney Infinity, they've announced basically their server shutdown plan.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So, you know, Disney Infinity is going to be shutting down their servers, ending everything finally on March 3, 2017.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But before that, starting September 30th, the Apple TV versions, I guess, of the games will be removed from the store.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And then also, you'll simply, I guess, get the boxed versions of the games.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And then, I guess, following that January 3rd, they're going to be removing the in-game purchases from PC, from the 2.0 and 3.0 on PC.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And then, of course, you know, finally, at the very end, they're going to be taking everything else down.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Although, starting, I guess, already, they've already removed some stuff as well.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000
So, Disney Infinity 2.0 in-game purchases on PC, iOS, Android, and Apple TV have been turned off.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
But that doesn't affect Infinity 3.0 yet.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I'm curious to see what happens with the figures, if it's going to drive them up in price, or...

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Well, some folks in chat are saying, Bob Coffey in chat says the Infinity figures are on hella clearance right now.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I wonder where that is, because not everything, you know, when they first announced that the game was stopping,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I think we were expecting to see clearances everywhere, and that didn't happen.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Yeah, I kind of want to get some more of those. My wife's like, no, don't buy anymore.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Well, it depends how much. You know, they are still good figures, little toys.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
If you're going to buy those little pop doll figures, why not the Disney Infinity figures?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Well, I just meant for my son, because, you know, he wants to play that.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And he doesn't really play it on PlayStation 4 anymore, so I was thinking, like, pick up the digital version on PS3 on Wii U.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And then that way, you know, since everything's plug and play, you just, you know, move the stuff over,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
he can just play it in his room on that.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But that's really unfortunate that the game's plug is being pulled, you know, so there's no chance they're going to sell anymore 3.0s during the holiday or any of that stuff.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
No, they've already moved on. Like, they've got, like, this licensing stuff I've seen with, like, the Marvel characters,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
and so they have these elaborate toys that, it's got some IR stuff with it as well. I'm not really sure what that is.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Bob Coffee says a lot of Walmarts should have them on rollback for $4.96 for a lot of the 3.0 and 2.0 figures.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It's pretty cheap.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Yeah.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:15.000
So, yeah, I just, but the game itself should still be playable, it's just the online where you play with friends and stuff wouldn't be available anymore, right?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
No, online wasn't that great anyway, so it's, like, up to four people, and, I mean, I just never really used the online stuff.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
My son just really just builds a level, and that's it.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I mean, there's not really, we're not downloading levels or playing any of the levels that people make. It's just kind of, no.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Tigerclaw in chat says with Disney Infinity gone, we only have three toys to life left.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Skylanders, Lego Dimension, and Amiibos. I don't know if Amiibos totally count as toy to life.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
No.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
They're kind of a unique category, and I thought I heard that in the last Nintendo earnings, they really took a hit on Amiibos.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Like, the bubbles kind of burst, but it also seems like they didn't really do much with Amiibos the past few months.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I mean, yeah, okay, they had, like, a recoloring Splatoon set, and a few other, but, I mean, they didn't have anything big.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
That's just cash drive shit right there.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Yeah, they didn't have anything big, you know? So, I wonder if Amiibo is kind of in a holding pattern until NX.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'll be curious to see what they do for the holiday, but I don't think Amiibo's gone.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Like, I mean, think about all the cool stuff they could have done, like, you dress up your Miis, you scan it in, boom, like, hey, you got costume or something.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, to be fair, we had that whole story last week about that Animal Crossing is being updated to include Amiibo.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I mean, it's silly, but it's something, and it's cool that it's a title that, you know, most people have just kind of had sitting dormant on their 3DS for years.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So, I mean, if Nintendo kind of keeps throwing those types of little bones at us, I think that's really cool.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I wonder if that's one of the games that they're remastering for the NX.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I wonder. Hmm.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
That's why that's being added right now, is cross-play with that version of the game.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:53.000
The only reason I'm not saying yes, absolutely, is because there's also the mobile game that's happening, and I don't think they would want those out at the same time.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
So, I mean, we'll see, but the mobile thing should be out by the end of the year.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.000
We're supposed to be getting, what is it? What was the other one? Is Fire Emblem the other one?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
We're supposed to be getting those two free-to-plays mobile things to follow up Miitomo by the end of the year.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
That's what it was, right? It was Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing, right?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I know Animal Crossing.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I don't remember.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Let's see, Indartetsuya in chat says, yeah, that's what I'm thinking. They're waiting for the NX launch to do some more stuff since all the Amiibo-supported games are already out.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I think the only really new one is the patch for Animal Crossing.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Also, the only other thing I wanted to say with the toys-to-life thing is that those are the only toys-to-life thing remaining for consoles.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
But don't forget, Target still has that huge section for the other Marvel thing that just plugs right into your TV.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
That's what I was saying. They've got that thing right now.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Yeah, so they're not totally gone, for what it's worth.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
But I think now that stuff is starting to slow down a little bit and is honestly probably better left to a company like Lego.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Because Lego is making the stuff that, you know, the age group that has a lot of money wants.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000
And they're already making toys anyway. So, I don't know. We'll see.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Anyway, let's move on and talk about Doom DLC. Did you ever play the new Doom, Loki?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Not yet.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
You should check it out.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
It's probably going to be something I purchase on sale and then never play again.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Well, there's a multiplayer add-on that's coming out with some new maps.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.000
But what's pretty cool about this, you kind of worry like, oh, when the new maps come out, there's going to be all these people that don't have the maps who aren't going to be able to play.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Well, actually, this is pretty cool. The new expansion, Unto the Evil, which is the multiplayer add-on, is that they're not going to split the community with it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
So, here's what happens. The DLC is going to have a feature called Party Play.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And they're calling this very similar to what Payday 2 does and Warhammer End Times.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
You will not have to buy Unto the Evil in order to play on the DLC maps.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:01.000
As long as you're in another party with a player who purchased the DLC map, it will come up in the rotation and you won't be kicked out.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So, as long as one person in the party owns the DLC, everybody can play the map in the rotation.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
But I guess, I don't know, it doesn't say if you could pick the map manually. It might still be just part of the random generation or what have you.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And that's honestly probably a really good thing.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And then lets people sample those maps and decide if they want to buy it on their own.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
So, I think that's probably the best way to do this without splitting the player base.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000
So, I need to go back and play some more Doom. It is a really, really well done, just graphically great game too.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And I played a little bit through it and then just, you know, my typical gamer, ooh shiny, something else to play kicked in and I never went back to Doom.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
So, I need to get on that.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Well, news about Shenmue 3. Ooh. Did any of us pay into the Kickstarter?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I did not chip into the Kickstarter because I just kind of stopped backing video game Kickstarters.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I've only done one Kickstarter.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I'll be curious to check it out.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I did one Kickstarter.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
What was that?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The Hotchafel Boyfriend Plushies.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I now have four pigeons on my desk at home.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Anyway, one of the people who worked on the other Shenmue is going to be returning.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.000
This is the sub director for the series, Okuyasu Keiji is going to be returning and working on the game.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And he really is looking forward to being a part of it and I have a good quote from him too.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
This is what I personally want to stress for my part is what makes Shenmue, Shenmue.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
The game has an utterly unique atmosphere and I want all that to be breathed in.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000
As you play along, you feel the ambiance, the mayo, and from place to place, getting that full sensory experience.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.000
So, that was in reference to working on the other two and wanting that to continue.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Well, I hope the magic can strike a third time. I really do.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:15.000
There's a little bit of me that's concerned that after so many years of there not being Shenmue, that this one may miss the mark, but we'll see.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000
As long as it has more Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier in it, I'm happy.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And games of Lucky Hit, hopefully.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some video games that you'll be playing a lot sooner than Shenmue 3.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
How about in the US, Loki?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000
So, let's see. This week, we don't have No Man's Sky and that's all that really matters.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Next week, though. Or, yeah, next week.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000
So, starting off for the first week in August here, we've got Abzu.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
That's going to be coming out on PC and PlayStation 4.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Also, we get the beginning of the Batman the Telltale series.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Episode 1 is going to be coming out this week as well.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Oh, awesome. I want to check that out.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
On pretty much all platforms.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Nice.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
A game on PC called This is the Police.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And I can only hope that's based off of the band.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And then finally, Tricky Towers on PC and PlayStation 4.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
And then on mobile, coming out this week, Mobius Final Fantasy.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
That's coming out on iOS and Android.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Oh, is this the week for that?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Yep, apparently.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Overcooked, which is on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Do you remember that one?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
No, it's not the sequel to Overwatch?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Nope. Overcooked, if I remember correctly, is the one that is like Iron Chef,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
but you also have to go hunt the monsters in your ingredients.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
So, it's that whole joke about why is the restaurant so slow?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Do they have to kill the chicken first?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Something like that.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
But, yeah, this is like an RPG or something.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
If I remember correctly, that's what that is.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Little King's Story is going to be coming to PC as well.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And that's it.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the release schedule in Japan.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Some price reductions on the PlayStation 4 this week on the 4th of August

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
for Biohazard Revelations 2, which, of course, is Resident Evil.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That gets a price reduction on the PlayStation 4.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
But also out this week is Wasteland 2.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
The Director's Cut is out this week.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
That is on the PlayStation 4.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I don't think the Wii U really has anything going on right now.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Nope, things are very slow and quiet over there on the Wii U.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
On the Vita this week, though, we have Genkai Toki 7 Pirates

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
is out this week on the 4th.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And then we also have, there's a limited edition of that same game as well.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And that's really it on the Vita.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.000
And then lastly, on the 3DS this week, we have Dragon Ball Fusions.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
There is a new Nintendo, yeah, there's a new Nintendo 3DS LL.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
There's a Super Famicom Edition and a Fire Emblem Edition.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And the Super Famicom Edition, it doesn't actually look like,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
well, actually, no, it kind of does look like a Super Nintendo.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
The box art did make it look like that.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Okay, that is pretty cool.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I don't know if you guys can see that here in the studio.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Let me make that a little bigger so that it doesn't zoom in.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But when it's closed, it actually looks like a Super Famicom system

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
with the little power switch and the eject.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And then on the inside, the buttons are actually colored

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
like they were in a Super Famicom.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Okay, that is super cute.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
And if I collected 3DSs, I would want that.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
But that's a very expensive thing to collect.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And then also on the 3DS this week, 12Sai Kousuru Diary is out this week.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And then there is Sekaijuu no Meikyu 5 Nagaki Shinwa no Hatae

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
comes out this week.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
And that is in a regular and a collector's pack edition.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And this is the Eterion Odyssey series in Japan.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So it's the latest in that game.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So if you like your dungeon crawlers, enjoy.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And that's it for Japanese releases.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Well, a few things.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000
In the UK, we have the Telltale Batman on everything

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and Abzu for PlayStation 4 and PC and Space Rift for PC.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
On the 5th, Little King's Story for PC.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
That's it.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
than the classic game of the week.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Loki.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
So this is something that they kind of teased, I want to say,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
during E3 on talking about Oculus support coming to Minecraft.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Well, it's going to be coming a little bit sooner now.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
So we should be expecting actually in the next few weeks, apparently.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It is already available for the Gear VR.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
So they have a specific version for that.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
But now they're talking about like on Windows 10

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
and possibly the regular PC version as well.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Very exciting.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I'm curious to see when that's going to be coming out, though.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
They didn't really specifically say, but in the next few weeks.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I know you don't really have Oculus Rift,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
but if you did, would you be all over this?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I do have the Oculus Rift.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Oh, that's right, you do. That's right.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Sorry, I'm thinking the Gear VR for some reason

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
was the only thing you have.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So are you going to check this out, then?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I will, but it'll run like absolute shit on my laptop.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
But I mean, yeah, sure, I'll try it.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Try it.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It's just, it's going to, you know.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Well, the graphics in Minecraft aren't that good.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Right.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So, remember we were talking how like, you know,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
they've basically, the Pokémon Go, Niantic has blocked those apps and stuff.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And like I mentioned, there's already workarounds for it.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
So I have this app on my phone that I just downloaded

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
that is a third-party app that someone made.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And not only does it show you which Pokémon are around you,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
it shows you all the Pokéstops in the area and everything.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
It shows you if there's lures on them and all that.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
So it must be tapping into the API or whatever.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Right.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
So, also against terms of service, but we'll see.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Anyway, I know you all are excited that Just Dance,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Ubisoft's Just Dance series is going to be getting, I guess, a spin-off series.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
It's not dancing, though. It's singing.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
That's right. Just Sing was announced this week.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Ubisoft announced that they are making the game.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Just Sing is not supposed to be about competition.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
It's just, you know, creating shareable stuff.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
So, and when you watch people in the trailer do this,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
they're holding the thing out like they're making a selfie while they're,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
it's kind of weird, but whatever.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Stupid is the word you're looking for?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Well, apparently, lip-syncing is as good as actually singing.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It's not measuring your pitch.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It's measuring if you're, like, trying.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
You're actually getting an A for effort, I guess.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So, you could just lip-sync.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
So, if you don't want to sing, you can just bah, bah, bah, you know,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
watermelon, bananas, watermelon, bananas,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
and you would get credit for singing watermelon, bananas,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
even though the song is really, you know,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
the new Fergie song about the milfs, the milf man,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
or what the hell is their new song about that's ridiculous?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Somebody knows what I'm talking about, right?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Fergie has a new song.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Dark Socko, clearly you know this, right?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Somebody in chat knows, right?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
All right.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.000
So, anyway, Just Sing will also take advantage of Xbox One's Kinect

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
or the PlayStation Camera.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Your phone is the microphone and camera via a free app,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
which, you know, Just Dance has this as well.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And let's talk about the song list, what's in this game here.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So, oh, I thought the song list was going to be there on the actual article,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
but I know, let's see, Dark Tetsuya had posted it in our forums,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and there was some pretty hilarious songs in here.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
It's kind of a little bit of a mix of different genres

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
and different decades like you would expect.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Let's see, Chandelier by Sia, so you can go around and do the dance

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
that the girl does in the video.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Love Me Like You Do by Ailey Goodling.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
One More Night by Maroon 5.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
What Do You Mean by Justin Bieber?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Let's see, Baby One More Time, which I'm assuming is Britney.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I Love Rock and Roll.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Love Shack.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Oh, my favorite karaoke song is going to be in Just Sing.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I can't freaking wait.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
There it is.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
All right.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So, yeah, I'm sure you all are looking forward to Just Sing.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Anyway, if that isn't enough for you,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
there's other karaoke games coming out later this year.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
A video game based off The Voice is coming out.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
This is a new Voice video game

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
because I feel like there already was one on the Wii or something.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
But anyway, this is yet another game based on The Voice,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
and it will include 30 top tracks from the charts

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
that you can use to impress the coaches,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
and you can play it by yourself or you can play it with friends.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Voxler is the developer behind the game,

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.000
and, yeah, that should be something that will be a hit at parties, I guess.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I don't think I will...

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I don't know if I'll be picking that up.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Only 30 songs? That doesn't seem like very many.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
You've got to have more in this day and age.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
All right, let's travel to a classic time.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
It's a classic time when people were not singing into their phones

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
and taking selfies and all this stuff.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
If you took pictures of yourself playing video games,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
you had to go get those pictures developed.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
And they were usually taken by other people anyway.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Remember One Hour Photos?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Whatever happened to One Hour Photoshops?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Remember Mastering the Art of the Selfie with a Polaroid Camera?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
They're all cash advance shops now.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.000
hey, you ungrateful little brats, put your phones down and play this.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
You won't find any Pokémon there, but this is way better than Pokémon.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Right, Dark Soccer?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Well, this game is a sequel that was eight years in the making.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Blasteroids.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Remember, I said I have one of these in my garage.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Dan sends me this text, hey, look what I just got, and it's a Blasteroids.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I'm like, really? Okay.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
This game is older than a bunch of people I know.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:31.000
So Blasteroids was a sequel to Asteroids, which came out in 1979.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Blasteroids came out in 1987.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And it uses full raster, not vector, as Asteroids did.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
It had home computer ports that were released.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:51.000
In 1989, we had Image Works releasing it for the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Atari ST, Commodore 64, N128, MSX, MS-DOS PC, and ZX Spectrum.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Sorry, ZX Spectrum.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I have to say it right.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Also, one thing, though, to note is that this has never appeared in any of the Midway compilations,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000
though it did show up in LEGO Dimensions as an unlockable minigame that was accessible in The End is Try.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So basically, it's, you know, more Asteroids.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.000
You control your ship from an above view in a 2D representation of space,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000
and then you use thrust to, you know, move the ship along with its momentum.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000
You can slow down or stop moving, so you have to rotate it to face the direction it came from,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000
and then generate exactly the right amount of thrust you need to nullify the motion.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It also has fuel that...

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:57.000
It's energy that, you know, will also deplete the shields to protect from collisions and enemy fire.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And then once all that energy is gone, you are dead.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
So you have to destroy Asteroids and enemy ships.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And the ship can also be turned into three different versions.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:18.000
One of them is a fast one called the Speeder, a fighter that has the most firepower, and the warrior that has extra armor.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And so you can start...

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
At the start of the game, you get four different Warps, which are your difficulties.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And so when you fly through that Warp, that gives you your difficulty,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and each Warp has different galaxies with 9 or 16 sectors, your levels, depending on the difficulty that you go through.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
So basically you just have to clean out all of the fields and keep moving forward.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.000
You get different power crystals to power you up, but they decay over time.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
You also get these type of Asteroids that if you shoot them, you have to shoot them again,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
because they'll break into smaller pieces.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And then you've got your boss, Mukor, who shows up after the sectors are cleared of Asteroids.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
He will try to ram you and send little ships into you.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And he has tentacles, because you have to have tentacles.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It also has a multiplayer mode, so a second player can join in by pressing the fire button for one credit.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And so Blastroids is multiplayer Asteroids as well.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And then you can also cover each other's ships by docking one of them.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.000
So, for example, if you dock and one is a Speeder and the other one is a Warrior,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000
then it will turn the Speeder into a turret with more firepower.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
It'll do different things to each other.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
So that's it, Blastroids.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
You know, I have to admit, I've never played this, Blastroids.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I actually had no idea that this existed. I somehow just missed it all these years.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
You can play it at my house.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Apparently I can. And some pinball.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Well, you know, a party was yesterday.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Well, I was actually about to, I was surprised you didn't talk about that at the beginning of the show.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Because I didn't go.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
You didn't go.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Because what am I going to do, play everything and hurt?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yeah, with your wrist. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
So, I slept.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And I really wanted to go, but a friend of mine had a situation that they needed my help on.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
So I had to do that instead.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Well, Dan ended up taking the Blastroids with him.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Oh, okay. Wow.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Yeah, there's people who bring like arcade machines there for Atari Party as well.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
That's awesome. Did they still do it in that little room at the library?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Yeah, well sometimes they do it in Sunnyvale as well.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
But it's basically at one library or another.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Wow, that's still really cool. Awesome.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Blastroids.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Come over to Jamie's house and play it.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
She's inviting you all over.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Yep.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Alright, well we're going to take a quick break you guys.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:55.000
When we come back there's plenty more show to come including rapid fire news, the FUs of the week, and the mailbag.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Live tonight, episode 652 for this July the 31st of 2016.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000
We've been talking about all sorts of news tonight, including the latest on what's been going on with Pokémon GO,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
the No Man's Sky leaks, which I think I caught Loki watching there during the break.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
You must have found them somewhere.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Yeah, I found them somewhere.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Yeah, what'd you think?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I thought they looked fun. It just makes me want to play it even more.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Yeah, there you go.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And talk about some of the big NX rumors as well.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.000
So we've had a pretty busy show, and we've got plenty more to come including your phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
So be our friend on Skype, and we'll be getting to the Skype line a little bit later in the show.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
But first, some rapid fire news.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Right, and speaking of No Man's Sky, it is going to be a game that does not require PlayStation Plus.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Being the fact that it is multiplayer technically, because there are other players playing,

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
but the universe is so vast that it's very unlikely that you'll find anybody.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
So that's why they're not charging you for the multiplayer on that.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
That's kind of funny.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
But it looks seriously fun.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I got it.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
It's going to be hard to wait another eight days for it.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Yeah.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
We'll see.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
And this is pretty cool.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
We kind of talked about this I think either last week or the week before last.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:36.000
There was a game called Pray for the Gods, and that was very similar to almost a Shadow of the Colossus-type game on Kickstarter.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And it's met its goal.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
So they've already met their goal, and it is funded, still with ten days left.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And not only that, but they've announced that they're going to be coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
So basically saying they've already even tried porting them to the system.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:02.000
It says within days we had them playable and running at 30 FPS unoptimized.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:09.000
So hopefully that will be running a little bit faster when they do eventually optimize it, but that's pretty awesome.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And spontaneous music!

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Now we're in the safari.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Sorry about that.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I don't know why my playlist looped back to the beginning.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
That was awkward. Sorry about that.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
But yeah.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
So that looks pretty awesome.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I am looking forward to actually playing that sometime whenever they do eventually release it.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
All right.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Let's move on and talk about Splatoon and Splatfest.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000
You know, they're done, because the Callie and Marie thing, that was the last Splatfest that was ever going to happen.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Who won?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I believe Marie did?

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I think Marie did.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I don't know. I didn't play. I missed it.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
But I'm pretty sure Marie did.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Okay. Thank you. Act F in chat confirming that.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
So start to see.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:02.000
So usually when you participated in these Splatoon events, you would get currency known as Super Sea Snails.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.000
However, because Splatfests are basically done, some people were like, well, how am I going to get these now?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Well, the good news is there is going to still be a way to earn this currency.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000
You have to talk to Judd, who's the lazy cat, and you exchange Ranked and Turf War wins for one snail.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
But it is a pretty big rate. You do have to do 30 wins per snail.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But you can also buy additional snails from Spike with gold if you want.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I will never play this.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
What?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I will never play this.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Why?

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Snails.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Oh, but you're giving them away.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
No. It involves mollusks. I won't play it.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
It's a little silly.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:48.000
But that's it. So you are able to get those currency even though they're gone, essentially, from being able to be earned in Splatfest.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Also announced this week, there is a brand new expansion coming to Hearthstone.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I know some of you all play Hearthstone like crazy on PC and tablets.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And there is a new expansion that's been announced. It's called One Night in Karazhan.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Lots more single player content, 45 new cards, and it launches August 11th with the prologue mission free for everybody.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And if you looked at the trailer, it looked ridiculous.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
But I'm okay with that because Karazhan was my favorite thing in World of Warcraft that raid.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I have a lot of good memories about that raid.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:31.000
So I'm okay with it being a little bit over the top and silly and disco crazy because that is what I like.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I like a little bit of cheesy.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Alright, let's move on. DarkSaukra, for RapidFireNews.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Well, we have a listing for Metal Gear Solid V Definitive X.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
It just says X, EX.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So, it looks like it's supposed to be, hopefully, a more fleshed out version of the Phantom Pain, maybe?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Or it would just have whatever DLC or whatever came with it?

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Take a guess. I would say it's probably the Phantom Pain and the...

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
What was the first one they released? Their demo.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Oh, yeah. They gave it away during PlayStation Plus at one point. I know what you're talking about. Yeah, the prologue thing.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Phantom Pain and... It just slips to mind.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The one that everybody had been talking about where it was like two hours or whatever.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Right. I mean, my guess. It's just a compilation of both.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Makes sense.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Now the chat room knows about my big mollusk phobia.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Well, I mean, they're not... I don't know. It's just a little... Like, it looks like a coin. I don't know. But whatever.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
If it's just the shell, that's fine.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Yeah, that's all it is. It's not just like wheel around on the ground or anything.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
But the word even creeps me out. The thought of it makes...

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Like, when we used to get slugs in the bathtub, I would make Dan go get rid of them.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I would wake his ass up at three in the morning and then scrub the tub.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I am not kidding.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Thank God we don't live in that house anymore.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So, yeah. Okay. So, yeah. Metal Gear. Metal Gear. Okay.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And also, you can sign up now for the PS4 software update beta.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:16.000
So, you have to register for it, even if you've been in past betas before.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000
They're not saying what they're going to test, but the beta starts in early August.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
So, like, tomorrow?

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:30.000
So, anyway, you have to be 18 years old, and you submit your PSN ID,

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000
and answer some questions about beta communications, and there you go.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
But not everyone will be selected, so just go look at it online.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
They really only ask two things. They ask, what's your username?

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
And do you opt in for beta contact information, yes or no?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Because I signed up for it today.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:56.000
You can look for the URL on the PlayStation.com and website. There you go.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
All right. Let's get back into some other news that's going on this week,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
and we do have the mailbag and the FUs coming up as well soon. Loki.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.000
So, there was a no fool question on the weekend this week.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
It is on hiatus, but somebody has expressed interest in taking that over,

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
so I'm hoping I have something to announce soon.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Very cool. Anyways, so, I was going to say, there was some controversy

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
regarding some of the NVIDIA GTX cards that came out last generation,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
because it is last generation now, since we have the 1080, 1070 cards.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
But one of those was actually the GTX 970, which was advertised to have

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
four gigabytes of DDR5 RAM, which it technically did,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
but the card only was able to access three and a half gigs of that,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and apparently the last 0.5 gigabytes was lower performance memory.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And because of this class action lawsuit, that means that if you did purchase

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000
one of these cards, you were entitled to $30.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000
So, they're going to be paying out to every person that purchased one of those cards.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
So, that's not bad.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Sorry, did my screen...

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Is Darth Vader actually pulling up one of the pictures?

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.000
That doesn't look like a snail. That looks like a, just a seashell.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Maybe you shouldn't watch Stranger Things, not the spoiler or anything,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
but maybe you should just hold off.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Are there lots of snails in it?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Is it one scene?

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
No, but it's one scene. Yeah.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Just warn me what episode it's in, and I'll scare you.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
The very, very, very end.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Of the very last one?

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Well, we've got to be careful about spoilers, so that's all.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Well, maybe I should just watch it with somebody so someone can tell me not to look.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
There you go.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
See, this just looks like Toad, kind of, with a big sea hat.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Do all of them look like this?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
That's it. That's all it is.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
They're not even enemies in the game or anything.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I can deal with that.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000
There you go. Act F does, I guess, I don't know if that's a victory shout in chat or what,

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
but there you go.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Okay, so we actually had kind of addressed this earlier in the show about the whole

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
does NX actually play the GameCube and Wii games after all?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I had a copy of Uzumaki and I gave it away without ever watching it.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
What?

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
To Sistabiri in the chat room.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Oh, okay.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Asking if the Uzumaki movie or manga.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I can't watch it.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I actually did have a copy of Uzumaki that I bought.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Just because I was collecting everything I could and the moment I realized what would be in it,

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I gave it away.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I gave away a $30 movie.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Well, don't give away your Nintendo NX if you buy one.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:58.000
So, anyway, I guess the analysis site Digital Foundry took a look at some of what's been

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
brought up about the NX rumors and talked about could the Tegra chip,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
even though we know it's going to be a new super power chip,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
could it actually do GameCube and Wii emulation?

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And apparently they are finding that maybe it actually could actually run these things,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
which honestly is not a surprise at all.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
You can run a lot of this stuff on Android devices practically, can't you?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
So, I don't know.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Anyway, I kind of think we already kind of got into this a little bit before, so yeah, that's it.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Okay, that's not so bad either.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Uh, oh yeah.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
So, something that has nothing to do with mollusks.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
There is going to be a mini Mega Drive set coming out in Europe,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
although there's no statement as to whether or not it's going to come out in the US,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
but it's preordered at Fun Stock.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
It looks like there's two different versions.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
One of them is just a plug-in console, I think.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
It actually even looks like it has a loading slot.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
And the other one, I'm just going to say this the moment I saw it, I was like,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
oh, it's fucking Nomad.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Like, didn't they already try that?

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:19.000
But, it looks like it's just going to be,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000
has twice the number of games than the Mini NES,

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:31.000
and it will also be the same price as the Mini NES,

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and I'm trying to see what the other thing it looks like,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
because yeah, it looks like you can actually play your own games on it

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
from what it looks like, but I don't know.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I think it's just all the built-in stuff, so there you go.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Another thing that will probably get my money if it comes out over here,

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
although I'll be perfectly honest, we have like three Sega Genesises around,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and a couple of power-based converters and Master Systems,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
although what would be funny is that if this one, the black one,

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
is like a cartridge loader, if it would actually,

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I would love to test and see if it works with the power-based converter.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
That would be fun, other than that. Neat.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Yeah, kind of funny that it was announced right around the same time,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
because I don't think they just did it as a response.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
They had to have been working on it already.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
You can't really pull something like that out after a week, but yeah.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Well, yeah, they can't, but they've already released this.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
It's just being repackaged and re-released,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
because if you're on Amazon, actually, you can pick one up already.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
I'm not sure if it's the same set of games,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000
although it looks like the game list is pretty similar.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
So it could be akin to an Atari Flashback and an Atari Flashback 2.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
It's kind of similar.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Maybe.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Yeah, okay, I got you, I got you. Interesting.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
All right, well, let's move on. Loki.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000
All right, so there's a cool new hack for the Vita in the Vita TV,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
and actually, I'm probably going to partake in this,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
but basically, it's going to allow you to run emulators and homebrew

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:18.000
and more games on the PlayStation Vita and, I believe, the Vita TV as well.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:24.000
So this is basically called the Henkaku hack that they're doing,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:31.000
and it's basically something that you have to have firmware 3.6 or lower,

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
and it's done through the Vita's web browser.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So you go to a website, and you have to do this every time you do it,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
because it doesn't stay on your actual console.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000
But you go to the website, you access this page, and it loads the hack onto your system.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And then, of course, you load your emulators and all that stuff.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
They have ways to do that as well.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Yeah, and it's pretty awesome.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
So off you go.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I need to check this out, because that looks pretty cool.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
That's interesting that you load it through a website each and every time,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
but it's not something you mod or do anything long-term to the firmware.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Right, and they've tried to make it in a way that it's not going to promote piracy,

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
so they're trying to make it difficult for people to pirate games on it,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
but you're going to be able to run emulators and homebrew stuff and all that.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Well, I'll be curious about that, except can you even get a Vita TV anymore?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I never bought one.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
You might be able to find one close out somewhere.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I mean, I've got mine for 30 bucks, and I don't really use it.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I kind of forget I have it sometimes, because it's so small,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
but I know I haven't updated that firmware forever,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000
so I'm sure it's probably capable of doing this.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
All right, well, let's talk about the next project from Remedy Entertainment.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Remedy Entertainment, of course, made a quantum break on the Xbox One.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Also, Alan Wake, Max Payne.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Quantum Wake?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Perhaps.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Alan Break?

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Perhaps.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
People are curious, you know, oh, what are they going to work on next

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
now that quantum break is kind of all said and done?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
What is the next thing that's going to happen?

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I guess the next project, or at least what's announced so far,

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000
a campaign for the next installment of the free-to-play shooter Crossfire.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
That's Crossfire 2.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Now, granted, you probably don't know this game,

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
because there's not a lot of players stateside.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I guess it does exist, but most of the people that play this game

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.000
are actually in Asia, where Smilegate, who makes the game, is located.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
So Smilegate actually picked Remedy to bring their unique blend of

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
storytelling, memorable characters, and inventive gameplay

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.000
to Crossfire's global audience, and that was in a post on Remedy's blog.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Apparently this has actually been being worked on for some time,

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
but that's all we know right now, so if you're waiting for a sequel

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
to Alan Wake or Quantum Break, we don't know anything yet.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I wouldn't think that this is a huge undertaking that's going to take away

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
from anything else for very long.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I can't be the only one that's not disappointed that this isn't based off

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
of the 90s board game that was shooting ball bearings at each other.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
That game is older than the 90s, it's just that they did the remake.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I think that game goes back to the 70s, but still.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
It didn't have the awesome commercial until the 80s or 90s.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
It caught in the Crossfire.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
That was amazing.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Yeah, no, this is not that same game.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
This is a different game that Remedy will be making that one little add-on for.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
We'll see what happens with that.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Let's get to the mailbag.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you want to participate

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
with our mailbag segment.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and finds some emails

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
that she thinks, hey, this would be a worthy thing to read on the show.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Two from the same person.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
So, shall I begin?

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Yes, you shall.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I am not playing Pokemon Go only because my iPod Touch 5G does not appear to support it.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Every time I've tried to set up an account, the app crashes when I try to uncheck email notifications.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
And then it's no longer able to log in and able to find user info.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Not sure if this is the device because the server was down the first time I tried to create an account.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.000
If I owned a proper smartphone, I'd be all over it like white on.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
What first gen Pokemon is predominantly white, not counting Mewtwo?

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Mewtwo's purple, lavender, whatever.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Well, actually is Mewtwo kind of gray lavender? Not really white.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Mewtwo I think is purple and Mew might be grayish.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Mew's lavender.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Mew's like pink. Right?

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Pinkender.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I do wonder, incidentally, whether people will get confused about the nature of Deus Ex Go.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I assume it's a term based puzzle like the Hitman or Lara Croft Go games.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Not anything AR focused.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Here's hoping nobody's foolish enough to make the word Go the next edge or saga.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Including Vivendi occupied Ubisoft.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.000
No disease jokes please, but are there regional Pokemon planned for South America?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
South America and Africa? Is the game even coming out in those continents?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I think we kind of referenced that earlier in the show when I talked about the Brazil people are very angry and that probably is what originated the hack.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000
I think it's just a matter of they've got to get some more things stabilized with the game first.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
How about they fix their economy and take care of their people before they worry about the game?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I don't know if Niantic can do all that, but as far as Pokemon Go goes, I think they need to fix some of these other issues that are a little more pressing right now.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And it should run on that device. My wife has an iPhone 5 and it runs on that.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.000
There were some difficulties logging in recently with the last update. It required some finagling.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Best bet would be to uninstall the game.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:22.000
If you're logging in with your Google account, which you really should be because to be honest, the Pokemon Club logins have been down more than the Google logins.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So if you were logging in with Google, which I hope you are, you go to your login to Google on a PC or Mac and basically remove the app permissions from it.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And then go back in there and reinstall the game and re-login and all that stuff.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And hopefully it'll work that time and not give you the error that we had the other day, which was enable cookies. So make sure you enable cookies as well.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And I would think this seems obvious, but just to make sure, make sure you have the most recent iOS on there as well.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:57.000
And also the most recent version of the app too, because sometimes it doesn't update automatically.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Yeah, I finally was unable to use my beta app anymore. It finally stopped working for me.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I had to go back into the store and download the real game because the beta stopped working with this latest update.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Oh well.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Also, I would just like to point out that if people want to know what I was talking about Brazil, just look up the past two years of protests and you'll know what I'm talking about.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Or the whole World Cup drama there was at too.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
So moving back to the email.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Finally, purely out of academic curiosity, since I do not yet have a Windows PC or partition on my 2009 MacBook, any idea if the popular Toho games, primarily the shooters, are available at all for legal purchase and download?

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.000
All I've seen are DVD ROMs on Amazon. This comes from Robert M.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I see the screen name Rob Roberts is shared by toy customizer Cheetamus Prime, who has been fairly inactive recently for health reasons.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I was, I know there's a fisherman, there's a DJ in Australia, and there's a gun owner that also uses the name.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And so, yeah, I guess, you know, it's, it's, I guess, not an entirely too difficult name to have.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
So no relation to the famous Julia, for what it's worth.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
But there you go.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I tried to get verified by Twitter this week, by the way, they shot me down.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Unfortunate.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Also, this is the follow up email from the same person.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Yes.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.000
As a quick follow up after the update, I'm no longer hanging on the unable to find a user that the app still crashes on the terms and services page.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Most likely an incompatibility with the fifth gen touch.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Check the website, check the compatibility list.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Yeah, I should say what it'll run on.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Yeah, check compatibility list and make sure you're on the most recent operating system version and the usual.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Make sure you turn it off and then on again.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:54.000
And if all else fails, force loaded on there anyways after you root it, which is what I did on my son's phone.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
It's all I'm sorry, you're not compatible device.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Well, fuck you, because it runs anyways, bitch.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.000
So take that compatible device.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Not that we necessarily endorse all these actions.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Good luck.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Although, you know, again, just try to- Pokemon Go is a game that's supposed to last for a very, very long time.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000
And people want to beat it in three weeks.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
You know, try again in a few weeks.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I bet this landscape will be a lot different than it is now.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
It's a very fast moving thing.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
It's hard to go into the unknown of being the biggest cell phone game of all time.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Anyway, is that it for the mailbag?

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
That is.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Participate at orangehonestradio.com.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I want to make sure the other thing didn't fall off the radar about the shooter games on the Mac.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I have not heard of any of that release.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Hold on, because I knew that I think some were on Steam, so give me a moment.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Because, I mean, I play a lot of my- I have both Macs and PCs.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:02.000
And a lot of the games that I have on Steam for my PC, I can also play on my Mac.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Like, I've been playing Danganronpa 2 on my Mac, so I'll double check a few things for Steam right now.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.000
So if people want to go ahead and continue story-ing, I can research.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Well, sadly, what I have next is not a story, and it will require your attention, DarkSakura.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
But you can get this out of your system real fast.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Oh my god, there's an IKEA game.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
What?

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000
There's a game that looks like an IKEA ad called Home Improvisation.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I'm gonna buy this right now.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Well, hold on, before you click the buy button, we gotta get a little bit of angst out of you.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
And DarkSakura, you must start us off.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Um, fuck you to my wrist, really.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:13.000
I am intensely tired of the constant pain and working on it for an entire week.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:20.000
It's just, yesterday I did nothing but take Norco and ice it and play The Sims.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Literally, that's all I did.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
You know.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Well, and I drank a whole bunch of orange soda.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
But other than that, I'm tired of it.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I had the surgery done to get rid of the lump.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I understood there might be some scar tissue.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I did not expect, I thought that, I expected to have some hardness under the skin.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I expected there to be scar tissue.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I did not expect for the full lump that I had removed to regrow.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
And I wasn't given any warning about it, so.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.000
If I had had some sort of expectation that, yeah, it could happen and that we're gonna keep looking at it,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
then I would be okay, but I'm right-handed.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I can't draw.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I can't play games that much.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And it's basically put so much of what I do on hold, so.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Okay, I'm done.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
All right, Loki.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Um, I was angrier earlier, but then, you know, I had my, uh, surgery, so, you know, that makes everything better.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Um, so, I guess just F you to, ironically enough, bad drivers for people playing Pokemon Go.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Which is ironic because I play Pokemon Go while I drive, despite the stupid warnings of the game.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
The game doesn't know better.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
I mean, seriously.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Um, but there's a lot of people that are new.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:40.000
See, they haven't been playing Ingress for a year like I have been driving, so they're not as, you know,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
they don't know the ins and outs of it.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And it's just like, it's very obvious.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Maybe you're not driving and playing Pokemon Go, but you're at least texting.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Just don't be obvious about it.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Like, when I play, eyes are straight ahead, but I can, like, glance down, you know.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I can catch Pokemon without looking at it.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I mean, that's how long I've played this game.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
So, I don't know.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Just watch where you're going, people.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Seriously.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Um, I don't really have enough view of the week.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Uh, I guess F you to those Cinnabon things for being so freaking addicting.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
In Dark Soccer, they're making me fat by bringing me here.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I asked first.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
She did. She did.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But I can still say F you a little bit.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Um, and, uh, I don't know.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
F you to all the paperwork I've had to do with my car.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
It's like, God, we had to go get the insurance updated.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Then we had to go get repairs done on the old cars.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
There's been a lot of this stuff.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
But I'm glad it's all done, and I really enjoy my new car.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
It's so fun to drive.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
So, um, that part.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
And I have not had to put gas in it yet.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
That's the great thing.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I've, uh, I'm down below half a tank, but, um, I bought the car a week ago Saturday, and I still have not had to put gas in it yet.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
That's the best part of all.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Cool. Love it.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I will say, by the way, is that I just looked up Toho, and while there's not any, I think, official games, um, they're still all, uh, PC shooters.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
So, whatevs.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Alright.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
But I want this home improvement sandbox thing.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Well.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
You can put, you can put mannequins as wheels on a skateboard.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Could you imagine?

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
That's pretty rad.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Well, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna open up the Skypline.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000
While we're flying through, uh, the second half of the show this week, we might end up finishing a little early, which actually might work out,

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
because Dark Soccer, I know, had to take off, um, about 8.30, you said, right?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
So, uh, we'll...

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000
About then. I have to be at work at seven in the morning.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Buh.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Yeah, we'll be saying bye-bye to her in a little bit, but we might be saying bye-bye to everybody.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
We'll see, uh, how the Skypline looks in a little bit.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
We just have a couple more stories, though, first. Loki.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
So, the Oregon Trail is coming back.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:47.000
No, not in the form of a game based on the new Crystal Pepsi, which, by the way, has anyone seen that in the actual stores yet?

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Because I know it's out.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
No, I haven't.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I have not seen it at the stores.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I, I still can't find, you know, you know, apparently it's that time of year for crazy flavored potato chips.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
You know how they do the contest every year?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Well, I guess instead of a contest this year, they're doing flavors from other countries.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
And so they have, like, Szechuan chicken, uh, chips as a flavor.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Uh, chicken tikka masala, uh, is one-

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
That sounds good.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I know, doesn't that sound really good, actually? Because I just love Indian food.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Um, and some Brazilian steak is one of the other flavors, so-

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Do you have to slice the chips off of, like, a bigger chip?

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
If you want.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
What, like, it's a, like, a sword or something?

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
The, uh, Greek yogurt sauce.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Tzatziki.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
That's it. That's the other one that's the other potato chip.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
This is cutest.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
But I, I'm having a hard time finding those.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Apparently they're around.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Have you ever did the tzatziki one before, or, like, some kind of Greek chicken?

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
They didn't do it here. It was gyro. You think of the gyros.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
No, the gyro flavor.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I just want french-fried flavored chips.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Why, why can't we get ketchup chips here in the States?

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Oh, god, no, no.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Ketchup is disgusting.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
God, no, no.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Rob-

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Where are my Canadians at?

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Rob-

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
What?

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
You to mayonnaise is me to ketchup.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Really?

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
But do you eat tomatoes?

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I like tomatoes. I hate tomato soup.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
You know what, though? I'm okay with that because I like eggs, and I like oil, and I like vinegar, but I hate mayonnaise.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:17.000
See, I love mayonnaise, but the thing is I only love either homemade mayonnaise or Hellmann's slash best foods.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Why can't they make, like, potato chips but crusty with all the stuff that they put the seasoned fries on?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Well, don't they, don't they make those, like, fries in a can that are, like, you know what I'm talking about?

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Like, they sell, like, french fry type things.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
You can get a loaf of bread in a can.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Is it like the French, was it the French, uh, French's onions or whatever?

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
No, we don't want Chick-fil-A flavor because it tastes like hatred.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I thought thing, I thought Chick-fil-A was, was okay to eat at now. I thought things, because the guy died.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Yeah, but there's-

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
So they, they, they specifically said they were getting out of that business.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I noticed that something tasted different. Like, the hatred went away, and the chicken started tasting not as great anymore.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
But now, now, uh, there's drama. There's always drama.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
There's always drama.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:03.000
But I do want curry chips to be a thing over here. I agree with, um, I keep misreading your name because I'm blind.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Siata berry?

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I think it's Siata berry.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Siata berry.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Curry chips are great. Um, but-

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And I want to give a shout-out to Alex P. Carson for being in my corner, saying I've been waiting for years for ketchup chips in the US. Thank you, sir.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Just go to Canada. And while you're there, bring me back some Tim Hortons.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Alright, yeah. Alex, we're going to Canada.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.000
You know, actually, I decided what else would be good. HP sauce-flavored chips.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
That'd be alright.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Have you had HP sauce?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
I don't think so.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000
It's basically, it's like-

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
It's a brown sauce.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
You can buy it at the store, because it's really good on fish.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
It's amazing.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
It's seriously, like-

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Akuma J.P. and Chad says, I just came back from a meeting, and OLR is not OLR anymore.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
We're always talking about food.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
You must be new to Orange Launch Radio. Welcome to the show.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Anyways, I don't even know how we got on this tangent here.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Wait, wait, one more. Okay, this is important. This is the flavor I'm going to submit next time Lays does one of those contests. Ready?

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Mm-mm.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Mozzarella sticks.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
That's-

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
That could be good.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Swear to God, if one of you sons of bitches rips off my idea and wins a million dollars off it, I will find you, and I will batter you, and I will deep fry you like you're a mozzarella stick.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Rob, will it have the marinara flavoring?

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I think it has to, for it to work.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000
For it to work. Is that going to be too tomatoey for you?

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:36.000
No, that's fine. I love marinara sauce. I hate tomato soup, and I hate ketchup. Actually, I will take this back. There's one thing. There's ketchup as an ingredient in something like in baked beans, or meatloaf is fine.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Ketchup, I have hated it since I was a child, and I'm still convinced that the two-maggot ratio is law, that there's always maggots in it.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
The two maggots per ounce allowance.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Oh my God. This is what happens also when we're running through the gaming news so fast that we're almost to the end of part B, and it's only been 30 minutes, so, uh,

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Okay, so anyways, let's talk about the Oregon Trail. So the Oregon Trail-

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Oh, right! Let's-

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Oregon Trail is going to become a card game.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Let's talk about those new and awesome groundbreaking video games.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
This is a video game.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Yeah, it's going to be a card game, or a card and dice game, that's going to be coming exclusively to Target stores in the future.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Did you just call it Target?

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I did.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Okay.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Because I'm being ironic, so.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
That's Target for all you-

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Oh, okay, thank you. Thank you.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
All you, you know, non-one percenters out there.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:42.000
So basically it's going to be a two to six person game. It's got supply cards and also, um, you know, some other stuff.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:50.000
And I guess you take turns and draw cards and stuff happens. And someone gets dysentery.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Stuff happens. Do you actually- okay.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:58:07.000
One of the best things about the Oregon Trail on the Apple IIe's back in the day was that as you would play the game, you would come across the tombstones of people who have previously played the game.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000
So, you know, you would be going down the road and then all of a sudden you have come across a tombstone. Would you like to see it? And you'd hit yes.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:22.000
It would be like, here lies balls or whatever the person named their family, you know, died of dysentery on whatever day.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Here lies hairy balls.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Exactly, right? That's, that's what happens. It comes up because these were always in the school.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Oh my God, that's the next person I'm going to make for my Sims family is hairy balls.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Anyway, hello maturity. Um, so anyway, my question is, would you actually get to make cards that are tombstones when you die and you put them in the decks that they come up in later games?

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Um, probably not, but that would be cool.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
That would be cool.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Did any of you ever play the Oregon Trail?

01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Oh, whoa, hold on, hold on. It does come with it. It says right here, the game even comes with gravestones, so players can write down their names and how they died on their final resting place.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
They thought of everything.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:09.000
That just seemed like the most obvious idea. Cause you know I design card games now after last week's calls.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I design card games now, just in case you missed that. No, I'm kidding.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Alright, anyway, Oregon Trail.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Oregon Trail.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
The Oregon Trail.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
The Oregon Trail.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Yeah, the zombie one.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Maybe you're in a station wagon.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I think that is one of my Steam games that's in my library that I've never touched, which is, which is unfortunate.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
It's pretty funny.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Yeah.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Alright.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Stoppy in chat says the Hunt family lost many members of their family named Mike.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Yeah, that that did in the second grade that would always happen was you're playing the Oregon Trail.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I dated a Benjamin Dover.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Like for real?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Like for real.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Okay.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
How was that?

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:55.000
It was short lived.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Alright.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Let's see going to chat.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.000
S2100 Matt says I still have a Pokemon snap game save with the name is boobies.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:09.000
My brother and I did that so that Professor Oak would say welcome back boobies at the start of every game.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Okay.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Beep beep. Here goes the tangent train leaving the station.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I know you people have done this shit in video games is that you've given your characters absolutely disgusting, horrific, sophomoric names.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Okay.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Just so you can giggle like that.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Well, yeah, we called the Horse and Derby Owners Club, Politary.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Yeah, I don't know about like giving people names.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I'm sure I probably did.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
But the only thing I remember recently was Animal Crossing teaching them phrases.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Oh, God, that was that was the best part of Animal Crossing was teaching them to say vile things.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
And then they would move to your neighborhood, but then one of your friends neighborhoods.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
So it's like, what is this disgusting thing?

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000
I'm still pissed at whoever took my lesbian.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I found Dina again and happy home designer and made her a gem that would make any stereotypical lesbian very happy.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Stereotypical.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Alex P. Carson says I have a Nintendog named Shit.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Well, that's come here you little shit.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000
But here's the thing. Is shit a shih tzu?

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Because that would be that's like the Robert Roberts of dogs.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Shih tzu.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Were you going by the South Park naming convention Shitty Shih Tzu?

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Shitty the Shih Tzu?

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Yeah, it's actually these all sound like John Waters characters.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I always envisioned my name as being inspired by a John Waters movie, even though it actually wasn't.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000
You know, that's that's what it sounds like to me.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Let's see. Act F says it sucks that the latest Pokemon games don't let you put curse words for names.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Have you seen the things people are calling the Pokemon that they put on gyms?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
You can get away with a lot in Pokemon Go apparently.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I've only named one Pokemon a different name.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Well, I mean, I named my Eevees whatever so I could evolve them.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:06.000
But I have one Rattata named Rat X because when Dan and I first played Pokemon Blue.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
He was playing right. I was playing blue.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
We each named our first Rattata Rat X.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000
And so that's the only one we have ever renamed.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
However, you can cause up a storm in Miitomo.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Yes, you can.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.000
My I've met Miis that have said some bizarre dirty shit.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Also, I learned something today that you're me and Miitomo cannot say we you properly.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Really?

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
It's way you.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
That is kind of funny that they didn't teach the Miis to say that.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
That's great.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
What else is going to say without the oh, the silly names and the immature names.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Here's the thing.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Classic arcade games, in my opinion, this is mandatory for me.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Like I just I have to do it.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.000
I can't not do this if I'm at a convention or something, you know, where a lot of people are going to be.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
And, you know, so forth.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:00.000
If I get a high score in a game that I'm decent at, like Dig Dug or something like I can get pretty far in one quarter on Dig Dug.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:09.000
And if I make the leaderboard or whatever, I'll put my initials in as VOG or OLR or something, you know, that means a lot to me.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:18.000
But if I'm just some random arcade that probably turns off the power at night and erases the high score table anyway, or just, you know, someplace that isn't that notable.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000
I always, always put my initials in as A-S-S.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
You have to put your initials in this ass.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
You just, how can you not?

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Dark Sakura, have you ever put your initials in his ass?

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
No, actually it's always been S-A-K.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
For Sakura?

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Yeah.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Really?

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Or Saku.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Do you ever put your initials in his ass?

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Loki, do you ever do that?

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
No.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
It's just me?

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Well, Dan used to do his because of Daytona as DMX for Dan Man X until, you know, the artist DMX was around because of how it would say it.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000
D-M-X!

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Like that.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
So Dan always did that.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Somebody's a dance maniacs fan.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Now it's just Dan.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Well, if you-

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I'm trying to take a picture, trying to find a picture of Rat X for you guys.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:15.000
On those games where you have four spots for initials, because that happens sometimes, I always put my initial in as A-S-S exclamation point.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
So it's kind of a similar thing.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
You're a happy ass.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Ass!

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Ass!

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Alright, Stoppy in Chat says, I go with Ho, H-O-E. That's a good one.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Shit, S-H-T.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000
And SSU100Matt says, Billy Mitchell puts his name down as USA, I think.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Maybe I should just put my-

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
That's such a Billy Mitchell thing to do.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I should just put mine down as CNT.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Can't?

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Girl.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Count?

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Girl.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Alright, and let's get to something a little more serious here.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
My gosh, we can't keep talking.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
We can't keep bringing the show down with our gutter chat.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I got the last story here tonight, and it's another story about-

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Why does Weepin' Bill look like a condom?

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
How appropriate.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
What did I just fucking say?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Anyhow, so this is another story about Pokemon.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Apparently, there is a new Etsy shop called Geeky Sex Toys.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Actually, I don't know if it's a new shop, but they have a new line called Pokemon.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And Pokemon is over 100 different handmade dildos and butt plugs that are modeled after Pokemon.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Such as Bulby, Charmy, and Squirty.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
And there's-

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
At least it really squirts.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
There's also, you know, because to be fair, maybe you need something a little bit of a

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:58.000
different caliber, you can also get shaped as a Pikachu tail, a butt plug, if you are

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
so inclined.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
That actually sounds cute.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Does it?

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Because I don't know-

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I don't know if cute is the word I would use.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I'm not into that, but I know people who would find it completely adorable.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Like the part that sticks not in your butt, but the other part is the tail, right?

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:21.000
And this article goes on to say, the Bulby has a large seat tip, making it a very pleasurable

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
friend to have.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:30.000
And apparently, it looks like it's a little Bulbasaur sack, but it looks like balls,

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
basically, on the end of this.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
So, there you go.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Enjoy, everybody, the Pokemoan dildos.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Goodnight.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
You've been listening to Orange-

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Okay, I'm kidding.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
But everybody in chat is like, drop the mic and end the show.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
So, there it is.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Let's see.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Prince Peach Fuzz in chat says, Licky Tongue.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Is there a Licky Tongue?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000
You would think that would be the most obvious thing to put.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Gosh, if only I had a link to the Pokemoan.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Oh, hey, how about that?

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Let me go look at the-

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Oh, my God.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Pokemoan site right now.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
I was right about the butt plug.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
What?

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
What about it?

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
You see the Pikachu tail?

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I just want to trim that little part.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Starring Dark Sakura.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
I was right about the butt plug.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
All right, whatevs.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Let's see.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000
There's also a Charmy, which has the flaming tail.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Wow, these are really something.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
There's a disclaimer here, by the way.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:41.000
All toys are sold as a novelty only, and the buyer accepts all responsibility for what the product is used for.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
There you go.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Alex P. Carson says he's going to make that sound clip, his new Windows startup sound.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000
You should make it the sound every time you get a text message.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
There you go.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I will not be using it.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:04.000
A nice, mature note to end things on here tonight here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Hey, let's open up the phones.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Hey, why don't you guys dirty up the show even more?

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Our Skype line is open.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:17.000
OMG, I am on the wrong account, so I'm going to switch to our right Skype account, which is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I took a picture of Rat X. It's just on my Twitter, so I'm trying to find it because it doesn't want to load.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:34.000
I was logged into my personal Skype account because I was guesting on a podcast yesterday, and as soon as that's posted, I will have to share it with you all.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Well, this is great live radio, and I'm on the wrong damn Skype account.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Okay, now I'm on the right Skype account, so you can give us a call.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call, and we will be taking your calls later in the show.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Right now. Call up.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Loki, do you have any last? Oh, never mind. The phone's ringing, so I can get to some calls right now.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
If Skype will work, it's being very slow.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
There we go. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
It's Ranma.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Hi, Ranma. How are you?

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
I was doing good.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000
You just killed it for me in the last 20 minutes.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:19.000
I want you to know, we talked about the Pokemon dildos on our show, but god damn it, Ranma, you just killed it. You just took it to the next level.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Hey, I know how to use dildos. What can I say?

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I love that too, by the way. Yeah, my night was doing pretty good, and then I started listening to OLR.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I just want you to know, I will not say anything in regards to you and dildos, because I am pleading the Fifth Amendment. I refuse to incriminate myself.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Fair enough, fair enough. Hey, though, speaking of incriminating, I will ask this question. I'm going to ask all our callers this tonight.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:54.000
How do you enter your initials on the high scoreboard on a classic 80s arcade machine? What do you put your initials in as?

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I actually use my real name initials, AHW.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Do you really?

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:11.000
After a while, when I figured out what my screen name would be, if it's big enough, I would put DJRS, or you know, or during my phase of writing fan fiction, I would take one of my characters and use their initials or whatever.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Okay, alright, I like that. So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Oh, a lot of stuff, but first things first, I'm going to send you a care package of ketchup flavored potato chips.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Bless you, bless you, bless you. I'm so happy to hear that. I didn't know, do they, maybe they, maybe I could find them around here if I looked harder. I don't think I've ever seen them at Trader Joe's or anything like that, though.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000
But it seems like the type of thing I ought to be able to find at like, maybe Whole Foods.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000
No, you probably, you better try like a grocery store or a drugstore. There's a local-

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Oh, they don't have them here.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:51.000
There's a local company called HERS that makes them, so I see them at ShopRite all the time, so I can buy you, put them in a box and send them over.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Cost plus.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Except the last few times I've been to cost plus, I haven't seen anything like that, but they've got stuff from all over, so.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Well, you know, if Rama wants to send me a care package, who am I to complain?

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Exactly, because I'll be sending Jamie a care package, too.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
There you go.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Is it going to have Tim Hortons in it?

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Yes, there is one Timmy Ho's left in New York City.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Okay, just to let you know, I like things that are chocolate.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Hey, I don't have the problem anymore of a lack of Dunkin' Donuts. We actually have a couple here in SAC now. My how times have changed.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Oh yeah, definitely.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Crazy.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:33.000
As for your Lay's chips, I've been finding them at local drugs or Walgreens, but I have to tell you, the Szechuan chicken is so good.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Alright, I gotta try that.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
It's probably too spicy for me.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
It's not even that spicy, though, but.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Oh my god, pickled chips are the grossest thing. Oh god, I feel sick. I'm going to go buy.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Are you leaving the show now?

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Well, I kind of have to in a few minutes, so I may as well log out.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Alright, well, final thought for our listeners real quick on your way out.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Um, I really, I'm so full right now between all that Chinese food and the Cinnabon Delights. Just roll me out.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Just roll you home?

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Just roll me home.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
There you go. Alright.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Ran-chan?

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Yes?

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Hearts.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Hearts.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Uh, anything else on your mind, Rama?

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Some stuff. I just want to say, right now, Mako-chan just woke up and went, mmm, dill pickled chips.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.000
I don't know why. She just loves them. But anywho.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I love the deep-fried ones that they have at, like, restaurants sometimes. Like, bar restaurants will have, like, deep-fried pickles. So good. So good.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.000
They are good, but you know what, Rob? Right now, put a thing of coffee on. We got to talk.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Okay.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Alright?

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
We got to talk. What's up?

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Pokemon Go. I mean, I've already said it on my personal Facebook. I'm tired of everybody bitching about something that they got for free.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:55.000
I am tired of everybody bitching at the developers, the programmers. This is my field. I get it. I understand everybody's issues.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:00.000
I understand everyone's complaints. They're doing the best that they can. They are fans of the series as well.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:07.000
And I can tell you this. There are a lot of people in the whole IT tech programming field who suck talking to other people.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:15.000
They'll keep everything within themselves. When it's done, they'll be like, here it is. You just won't even know half the time.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
They'll be like, here. It's there. You know?

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I think most people just need to take a step back and calm their tits and not react so emotionally because a lot of people, and I'm saying everybody,

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:34.000
there are some valid complaints about what's going on with Niantic. The fact that they don't have any type of real good PR system really sucks.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.000
And I think they could use that right now really badly. And I'll definitely agree with that.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:49.000
But I think at the same time, take a step back and ask yourself, does Niantic really exist to create the biggest cell phone game of all time and then piss everybody off?

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Like because Niantic hates, like that's what some people are saying. Niantic hates the player base.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Take a step back and think about what you're really saying for a minute.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Like, is there money to be made in hating your player base? I'm not so sure about that.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:12.000
And I think a lot of these issues, if you'll just calm your tits, give it a few days, it's going to work out.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
It's going to be fine. And you'll have years and years to catch them all.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I'm sorry. Now I'm thinking of like, you remember those sprinklers that had the little hoses that went all over the place, the silly sprinklers?

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000
I'm imagining tits like that now. Well, that's everybody right now.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Basically, like I'm in this Facebook community for Pokemon Go and like anytime I see a post in that community, that's what it looks like.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Hellrauma's post kind of looked like that a little bit, not your post specifically, but the comments kind of looked like that a little bit.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000
I got into it. Well, you know, when I say I got into it, like I, you know, I don't take it that seriously.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
I haven't been on Facebook in three days. Good for you.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
So I really need to do the same thing.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Because I'm tired. Tired, tired, tired.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Hey, at least it wasn't politics. I'd rather argue-

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
That's what chased me off.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I would rather argue about stupid Pokemon than fucking politics. That's it.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Well, I'm going to say goodbye to everybody now.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Bye.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Bye.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Anything else, Rama?

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I just want to get that off my chest because you feel me on this. I mean, praise Breslau for what he said. Praise that man. Okay?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Yeah, I don't give that man kudos very often, but he deserved it for that one.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Yes, yes. Before I get out of here, I was going to show y'all a picture of my awesome Pokemon Go t-shirt, but I'll do that later.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:34.000
But since you were talking about odd names and stuff like that, I'm going to post a link in the chat room called 14 Perfect Names People Gave Their Pokemon.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I'd recommend not drinking anything while you look at this list.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Is this stuff like the Love is Love on the Westboro Baptist Church and all that stuff? Things like that?

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:50.000
No, but it's more funny, tongue-in-cheek, borderline perverted. Stuff that, you know, like, you know what? I would have done the same thing.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.000
I don't like perverted jokes, Rama. That's trashy.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
You suck at trolling, Mr. Rob Roberts.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Yeah, right. Whatever.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Alright. Well, I look forward to your care package, and I'll be sure to send you a care package in return. And who knows, maybe if the label says Pokemon on it, don't be surprised.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:17.000
If that happens, I will be giving them away as prizes on my show.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Hooray!

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:33.000
I do know for a fact there are people out there that I know that will buy them, and they have, and they're like, you realize what you're buying? Yes. Are you going? Alright. You go do you. I'll be over here.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Do you think that Bobby would let me bring back the VOG Network giveaways?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
For a squirty?

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:48.000
If we're able to, if you're going to do this, I, Anime Jam Session will back this.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Just, we'll do a VOG Network giveaway, and we'll give away a squirty and a bag of ketchup potato chips, and just call it Friday Night Home Alone.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Where's the lie, though?

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Alright, Rama, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Alright, you stay fabulous, man.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Take care, my friend.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000
You too. Bye.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Act Afton Chat says, Black Wolf's ears must be burning hot right now. Probably smoke coming out of them.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Actually, if he's driving, I don't know what his schedule was, but if he's driving home, he probably is listening in his car, because, you know, those Tesla spaceships, he can beam whatever internet thing he wants.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.000
He probably actually is listening on TuneIn right now, so hopefully he didn't crash the car.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:40.000
That's alright. That's what the autopilot's for, is to help not crash the car in those situations.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Don't get started on that video. I think Bobby had to finally turn off the emails from that video, because it's been every-

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Hey, I gotta get props. We finally got one to go viral.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Actually, I think that's the second one that went viral, because his Rainbow Road one was kind of viral, but this one's going, like, twice as much.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Rainbow Road.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Yeah, the Easter egg in the Teslas, where you can turn the GPS thing into Rainbow Road.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Well, go check out the video at VOG Network on YouTube, Loki, and you won't give me that puzzled face anymore.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Alright, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype. Meanwhile, while we wait for a call, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories you want to share with us?

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Yeah, there's some good news regarding EVO and their coverage on ESPN. Apparently, they had some two million unique viewers, about averaging that 20 minutes each, so that's pretty good.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:35.000
So, hopefully, that means more of the same type of thing going forward for future events. More coverage.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Awesome. One more call for calls. Put the call out there for calls. OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, we'd love to hear from you guys about anything.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:55.000
It doesn't have to be perverted. Just because Rama calls in about pervert- I'm just kidding. It doesn't mean you have to. Anything else, Loki?

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Nope.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Not a lot else going on?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Not a lot else going on.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Alright, what are you going to play this week while you're waiting for No Man's Sky to be released?

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Probably just Pokemon Go. I've been trying to actually sit down and program, but like even last night, like after- I had to go in a different room because my wife's still watching, grazing out of me. It's very distracting.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:31.000
And then that's when I realized that the update to Pokemon Go happened, so I had to help her get it installed, and of course there was a whole login issue, and after all that, and then finally I got to sit down and watch stuff, and it was uncomfortable seeing it at the kitchen table for that long.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:46.000
So I went back into the living room, started watching videos, and like just literally passing out from being tired. So I'm trying to work. I have Unity up. I'm meaning to do it.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
I launch the program, and then I just stare at the screen.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Seriously? That is exactly- well, it's because I've been kind of going back and forth on how I want to do the engine, because I want to redo everything again on the game I'm working on, and the one way I was going to do it, it's like it was way too complicated, and I don't even- like I kind of thought about it, I'm like, do I really need to be that complicated? No, not really, because it's ridiculous.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:30.000
So I'm going back to what I was originally planning on doing, and so now I'm trying to find a better way to implement that, maybe something that's a little bit more complete, or something that someone's already started a framework on that I can try. Basically just trying to see how to optimize a voxel engine is basically it.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Alright. Well, since there's no more calls coming in, I guess we're going to close up shop for the night, and thank you guys. If you've thought of something after the fact, you want to email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:59.000
And, you know, as I say at the end of every episode, thank you guys for listening to the show, and if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or five about the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only spread those voices if you use them.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:13.000
So please, use your voice, and be on the show. A nice five star review at a place like iTunes or Google Play or wherever you found this show goes an awful long way as well.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:24.000
But that is going to do it for another episode until we are back in seven days to do it all over again. Get really hyped about No Man's Sky, which will be out in just a couple of days at that point, and whatever else happens in gaming in the next week.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Maybe Pokemon Go changes something else this week, and that'll get everybody all in a tizzy, or there'll be something else. Who knows?

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
But meanwhile, final thoughts. Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Well, even though he's not on the show yet, hopefully soon, but happy birthday to my son Josh. He'll be turning six tomorrow.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Oh, happy birthday! Six years old! My gosh. Time flies.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Exactly. He's playing Pokemon Go and everything.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
That is awesome. Well, happy birthday.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
That will be my final thought too, because you know what? I didn't really have anything else in mind.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:58.000
So happy birthday to Joshua and anybody that might be celebrating a birthday in the coming days.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:03.000
That is going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening. Really appreciate it.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:09.000
We'll see you in seven days to do it all over again. Can't believe it's already going to be August. Where does the time go?

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
See you guys. Have a good one.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:18.000
