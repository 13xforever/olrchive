0	28000	This week excitement reaches a bursting point as a leaked copy of No Man's Sky results in a number of gameplay videos becoming available to the thirsty masses. But that's just the surface of 18 quintillion planets. Join us for plenty more news right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live for this July the 31st of 2016, episode number 652 of our show.
47000	61000	My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E. And joining me here in Studio N7 here in lovely Sacramento, California. Lovely and hot are my co-hosts. Say hello, welcome back this week, DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
62000	63000	Hi.
64000	65000	Hi, how are you?
66000	67000	A combination of very full and sore.
68000	70000	Very full and sore. Did you do yoga today?
70000	86000	No I didn't do yoga. I slept through yoga and I woke up sore and I decided that I just needed to eat. I was not going to get Chinese food until you told me you had Chinese food. And I was like, oh my god that sounds so good.
86000	92000	Let's hold on a minute. There's actually a difference. We had Panda Express today which isn't, I mean it's not really Chinese food.
93000	94000	It's Chinese.
95000	110000	It's America's perception. It's everything America likes about Chinese food and then kind of amplified. I mean, heaven forbid DarkSakura. It's like saying Taco Bell is Mexican food. Let's be real. Taco Bell is not Mexican food. It's something that kind of resembles Mexican food.
110000	114000	And that's what Panda is. It's good. But like orange chicken.
115000	121000	If you want to see something hilarious, watch the BuzzFeed about Chinese people eat Panda Express.
122000	123000	Oh I bet. I bet.
124000	131000	And the kids are like, this doesn't taste authentic. And the old parents are like, this is pretty good. I like this. I'm going to eat this again.
131000	143000	No I had some. My favorite dish there is like a steak dish. It's like Angus. There's no way this is Chinese but it's really good. It's what I want. So whatever. I wanted it.
144000	145000	And then I brought Cinnabon Delights.
146000	151000	I'm going to gain 500 pounds before it's time to go to Dragon Con which is one month away until I leave.
151000	160000	I can't. Well I have to go on an elimination diet for 30 days to see what is actually making me sick. So I figured I just make myself really sick anyway.
161000	165000	And then remember why I'm not eating any of that so that I don't get sick.
166000	170000	So this is your last kind of binge before that. So make the most of it.
171000	175000	Also joining us to see is every week. Say hello to tech master Loki.
176000	177000	Hello. Hi Loki. How are you? I'm doing good.
178000	179000	Hey I got some news for you.
179000	185000	So on last week's show you were or maybe it was the week before you were talking about this like show you're obsessed with on Netflix Stranger Things.
186000	193000	Oh yes yes. So I watched that. I sat down on Friday to watch it. I was like oh everybody freaking raves about this show and won't shut up about it.
194000	198000	Loki won't shut up about it. My Twitter people. So OK I'm going to sit down and watch an episode on Friday.
199000	205000	I had binged the entire thing by 12 hours later. I went to bed on Friday. I woke up Saturday and I finished it on Saturday.
205000	212000	So I guess it's kind of like one of those like screw you and thank you all at the same time. No it was great. It was so good.
213000	220000	The way I describe it is it is like the best Stephen King miniseries ever that Stephen King had nothing to do with.
221000	227000	Yeah pretty much. Pretty accurate right. Yes. Or like Stephen King and Spielberg or something like that.
228000	231000	And the soundtrack is on point. You're absolutely right. And they're going to release it too.
231000	237000	I know that's awesome. They have some great like 80s songs and what's interesting is that they have like covers of 80s songs that are really good.
238000	247000	Like one of my favorite scenes I'm not going to spoil don't worry but one of my favorite scenes in the whole thing used a cover of David Bowie's Heroes by Peter Gabriel that was released in the 80s.
248000	258000	And I thought that was really really good. Lots of great 80s references. But the thing about it and as like somebody was trying to tell me explain it to me is that it's it's really great.
258000	269000	And the way it refers to the 80s without like shoving it down your throat like everything's very subtle and I think that's what makes the show really work is that it looks like you're watching a show that was made in 1985.
270000	281000	But it's just oh it's high definition on Netflix and widescreen and all that. But it feels like you're just watching something that was made in 1985 except wow Winona Ryder is like 20 years older and now she's the mom instead of the daughter.
281000	294000	And she's great and deserves an Emmy. Absolutely. She deserves an Emmy and the little girl character deserves an Emmy. They all deserve an Emmy. Just get Oprah to hand Emmys to the entire cast.
295000	310000	I mean it's just it's interesting to see all these shows that come to like Netflix now they're just like these really great shows. I mean oh God. And even like even before that you know just like these shows coming to like Annie or you know all the you know like you're walking
310000	323000	deads and just like all these really great series there on these cable channels. Whereas like OK like the normal like basic cable channels like what the fuck are you guys doing. I mean seriously there's nothing. No one gives a shit about your fucking sitcoms.
323000	333000	And I know this is a video game show but I think this is important about that particular TV series too is that the plot was very much like something I would see in a scary video game.
333000	347000	And one thing I really liked about it. You guys know that like I'm cool with scary things but I don't like gore. Like I hate those saw movies and stuff but Stranger Things was very very well done without having any gore or like over the top.
347000	357000	But like there was just only like a couple scenes that were like but it was like it was like PG 13 at worst like it's not. Yeah I wasn't not even too bad. It was just like kind of more creepy than.
357000	371000	Yeah exactly. And it it's very obvious again I'm not going to spoil but it's very obvious. And they've even said in interviews the guys who created that who I don't think have done a lot of other stuff. I think they did like one other show that maybe was on cable somewhere.
371000	383000	But this is like kind of their first big thing. But they've said in interviews that they were influenced by Silent Hill. And there is a very like you know again I'm not going to spoil anything but there's very obvious ties like things that I'm like oh this.
383000	396000	Especially not to spoil anything was specially the very very end of the series. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah for sure. So anyway we will. We've got to be careful we don't want to go into spoiler territory but I'm sure a lot of you guys have been watching it anyway.
396000	407000	And yeah I just. So yeah you think we're we're paid off by them but we're not. It really is that good. I really enjoyed it and I hope I hope they do get a second season. My hope. Oh they have a second season. Oh good.
407000	422000	My hope was that they would go kind of the American horror story route and that the second season would have no ties to the first season. But going to be the case. Well yeah. Then in the last 20 minutes obviously they kind of leave it open for a second season.
422000	433000	I was I was actually that was my I have two major issues with it. One of them I can't talk about because it's a total spoiler. The other is that it it didn't need to leave it open for a sequel.
433000	450000	I don't think it was. It wasn't like you know how like some movies do it really cheesy bad how they set up for a sequel. Like it's like one of those like wink type of things. I mean it doesn't do that but it's just like I would have been totally fine if they just kind of put a bow on it and was done and then the second season was just a completely different story.
450000	460000	It's also very like not plausible it's like yeah this thing just happened to me and I'm not going to tell anybody about it. I'm going to keep it a secret.
461000	480000	Going to our chat. We do tape live of course every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network. VoG Network dot com. 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Except not this week. Bobby was out at I believe it's called Fandom Fest in Kentucky and hopefully was doing some videos there.
480000	490000	I know he was taping with Pod Culture another show here at the Voice of Geeks Network and you'll get to hear that episode with both Pod Culture and Bobby on Monday so you stay tuned for that.
490000	501000	But he was there so he wasn't live tonight but we're live here at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern. If you are listening to our show live you should join our chat over at live dot VoG Network dot com.
501000	517000	SSG100Matt says breaking news. Rob will be starting a Stranger Things podcast starting Thursday. Don't tempt me. Don't tempt me because I could do it. I could do it. Isn't four enough.
517000	531000	I technically already have one. Apparently I was unaware of this but there's a YouTube show that's like after the show or something like that with Netflix or something. They actually talk about shows that are on Netflix and it's sponsored by Netflix.
531000	547000	Of course. Do they do wrap ups of Chelsea? I don't know. That's like the first Netflix show that isn't all at once because it actually is top time and topical so they can't you know she tapes it what three times a week so I'd be curious to see what Netflix is going to do with that format.
547000	561000	But anyway I'm getting off track. Let's see. Other comments from chat over at live dot VoG Network dot com. Act deaf talking about Daredevil. Jessica Jones was fantastic too so and those are shows admittedly I haven't even touched but everybody raves about Jessica Jones as well.
561000	579000	You need to read the comics and see the show and see the show because if you if you read Alias and then go watch this so that you know the differences between the two you can see where they got certain things in the show directly from the comic like whole lines.
579000	594000	And you were a big fan of Kristin Ritter being cast as. Yeah I thought she did great. Yeah Jessica Jones. I've read Alias and the pulse like so many freakin times. She is my favorite character so I thought that she was cast well and everything.
594000	605000	Let's see other comments from chat over at live dot VoG Network dot com. Raginator says sky doesn't like gore but sky. He works so hard advocating for the environment and he invented the Internet.
605000	616000	Ha ha ha. Actually that was one of the that was one of Raginator's first good jokes. So I read that one on air. So good job Raginator. You get a cookie or no you get a Cinnabon delight because we have way too many of those here.
617000	632000	I ate the last cookie. So what exactly is a Cinnabon delight. Have you not eaten it. Eat one. It is so good. Oh wait those are the ones that are like churros right. Kinda. They're even better. It tastes like donuts with like icing inside but it's a really odd texture at first.
632000	644000	Yeah. You're so picky. So picky. All right. Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and the rest of the game gaming news.
644000	657000	So there's lots of we're finally getting back into a lot of big stories going on. And this week we have a pretty big one with No Man's Sky is probably the next big release that a lot of people are looking forward to right.
657000	674000	No Man's Sky is going to be out August 9th. Is that right. A week from Tuesday. That's correct. So we're in the home stretch of that. And you know this was a game that for a long time here on this show I used to kind of give a hard time because remember how like they would do this presentation after presentation.
674000	688000	There was an E3 then the PlayStation Expo and every time they would show the game it was like they were showing the exploration which looked really cool. But I was always sitting there going and the game. What's the game. What is the game element in this.
688000	705000	Now to be fair they have since you know talked a little more about the game and there's videos and so forth. But one thing that you know kind of hasn't been out there is a lot of those like early looks or first few minutes or any of that stuff until this week.
705000	725000	Well they have like 20 like long play sessions but it wasn't like the first section of the game. Yes. Yeah. Some portion of the game. So this week somebody to make a long story short somebody bought a copy of the game it was a leaked copy of the game somebody bought it on eBay for thirteen hundred dollars.
726000	745000	OK that's dumb. A user on Reddit named Daimi Un bought that. Wait wait wait hold on. Did you just razz a guy for spending thirteen hundred dollars. Yes that's way too much money for a game especially it's come out one week. Didn't you buy an early copy of Motorstorm Apocalypse that came out several months earlier than the actual release.
745000	756000	It's like wait I just didn't remember you. Thirteen hundred dollars on it either. And it was a collector's edition. And yeah. So no I would never spend thirteen hundred dollars on a game to get it one week early.
756000	770000	I still feel a little pot and kettle going on here but that's OK. So anyway so he bought the game and it was kind of one of those things where it sounds like he didn't really originally set out on putting all this footage out there.
770000	782000	But he would put a little bit like he put the here's the unboxing and of course the internet goes more more more. And then it was like oh I'm going to put a little more more more. So finally he put like twenty five minutes the like from the beginning of the game out there.
782000	794000	And you know the creator of the game is not happy about it Sean Murray who is the Hello Games founder on Twitter put we've spent years filling No Man's Sky with surprises.
794000	807000	You've spent years waiting. Please don't spoil it for yourself frowny face. To Damien's credit he did go back on Reddit in a final post and said you should just wait and experience the game first hands.
807000	818000	The first videos I posted were perfect. They spoiled nothing. There are more spoilers than you probably realize with this game. I'm only a couple hours in barely touched a few planets and I've already had many fuck yeah moments.
818000	829000	On the one hand I'd love to share those with you but on the other hand Sean is right why not just wait and experience them first hand. That almost makes me wonder if the whole thing was scripted but that's okay.
829000	851000	But I'm not I don't really fault the Reddit user for doing what he did especially listening to the cries of everybody and you know people people kind of want to know what it is that they're going to buy you know because the creators of No Man's Sky and everybody they're asking people to drop sixty dollars on this game and in some ways it's a little bit of a leap of faith.
851000	863000	Like we know a little bit about the game but we don't necessarily know as much as we do about a lot of video games when they come out. It's almost like the movie that isn't screened for critics.
863000	870000	And sometimes you worry a little bit about the movie that isn't screened for critics because what does that usually mean when a movie isn't screened for critics?
870000	874000	It's Ghostbusters.
874000	879000	I guess whatever. Although I think that was screened for critics to be fair but anyway.
879000	881000	All the reviews are embargoed.
882000	900000	To be fair that's totally normal and I'm sure No Man's Sky I'm sure a lot of critics in the gaming industry have played No Man's Sky and they are probably all embargoed until oh I don't know probably the weekend before the Monday before or just before when they're allowed to release their stuff.
900000	919000	So but is anybody going to wonder about how did a leaked copy end up on eBay in the first place? That to me would be the thing I'd really be ticked off about if I were this guy from Hello Games is how did a copy of my game get on eBay for thirteen hundred dollars?
919000	920000	It's so easy.
920000	921000	Yeah?
921000	929000	I mean I don't know where this copy came from but I mean stuff gets leaked out early. Shipments get sent accidentally.
929000	941000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Stoppy says getting a shady early copy is probably a great way to make your Twitch channel blow up. Maybe that's worth thirteen hundred dollars.
941000	954000	Well actually Twitch could ban you for that. Twitch has in the user agreement that you're not supposed to play games that aren't out yet basically. Especially ones that are obtained through questionable means.
954000	965000	Piracy and stuff like that. And they have banned users of big releases like I'm thinking like the Call of Duty's and the Modern Warfare's and those games release and you're playing them on Twitch. They've banned those users.
965000	974000	So that actually wouldn't work. In fact these videos went on I think Daily Motion because YouTube was pulling them as fast as they were posting them.
974000	976000	And Daily Motion pulled them too so.
976000	992000	Yeah well eventually yeah Daily Motion pulled them too. Although I saw it on YouTube but it wasn't like it was through like a. It was like a channel from Brazil or something that probably. Maybe they either flipped the game image or did something with it so it wouldn't get picked up automatically. You know how people do that right?
992000	996000	They'll distort the image or slow it down speed it up or you know so.
997000	1009000	I don't think this one they'd be able to pull like you know just based off of like it matching it it's more of something manually matching. You know especially with it like all these people reporting on it. This is easier to report the link.
1009000	1013000	Yeah. Well did you did you actually get to watch any of the footage?
1013000	1014000	Nope.
1014000	1024000	I watched a little bit. I didn't sit and watch all 25 minutes but I kind of just pecked around the you know on the seek bar kind of looked at little portions and it looks interesting. I'm excited to try it.
1024000	1034000	You know it looked like there was like kind of like some crafting type of stuff going on like he was trying to like mine the planet surface for stuff but I don't think that was really anything that we didn't already know about the game.
1034000	1035000	No.
1035000	1041000	Yeah so I guess I was successful in not spoiling any plot details for myself which might be the stuff they're trying to keep.
1041000	1043000	I heard it runs really nice.
1043000	1064000	Yeah it seemed to look really good. To me it actually looked like once you have the interface and the UI on it it actually looks different to me than it does in a lot of those previews. I mean not in a bad way it's just like wow this game doesn't look like it did in those previews but those previews like were like UI free like there was nothing in them you know.
1064000	1076000	It was just like look at the planet surface. So let's see going to chat for more comments over at live dot vog network dot com Tiger class says Yeah I think Twitch has a policy or something about closed betas.
1076000	1089000	I don't think Twitch allows people streaming games that are on closed betas since those games are under NDA by the beta testers Dungeon Buster points out NBA Elite 11 was canceled and then copies somehow made it to eBay.
1089000	1091000	I might have been disgruntled developers.
1091000	1105000	That was actually where they had shipped it late already. It actually had shipped and then got pulled back. Just remember the same thing happened with a little big plant. The first one it had already shipped.
1105000	1114000	And then they pulled it back to release the new ones because they had that music in there or something objected to that. But I got one anyways.
1114000	1125000	Well yeah a lot of people still got it anyway so especially it's hard to control what's at every stores as 200 Matt says I thought I heard somewhere that these leaked copies often come from these big box stores.
1125000	1133000	I would be surprised that the big box stores would have the game this early. Wouldn't they know they get FedEx the night before.
1133000	1142000	No I'm not exactly sometimes they have it like the week before but typically it's not that early. Yeah this seems really early for that distributors maybe.
1142000	1149000	Distributors don't get distributors are second classes since compared to big box stores so they're not having that early.
1149000	1158000	Yes all right. Well so this doesn't change anybody's opinion on no man's sky though right. I'm still I'm totally not buying it now.
1159000	1173000	Don't lie. Yes you are. Of course I actually haven't bought it yet so I have really that. Oh I mean I'm going to get digitally so OK. Yeah I just I put my Amazon thing in like month. Oh no there's not going to be enough copies of the digital version out there.
1173000	1182000	Things game stuff. No doesn't that happen sometimes the digital versions sell out. I thought I saw that happening with some game not that long ago. They may have run out like steam keys or something like that.
1182000	1195000	Depends where you're buying them. Yeah. All right. Let's get to our gaming weeks since no man's sky is now yet. We need to go back and talk about our gaming weeks this week and take a look at some of the video games that we've been playing this week.
1195000	1215000	Dark Sakura how was your gaming week. Very semi as I pretty much only played Sims 4. Uh huh. And I've played Pokemon Go and that's really about in some pebble because pebble is like my time waster.
1215000	1229000	But you always have to have that filthy casual game to fill in the gaps with time. I'm rebuilt. I'm actually completely repopulating every village in my game with all custom built houses and custom designed families.
1229000	1243000	And I have like the family that has like four kids and then I've got like I've just you know just started doing it because it's a good time waster.
1243000	1257000	While I can't really do a whole lot with my hand because I did have that ganglion sister removed and the sisters back. So it still hurts and I can't really play many things.
1258000	1273000	Yeah I remember when you had your wrist surgery some time ago you were kind of out of controller gaming for a while. You could still do some stuff but yeah I it's not really comfortable to really hold any anything actually as I just switch.
1273000	1281000	Yeah. Anything in my hand for very long. So well I hope the doctors get that all fixed up and resolved. You and me both.
1282000	1289000	All right. Loki how was your gaming week. Same as the last few weeks unfortunately because I haven't really been able to play any console games.
1290000	1303000	So I just played a little bit Pokemon Go more than I would have actually wanted to play but my son wanted to go out so we went out and played this weekend.
1303000	1314000	And then right after that we went and had dinner with some friends and went right back to Sutter Street and Old Folsom.
1314000	1328000	So it was like playing the entire time. I literally drained my battery to nothing. And my wife is more obsessed with the game than I am. She's 15. I'm level 20 and a half now. And my son's 12.
1328000	1339000	Geez. I guess I'm not playing enough. I'm about to hit 18. I did the whole trick today where I used an egg and I evolved a bunch of stuff and that got me almost completely through level 17.
1339000	1350000	That's pretty useful. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm not quite 18 yet but I'm almost there. But yeah I was trying like I don't know it's been kind of annoying because it's just been the same Pokemon over and over and over again.
1350000	1361000	Although there was a Bulbasaur I saw the other day who was not even that high level. And I had this is right after I got whatever the third type of Pokeball you have.
1361000	1372000	I don't know if it's a it's not mass. Is it a master ball. I remember with the third water ball ultra ball. That's right. The ultra ball. So I had the ultra ball and with even the raspberry.
1372000	1384000	And he's just like he got caught in it then popped right out and like fuck you I'm leaving. Fuck you I'm out. Yeah I hate it when the little bastards break out.
1385000	1398000	So why not just get work gets worse as you level up. Oh yeah. The artificial difficulty is absolutely stupid. And then it doesn't help that the game's glitched out to where you know forces curveball sometimes.
1398000	1409000	I found a way to sort of fix that for myself. Like if I notice it's doing that I'll try to spin like I'm going to do a curveball and let it kind of cool down and then throw it and then normally go straight.
1409000	1420000	But it's just kind of annoying that does that especially when you're using something like an ultra ball or something like oh hey I'm just going to curve for no fucking reason. It's annoying. So yeah.
1420000	1431000	And yes we know there's a lot of big Pokemon Go news going on right now we'll get to that in a little bit when we get it. Yes. So aside from that little bit tap my Katamari I'm a horrible cheater.
1432000	1450000	What did you do now. You see I have my computer and my computer is really fast. And so I can take a script from auto it and I can link my computer basically to my phone and have the computer click the game for me.
1451000	1466000	And there's really no reason to do this because there's no point to the game. So cheater cheater cheater because I can do. So you built something to click the cookies for because let's be real tap my Katamari is cookie clicker. That's all it is. So you build something to tap the cookies for you.
1467000	1486000	Sort of. Yeah. Cheater at least at least something like that is a single player game. And what you do doesn't really know anybody else. But it's just oh my gosh you're such a cheater. That's kind of I don't know why I'm laughing so hard that you actually built something to click the cookies for you.
1486000	1509000	Because you can still I can. That's the reason because you can. Let's see going to chat over at live dot vog network dot com. Somebody named Vote Trump in chat says damn that is some next level hacks. Perhaps this person wants you to work on somebody's campaign. I don't know what those types of next level hacks.
1510000	1527000	I'm sorry that name's offensive. And then I also played Ingress just a little bit. Usually when Pokemon goes not working and also just to keep my streak going until September when I finally get that last badge. And then I'm just like ah fuck it I'll play it whenever then I'm free.
1528000	1539000	In Dark Sakura it doesn't say what for. It just says vote Trump. You could vote him for biggest poopy head if you want. It just says vote. Voting is important. Maybe they're talking about the cards.
1539000	1548000	Maybe it's a game. Yes it's like a Trump card. Vote it's P. Knuckle. It's a big P. Knuckle fan. That's what it is. No it's offensive.
1549000	1568000	All right. Is that it for your gaming week. Yeah. I think that's basically it. All right. My gaming week. Let's see. Actually it's it's slowed down a little bit. A lot of the same stuff I've been playing like Final Fantasy 14 still checking in with that.
1569000	1584000	Honestly not a whole lot of new stuff. I can't really think of anything new except Dark Sakura. You missed this chat last week so I'll bring it up again. I did fire up my good old World of Warcraft account once again and you were one of the people that was telling me I should do that.
1584000	1596000	We should play. You're freaking welcome. I need to finish leveling Sakurina. I started a new priest. I started a new character. You need to play sassy pants. And well I do but I wanted to start a new character so I did.
1596000	1605000	Because you know everything's changed and I feel like there's no better way to figure out the changes than to just start from scratch. You know start from level one and ramp up slowly.
1605000	1615000	But I'm already level 51. So that might be why I haven't played a whole lot of other games because I've been playing an awful lot of World of Warcraft.
1615000	1628000	And then I've been playing a little bit of Overwatch. Alan will sometimes make the sad puppy dog eyes because he's really into Overwatch. He's playing the ranked mode and everything and and he's like don't you want to play and I'm like no because I'm terrible at it.
1628000	1644000	But once in a while he'll talk me into playing and it once I finally get in there and start playing it is fun especially if we have other friends in there playing too. You know friends equals fun and all that stuff always helps make the experience better so yeah Overwatch has been good.
1644000	1651000	And I just got a text message from Shane not that long ago that I guess he finally bought Overwatch so now that somebody else I know that will be playing so that'll be good.
1651000	1667000	So that's really it for my gaming week so let's get into some housekeeping for this week. Dark Sakura let's talk about this so just to get the bad news over with and rip the bandaid off.
1667000	1671000	So Dark Sakura is going to be taking a hiatus from OLR.
1671000	1687000	Yes against my will because okay I'll just put it out here like this at my job we bid for our shifts every three months and this shift bid came out while I was on leave.
1687000	1705000	So I missed the bid which gave me like the world's worst schedule for me. However someone traded with me for something that won't be five in the morning except it's on Sunday.
1705000	1717000	So I will be taking the occasional Sunday out early to come but other than that I'm going to be out for about three months.
1718000	1721000	So from after Labor Day.
1721000	1726000	I mean unless we can do like an early day something or something like that.
1726000	1733000	Well we had talked about doing an early show for Loki's Kid at some point so that's something we can work in at some point.
1733000	1739000	But for the most part we will be Dark Sakura-less from September to December.
1739000	1740000	Early December.
1740000	1747000	Which which sucks but you know it's it's the job it's what you got to do to pay the bills and has to come before any of this stuff so.
1747000	1753000	And I'll probably be recording some of my segments ahead of time so it's not like you're going to be void of my voice.
1753000	1765000	Yeah we've talked about ways to kind of fill in the gap and we'll likely be having her do the classic game of the week in advance and we'll kind of tape and this also prevents Loki from picking Halo when she's gone.
1765000	1768000	But Halo 1 this week. Halo 2 next week.
1768000	1774000	No because the official word is that I have to approve of something as a classic game.
1774000	1777000	So you can say it's a classic game but if I don't approve it it's not official.
1777000	1783000	Did you approve of my choice last week? I don't remember what I picked. Oh I picked Summer Games from the Commodore 64. You like that?
1783000	1784000	I approve.
1784000	1786000	Yeah you know why she's approved? It's not Halo.
1786000	1787000	It's not Halo.
1787000	1788000	As long as I didn't say Halo.
1788000	1791000	Hey could I pick ET on the Atari 2600 as my classic game of the week?
1791000	1792000	Sure.
1792000	1795000	Hey could I pick the Purina Chuckwagon Chao game?
1795000	1796000	Sure.
1796000	1797000	Can I pick Yaris as the classic game?
1797000	1798000	No.
1798000	1799000	Damn it.
1799000	1803000	Yaris and Halo. That and Yaris is too new.
1803000	1805000	Oh that's right. Is it?
1805000	1806000	Give it a couple more years.
1806000	1809000	I don't know. Give it a couple more years. We might have to have some type of...
1809000	1814000	You know what you can vote for instead of Halo? The only thing that remotely sounds like it?
1814000	1815000	Oh.
1815000	1816000	Hollow Hollow because it's actually kind of tasty.
1816000	1825000	To be fair you did Marathon and Marathon 2 at some point which were like the precursors to Halo. I think. You did at least one of them.
1825000	1827000	Didn't you do Halo Wars as well?
1827000	1828000	No I've never done Halo Wars.
1828000	1830000	No you did something in the Halo universe I remember.
1830000	1833000	I did something that was like an early Bungie game.
1833000	1835000	Yeah well yeah Marathon.
1835000	1836000	Yeah.
1836000	1842000	I thought you did something in the Halo universe but it wasn't Halo and it was kind of a finger to Loki.
1842000	1843000	Halo kitty.
1843000	1845000	Halo kitty.
1845000	1846000	But anyway.
1846000	1847000	Someone needs to make that mod.
1847000	1858000	I mean I've done Quake and I've done... I've done like a bunch of different first persons. I'm just now not doing Halo out of spite at this point.
1858000	1869000	It doesn't matter how good it is. I'll do... I will do Red vs. Blue instead of Halo even though it's not a game and made with Halo assets and still not do Halo.
1869000	1870000	Except...
1870000	1871000	No.
1871000	1872000	It's not old enough.
1872000	1881000	They didn't have Red vs. Blue. I'm thinking there was... I thought there was like a Civil War game that was something in that sense. Was it Blue and Grey or something?
1881000	1889000	Maybe. Oh yeah it's a mod or something I think. But anyway. Sorry just quick chats over at live.vognetwork.com.
1889000	1895000	Let's see some people sympathizing with you there. Sia Tabiri says shift switches suck.
1895000	1900000	Stoppy suggests that since we're recording these in advance edit her voice so it says Halo.
1900000	1903000	No because I know what I said and that won't hold up in court.
1903000	1912000	She's gonna check the wiki every week and if Halo pops up my phone... my phone... it's not even gonna... I won't even get the text message. My phone will just melt.
1914000	1923000	I will suddenly appear in this room going Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob... Rob...
1923000	1930000	It'll be like that scene in Misery where the guy wakes up and Kathy Bates is hovering over him. You dirty birdie.
1933000	1935000	Oh my god that's a parody I want to do for YouTube.
1935000	1937000	I'll have the mallet ready.
1939000	1943000	Anyway. Sorry I love it. It's great.
1943000	1951000	Sia Tabiri suggests how about the Clue game for Genesis. I love that game actually. I have the cartridge for Super Nintendo which is the same thing.
1951000	1959000	So you can always you can always send our Sakura your suggestions. You can tweet the matter. She may use them or she might not. Just depends.
1959000	1969000	I take ideas because I mean I literally looked in the vault. I was like the fuck am I gonna pick and then I pick something that's actually in my garage.
1971000	1973000	As if there's a difference to the listeners.
1973000	1979000	No there's a difference. Because the vault is an air-conditioned room that I can comfortably sit in and play whatever the fuck I want.
1979000	1991000	The garage is hot because this is Sacramento aka Satan's armpit. No wait armpits are humid. Satan's uh what isn't very humid on the body. Satan's foot. It's Satan's foot.
1991000	2002000	It's hot. It's a convection oven of California. So in our garage we have about five pinball tables and three arcade cabinets. So I picked one of the things out there.
2002000	2011000	Kaijuto suggests Spy vs. Spy. Yeah I was gonna say I know that was done on a previous episode because if if she didn't pick it I did because that was a great game.
2011000	2013000	I haven't done Raid over Moscow.
2013000	2016000	I think I did that one week actually.
2016000	2018000	I would do that while drinking a Moscow Mule.
2018000	2021000	Check the wiki orangelaunchradio.wiki.com.
2021000	2022000	I think I've done Time Crisis.
2022000	2026000	Yeah there's there's a lot of games we have done believe it or not. Anyway um so.
2026000	2028000	I've done Galaxian.
2028000	2040000	We will we will make do without dark soccer a few few months it's gonna be weird but you know we we made Loki's baby time work a couple years ago we'll make this work too.
2040000	2045000	So you guys are the most important showing up here week after week and supporting the show.
2045000	2055000	Of course dark soccer can never be replaced but we will try to have some fill ins some substitute teachers visit us over those few months to say hello.
2055000	2056000	So.
2056000	2062000	I've done Dragon Spirit by the way because it was the Dragon Ball Z RPG or Dragon Ball RPG sorry not Dragon Ball Z that was before that.
2062000	2064000	Check the wiki before making suggestions.
2064000	2065000	Wiki.
2065000	2066000	Anyways.
2066000	2067000	Do you speak it?
2067000	2070000	Well and big thing because we don't I've never touched the wiki.
2070000	2071000	Why would I do the guy game?
2071000	2074000	I think Loki did the guy game.
2074000	2077000	I think Loki did it. I approve of that before I approve of Halo.
2077000	2081000	That sounds like something I would do. I remember that.
2081000	2082000	But anyway.
2082000	2085000	I will approve BMX triple X before.
2085000	2093000	It was a great game I mean honestly I mean aside from just the ridiculousness of the game but it was a good BMX game.
2093000	2095000	BMX triple X? Oh yeah.
2095000	2096000	It was ridiculous.
2096000	2099000	Oh yeah Dragon Power whatever it's Dragon something.
2099000	2101000	Alright anyway.
2101000	2109000	So again that starts after Labor Day we will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be at Dragon Con that weekend so it's going to be a little bit of a shift of sorts.
2109000	2118000	At the end of August leading into September and a live Jamie-less end of the year but we'll make it work.
2118000	2119000	We always do here at Orange Laundry.
2119000	2120000	I'll be here at the end of the year.
2120000	2122000	Oh yeah right well yeah.
2122000	2125000	You're hoping to be back just in time for episode 666.
2125000	2129000	Yeah I mean I would make that happen one way or another.
2129000	2133000	What a great return wouldn't that be appropriate for your first show back?
2133000	2134000	Yes.
2134000	2136000	Alright.
2136000	2137000	You know what?
2137000	2143000	I found this wiki of all like deleted scenes and stuff from games.
2143000	2146000	Oh yeah what is it the Unseen 64 or something like that?
2146000	2148000	No it's not Unseen 64.
2148000	2161000	This is actually just a let me see if I can find the because right now I was looking at the ones for Final Fantasy 7 and yeah it's TCRF.net.
2161000	2166000	Oh maybe that maybe I am I may be thinking of the same one I don't I can never remember the names of sites.
2166000	2167000	There's Beta64.
2167000	2168000	Maybe maybe.
2168000	2186000	Which is a video thing but it's actually just a whole bunch of stuff that I've I've done the I used to have the for a while the Japanese version of Final Fantasy 7 and these were all stuff from the debugs that I had played around with and I couldn't read very well so just kind of neat.
2186000	2190000	I would love to see director's cuts of these games with these deleted scenes and everything.
2190000	2191000	Wouldn't it be awesome?
2191000	2192000	Yeah for sure.
2192000	2193000	Yeah.
2193000	2194000	I did want to give a shout out.
2194000	2196000	Although I'm glad that bitch Aerith is dead.
2196000	2214000	I did want to give a shout out by the way real quick to the people that do edit the wiki for Orange Knowledge Radio because I never touch it but all of us hosts it's very meta because all of us hosts have actually used the wiki as a resource for this show because like what game did we pick before we need to go do a control find on the wiki.
2214000	2215000	I look at that thing every week.
2215000	2223000	Yeah so it's and it's funny because we I've never touched it so props to all of our people that actually make that happen thank you so much really appreciate that.
2223000	2228000	So let's see some other quick comments here and then we'll move on.
2228000	2235000	Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com suggests we can have a Dark Sakura séance on episode 666.
2235000	2237000	Oh that might be something interesting.
2237000	2239000	Knock three times if you can hear me.
2239000	2240000	Alright anyway.
2240000	2243000	Let's get into some gaming news.
2243000	2244000	I think it's the time for that.
2244000	2246000	We're all past our gaming weeks and housekeeping.
2246000	2247000	Let's get into gaming news.
2247000	2248000	Loki.
2249000	2252000	So Pokemon Go.
2252000	2254000	Lots of stuff to talk about.
2254000	2260000	First off they just had an update recently in fact I noticed it yesterday that changes a little bit of the game.
2260000	2267000	They've nerfed some of the attacks from the actual Pokemon especially a lot of the ones that have been used.
2267000	2273000	They've also allowed you to re-customize your trainer which is kind of nice because my son says he wants to play as a girl.
2273000	2280000	And I'm like okay that's fine but I originally created your character to kind of look like you but you can do whatever you want now.
2280000	2285000	They also I guess changed some of the animations.
2285000	2292000	They've added like actual new pictures for some of the trophies or awards that you get.
2292000	2301000	And then they've also removed the three foot thing that was on the actual nearby Pokemon.
2301000	2306000	So now there's no distance whatsoever indicated with the nearby Pokemon.
2306000	2314000	Along with that they've done some back end stuff to block PokeVision from working and some of the other tracking applications.
2314000	2319000	Because yeah I don't know.
2319000	2322000	I guess service stability or something.
2322000	2328000	I've to be honest found that the game has been crashing a lot more for me lately but that's just my thing I guess.
2328000	2336000	There's a lot of I don't know how much you've seen of this on the internet Loki but there's a lot of strong opinions about what's happening with Pokemon GO.
2336000	2337000	There's a lot of salt.
2337000	2344000	They are pissed off at Niantic for not talking to the community and a lot of English players are like.
2344000	2347000	Well aware of this.
2348000	2349000	Welcome to our world.
2349000	2350000	Okay so here's the thing.
2350000	2356000	So I actually like I'm using my quotey fingers got into it on Twitter a little bit today over this.
2356000	2364000	Although I don't you know as long as nothing ever blurs the line of personal attacks I don't I don't really get like all bent out of shape on Twitter debates.
2364000	2368000	But I was definitely getting into it a little bit today about these changes and so forth.
2368000	2373000	Because honestly when I heard that they shut PokeVision down my reaction was good.
2373000	2375000	I think that site needed to go.
2375000	2378000	I don't think that site was what the game was intended for.
2378000	2380000	And it doesn't really do anything.
2380000	2384000	All it does is like shows you exactly where to go to find stuff.
2384000	2385000	It's yeah.
2385000	2390000	It shows us where to find it because they're fucking tracking shit doesn't work for shit.
2390000	2393000	I kind of get that people have that complaint and so forth.
2393000	2400000	But here's the thing is that a that site is against the terms of service like you can sugarcoat it however you want or whatever.
2400000	2403000	But the site is against the terms of service Niantic had a right to pull it down.
2403000	2406000	Go look up the part about scraping, botting.
2406000	2409000	You're just sugarcoating it.
2409000	2413000	You're trying to say oh but you know whatever you know it's it is.
2413000	2415000	They're going to do it anyways.
2415000	2417000	People are going to cheat.
2417000	2422000	But the thing is is that PokeVision shouldn't and I get why people are like upset and so forth.
2422000	2424000	But here's the thing.
2424000	2426000	The tracking thing is is temporary.
2426000	2428000	I'm confident in that.
2428000	2430000	They're going to bring back the tracking thing.
2430000	2435000	And the reason why they disabled it is because the game is playable.
2435000	2442000	So in my in my opinion based on what I'm seeing off what's going on from the system perspective.
2442000	2451000	They turned off the tracking the 123 foot and all that they disabled that or nullified it or whatever to make the servers more stable.
2451000	2454000	So that way you can play the game at all.
2454000	2459000	So Niantic either has it where people are going to be bitching because the radar thing doesn't work.
2459000	2462000	Or people are going to be bitching because they can't log into the game at all.
2462000	2467000	Now the one thing I will agree though that Niantic and this never did come up in my Twitter debate earlier.
2467000	2475000	But it is the thing that I will agree on is that Niantic is doing a pretty crap job at communicating with their player base on some of these reasons why.
2475000	2480000	And everything that is happening with this situation has to be inferred through interviews.
2480000	2485000	Like John Hanke said this offhanded comment about don't expect those sites to last much longer.
2485000	2489000	That a lot of people are like really like running with and so forth.
2489000	2493000	Like oh he had a personal vendetta against these sites and that's why he shut them down and all this stuff.
2493000	2497000	And I'm kind of like okay take a step back.
2497000	2504000	The creators of Pokemon Go did not disable the radar to intentionally piss off their player base.
2504000	2509000	They're not out there to piss you off intentionally as a gamer.
2509000	2511000	That's a no win situation for them.
2511000	2517000	But because they don't communicate well with their player base everybody can kind of make up that line and run with it.
2517000	2521000	And that's what's happening here because Niantic doesn't really communicate.
2521000	2529000	And this is where that relationship with Nintendo would come in really freaking handy right about now.
2529000	2533000	Is that maybe Nintendo can help them out with some of these communication issues.
2533000	2538000	I feel like they did with the Pogo wrist bracelet thing right.
2538000	2542000	With it being delayed.
2542000	2546000	Yeah I feel like didn't Nintendo come out and talk about that too.
2546000	2549000	Yeah I don't let's see here.
2549000	2556000	Yeah basically they're supposed to be coming out at the end of or it's supposed to be coming out now in September.
2556000	2567000	And this is from Nintendo they actually said you know this delay is due to the preparations for Pokemon Go application update in order to optimize Pokemon Go Plus.
2567000	2579000	In order for us to offer new experiences to play Pokemon Go with Pokemon Go Plus with all high quality level or a quality level high enough to satisfy many people as possible.
2579000	2586000	We decided it's necessary to take the time for completion. We ask for your understanding.
2586000	2591000	So anyway I believe the tracking will be back.
2591000	2596000	And you know for all these salty people that are threatening to leave Pokemon Go and so forth honestly.
2596000	2597000	Bye Felicia.
2597000	2606000	Well I don't want to sound so like such an asshole but at the same time it's like actually if people would stop playing for a little bit it would help the servers become more stable.
2606000	2611000	And the tracking will probably come back sooner rather than later so like your threat to quit.
2611000	2615000	I'm just kind of like yeah actually could you could you stop playing for a little bit.
2615000	2627000	But that makes me sound like such a colossal asshole I realize but you know and the tweet I'd written earlier was just a very tongue in cheek thing about holding gyms and so forth and obviously I would like to see a game that everybody can play.
2627000	2632000	But this is not like seriously guys we've been doing this show what 14 years.
2632000	2642000	In my opinion Pokemon Go is just another MMO and these are problems that every fucking MMO every single one of them has had when it launched.
2642000	2648000	Every single one of them has been a shit show in one way or another.
2648000	2652000	Has there been any that were not a shit show at least in one way or another.
2652000	2655000	Has there been a smooth MMO launch.
2655000	2658000	I'm trying to think was Wildstar smooth maybe.
2659000	2662000	I didn't have a problem. I don't remember a problem with Star Trek online.
2662000	2671000	Maybe but I just, you know, for the, you know, the big ones like World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, they all had problems, their first couple weeks.
2671000	2677000	As far as Niantic's track record again, they've done at least 104.
2677000	2678000	What?
2678000	2681000	No I do remember there are problems with Star Trek online nevermind.
2681000	2682000	Yeah there were.
2682000	2686000	They've done at least 104 updates to Ingress in the three years it's been out.
2686000	2688000	They will keep updating Pokemon Go.
2688000	2692000	This first little update they did is just one of many things to come.
2692000	2699000	So people just need to step back, take a deep breath, Niantic doesn't fucking hate you.
2699000	2701000	They're just trying to make the game playable at all.
2701000	2713000	But at the same time they have a right to close this Pokevision stuff because it's completely removing, like it's one extreme to the other is what it is.
2713000	2722000	There's already, like there's a subreddit on Reddit of course called Pokemon Go Dev where all these people are developing these third party stuff.
2722000	2725000	And they've already gotten past all the stuff that Niantic's done.
2725000	2730000	So it'll be just down for a few days and then it's going to be back up again.
2730000	2735000	Kaijuto in chat says no worries, more Pokemon nerfing coming, the game is done.
2735000	2739000	The game is done. That's funny.
2739000	2741000	Wow is dead too.
2742000	2748000	The minute they release the second generation Pokemon, everybody will be back.
2748000	2757000	Listen, you're able to log into the game, so what that they removed the amount of feet that are next to the nearby Pokemon? It's better than nothing.
2758000	2765000	Honestly, yeah. Because that's the alternative from the technical side of things.
2765000	2772000	Remember like the way you would refresh the feet thing? You could kind of force the system to do it the same way you do in Ingress.
2772000	2776000	You click on a Poke stop and click out and then it will refresh things.
2776000	2781000	Like that's, it's all about the server queries and how often things get pinged to see where the stuff is.
2781000	2788000	And they, these sites don't help that. It doesn't reduce the number of those queries.
2788000	2793000	So those sites being up are just putting Niantic back in the same place essentially.
2793000	2799000	So, let's see, going to chat for some more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
2799000	2804000	SSG100Matt says the people asking for refunds are stupid, you don't need to spend money.
2804000	2811000	Oh, yeah, did you mention that at all? The people that are calling Apple and Google and all that are getting refunds for it?
2811000	2812000	No.
2812000	2819000	Oh my god, it's off the hook. Because Kotaku ran a story, here's how you get your refunds for Pokemon Go.
2819000	2820000	Thank you Kotaku.
2820000	2827000	And people, people go, ooh, free money. And so I just, I'm kind of surprised the companies are letting them do it.
2827000	2836000	But I also, like, that's not a read on Apple or Google. It's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, I understand the good customer service and all that stuff.
2836000	2842000	So, hmm. But anyway, we'll see. We'll see what develops.
2842000	2845000	All right, let's move on.
2845000	2847000	Real quick, I wanted to mention one last thing.
2847000	2848000	Yeah, yeah.
2848000	2855000	So this is kind of funny. So remember how Pokemon Go really made Nintendo's stocks kind of skyrocket a little bit?
2855000	2864000	Well, Nintendo actually came out with a release basically saying, hey, even though Pokemon Go is doing really well,
2864000	2874000	Nintendo doesn't really fully own the franchise and the amount of money that we're, the revenue that we're receiving from Pokemon Go isn't really going to make a huge difference.
2875000	2885000	And so because of that, you know, their shares then plummeted back down 17%, you know, where they were up, I think previously like 30% or so.
2885000	2893000	Yeah, I'd heard about, I'd heard about the whole fact that it declined because people realized that Nintendo hadn't really made the game or whatever.
2893000	2895000	It's just funny.
2895000	2898000	Oh, well. If only I could get in on that.
2898000	2903000	Yeah, well Nintendo could, you know, again, they could kind of own a little, they do own part of Niantic though.
2903000	2907000	They own part of Niantic, they own part of the Pokemon company. I mean, they do.
2907000	2914000	It's kind of like how most of Yahoo's money comes from their investments in Alibaba or whatever that site is in China.
2914000	2919000	Alibaba is the name of it. Most of Yahoo's money comes from their investments in that.
2919000	2920000	Funny.
2920000	2922000	I think investments can still be worth a lot.
2922000	2927000	Well, now most of their investments are going to be coming from their purchase or being purchased by Verizon.
2927000	2933000	Yeah. Oh, and a TigerKlon chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, you heard that the boss of Niantic's Twitter account got hacked?
2933000	2941000	Yeah, I did see that. And it's just one of those things where I just kind of face palmed and I'm like, God dammit gamers, this is why we can't have nice things.
2941000	2947000	No, no, no, no, stop blaming gamers. Seriously. But everybody games. Pokemon Go.
2947000	2949000	That is the reputation that's going to be out there.
2949000	2952000	No, no, no, that's like saying, damn you white people. I mean, because seriously.
2952000	2954000	Well, I have said that on several occasions.
2954000	2961000	Seriously, like, can we just stop doing that? Because why are we assuming that a gamer is the one that hacked this person's thing?
2961000	2966000	Okay, that's fine. Everybody is playing games. Everybody is fucking playing Pokemon Go.
2966000	2973000	Pokemon Go is a game, therefore you're a fucking gamer. So let's stop labeling people. Damn you food eaters for fucking hacking him.
2973000	2982000	If you would let me finish my thought, it actually, the hack doesn't seem to do with this recent fuckery about the website getting closed and all that.
2982000	2992000	But the fact that the game hasn't released in Brazil. So it appears that these are gamers in Brazil that are very anxious about Pokemon Go being released,
2992000	2996000	who actually hacked the account because Niantic has not released the game in Brazil.
2996000	3002000	And to the folks in Brazil, I tell you, there's, again, server stability things.
3002000	3007000	There's probably a really good reason why the game isn't out for you yet, because the game needs to be playable.
3007000	3017000	Although, granted, they did still release the game in Japan, but Japan's a little different because, you know, it's kind of the homeland of Pokemon and Nintendo.
3017000	3023000	So I think there was a lot more pressure that the game kind of had to release in Japan in a reasonable timeframe.
3023000	3032000	But unfortunately, Brazil will probably have to wait. It's a very big place. Brazil probably will have to wait until some of these server issues sort themselves out.
3032000	3038000	But look at the bright side, Brazil. You'll never have to deal with all this junk that we've been talking about this week.
3038000	3043000	That'll all be worked out by the time you get the game. So enjoy the Olympics and stuff in the meantime.
3043000	3051000	Alright. Anyway, let's go and talk about Nintendo NX rumors, because there's never enough Nintendo NX rumors.
3051000	3058000	But these ones actually seem to be a little more, I guess, believable, plausible.
3058000	3064000	I don't know. When I look at this, I kind of go, yep, this is probably it. This probably hits the nail on the head.
3064000	3073000	Eurogamer is the site that kind of broke this. But when I say broke this, it's more like confirmed a lot of speculation that was out there already.
3073000	3082000	And what the deal is, is that the NX is apparently a handheld, think like a tablet type of device with detachable controllers on the left and the right side.
3082000	3092000	When you detach those controllers, you can dock the tablet and it will play on your television using those controllers that used to be plugged into the tablet.
3092000	3098000	And that is essentially what the NX is. It is a handheld and a console.
3098000	3109000	So it's not like the earlier speculation that we've had on this show that the NX is a handheld, comma, and a console system, basically.
3109000	3113000	Like there's two separate ones, but that it is actually combined in one.
3113000	3114000	So it's a Nomad.
3114000	3117000	Is that what, did that do the same thing?
3117000	3118000	The Sega Nomad.
3118000	3119000	Did that kind of do the same thing?
3119000	3124000	It was a handheld Sega Genesis and you could plug it into your TV.
3124000	3129000	I guess in a way, yeah, it could be.
3129000	3137000	Now, some other specs about this, it's going to have the NVIDIA Tegra processor in it, which is kind of the big thing they're talking about.
3137000	3144000	But that is a change, a big change from the parts that are on the GameCube and on the Wii and the Wii U.
3144000	3149000	So a lot of folks are saying don't expect backwards compatibility because that is changing.
3149000	3155000	Also, there is going to be a recommended 32 gigabyte cartridge.
3155000	3167000	But when we say cartridge, think more a DS cart and less a old school thick gray cartridge because, again, this is a handheld thing that's meant to go with you on the go.
3167000	3171000	This makes a lot of sense to me and this is probably right.
3171000	3173000	What do you think, Loki?
3173000	3179000	The only thing that I think was missing is one of the rumors is that it's not the Tegra chip that's out now.
3179000	3184000	It's going to be a brand new Tegra chip because the one that's out now is kind of underpowered a bit.
3184000	3188000	But I don't know, we'll just see what it is.
3188000	3193000	I mean, honestly, I just don't see how this is going to revolutionize stuff.
3193000	3206000	Well, it's going to be neat that, again, this is something that was already with the rumors is that it would probably be like a Wii U, except you could really take that tablet part anywhere with you.
3206000	3209000	And that's essentially what it sounds like this NX is going to be.
3209000	3220000	And especially in a culture like Japan, where there's a lot more of the commuting and mass transit and so forth, where somebody could start a game in the morning, literally pick it up and play it on their way to work.
3220000	3225000	That's pretty cool. Although, I wonder what the size of that tablet is going to be.
3225000	3232000	Did they say what the size of the tablet is? Are we talking like an iPad size thing or are we talking like the size of a DS?
3232000	3233000	I don't know.
3233000	3234000	Do we know?
3234000	3238000	I'd be very curious what the size of that thing is going to look like to see what that kind of looks like for mobility.
3238000	3244000	Is it something that's going to fit in my pocket or am I going to have to carry a man bag in order to take that thing with me on the go?
3244000	3246000	That's a big question as well.
3246000	3253000	And Dark Tetsuya says, it would certainly be in line with when Nintendo was talking about unifying things between handheld and console.
3253000	3257000	So just have all the games as console and handheld at the same time.
3257000	3259000	That comment from live.vognetwork.com.
3260000	3264000	And yeah, I think that's going to be one of the biggest assets of this system.
3264000	3270000	Even though the Wii U kind of lost that third party support after the first year,
3270000	3274000	and a lot of the third party companies stopped making games for it,
3274000	3277000	they were still making games for the 3DS and the DS.
3277000	3284000	So for Nintendo to recover from whatever slump you want to say the Wii U may have put them in,
3284000	3289000	why not leverage that strength in the handheld department and just unify it?
3289000	3292000	And like, hey, if you make a game for the handheld, guess what?
3292000	3294000	It's going to work on the console too.
3294000	3301000	And then it's also kind of that double sided thing where it's like, hey, that Xbox One or PlayStation 4 game you're making,
3301000	3305000	guess how easy it is to port to the NX and it's now a handheld game.
3305000	3306000	It'll run on the tablet.
3306000	3314000	I think it's going to really open it up to the third party publishers and hopefully keep a repeat problem of the Wii U from happening.
3314000	3319000	But you know, it is about time for a refresh of the 3DS and the DS technology.
3319000	3322000	So I'd be very curious to see what happens with that.
3322000	3332000	Speaking of that, one other real quick point I wanted to say is that a lot of people are saying don't expect backwards compatibility with the Wii U and the Wii and all that stuff.
3332000	3336000	Although I would think a virtual console for at least GameCube would be a given.
3336000	3337000	They'll emulate it.
3337000	3339000	They don't know how to fucking do networking.
3339000	3340000	They'll emulate it.
3340000	3341000	Oh, I'm sorry.
3341000	3342000	Is your mic off?
3342000	3345000	Lowkey, Lowkey, Lowkey, Lowkey, is your mic off?
3345000	3347000	It doesn't mind me.
3347000	3349000	Maybe for that it needed to be off.
3349000	3352000	But anyway, what was I saying?
3352000	3359000	So it probably won't play the Wii or the GameCube games, but maybe it'll play the DS or the 3DS games.
3359000	3360000	Why not?
3360000	3363000	It would make a lot of sense that it would play the old handheld games.
3363000	3367000	Well, being that an Android phone couldn't emulate those anyways.
3367000	3368000	Why not?
3368000	3373000	No, but seriously though, they're going to fucking screw us with the virtual console game.
3373000	3376000	Make some excuses like, oh, we just can't figure out how to link those stories together.
3376000	3379000	It's, networking is so hard.
3379000	3383000	Rama in chat says Tegra ain't going to be able to emulate that, Sky.
3383000	3387000	Whatever's in this thing is able to run the new Zelda game.
3387000	3391000	It's supposed to be rumored to be a new Tegra chip.
3391000	3395000	It's a new chip that hasn't been revealed yet.
3395000	3400000	And it's supposed to be, the whole thing's supposed to be announced in September, supposedly.
3400000	3401000	We'll see.
3401000	3406000	Yeah, but you know, again, if it's going to play that new Zelda game, it can play the old 3DS games just fine.
3406000	3410000	And it can probably do GameCube games too, even though it is a different processor.
3410000	3412000	They could probably emulate it, but we'll see.
3412000	3413000	We'll see.
3413000	3416000	TigerKlon chat says it'll probably be scaled down to run on it.
3416000	3419000	That would really surprise me if that ended up being...
3419000	3420000	That would be funny.
3420000	3423000	We didn't show you the NX version. I know you guys are expecting a better version, but...
3423000	3426000	Why? That would be shooting that new console in the foot.
3426000	3428000	It needs to look better on NX than Wii U.
3428000	3432000	Well, this is the same company that fucking thinks that they can play in their own playground
3432000	3434000	and they don't have to compete with the other companies.
3434000	3435000	Which is a...
3435000	3440000	How well did that fucking work out for you with the Wii U, mister I don't want to compete with other companies?
3440000	3444000	Yeah, you won't be competing with the other companies because they will blow you the fuck away.
3444000	3446000	Is what's going to happen.
3446000	3449000	And, I mean, I hope this gimmick is fantastic.
3449000	3454000	I hope that this really brings, you know, the third parties to your console.
3454000	3458000	But, if it doesn't have the power to keep up with the games that they're developing,
3458000	3461000	I'm sorry you're going to be left in the dust again.
3461000	3462000	It's going to be...
3462000	3465000	Yeah, you're going to have the great first party titles, but those are always fucking there.
3465000	3466000	So that's not something that...
3466000	3467000	I mean, that's something that...
3467000	3471000	Well, yeah, it really depends on what those launch titles are.
3471000	3476000	If they have some must-have stuff at launch, there's going to be a lot of people really into this.
3476000	3480000	I do. I think if Nintendo can come out with some strong first party things...
3480000	3487000	And I kind of feel like they may come out swinging with a bunch of Wii U ports for the NX.
3487000	3492000	And we've heard rumblings about a remastered Splatoon, a remastered...
3492000	3495000	Was it Mario Maker? Something else on the Wii U recently.
3495000	3497000	That they're talking about a remastering for NX.
3497000	3502000	They'll probably just punch us with all this stuff right at launch.
3502000	3508000	You know, obviously there needs to be stuff besides recycled Wii U games if they want this to succeed.
3508000	3514000	But, we're about due for something in the Mario Galaxy or the Mario 3D setting.
3514000	3516000	So that would be something I could definitely see as a launch game.
3516000	3520000	And, oh yeah, there's Zelda. That's kind of a big deal as well.
3520000	3521000	Yeah.
3521000	3523000	So, we'll see what happens.
3524000	3529000	So, Fifth Dream in chat says, what? Nintendo wants you to buy all your games again?
3529000	3533000	Well, yes and no. Of course they want you to buy them again.
3533000	3535000	And they'll do something with this to soup them up.
3535000	3539000	And the fact that you can take Splatoon with you on the go and all this stuff will probably be...
3539000	3542000	Although, how would you take it on the go with you and play online?
3542000	3546000	I'm assuming there's no cellular data thing.
3546000	3550000	I mean, maybe it's got Wi-Fi, so you could play it at Starbucks or something, but I don't know.
3550000	3557000	I'm going to take a page out of the fucking Vita and call it asynchronous multiplayer.
3557000	3562000	Or better known as, fuck it, we're not doing multiplayer.
3562000	3569000	But, Fifth Dream, that also may be an opportunity to try to push this console for people that skipped the Wii U.
3569000	3574000	And I think that would be more of the strategy behind this is, hey, look at these games that you still haven't played yet.
3574000	3579000	You could just buy the better versions on your NX at launch for 40 bucks.
3579000	3581000	We'll see what happens. We'll see.
3581000	3585000	Alright, let's move on. Something else. Dark Saga.
3585000	3591000	Well, we have been talking about this for how many years? It's the whole 38 Studio thing?
3591000	3594000	A while. It's been a while.
3594000	3609000	Well, finally, after a four year investigation into the collapse of 38 Studios, the decision has been made that there will be no criminal charges filed against the company.
3609000	3616000	And the quote says, a bad business deal does not necessarily make it a crime.
3617000	3627000	So, the Attorney General, the Rhode Island Attorney General, and the Superintendent of the State Police made the announcement.
3627000	3633000	And they were, they say, we know taxpayers aren't going to be happy about it.
3634000	3649000	So, yeah. And of course, when asked about it, Curt Schilling's response was that they could have saved tens of millions more by making that statement five years ago.
3649000	3654000	And the quote on here is, disgusted to see officers sent on fake ass witch hunt.
3656000	3659000	So, it's over. Over and done.
3659000	3669000	I'm not surprised they didn't bring criminal charges. I mean, you know, just, it's done. Let it be. We're past it at this point.
3669000	3678000	I just don't see the point of dragging what's his name through the mud, even though he's said a lot of other things where, you know, I, bleh.
3678000	3686000	But for this particular circumstance, specifically, like it's just, you know, why, why do we keep dragging this out? Let's just, it's done.
3686000	3689000	It costs the state a lot of money. Let's move on.
3691000	3696000	That they never should have given him in the first place. But, you know, hindsight's 20-20. What can he do?
3696000	3697000	Better to be done.
3697000	3700000	All right. Let's move on. Loki, what do you have for us next?
3700000	3706000	So, I mean, I guess this was to be expected after they announced that they weren't going to be making any more of these games.
3706000	3711000	But Disney Infinity, they've announced basically their server shutdown plan.
3711000	3720000	So, you know, Disney Infinity is going to be shutting down their servers, ending everything finally on March 3, 2017.
3720000	3731000	But before that, starting September 30th, the Apple TV versions, I guess, of the games will be removed from the store.
3731000	3735000	And then also, you'll simply, I guess, get the boxed versions of the games.
3735000	3745000	And then, I guess, following that January 3rd, they're going to be removing the in-game purchases from PC, from the 2.0 and 3.0 on PC.
3745000	3749000	And then, of course, you know, finally, at the very end, they're going to be taking everything else down.
3749000	3755000	Although, starting, I guess, already, they've already removed some stuff as well.
3755000	3761000	So, Disney Infinity 2.0 in-game purchases on PC, iOS, Android, and Apple TV have been turned off.
3761000	3766000	But that doesn't affect Infinity 3.0 yet.
3766000	3772000	I'm curious to see what happens with the figures, if it's going to drive them up in price, or...
3772000	3777000	Well, some folks in chat are saying, Bob Coffey in chat says the Infinity figures are on hella clearance right now.
3777000	3781000	I wonder where that is, because not everything, you know, when they first announced that the game was stopping,
3781000	3784000	I think we were expecting to see clearances everywhere, and that didn't happen.
3784000	3788000	Yeah, I kind of want to get some more of those. My wife's like, no, don't buy anymore.
3788000	3791000	Well, it depends how much. You know, they are still good figures, little toys.
3791000	3796000	If you're going to buy those little pop doll figures, why not the Disney Infinity figures?
3796000	3800000	Well, I just meant for my son, because, you know, he wants to play that.
3800000	3809000	And he doesn't really play it on PlayStation 4 anymore, so I was thinking, like, pick up the digital version on PS3 on Wii U.
3809000	3815000	And then that way, you know, since everything's plug and play, you just, you know, move the stuff over,
3815000	3817000	he can just play it in his room on that.
3817000	3826000	But that's really unfortunate that the game's plug is being pulled, you know, so there's no chance they're going to sell anymore 3.0s during the holiday or any of that stuff.
3826000	3831000	No, they've already moved on. Like, they've got, like, this licensing stuff I've seen with, like, the Marvel characters,
3831000	3838000	and so they have these elaborate toys that, it's got some IR stuff with it as well. I'm not really sure what that is.
3838000	3845000	Bob Coffee says a lot of Walmarts should have them on rollback for $4.96 for a lot of the 3.0 and 2.0 figures.
3845000	3846000	It's pretty cheap.
3846000	3847000	Yeah.
3847000	3855000	So, yeah, I just, but the game itself should still be playable, it's just the online where you play with friends and stuff wouldn't be available anymore, right?
3855000	3861000	No, online wasn't that great anyway, so it's, like, up to four people, and, I mean, I just never really used the online stuff.
3861000	3865000	My son just really just builds a level, and that's it.
3865000	3871000	I mean, there's not really, we're not downloading levels or playing any of the levels that people make. It's just kind of, no.
3871000	3876000	Tigerclaw in chat says with Disney Infinity gone, we only have three toys to life left.
3876000	3881000	Skylanders, Lego Dimension, and Amiibos. I don't know if Amiibos totally count as toy to life.
3881000	3882000	No.
3882000	3888000	They're kind of a unique category, and I thought I heard that in the last Nintendo earnings, they really took a hit on Amiibos.
3888000	3893000	Like, the bubbles kind of burst, but it also seems like they didn't really do much with Amiibos the past few months.
3893000	3899000	I mean, yeah, okay, they had, like, a recoloring Splatoon set, and a few other, but, I mean, they didn't have anything big.
3899000	3900000	That's just cash drive shit right there.
3900000	3905000	Yeah, they didn't have anything big, you know? So, I wonder if Amiibo is kind of in a holding pattern until NX.
3905000	3910000	I'll be curious to see what they do for the holiday, but I don't think Amiibo's gone.
3910000	3918000	Like, I mean, think about all the cool stuff they could have done, like, you dress up your Miis, you scan it in, boom, like, hey, you got costume or something.
3918000	3925000	Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, to be fair, we had that whole story last week about that Animal Crossing is being updated to include Amiibo.
3925000	3932000	I mean, it's silly, but it's something, and it's cool that it's a title that, you know, most people have just kind of had sitting dormant on their 3DS for years.
3932000	3936000	So, I mean, if Nintendo kind of keeps throwing those types of little bones at us, I think that's really cool.
3936000	3938000	I wonder if that's one of the games that they're remastering for the NX.
3938000	3940000	I wonder. Hmm.
3940000	3945000	That's why that's being added right now, is cross-play with that version of the game.
3945000	3953000	The only reason I'm not saying yes, absolutely, is because there's also the mobile game that's happening, and I don't think they would want those out at the same time.
3953000	3957000	So, I mean, we'll see, but the mobile thing should be out by the end of the year.
3957000	3962000	We're supposed to be getting, what is it? What was the other one? Is Fire Emblem the other one?
3962000	3967000	We're supposed to be getting those two free-to-plays mobile things to follow up Miitomo by the end of the year.
3967000	3970000	That's what it was, right? It was Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing, right?
3970000	3971000	I know Animal Crossing.
3971000	3972000	I don't remember.
3973000	3981000	Let's see, Indartetsuya in chat says, yeah, that's what I'm thinking. They're waiting for the NX launch to do some more stuff since all the Amiibo-supported games are already out.
3981000	3984000	I think the only really new one is the patch for Animal Crossing.
3984000	3992000	Also, the only other thing I wanted to say with the toys-to-life thing is that those are the only toys-to-life thing remaining for consoles.
3992000	3999000	But don't forget, Target still has that huge section for the other Marvel thing that just plugs right into your TV.
3999000	4002000	That's what I was saying. They've got that thing right now.
4002000	4007000	Yeah, so they're not totally gone, for what it's worth.
4007000	4014000	But I think now that stuff is starting to slow down a little bit and is honestly probably better left to a company like Lego.
4014000	4020000	Because Lego is making the stuff that, you know, the age group that has a lot of money wants.
4020000	4026000	And they're already making toys anyway. So, I don't know. We'll see.
4026000	4034000	Anyway, let's move on and talk about Doom DLC. Did you ever play the new Doom, Loki?
4034000	4035000	Not yet.
4035000	4036000	You should check it out.
4036000	4039000	It's probably going to be something I purchase on sale and then never play again.
4039000	4043000	Well, there's a multiplayer add-on that's coming out with some new maps.
4043000	4050000	But what's pretty cool about this, you kind of worry like, oh, when the new maps come out, there's going to be all these people that don't have the maps who aren't going to be able to play.
4050000	4059000	Well, actually, this is pretty cool. The new expansion, Unto the Evil, which is the multiplayer add-on, is that they're not going to split the community with it.
4059000	4063000	So, here's what happens. The DLC is going to have a feature called Party Play.
4063000	4068000	And they're calling this very similar to what Payday 2 does and Warhammer End Times.
4068000	4073000	You will not have to buy Unto the Evil in order to play on the DLC maps.
4073000	4081000	As long as you're in another party with a player who purchased the DLC map, it will come up in the rotation and you won't be kicked out.
4081000	4086000	So, as long as one person in the party owns the DLC, everybody can play the map in the rotation.
4086000	4094000	But I guess, I don't know, it doesn't say if you could pick the map manually. It might still be just part of the random generation or what have you.
4094000	4097000	And that's honestly probably a really good thing.
4097000	4102000	And then lets people sample those maps and decide if they want to buy it on their own.
4102000	4107000	So, I think that's probably the best way to do this without splitting the player base.
4107000	4113000	So, I need to go back and play some more Doom. It is a really, really well done, just graphically great game too.
4113000	4121000	And I played a little bit through it and then just, you know, my typical gamer, ooh shiny, something else to play kicked in and I never went back to Doom.
4121000	4123000	So, I need to get on that.
4123000	4126000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
4126000	4134000	Well, news about Shenmue 3. Ooh. Did any of us pay into the Kickstarter?
4134000	4139000	I did not chip into the Kickstarter because I just kind of stopped backing video game Kickstarters.
4139000	4142000	I've only done one Kickstarter.
4142000	4143000	I'll be curious to check it out.
4143000	4144000	I did one Kickstarter.
4144000	4145000	What was that?
4145000	4147000	The Hotchafel Boyfriend Plushies.
4147000	4150000	I now have four pigeons on my desk at home.
4150000	4162000	Anyway, one of the people who worked on the other Shenmue is going to be returning.
4162000	4171000	This is the sub director for the series, Okuyasu Keiji is going to be returning and working on the game.
4171000	4179000	And he really is looking forward to being a part of it and I have a good quote from him too.
4179000	4183000	This is what I personally want to stress for my part is what makes Shenmue, Shenmue.
4183000	4188000	The game has an utterly unique atmosphere and I want all that to be breathed in.
4188000	4195000	As you play along, you feel the ambiance, the mayo, and from place to place, getting that full sensory experience.
4195000	4202000	So, that was in reference to working on the other two and wanting that to continue.
4202000	4206000	Well, I hope the magic can strike a third time. I really do.
4206000	4215000	There's a little bit of me that's concerned that after so many years of there not being Shenmue, that this one may miss the mark, but we'll see.
4215000	4219000	As long as it has more Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier in it, I'm happy.
4219000	4222000	And games of Lucky Hit, hopefully.
4222000	4228000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some video games that you'll be playing a lot sooner than Shenmue 3.
4228000	4230000	How about in the US, Loki?
4231000	4237000	So, let's see. This week, we don't have No Man's Sky and that's all that really matters.
4237000	4240000	Next week, though. Or, yeah, next week.
4240000	4246000	So, starting off for the first week in August here, we've got Abzu.
4246000	4249000	That's going to be coming out on PC and PlayStation 4.
4249000	4253000	Also, we get the beginning of the Batman the Telltale series.
4253000	4255000	Episode 1 is going to be coming out this week as well.
4255000	4256000	Oh, awesome. I want to check that out.
4256000	4258000	On pretty much all platforms.
4258000	4259000	Nice.
4260000	4263000	A game on PC called This is the Police.
4263000	4267000	And I can only hope that's based off of the band.
4267000	4271000	And then finally, Tricky Towers on PC and PlayStation 4.
4271000	4275000	And then on mobile, coming out this week, Mobius Final Fantasy.
4275000	4277000	That's coming out on iOS and Android.
4277000	4278000	Oh, is this the week for that?
4278000	4280000	Yep, apparently.
4280000	4284000	Overcooked, which is on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Do you remember that one?
4284000	4286000	No, it's not the sequel to Overwatch?
4286000	4290000	Nope. Overcooked, if I remember correctly, is the one that is like Iron Chef,
4290000	4293000	but you also have to go hunt the monsters in your ingredients.
4293000	4297000	So, it's that whole joke about why is the restaurant so slow?
4297000	4299000	Do they have to kill the chicken first?
4299000	4300000	Something like that.
4300000	4301000	But, yeah, this is like an RPG or something.
4301000	4303000	If I remember correctly, that's what that is.
4303000	4307000	Little King's Story is going to be coming to PC as well.
4307000	4309000	And that's it.
4309000	4312000	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the release schedule in Japan.
4313000	4316000	Some price reductions on the PlayStation 4 this week on the 4th of August
4316000	4320000	for Biohazard Revelations 2, which, of course, is Resident Evil.
4320000	4323000	That gets a price reduction on the PlayStation 4.
4323000	4326000	But also out this week is Wasteland 2.
4326000	4329000	The Director's Cut is out this week.
4329000	4331000	That is on the PlayStation 4.
4331000	4334000	I don't think the Wii U really has anything going on right now.
4334000	4337000	Nope, things are very slow and quiet over there on the Wii U.
4337000	4340000	On the Vita this week, though, we have Genkai Toki 7 Pirates
4340000	4342000	is out this week on the 4th.
4342000	4348000	And then we also have, there's a limited edition of that same game as well.
4348000	4350000	And that's really it on the Vita.
4350000	4357000	And then lastly, on the 3DS this week, we have Dragon Ball Fusions.
4357000	4362000	There is a new Nintendo, yeah, there's a new Nintendo 3DS LL.
4362000	4366000	There's a Super Famicom Edition and a Fire Emblem Edition.
4366000	4369000	And the Super Famicom Edition, it doesn't actually look like,
4369000	4371000	well, actually, no, it kind of does look like a Super Nintendo.
4371000	4373000	The box art did make it look like that.
4373000	4375000	Okay, that is pretty cool.
4375000	4377000	I don't know if you guys can see that here in the studio.
4377000	4379000	Let me make that a little bigger so that it doesn't zoom in.
4379000	4382000	But when it's closed, it actually looks like a Super Famicom system
4382000	4384000	with the little power switch and the eject.
4384000	4387000	And then on the inside, the buttons are actually colored
4387000	4389000	like they were in a Super Famicom.
4389000	4391000	Okay, that is super cute.
4391000	4394000	And if I collected 3DSs, I would want that.
4394000	4397000	But that's a very expensive thing to collect.
4397000	4402000	And then also on the 3DS this week, 12Sai Kousuru Diary is out this week.
4402000	4411000	And then there is Sekaijuu no Meikyu 5 Nagaki Shinwa no Hatae
4411000	4412000	comes out this week.
4412000	4416000	And that is in a regular and a collector's pack edition.
4416000	4421000	And this is the Eterion Odyssey series in Japan.
4421000	4424000	So it's the latest in that game.
4424000	4427000	So if you like your dungeon crawlers, enjoy.
4427000	4429000	And that's it for Japanese releases.
4429000	4431000	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
4431000	4432000	Well, a few things.
4432000	4438000	In the UK, we have the Telltale Batman on everything
4438000	4445000	and Abzu for PlayStation 4 and PC and Space Rift for PC.
4445000	4448000	On the 5th, Little King's Story for PC.
4448000	4449000	That's it.
4449000	4451000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys
4451000	4453000	than the classic game of the week.
4453000	4454000	Loki.
4454000	4458000	So this is something that they kind of teased, I want to say,
4458000	4463000	during E3 on talking about Oculus support coming to Minecraft.
4463000	4465000	Well, it's going to be coming a little bit sooner now.
4465000	4469000	So we should be expecting actually in the next few weeks, apparently.
4469000	4473000	It is already available for the Gear VR.
4473000	4475000	So they have a specific version for that.
4475000	4477000	But now they're talking about like on Windows 10
4477000	4481000	and possibly the regular PC version as well.
4482000	4483000	Very exciting.
4483000	4486000	I'm curious to see when that's going to be coming out, though.
4486000	4491000	They didn't really specifically say, but in the next few weeks.
4493000	4495000	I know you don't really have Oculus Rift,
4495000	4497000	but if you did, would you be all over this?
4497000	4498000	I do have the Oculus Rift.
4498000	4500000	Oh, that's right, you do. That's right.
4500000	4502000	Sorry, I'm thinking the Gear VR for some reason
4502000	4503000	was the only thing you have.
4503000	4505000	So are you going to check this out, then?
4505000	4508000	I will, but it'll run like absolute shit on my laptop.
4508000	4510000	But I mean, yeah, sure, I'll try it.
4510000	4511000	Try it.
4511000	4513000	It's just, it's going to, you know.
4513000	4515000	Well, the graphics in Minecraft aren't that good.
4516000	4517000	Right.
4518000	4522000	So, remember we were talking how like, you know,
4522000	4527000	they've basically, the Pokémon Go, Niantic has blocked those apps and stuff.
4527000	4530000	And like I mentioned, there's already workarounds for it.
4530000	4533000	So I have this app on my phone that I just downloaded
4533000	4535000	that is a third-party app that someone made.
4535000	4538000	And not only does it show you which Pokémon are around you,
4538000	4540000	it shows you all the Pokéstops in the area and everything.
4540000	4542000	It shows you if there's lures on them and all that.
4543000	4547000	So it must be tapping into the API or whatever.
4547000	4548000	Right.
4548000	4552000	So, also against terms of service, but we'll see.
4552000	4558000	Anyway, I know you all are excited that Just Dance,
4558000	4562000	Ubisoft's Just Dance series is going to be getting, I guess, a spin-off series.
4562000	4566000	It's not dancing, though. It's singing.
4566000	4570000	That's right. Just Sing was announced this week.
4570000	4573000	Ubisoft announced that they are making the game.
4573000	4576000	Just Sing is not supposed to be about competition.
4576000	4579000	It's just, you know, creating shareable stuff.
4579000	4582000	So, and when you watch people in the trailer do this,
4582000	4586000	they're holding the thing out like they're making a selfie while they're,
4586000	4589000	it's kind of weird, but whatever.
4589000	4591000	Stupid is the word you're looking for?
4591000	4596000	Well, apparently, lip-syncing is as good as actually singing.
4596000	4598000	It's not measuring your pitch.
4598000	4601000	It's measuring if you're, like, trying.
4601000	4603000	You're actually getting an A for effort, I guess.
4603000	4604000	So, you could just lip-sync.
4604000	4607000	So, if you don't want to sing, you can just bah, bah, bah, you know,
4607000	4610000	watermelon, bananas, watermelon, bananas,
4610000	4613000	and you would get credit for singing watermelon, bananas,
4613000	4616000	even though the song is really, you know,
4616000	4620000	the new Fergie song about the milfs, the milf man,
4620000	4623000	or what the hell is their new song about that's ridiculous?
4623000	4626000	Somebody knows what I'm talking about, right?
4626000	4627000	Fergie has a new song.
4627000	4629000	Dark Socko, clearly you know this, right?
4634000	4636000	Somebody in chat knows, right?
4636000	4637000	All right.
4637000	4643000	So, anyway, Just Sing will also take advantage of Xbox One's Kinect
4643000	4645000	or the PlayStation Camera.
4645000	4649000	Your phone is the microphone and camera via a free app,
4649000	4651000	which, you know, Just Dance has this as well.
4651000	4655000	And let's talk about the song list, what's in this game here.
4655000	4660000	So, oh, I thought the song list was going to be there on the actual article,
4660000	4664000	but I know, let's see, Dark Tetsuya had posted it in our forums,
4664000	4668000	and there was some pretty hilarious songs in here.
4668000	4671000	It's kind of a little bit of a mix of different genres
4671000	4673000	and different decades like you would expect.
4673000	4677000	Let's see, Chandelier by Sia, so you can go around and do the dance
4677000	4679000	that the girl does in the video.
4679000	4682000	Love Me Like You Do by Ailey Goodling.
4682000	4684000	One More Night by Maroon 5.
4684000	4687000	What Do You Mean by Justin Bieber?
4687000	4690000	Let's see, Baby One More Time, which I'm assuming is Britney.
4690000	4692000	Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.
4692000	4693000	I Love Rock and Roll.
4693000	4695000	Love Shack.
4695000	4698000	Oh, my favorite karaoke song is going to be in Just Sing.
4698000	4700000	I can't freaking wait.
4700000	4702000	There it is.
4703000	4705000	All right.
4705000	4708000	So, yeah, I'm sure you all are looking forward to Just Sing.
4708000	4711000	Anyway, if that isn't enough for you,
4711000	4715000	there's other karaoke games coming out later this year.
4715000	4719000	A video game based off The Voice is coming out.
4719000	4721000	This is a new Voice video game
4721000	4724000	because I feel like there already was one on the Wii or something.
4724000	4727000	But anyway, this is yet another game based on The Voice,
4727000	4731000	and it will include 30 top tracks from the charts
4731000	4733000	that you can use to impress the coaches,
4733000	4737000	and you can play it by yourself or you can play it with friends.
4737000	4740000	Voxler is the developer behind the game,
4740000	4747000	and, yeah, that should be something that will be a hit at parties, I guess.
4747000	4749000	I don't think I will...
4749000	4751000	I don't know if I'll be picking that up.
4751000	4754000	Only 30 songs? That doesn't seem like very many.
4754000	4756000	You've got to have more in this day and age.
4756000	4760000	All right, let's travel to a classic time.
4760000	4765000	It's a classic time when people were not singing into their phones
4765000	4768000	and taking selfies and all this stuff.
4768000	4770000	If you took pictures of yourself playing video games,
4770000	4773000	you had to go get those pictures developed.
4773000	4776000	And they were usually taken by other people anyway.
4776000	4778000	It's the classic game of the week.
4778000	4780000	Remember One Hour Photos?
4780000	4782000	Whatever happened to One Hour Photoshops?
4782000	4784000	Remember Mastering the Art of the Selfie with a Polaroid Camera?
4784000	4787000	They're all cash advance shops now.
4787000	4789000	Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.
4789000	4793000	Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks,
4793000	4799000	hey, you ungrateful little brats, put your phones down and play this.
4799000	4803000	You won't find any Pokémon there, but this is way better than Pokémon.
4803000	4804000	Right, Dark Soccer?
4804000	4806000	Well, this game is a sequel that was eight years in the making.
4806000	4808000	What is the classic game of the week?
4808000	4811000	Blasteroids.
4811000	4814000	Remember, I said I have one of these in my garage.
4814000	4818000	Dan sends me this text, hey, look what I just got, and it's a Blasteroids.
4818000	4820000	I'm like, really? Okay.
4820000	4824000	This game is older than a bunch of people I know.
4824000	4831000	So Blasteroids was a sequel to Asteroids, which came out in 1979.
4831000	4834000	Blasteroids came out in 1987.
4834000	4839000	And it uses full raster, not vector, as Asteroids did.
4839000	4844000	It had home computer ports that were released.
4844000	4851000	In 1989, we had Image Works releasing it for the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC,
4851000	4858000	Atari ST, Commodore 64, N128, MSX, MS-DOS PC, and ZX Spectrum.
4858000	4860000	Sorry, ZX Spectrum.
4860000	4861000	I have to say it right.
4861000	4869000	Also, one thing, though, to note is that this has never appeared in any of the Midway compilations,
4869000	4876000	though it did show up in LEGO Dimensions as an unlockable minigame that was accessible in The End is Try.
4876000	4882000	So basically, it's, you know, more Asteroids.
4882000	4888000	You control your ship from an above view in a 2D representation of space,
4888000	4893000	and then you use thrust to, you know, move the ship along with its momentum.
4893000	4898000	You can slow down or stop moving, so you have to rotate it to face the direction it came from,
4898000	4904000	and then generate exactly the right amount of thrust you need to nullify the motion.
4904000	4908000	It also has fuel that...
4908000	4917000	It's energy that, you know, will also deplete the shields to protect from collisions and enemy fire.
4917000	4922000	And then once all that energy is gone, you are dead.
4922000	4925000	So you have to destroy Asteroids and enemy ships.
4925000	4931000	And the ship can also be turned into three different versions.
4931000	4938000	One of them is a fast one called the Speeder, a fighter that has the most firepower, and the warrior that has extra armor.
4938000	4940000	And so you can start...
4940000	4944000	At the start of the game, you get four different Warps, which are your difficulties.
4944000	4947000	Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert.
4947000	4951000	And so when you fly through that Warp, that gives you your difficulty,
4951000	4959000	and each Warp has different galaxies with 9 or 16 sectors, your levels, depending on the difficulty that you go through.
4959000	4963000	So basically you just have to clean out all of the fields and keep moving forward.
4963000	4969000	You get different power crystals to power you up, but they decay over time.
4969000	4974000	You also get these type of Asteroids that if you shoot them, you have to shoot them again,
4974000	4976000	because they'll break into smaller pieces.
4976000	4985000	And then you've got your boss, Mukor, who shows up after the sectors are cleared of Asteroids.
4985000	4988000	He will try to ram you and send little ships into you.
4988000	4991000	And he has tentacles, because you have to have tentacles.
4991000	4998000	It also has a multiplayer mode, so a second player can join in by pressing the fire button for one credit.
4998000	5001000	And so Blastroids is multiplayer Asteroids as well.
5002000	5010000	And then you can also cover each other's ships by docking one of them.
5010000	5018000	So, for example, if you dock and one is a Speeder and the other one is a Warrior,
5018000	5022000	then it will turn the Speeder into a turret with more firepower.
5022000	5024000	It'll do different things to each other.
5024000	5026000	So that's it, Blastroids.
5026000	5029000	You know, I have to admit, I've never played this, Blastroids.
5029000	5033000	I actually had no idea that this existed. I somehow just missed it all these years.
5033000	5035000	You can play it at my house.
5035000	5037000	Apparently I can. And some pinball.
5037000	5039000	Well, you know, a party was yesterday.
5039000	5043000	Well, I was actually about to, I was surprised you didn't talk about that at the beginning of the show.
5043000	5044000	Because I didn't go.
5044000	5045000	You didn't go.
5045000	5048000	Because what am I going to do, play everything and hurt?
5048000	5050000	Yeah, with your wrist. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
5050000	5053000	So, I slept.
5053000	5058000	And I really wanted to go, but a friend of mine had a situation that they needed my help on.
5058000	5060000	So I had to do that instead.
5060000	5063000	Well, Dan ended up taking the Blastroids with him.
5063000	5065000	Oh, okay. Wow.
5065000	5068000	Yeah, there's people who bring like arcade machines there for Atari Party as well.
5068000	5071000	That's awesome. Did they still do it in that little room at the library?
5071000	5073000	Yeah, well sometimes they do it in Sunnyvale as well.
5073000	5076000	But it's basically at one library or another.
5076000	5078000	Wow, that's still really cool. Awesome.
5078000	5082000	Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Blastroids.
5082000	5084000	Come over to Jamie's house and play it.
5084000	5086000	She's inviting you all over.
5086000	5087000	Yep.
5087000	5089000	Alright, well we're going to take a quick break you guys.
5089000	5095000	When we come back there's plenty more show to come including rapid fire news, the FUs of the week, and the mailbag.
5095000	5098000	Your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
5098000	5103000	All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5109000	5112000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5112000	5119000	Live tonight, episode 652 for this July the 31st of 2016.
5119000	5124000	We've been talking about all sorts of news tonight, including the latest on what's been going on with Pokémon GO,
5124000	5128000	the No Man's Sky leaks, which I think I caught Loki watching there during the break.
5128000	5129000	You must have found them somewhere.
5129000	5130000	Yeah, I found them somewhere.
5130000	5131000	Yeah, what'd you think?
5131000	5134000	I thought they looked fun. It just makes me want to play it even more.
5134000	5135000	Yeah, there you go.
5135000	5138000	And talk about some of the big NX rumors as well.
5138000	5144000	So we've had a pretty busy show, and we've got plenty more to come including your phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
5144000	5148000	So be our friend on Skype, and we'll be getting to the Skype line a little bit later in the show.
5148000	5151000	But first, some rapid fire news.
5151000	5156000	Right, and speaking of No Man's Sky, it is going to be a game that does not require PlayStation Plus.
5156000	5164000	Being the fact that it is multiplayer technically, because there are other players playing,
5164000	5169000	but the universe is so vast that it's very unlikely that you'll find anybody.
5169000	5173000	So that's why they're not charging you for the multiplayer on that.
5173000	5175000	That's kind of funny.
5175000	5177000	But it looks seriously fun.
5177000	5179000	I got it.
5179000	5182000	It's going to be hard to wait another eight days for it.
5182000	5183000	Yeah.
5183000	5184000	We'll see.
5184000	5186000	And this is pretty cool.
5186000	5189000	We kind of talked about this I think either last week or the week before last.
5189000	5196000	There was a game called Pray for the Gods, and that was very similar to almost a Shadow of the Colossus-type game on Kickstarter.
5196000	5198000	And it's met its goal.
5198000	5203000	So they've already met their goal, and it is funded, still with ten days left.
5203000	5209000	And not only that, but they've announced that they're going to be coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5209000	5214000	So basically saying they've already even tried porting them to the system.
5214000	5222000	It says within days we had them playable and running at 30 FPS unoptimized.
5222000	5229000	So hopefully that will be running a little bit faster when they do eventually optimize it, but that's pretty awesome.
5229000	5233000	And spontaneous music!
5233000	5234000	Now we're in the safari.
5234000	5235000	Sorry about that.
5235000	5238000	I don't know why my playlist looped back to the beginning.
5238000	5240000	That was awkward. Sorry about that.
5240000	5242000	But yeah.
5242000	5243000	So that looks pretty awesome.
5243000	5248000	I am looking forward to actually playing that sometime whenever they do eventually release it.
5250000	5251000	All right.
5251000	5255000	Let's move on and talk about Splatoon and Splatfest.
5255000	5261000	You know, they're done, because the Callie and Marie thing, that was the last Splatfest that was ever going to happen.
5261000	5262000	Who won?
5262000	5265000	I believe Marie did?
5265000	5267000	I think Marie did.
5267000	5268000	I don't know. I didn't play. I missed it.
5268000	5270000	But I'm pretty sure Marie did.
5270000	5273000	Okay. Thank you. Act F in chat confirming that.
5273000	5274000	So start to see.
5274000	5282000	So usually when you participated in these Splatoon events, you would get currency known as Super Sea Snails.
5282000	5288000	However, because Splatfests are basically done, some people were like, well, how am I going to get these now?
5288000	5292000	Well, the good news is there is going to still be a way to earn this currency.
5292000	5299000	You have to talk to Judd, who's the lazy cat, and you exchange Ranked and Turf War wins for one snail.
5299000	5303000	But it is a pretty big rate. You do have to do 30 wins per snail.
5303000	5308000	But you can also buy additional snails from Spike with gold if you want.
5308000	5309000	I will never play this.
5309000	5310000	What?
5310000	5311000	I will never play this.
5311000	5312000	Why?
5312000	5313000	Snails.
5313000	5315000	Oh, but you're giving them away.
5315000	5317000	No. It involves mollusks. I won't play it.
5317000	5318000	It's a little silly.
5318000	5328000	But that's it. So you are able to get those currency even though they're gone, essentially, from being able to be earned in Splatfest.
5328000	5333000	Also announced this week, there is a brand new expansion coming to Hearthstone.
5333000	5338000	I know some of you all play Hearthstone like crazy on PC and tablets.
5338000	5342000	And there is a new expansion that's been announced. It's called One Night in Karazhan.
5342000	5351000	Lots more single player content, 45 new cards, and it launches August 11th with the prologue mission free for everybody.
5351000	5354000	And if you looked at the trailer, it looked ridiculous.
5354000	5359000	But I'm okay with that because Karazhan was my favorite thing in World of Warcraft that raid.
5359000	5361000	I have a lot of good memories about that raid.
5361000	5371000	So I'm okay with it being a little bit over the top and silly and disco crazy because that is what I like.
5371000	5372000	I like a little bit of cheesy.
5372000	5375000	Alright, let's move on. DarkSaukra, for RapidFireNews.
5376000	5383000	Well, we have a listing for Metal Gear Solid V Definitive X.
5383000	5385000	It just says X, EX.
5387000	5398000	So, it looks like it's supposed to be, hopefully, a more fleshed out version of the Phantom Pain, maybe?
5398000	5402000	Or it would just have whatever DLC or whatever came with it?
5402000	5408000	Take a guess. I would say it's probably the Phantom Pain and the...
5408000	5411000	What was the first one they released? Their demo.
5411000	5417000	Oh, yeah. They gave it away during PlayStation Plus at one point. I know what you're talking about. Yeah, the prologue thing.
5417000	5420000	Phantom Pain and... It just slips to mind.
5420000	5425000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. The one that everybody had been talking about where it was like two hours or whatever.
5425000	5428000	Right. I mean, my guess. It's just a compilation of both.
5428000	5429000	Makes sense.
5429000	5431000	Now the chat room knows about my big mollusk phobia.
5433000	5438000	Well, I mean, they're not... I don't know. It's just a little... Like, it looks like a coin. I don't know. But whatever.
5438000	5440000	If it's just the shell, that's fine.
5440000	5442000	Yeah, that's all it is. It's not just like wheel around on the ground or anything.
5442000	5444000	But the word even creeps me out. The thought of it makes...
5444000	5448000	Like, when we used to get slugs in the bathtub, I would make Dan go get rid of them.
5448000	5452000	I would wake his ass up at three in the morning and then scrub the tub.
5452000	5454000	I am not kidding.
5454000	5456000	Thank God we don't live in that house anymore.
5457000	5463000	So, yeah. Okay. So, yeah. Metal Gear. Metal Gear. Okay.
5463000	5468000	And also, you can sign up now for the PS4 software update beta.
5468000	5476000	So, you have to register for it, even if you've been in past betas before.
5476000	5481000	They're not saying what they're going to test, but the beta starts in early August.
5481000	5483000	So, like, tomorrow?
5484000	5490000	So, anyway, you have to be 18 years old, and you submit your PSN ID,
5490000	5495000	and answer some questions about beta communications, and there you go.
5495000	5500000	But not everyone will be selected, so just go look at it online.
5500000	5503000	They really only ask two things. They ask, what's your username?
5503000	5508000	And do you opt in for beta contact information, yes or no?
5508000	5510000	Because I signed up for it today.
5510000	5516000	You can look for the URL on the PlayStation.com and website. There you go.
5525000	5529000	All right. Let's get back into some other news that's going on this week,
5529000	5533000	and we do have the mailbag and the FUs coming up as well soon. Loki.
5533000	5538000	So, there was a no fool question on the weekend this week.
5538000	5542000	It is on hiatus, but somebody has expressed interest in taking that over,
5542000	5544000	so I'm hoping I have something to announce soon.
5544000	5549000	Very cool. Anyways, so, I was going to say, there was some controversy
5549000	5554000	regarding some of the NVIDIA GTX cards that came out last generation,
5554000	5559000	because it is last generation now, since we have the 1080, 1070 cards.
5559000	5564000	But one of those was actually the GTX 970, which was advertised to have
5564000	5570000	four gigabytes of DDR5 RAM, which it technically did,
5570000	5575000	but the card only was able to access three and a half gigs of that,
5575000	5582000	and apparently the last 0.5 gigabytes was lower performance memory.
5582000	5585000	And because of this class action lawsuit, that means that if you did purchase
5585000	5589000	one of these cards, you were entitled to $30.
5589000	5595000	So, they're going to be paying out to every person that purchased one of those cards.
5595000	5597000	So, that's not bad.
5597000	5599000	Sorry, did my screen...
5599000	5602000	Is Darth Vader actually pulling up one of the pictures?
5602000	5609000	That doesn't look like a snail. That looks like a, just a seashell.
5609000	5613000	Maybe you shouldn't watch Stranger Things, not the spoiler or anything,
5613000	5615000	but maybe you should just hold off.
5615000	5617000	Are there lots of snails in it?
5617000	5618000	Is it one scene?
5618000	5621000	No, but it's one scene. Yeah.
5621000	5624000	Just warn me what episode it's in, and I'll scare you.
5624000	5626000	The very, very, very end.
5626000	5628000	Of the very last one?
5628000	5631000	Well, we've got to be careful about spoilers, so that's all.
5631000	5634000	Well, maybe I should just watch it with somebody so someone can tell me not to look.
5634000	5635000	There you go.
5635000	5639000	See, this just looks like Toad, kind of, with a big sea hat.
5639000	5642000	Do all of them look like this?
5642000	5644000	That's it. That's all it is.
5644000	5646000	They're not even enemies in the game or anything.
5647000	5648000	I can deal with that.
5648000	5653000	There you go. Act F does, I guess, I don't know if that's a victory shout in chat or what,
5653000	5655000	but there you go.
5655000	5660000	Okay, so we actually had kind of addressed this earlier in the show about the whole
5660000	5663000	does NX actually play the GameCube and Wii games after all?
5663000	5667000	I had a copy of Uzumaki and I gave it away without ever watching it.
5667000	5668000	What?
5668000	5672000	To Sistabiri in the chat room.
5672000	5673000	Oh, okay.
5673000	5675000	Asking if the Uzumaki movie or manga.
5675000	5676000	I can't watch it.
5676000	5680000	I actually did have a copy of Uzumaki that I bought.
5680000	5685000	Just because I was collecting everything I could and the moment I realized what would be in it,
5685000	5687000	I gave it away.
5687000	5689000	I gave away a $30 movie.
5689000	5691000	Well, don't give away your Nintendo NX if you buy one.
5691000	5698000	So, anyway, I guess the analysis site Digital Foundry took a look at some of what's been
5698000	5702000	brought up about the NX rumors and talked about could the Tegra chip,
5702000	5705000	even though we know it's going to be a new super power chip,
5705000	5709000	could it actually do GameCube and Wii emulation?
5709000	5715000	And apparently they are finding that maybe it actually could actually run these things,
5715000	5718000	which honestly is not a surprise at all.
5718000	5722000	You can run a lot of this stuff on Android devices practically, can't you?
5722000	5724000	So, I don't know.
5724000	5729000	Anyway, I kind of think we already kind of got into this a little bit before, so yeah, that's it.
5729000	5731000	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?
5731000	5734000	Okay, that's not so bad either.
5734000	5736000	Uh, oh yeah.
5736000	5740000	So, something that has nothing to do with mollusks.
5740000	5745000	There is going to be a mini Mega Drive set coming out in Europe,
5745000	5750000	although there's no statement as to whether or not it's going to come out in the US,
5750000	5754000	but it's preordered at Fun Stock.
5754000	5756000	It looks like there's two different versions.
5756000	5760000	One of them is just a plug-in console, I think.
5760000	5762000	It actually even looks like it has a loading slot.
5762000	5766000	And the other one, I'm just going to say this the moment I saw it, I was like,
5766000	5769000	oh, it's fucking Nomad.
5769000	5772000	Like, didn't they already try that?
5772000	5779000	But, it looks like it's just going to be,
5779000	5783000	has twice the number of games than the Mini NES,
5783000	5791000	and it will also be the same price as the Mini NES,
5791000	5798000	and I'm trying to see what the other thing it looks like,
5798000	5801000	because yeah, it looks like you can actually play your own games on it
5801000	5803000	from what it looks like, but I don't know.
5803000	5808000	I think it's just all the built-in stuff, so there you go.
5808000	5812000	Another thing that will probably get my money if it comes out over here,
5812000	5817000	although I'll be perfectly honest, we have like three Sega Genesises around,
5817000	5820000	and a couple of power-based converters and Master Systems,
5820000	5824000	although what would be funny is that if this one, the black one,
5824000	5828000	is like a cartridge loader, if it would actually,
5828000	5833000	I would love to test and see if it works with the power-based converter.
5833000	5838000	That would be fun, other than that. Neat.
5838000	5840000	Yeah, kind of funny that it was announced right around the same time,
5840000	5843000	because I don't think they just did it as a response.
5843000	5845000	They had to have been working on it already.
5845000	5849000	You can't really pull something like that out after a week, but yeah.
5849000	5854000	Well, yeah, they can't, but they've already released this.
5854000	5857000	It's just being repackaged and re-released,
5857000	5860000	because if you're on Amazon, actually, you can pick one up already.
5860000	5862000	I'm not sure if it's the same set of games,
5862000	5867000	although it looks like the game list is pretty similar.
5867000	5871000	So it could be akin to an Atari Flashback and an Atari Flashback 2.
5871000	5872000	It's kind of similar.
5872000	5873000	Maybe.
5873000	5876000	Yeah, okay, I got you, I got you. Interesting.
5876000	5879000	All right, well, let's move on. Loki.
5879000	5885000	All right, so there's a cool new hack for the Vita in the Vita TV,
5885000	5887000	and actually, I'm probably going to partake in this,
5887000	5891000	but basically, it's going to allow you to run emulators and homebrew
5891000	5898000	and more games on the PlayStation Vita and, I believe, the Vita TV as well.
5898000	5904000	So this is basically called the Henkaku hack that they're doing,
5904000	5911000	and it's basically something that you have to have firmware 3.6 or lower,
5911000	5914000	and it's done through the Vita's web browser.
5914000	5919000	So you go to a website, and you have to do this every time you do it,
5919000	5921000	because it doesn't stay on your actual console.
5921000	5927000	But you go to the website, you access this page, and it loads the hack onto your system.
5927000	5931000	And then, of course, you load your emulators and all that stuff.
5931000	5934000	They have ways to do that as well.
5934000	5935000	Yeah, and it's pretty awesome.
5935000	5938000	So off you go.
5938000	5941000	I need to check this out, because that looks pretty cool.
5941000	5943000	That's interesting that you load it through a website each and every time,
5943000	5947000	but it's not something you mod or do anything long-term to the firmware.
5947000	5955000	Right, and they've tried to make it in a way that it's not going to promote piracy,
5955000	5958000	so they're trying to make it difficult for people to pirate games on it,
5958000	5962000	but you're going to be able to run emulators and homebrew stuff and all that.
5962000	5968000	Well, I'll be curious about that, except can you even get a Vita TV anymore?
5968000	5970000	I never bought one.
5970000	5974000	You might be able to find one close out somewhere.
5974000	5978000	I mean, I've got mine for 30 bucks, and I don't really use it.
5978000	5981000	I kind of forget I have it sometimes, because it's so small,
5981000	5985000	but I know I haven't updated that firmware forever,
5985000	5990000	so I'm sure it's probably capable of doing this.
5990000	5995000	All right, well, let's talk about the next project from Remedy Entertainment.
5995000	5999000	Remedy Entertainment, of course, made a quantum break on the Xbox One.
5999000	6003000	Also, Alan Wake, Max Payne.
6003000	6005000	Quantum Wake?
6005000	6006000	Perhaps.
6006000	6007000	Alan Break?
6007000	6008000	Perhaps.
6008000	6010000	People are curious, you know, oh, what are they going to work on next
6010000	6013000	now that quantum break is kind of all said and done?
6013000	6015000	What is the next thing that's going to happen?
6015000	6019000	I guess the next project, or at least what's announced so far,
6019000	6024000	a campaign for the next installment of the free-to-play shooter Crossfire.
6024000	6026000	That's Crossfire 2.
6026000	6029000	Now, granted, you probably don't know this game,
6029000	6031000	because there's not a lot of players stateside.
6031000	6034000	I guess it does exist, but most of the people that play this game
6034000	6039000	are actually in Asia, where Smilegate, who makes the game, is located.
6039000	6043000	So Smilegate actually picked Remedy to bring their unique blend of
6043000	6046000	storytelling, memorable characters, and inventive gameplay
6046000	6051000	to Crossfire's global audience, and that was in a post on Remedy's blog.
6051000	6054000	Apparently this has actually been being worked on for some time,
6054000	6057000	but that's all we know right now, so if you're waiting for a sequel
6057000	6060000	to Alan Wake or Quantum Break, we don't know anything yet.
6061000	6064000	I wouldn't think that this is a huge undertaking that's going to take away
6064000	6066000	from anything else for very long.
6066000	6068000	I can't be the only one that's not disappointed that this isn't based off
6068000	6073000	of the 90s board game that was shooting ball bearings at each other.
6073000	6077000	That game is older than the 90s, it's just that they did the remake.
6077000	6080000	I think that game goes back to the 70s, but still.
6081000	6084000	It didn't have the awesome commercial until the 80s or 90s.
6084000	6086000	It caught in the Crossfire.
6087000	6089000	That was amazing.
6089000	6091000	Yeah, no, this is not that same game.
6091000	6096000	This is a different game that Remedy will be making that one little add-on for.
6096000	6098000	We'll see what happens with that.
6098000	6100000	Let's get to the mailbag.
6100000	6102000	Every week you guys send us emails.
6102000	6105000	Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you want to participate
6105000	6107000	with our mailbag segment.
6107000	6110000	DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and finds some emails
6110000	6114000	that she thinks, hey, this would be a worthy thing to read on the show.
6114000	6116000	DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?
6116000	6118000	Two from the same person.
6119000	6120000	So, shall I begin?
6120000	6121000	Yes, you shall.
6122000	6128000	I am not playing Pokemon Go only because my iPod Touch 5G does not appear to support it.
6128000	6133000	Every time I've tried to set up an account, the app crashes when I try to uncheck email notifications.
6133000	6136000	And then it's no longer able to log in and able to find user info.
6136000	6142000	Not sure if this is the device because the server was down the first time I tried to create an account.
6142000	6148000	If I owned a proper smartphone, I'd be all over it like white on.
6148000	6152000	What first gen Pokemon is predominantly white, not counting Mewtwo?
6152000	6155000	Mewtwo's purple, lavender, whatever.
6155000	6160000	Well, actually is Mewtwo kind of gray lavender? Not really white.
6160000	6163000	Mewtwo I think is purple and Mew might be grayish.
6163000	6164000	Mew's lavender.
6164000	6167000	Mew's like pink. Right?
6167000	6168000	Pinkender.
6168000	6169000	Yeah, I don't know.
6169000	6177000	I do wonder, incidentally, whether people will get confused about the nature of Deus Ex Go.
6177000	6184000	I assume it's a term based puzzle like the Hitman or Lara Croft Go games.
6184000	6186000	Not anything AR focused.
6186000	6191000	Here's hoping nobody's foolish enough to make the word Go the next edge or saga.
6191000	6194000	Including Vivendi occupied Ubisoft.
6194000	6198000	No disease jokes please, but are there regional Pokemon planned for South America?
6198000	6202000	South America and Africa? Is the game even coming out in those continents?
6202000	6211000	I think we kind of referenced that earlier in the show when I talked about the Brazil people are very angry and that probably is what originated the hack.
6211000	6216000	I think it's just a matter of they've got to get some more things stabilized with the game first.
6216000	6220000	How about they fix their economy and take care of their people before they worry about the game?
6220000	6222000	Oh, I'm sorry.
6223000	6234000	I don't know if Niantic can do all that, but as far as Pokemon Go goes, I think they need to fix some of these other issues that are a little more pressing right now.
6234000	6242000	And it should run on that device. My wife has an iPhone 5 and it runs on that.
6242000	6249000	There were some difficulties logging in recently with the last update. It required some finagling.
6250000	6252000	Best bet would be to uninstall the game.
6252000	6262000	If you're logging in with your Google account, which you really should be because to be honest, the Pokemon Club logins have been down more than the Google logins.
6262000	6273000	So if you were logging in with Google, which I hope you are, you go to your login to Google on a PC or Mac and basically remove the app permissions from it.
6273000	6277000	And then go back in there and reinstall the game and re-login and all that stuff.
6277000	6286000	And hopefully it'll work that time and not give you the error that we had the other day, which was enable cookies. So make sure you enable cookies as well.
6286000	6291000	And I would think this seems obvious, but just to make sure, make sure you have the most recent iOS on there as well.
6291000	6297000	And also the most recent version of the app too, because sometimes it doesn't update automatically.
6297000	6301000	Yeah, I finally was unable to use my beta app anymore. It finally stopped working for me.
6301000	6306000	I had to go back into the store and download the real game because the beta stopped working with this latest update.
6306000	6307000	Oh well.
6307000	6316000	Also, I would just like to point out that if people want to know what I was talking about Brazil, just look up the past two years of protests and you'll know what I'm talking about.
6316000	6319000	Or the whole World Cup drama there was at too.
6319000	6321000	So moving back to the email.
6321000	6334000	Finally, purely out of academic curiosity, since I do not yet have a Windows PC or partition on my 2009 MacBook, any idea if the popular Toho games, primarily the shooters, are available at all for legal purchase and download?
6334000	6339000	All I've seen are DVD ROMs on Amazon. This comes from Robert M.
6339000	6349000	I see the screen name Rob Roberts is shared by toy customizer Cheetamus Prime, who has been fairly inactive recently for health reasons.
6350000	6359000	I was, I know there's a fisherman, there's a DJ in Australia, and there's a gun owner that also uses the name.
6359000	6367000	And so, yeah, I guess, you know, it's, it's, I guess, not an entirely too difficult name to have.
6367000	6371000	So no relation to the famous Julia, for what it's worth.
6371000	6373000	But there you go.
6373000	6377000	I tried to get verified by Twitter this week, by the way, they shot me down.
6377000	6378000	Unfortunate.
6378000	6382000	Also, this is the follow up email from the same person.
6382000	6383000	Yes.
6383000	6390000	As a quick follow up after the update, I'm no longer hanging on the unable to find a user that the app still crashes on the terms and services page.
6390000	6394000	Most likely an incompatibility with the fifth gen touch.
6394000	6397000	Check the website, check the compatibility list.
6397000	6399000	Yeah, I should say what it'll run on.
6399000	6404000	Yeah, check compatibility list and make sure you're on the most recent operating system version and the usual.
6404000	6406000	Make sure you turn it off and then on again.
6406000	6414000	And if all else fails, force loaded on there anyways after you root it, which is what I did on my son's phone.
6414000	6416000	It's all I'm sorry, you're not compatible device.
6416000	6418000	Well, fuck you, because it runs anyways, bitch.
6418000	6422000	So take that compatible device.
6425000	6429000	Not that we necessarily endorse all these actions.
6429000	6430000	Good luck.
6430000	6438000	Although, you know, again, just try to- Pokemon Go is a game that's supposed to last for a very, very long time.
6438000	6441000	And people want to beat it in three weeks.
6441000	6444000	You know, try again in a few weeks.
6444000	6447000	I bet this landscape will be a lot different than it is now.
6447000	6449000	It's a very fast moving thing.
6449000	6454000	It's hard to go into the unknown of being the biggest cell phone game of all time.
6454000	6457000	Anyway, is that it for the mailbag?
6457000	6458000	That is.
6458000	6460000	Participate at orangehonestradio.com.
6460000	6465000	I want to make sure the other thing didn't fall off the radar about the shooter games on the Mac.
6465000	6467000	I have not heard of any of that release.
6467000	6472000	Hold on, because I knew that I think some were on Steam, so give me a moment.
6472000	6476000	Because, I mean, I play a lot of my- I have both Macs and PCs.
6476000	6482000	And a lot of the games that I have on Steam for my PC, I can also play on my Mac.
6482000	6490000	Like, I've been playing Danganronpa 2 on my Mac, so I'll double check a few things for Steam right now.
6490000	6496000	So if people want to go ahead and continue story-ing, I can research.
6496000	6502000	Well, sadly, what I have next is not a story, and it will require your attention, DarkSakura.
6502000	6504000	But you can get this out of your system real fast.
6504000	6506000	Oh my god, there's an IKEA game.
6506000	6507000	What?
6507000	6511000	There's a game that looks like an IKEA ad called Home Improvisation.
6511000	6513000	I'm gonna buy this right now.
6513000	6517000	Well, hold on, before you click the buy button, we gotta get a little bit of angst out of you.
6517000	6518000	It's time for the FUs of the Week.
6534000	6537000	And DarkSakura, you must start us off.
6537000	6541000	Um, fuck you to my wrist, really.
6541000	6553000	I am intensely tired of the constant pain and working on it for an entire week.
6553000	6560000	It's just, yesterday I did nothing but take Norco and ice it and play The Sims.
6560000	6562000	Literally, that's all I did.
6562000	6563000	You know.
6563000	6565000	Well, and I drank a whole bunch of orange soda.
6565000	6568000	But other than that, I'm tired of it.
6568000	6571000	I had the surgery done to get rid of the lump.
6571000	6573000	I understood there might be some scar tissue.
6573000	6580000	I did not expect, I thought that, I expected to have some hardness under the skin.
6580000	6582000	I expected there to be scar tissue.
6582000	6587000	I did not expect for the full lump that I had removed to regrow.
6587000	6590000	And I wasn't given any warning about it, so.
6590000	6596000	If I had had some sort of expectation that, yeah, it could happen and that we're gonna keep looking at it,
6596000	6600000	then I would be okay, but I'm right-handed.
6600000	6601000	I can't draw.
6601000	6603000	I can't play games that much.
6603000	6608000	And it's basically put so much of what I do on hold, so.
6608000	6609000	Okay, I'm done.
6609000	6611000	All right, Loki.
6611000	6617000	Um, I was angrier earlier, but then, you know, I had my, uh, surgery, so, you know, that makes everything better.
6617000	6625000	Um, so, I guess just F you to, ironically enough, bad drivers for people playing Pokemon Go.
6625000	6629000	Which is ironic because I play Pokemon Go while I drive, despite the stupid warnings of the game.
6629000	6630000	The game doesn't know better.
6630000	6631000	I mean, seriously.
6631000	6633000	Um, but there's a lot of people that are new.
6633000	6640000	See, they haven't been playing Ingress for a year like I have been driving, so they're not as, you know,
6640000	6642000	they don't know the ins and outs of it.
6642000	6645000	And it's just like, it's very obvious.
6645000	6648000	Maybe you're not driving and playing Pokemon Go, but you're at least texting.
6648000	6650000	Just don't be obvious about it.
6650000	6656000	Like, when I play, eyes are straight ahead, but I can, like, glance down, you know.
6656000	6658000	I can catch Pokemon without looking at it.
6658000	6661000	I mean, that's how long I've played this game.
6661000	6663000	So, I don't know.
6663000	6665000	Just watch where you're going, people.
6665000	6667000	Seriously.
6667000	6669000	Um, I don't really have enough view of the week.
6669000	6673000	Uh, I guess F you to those Cinnabon things for being so freaking addicting.
6673000	6675000	In Dark Soccer, they're making me fat by bringing me here.
6675000	6676000	I asked first.
6676000	6677000	She did. She did.
6677000	6679000	But I can still say F you a little bit.
6679000	6681000	Um, and, uh, I don't know.
6681000	6684000	F you to all the paperwork I've had to do with my car.
6684000	6687000	It's like, God, we had to go get the insurance updated.
6687000	6689000	Then we had to go get repairs done on the old cars.
6689000	6691000	There's been a lot of this stuff.
6691000	6693000	But I'm glad it's all done, and I really enjoy my new car.
6693000	6695000	It's so fun to drive.
6695000	6697000	So, um, that part.
6697000	6699000	And I have not had to put gas in it yet.
6699000	6701000	That's the great thing.
6701000	6709000	I've, uh, I'm down below half a tank, but, um, I bought the car a week ago Saturday, and I still have not had to put gas in it yet.
6709000	6711000	That's the best part of all.
6711000	6712000	Cool. Love it.
6712000	6719000	I will say, by the way, is that I just looked up Toho, and while there's not any, I think, official games, um, they're still all, uh, PC shooters.
6719000	6721000	So, whatevs.
6721000	6722000	Alright.
6722000	6724000	But I want this home improvement sandbox thing.
6724000	6725000	Well.
6725000	6728000	You can put, you can put mannequins as wheels on a skateboard.
6728000	6730000	Could you imagine?
6730000	6732000	That's pretty rad.
6732000	6735000	Well, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna open up the Skypline.
6735000	6740000	While we're flying through, uh, the second half of the show this week, we might end up finishing a little early, which actually might work out,
6740000	6744000	because Dark Soccer, I know, had to take off, um, about 8.30, you said, right?
6744000	6745000	So, uh, we'll...
6745000	6748000	About then. I have to be at work at seven in the morning.
6748000	6749000	Buh.
6749000	6753000	Yeah, we'll be saying bye-bye to her in a little bit, but we might be saying bye-bye to everybody.
6753000	6755000	We'll see, uh, how the Skypline looks in a little bit.
6755000	6757000	We just have a couple more stories, though, first. Loki.
6757000	6760000	So, the Oregon Trail is coming back.
6760000	6767000	No, not in the form of a game based on the new Crystal Pepsi, which, by the way, has anyone seen that in the actual stores yet?
6767000	6768000	Because I know it's out.
6768000	6769000	No, I haven't.
6769000	6770000	I have not seen it at the stores.
6770000	6776000	I, I still can't find, you know, you know, apparently it's that time of year for crazy flavored potato chips.
6776000	6778000	You know how they do the contest every year?
6778000	6783000	Well, I guess instead of a contest this year, they're doing flavors from other countries.
6783000	6787000	And so they have, like, Szechuan chicken, uh, chips as a flavor.
6787000	6791000	Uh, chicken tikka masala, uh, is one-
6791000	6792000	That sounds good.
6792000	6795000	I know, doesn't that sound really good, actually? Because I just love Indian food.
6795000	6799000	Um, and some Brazilian steak is one of the other flavors, so-
6799000	6802000	Do you have to slice the chips off of, like, a bigger chip?
6802000	6803000	If you want.
6803000	6805000	What, like, it's a, like, a sword or something?
6805000	6807000	The, uh, Greek yogurt sauce.
6807000	6808000	Tzatziki.
6808000	6810000	That's it. That's the other one that's the other potato chip.
6810000	6811000	This is cutest.
6811000	6814000	But I, I'm having a hard time finding those.
6814000	6815000	Apparently they're around.
6815000	6818000	Have you ever did the tzatziki one before, or, like, some kind of Greek chicken?
6818000	6821000	They didn't do it here. It was gyro. You think of the gyros.
6821000	6822000	No, the gyro flavor.
6822000	6824000	I just want french-fried flavored chips.
6827000	6830000	Why, why can't we get ketchup chips here in the States?
6830000	6832000	Oh, god, no, no.
6832000	6833000	Ketchup is disgusting.
6833000	6834000	God, no, no.
6834000	6835000	Rob-
6835000	6836000	Where are my Canadians at?
6836000	6837000	Rob-
6838000	6839000	What?
6839000	6841000	You to mayonnaise is me to ketchup.
6841000	6842000	Really?
6842000	6843000	But do you eat tomatoes?
6843000	6845000	I like tomatoes. I hate tomato soup.
6845000	6850000	You know what, though? I'm okay with that because I like eggs, and I like oil, and I like vinegar, but I hate mayonnaise.
6850000	6857000	See, I love mayonnaise, but the thing is I only love either homemade mayonnaise or Hellmann's slash best foods.
6857000	6863000	Why can't they make, like, potato chips but crusty with all the stuff that they put the seasoned fries on?
6863000	6868000	Well, don't they, don't they make those, like, fries in a can that are, like, you know what I'm talking about?
6868000	6870000	Like, they sell, like, french fry type things.
6870000	6872000	You can get a loaf of bread in a can.
6872000	6875000	Is it like the French, was it the French, uh, French's onions or whatever?
6875000	6878000	No, we don't want Chick-fil-A flavor because it tastes like hatred.
6878000	6883000	I thought thing, I thought Chick-fil-A was, was okay to eat at now. I thought things, because the guy died.
6883000	6884000	Yeah, but there's-
6884000	6886000	So they, they, they specifically said they were getting out of that business.
6886000	6891000	I noticed that something tasted different. Like, the hatred went away, and the chicken started tasting not as great anymore.
6891000	6895000	But now, now, uh, there's drama. There's always drama.
6895000	6896000	There's always drama.
6896000	6903000	But I do want curry chips to be a thing over here. I agree with, um, I keep misreading your name because I'm blind.
6903000	6904000	Siata berry?
6904000	6905000	I think it's Siata berry.
6905000	6906000	Siata berry.
6906000	6909000	Curry chips are great. Um, but-
6909000	6916000	And I want to give a shout-out to Alex P. Carson for being in my corner, saying I've been waiting for years for ketchup chips in the US. Thank you, sir.
6916000	6919000	Just go to Canada. And while you're there, bring me back some Tim Hortons.
6919000	6921000	Alright, yeah. Alex, we're going to Canada.
6921000	6926000	You know, actually, I decided what else would be good. HP sauce-flavored chips.
6926000	6928000	That'd be alright.
6928000	6929000	Have you had HP sauce?
6929000	6930000	I don't think so.
6930000	6931000	It's basically, it's like-
6931000	6932000	It's a brown sauce.
6932000	6935000	You can buy it at the store, because it's really good on fish.
6935000	6936000	It's amazing.
6936000	6937000	It's seriously, like-
6937000	6944000	Akuma J.P. and Chad says, I just came back from a meeting, and OLR is not OLR anymore.
6944000	6946000	We're always talking about food.
6946000	6950000	You must be new to Orange Launch Radio. Welcome to the show.
6950000	6953000	Anyways, I don't even know how we got on this tangent here.
6953000	6959000	Wait, wait, one more. Okay, this is important. This is the flavor I'm going to submit next time Lays does one of those contests. Ready?
6959000	6960000	Mm-mm.
6960000	6962000	Mozzarella sticks.
6962000	6963000	That's-
6963000	6964000	That could be good.
6964000	6974000	Swear to God, if one of you sons of bitches rips off my idea and wins a million dollars off it, I will find you, and I will batter you, and I will deep fry you like you're a mozzarella stick.
6974000	6977000	Rob, will it have the marinara flavoring?
6977000	6979000	I think it has to, for it to work.
6979000	6983000	For it to work. Is that going to be too tomatoey for you?
6983000	6996000	No, that's fine. I love marinara sauce. I hate tomato soup, and I hate ketchup. Actually, I will take this back. There's one thing. There's ketchup as an ingredient in something like in baked beans, or meatloaf is fine.
6996000	7006000	Ketchup, I have hated it since I was a child, and I'm still convinced that the two-maggot ratio is law, that there's always maggots in it.
7007000	7009000	The two maggots per ounce allowance.
7009000	7016000	Oh my God. This is what happens also when we're running through the gaming news so fast that we're almost to the end of part B, and it's only been 30 minutes, so, uh,
7016000	7019000	Okay, so anyways, let's talk about the Oregon Trail. So the Oregon Trail-
7019000	7020000	Oh, right! Let's-
7020000	7022000	Oregon Trail is going to become a card game.
7022000	7026000	Let's talk about those new and awesome groundbreaking video games.
7026000	7027000	This is a video game.
7028000	7036000	Yeah, it's going to be a card game, or a card and dice game, that's going to be coming exclusively to Target stores in the future.
7039000	7040000	Did you just call it Target?
7040000	7041000	I did.
7041000	7042000	Okay.
7042000	7043000	Because I'm being ironic, so.
7045000	7046000	That's Target for all you-
7046000	7048000	Oh, okay, thank you. Thank you.
7048000	7051000	All you, you know, non-one percenters out there.
7052000	7062000	So basically it's going to be a two to six person game. It's got supply cards and also, um, you know, some other stuff.
7062000	7070000	And I guess you take turns and draw cards and stuff happens. And someone gets dysentery.
7070000	7072000	Stuff happens. Do you actually- okay.
7072000	7087000	One of the best things about the Oregon Trail on the Apple IIe's back in the day was that as you would play the game, you would come across the tombstones of people who have previously played the game.
7087000	7093000	So, you know, you would be going down the road and then all of a sudden you have come across a tombstone. Would you like to see it? And you'd hit yes.
7093000	7102000	It would be like, here lies balls or whatever the person named their family, you know, died of dysentery on whatever day.
7102000	7103000	Here lies hairy balls.
7103000	7108000	Exactly, right? That's, that's what happens. It comes up because these were always in the school.
7108000	7112000	Oh my God, that's the next person I'm going to make for my Sims family is hairy balls.
7113000	7123000	Anyway, hello maturity. Um, so anyway, my question is, would you actually get to make cards that are tombstones when you die and you put them in the decks that they come up in later games?
7123000	7126000	Um, probably not, but that would be cool.
7126000	7128000	That would be cool.
7128000	7130000	Did any of you ever play the Oregon Trail?
7130000	7141000	Oh, whoa, hold on, hold on. It does come with it. It says right here, the game even comes with gravestones, so players can write down their names and how they died on their final resting place.
7141000	7143000	They thought of everything.
7143000	7149000	That just seemed like the most obvious idea. Cause you know I design card games now after last week's calls.
7149000	7153000	I design card games now, just in case you missed that. No, I'm kidding.
7153000	7155000	Alright, anyway, Oregon Trail.
7155000	7156000	Oregon Trail.
7156000	7157000	The Oregon Trail.
7157000	7158000	The Oregon Trail.
7158000	7159000	Yeah, the zombie one.
7159000	7161000	Maybe you're in a station wagon.
7161000	7166000	I think that is one of my Steam games that's in my library that I've never touched, which is, which is unfortunate.
7166000	7167000	It's pretty funny.
7167000	7168000	Yeah.
7168000	7169000	Alright.
7169000	7174000	Stoppy in chat says the Hunt family lost many members of their family named Mike.
7174000	7178000	Yeah, that that did in the second grade that would always happen was you're playing the Oregon Trail.
7178000	7181000	I dated a Benjamin Dover.
7181000	7182000	Like for real?
7182000	7185000	Like for real.
7185000	7188000	Okay.
7188000	7191000	How was that?
7191000	7195000	It was short lived.
7195000	7196000	Alright.
7196000	7198000	Let's see going to chat.
7198000	7203000	S2100 Matt says I still have a Pokemon snap game save with the name is boobies.
7203000	7209000	My brother and I did that so that Professor Oak would say welcome back boobies at the start of every game.
7209000	7211000	Okay.
7211000	7214000	Beep beep. Here goes the tangent train leaving the station.
7214000	7222000	I know you people have done this shit in video games is that you've given your characters absolutely disgusting, horrific, sophomoric names.
7222000	7223000	Okay.
7223000	7224000	Just so you can giggle like that.
7224000	7228000	Well, yeah, we called the Horse and Derby Owners Club, Politary.
7228000	7231000	Yeah, I don't know about like giving people names.
7231000	7232000	I'm sure I probably did.
7232000	7237000	But the only thing I remember recently was Animal Crossing teaching them phrases.
7237000	7242000	Oh, God, that was that was the best part of Animal Crossing was teaching them to say vile things.
7242000	7245000	And then they would move to your neighborhood, but then one of your friends neighborhoods.
7245000	7248000	So it's like, what is this disgusting thing?
7248000	7253000	I'm still pissed at whoever took my lesbian.
7253000	7262000	I found Dina again and happy home designer and made her a gem that would make any stereotypical lesbian very happy.
7262000	7264000	Stereotypical.
7264000	7267000	Alex P. Carson says I have a Nintendog named Shit.
7267000	7270000	Well, that's come here you little shit.
7270000	7274000	But here's the thing. Is shit a shih tzu?
7274000	7278000	Because that would be that's like the Robert Roberts of dogs.
7278000	7282000	Shih tzu.
7282000	7287000	Were you going by the South Park naming convention Shitty Shih Tzu?
7287000	7288000	Shitty the Shih Tzu?
7288000	7291000	Yeah, it's actually these all sound like John Waters characters.
7291000	7296000	I always envisioned my name as being inspired by a John Waters movie, even though it actually wasn't.
7297000	7300000	You know, that's that's what it sounds like to me.
7300000	7305000	Let's see. Act F says it sucks that the latest Pokemon games don't let you put curse words for names.
7305000	7310000	Have you seen the things people are calling the Pokemon that they put on gyms?
7310000	7313000	You can get away with a lot in Pokemon Go apparently.
7313000	7315000	I've only named one Pokemon a different name.
7315000	7319000	Well, I mean, I named my Eevees whatever so I could evolve them.
7319000	7326000	But I have one Rattata named Rat X because when Dan and I first played Pokemon Blue.
7326000	7328000	He was playing right. I was playing blue.
7328000	7331000	We each named our first Rattata Rat X.
7331000	7335000	And so that's the only one we have ever renamed.
7335000	7337000	However, you can cause up a storm in Miitomo.
7337000	7338000	Yes, you can.
7338000	7344000	My I've met Miis that have said some bizarre dirty shit.
7344000	7349000	Also, I learned something today that you're me and Miitomo cannot say we you properly.
7349000	7350000	Really?
7350000	7352000	It's way you.
7352000	7354000	That is kind of funny that they didn't teach the Miis to say that.
7354000	7356000	That's great.
7356000	7360000	What else is going to say without the oh, the silly names and the immature names.
7360000	7361000	Here's the thing.
7361000	7366000	Classic arcade games, in my opinion, this is mandatory for me.
7366000	7367000	Like I just I have to do it.
7367000	7373000	I can't not do this if I'm at a convention or something, you know, where a lot of people are going to be.
7373000	7374000	And, you know, so forth.
7374000	7380000	If I get a high score in a game that I'm decent at, like Dig Dug or something like I can get pretty far in one quarter on Dig Dug.
7380000	7389000	And if I make the leaderboard or whatever, I'll put my initials in as VOG or OLR or something, you know, that means a lot to me.
7389000	7398000	But if I'm just some random arcade that probably turns off the power at night and erases the high score table anyway, or just, you know, someplace that isn't that notable.
7399000	7403000	I always, always put my initials in as A-S-S.
7403000	7405000	You have to put your initials in this ass.
7405000	7407000	You just, how can you not?
7407000	7409000	Dark Sakura, have you ever put your initials in his ass?
7409000	7414000	No, actually it's always been S-A-K.
7414000	7415000	For Sakura?
7415000	7416000	Yeah.
7416000	7417000	Really?
7417000	7418000	Or Saku.
7418000	7419000	Do you ever put your initials in his ass?
7419000	7421000	Loki, do you ever do that?
7421000	7422000	No.
7422000	7423000	It's just me?
7423000	7434000	Well, Dan used to do his because of Daytona as DMX for Dan Man X until, you know, the artist DMX was around because of how it would say it.
7434000	7437000	D-M-X!
7437000	7438000	Like that.
7438000	7439000	So Dan always did that.
7439000	7441000	Somebody's a dance maniacs fan.
7441000	7443000	Now it's just Dan.
7443000	7444000	Well, if you-
7444000	7447000	I'm trying to take a picture, trying to find a picture of Rat X for you guys.
7447000	7455000	On those games where you have four spots for initials, because that happens sometimes, I always put my initial in as A-S-S exclamation point.
7455000	7456000	So it's kind of a similar thing.
7456000	7457000	You're a happy ass.
7457000	7458000	Ass!
7458000	7460000	Ass!
7460000	7466000	Alright, Stoppy in Chat says, I go with Ho, H-O-E. That's a good one.
7466000	7469000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Shit, S-H-T.
7469000	7474000	And SSU100Matt says, Billy Mitchell puts his name down as USA, I think.
7474000	7475000	Maybe I should just put my-
7475000	7476000	That's such a Billy Mitchell thing to do.
7476000	7479000	I should just put mine down as CNT.
7479000	7481000	Can't?
7481000	7482000	Girl.
7482000	7484000	Count?
7484000	7486000	Girl.
7486000	7491000	Alright, and let's get to something a little more serious here.
7491000	7492000	My gosh, we can't keep talking.
7492000	7496000	We can't keep bringing the show down with our gutter chat.
7496000	7499000	I got the last story here tonight, and it's another story about-
7499000	7502000	Why does Weepin' Bill look like a condom?
7502000	7503000	How appropriate.
7503000	7505000	What did I just fucking say?
7505000	7510000	Anyhow, so this is another story about Pokemon.
7510000	7515000	Apparently, there is a new Etsy shop called Geeky Sex Toys.
7515000	7522000	Actually, I don't know if it's a new shop, but they have a new line called Pokemon.
7522000	7534000	And Pokemon is over 100 different handmade dildos and butt plugs that are modeled after Pokemon.
7534000	7543000	Such as Bulby, Charmy, and Squirty.
7543000	7544000	And there's-
7544000	7545000	At least it really squirts.
7545000	7550000	There's also, you know, because to be fair, maybe you need something a little bit of a
7550000	7558000	different caliber, you can also get shaped as a Pikachu tail, a butt plug, if you are
7558000	7559000	so inclined.
7559000	7560000	That actually sounds cute.
7560000	7561000	Does it?
7561000	7562000	Because I don't know-
7562000	7564000	I don't know if cute is the word I would use.
7564000	7568000	I'm not into that, but I know people who would find it completely adorable.
7568000	7573000	Like the part that sticks not in your butt, but the other part is the tail, right?
7573000	7581000	And this article goes on to say, the Bulby has a large seat tip, making it a very pleasurable
7581000	7583000	friend to have.
7583000	7590000	And apparently, it looks like it's a little Bulbasaur sack, but it looks like balls,
7590000	7592000	basically, on the end of this.
7592000	7594000	So, there you go.
7594000	7600000	Enjoy, everybody, the Pokemoan dildos.
7600000	7601000	Goodnight.
7601000	7603000	You've been listening to Orange-
7603000	7605000	Okay, I'm kidding.
7605000	7608000	But everybody in chat is like, drop the mic and end the show.
7608000	7609000	So, there it is.
7609000	7610000	Let's see.
7610000	7613000	Prince Peach Fuzz in chat says, Licky Tongue.
7613000	7615000	Is there a Licky Tongue?
7615000	7618000	You would think that would be the most obvious thing to put.
7618000	7621000	Gosh, if only I had a link to the Pokemoan.
7621000	7622000	Oh, hey, how about that?
7622000	7623000	Let me go look at the-
7623000	7624000	Oh, my God.
7624000	7626000	Pokemoan site right now.
7626000	7628000	I was right about the butt plug.
7628000	7629000	What?
7629000	7630000	What about it?
7630000	7631000	You see the Pikachu tail?
7631000	7633000	I just want to trim that little part.
7633000	7635000	Starring Dark Sakura.
7635000	7637000	I was right about the butt plug.
7642000	7643000	All right, whatevs.
7644000	7645000	Let's see.
7645000	7649000	There's also a Charmy, which has the flaming tail.
7649000	7652000	Wow, these are really something.
7652000	7654000	There's a disclaimer here, by the way.
7654000	7661000	All toys are sold as a novelty only, and the buyer accepts all responsibility for what the product is used for.
7665000	7666000	There you go.
7666000	7671000	Alex P. Carson says he's going to make that sound clip, his new Windows startup sound.
7671000	7674000	You should make it the sound every time you get a text message.
7677000	7678000	There you go.
7678000	7679000	I will not be using it.
7679000	7684000	A nice, mature note to end things on here tonight here at Orange Lounge Radio.
7684000	7686000	Hey, let's open up the phones.
7686000	7688000	Hey, why don't you guys dirty up the show even more?
7688000	7689000	Our Skype line is open.
7689000	7697000	OMG, I am on the wrong account, so I'm going to switch to our right Skype account, which is Orange Lounge Radio.
7697000	7702000	I took a picture of Rat X. It's just on my Twitter, so I'm trying to find it because it doesn't want to load.
7702000	7714000	I was logged into my personal Skype account because I was guesting on a podcast yesterday, and as soon as that's posted, I will have to share it with you all.
7716000	7719000	Well, this is great live radio, and I'm on the wrong damn Skype account.
7721000	7723000	Okay, now I'm on the right Skype account, so you can give us a call.
7723000	7729000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call, and we will be taking your calls later in the show.
7730000	7731000	Right now. Call up.
7732000	7736000	Loki, do you have any last? Oh, never mind. The phone's ringing, so I can get to some calls right now.
7737000	7739000	If Skype will work, it's being very slow.
7739000	7741000	There we go. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7741000	7742000	It's Ranma.
7742000	7744000	Hi, Ranma. How are you?
7744000	7746000	I was doing good.
7746000	7750000	You just killed it for me in the last 20 minutes.
7750000	7759000	I want you to know, we talked about the Pokemon dildos on our show, but god damn it, Ranma, you just killed it. You just took it to the next level.
7759000	7763000	Hey, I know how to use dildos. What can I say?
7765000	7771000	I love that too, by the way. Yeah, my night was doing pretty good, and then I started listening to OLR.
7772000	7781000	I just want you to know, I will not say anything in regards to you and dildos, because I am pleading the Fifth Amendment. I refuse to incriminate myself.
7781000	7787000	Fair enough, fair enough. Hey, though, speaking of incriminating, I will ask this question. I'm going to ask all our callers this tonight.
7787000	7794000	How do you enter your initials on the high scoreboard on a classic 80s arcade machine? What do you put your initials in as?
7794000	7797000	I actually use my real name initials, AHW.
7797000	7798000	Do you really?
7798000	7811000	After a while, when I figured out what my screen name would be, if it's big enough, I would put DJRS, or you know, or during my phase of writing fan fiction, I would take one of my characters and use their initials or whatever.
7811000	7814000	Okay, alright, I like that. So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
7814000	7824000	Oh, a lot of stuff, but first things first, I'm going to send you a care package of ketchup flavored potato chips.
7824000	7834000	Bless you, bless you, bless you. I'm so happy to hear that. I didn't know, do they, maybe they, maybe I could find them around here if I looked harder. I don't think I've ever seen them at Trader Joe's or anything like that, though.
7834000	7838000	But it seems like the type of thing I ought to be able to find at like, maybe Whole Foods.
7838000	7843000	No, you probably, you better try like a grocery store or a drugstore. There's a local-
7843000	7844000	Oh, they don't have them here.
7844000	7851000	There's a local company called HERS that makes them, so I see them at ShopRite all the time, so I can buy you, put them in a box and send them over.
7851000	7852000	Cost plus.
7852000	7859000	Except the last few times I've been to cost plus, I haven't seen anything like that, but they've got stuff from all over, so.
7859000	7863000	Well, you know, if Rama wants to send me a care package, who am I to complain?
7863000	7866000	Exactly, because I'll be sending Jamie a care package, too.
7866000	7867000	There you go.
7867000	7868000	Is it going to have Tim Hortons in it?
7868000	7871000	Yes, there is one Timmy Ho's left in New York City.
7873000	7876000	Okay, just to let you know, I like things that are chocolate.
7877000	7884000	Hey, I don't have the problem anymore of a lack of Dunkin' Donuts. We actually have a couple here in SAC now. My how times have changed.
7884000	7885000	Oh yeah, definitely.
7885000	7886000	Crazy.
7886000	7893000	As for your Lay's chips, I've been finding them at local drugs or Walgreens, but I have to tell you, the Szechuan chicken is so good.
7893000	7894000	Alright, I gotta try that.
7894000	7896000	It's probably too spicy for me.
7896000	7899000	It's not even that spicy, though, but.
7899000	7904000	Oh my god, pickled chips are the grossest thing. Oh god, I feel sick. I'm going to go buy.
7904000	7905000	Are you leaving the show now?
7905000	7908000	Well, I kind of have to in a few minutes, so I may as well log out.
7908000	7910000	Alright, well, final thought for our listeners real quick on your way out.
7910000	7918000	Um, I really, I'm so full right now between all that Chinese food and the Cinnabon Delights. Just roll me out.
7918000	7919000	Just roll you home?
7919000	7920000	Just roll me home.
7920000	7921000	There you go. Alright.
7921000	7922000	Ran-chan?
7922000	7923000	Yes?
7923000	7924000	Hearts.
7924000	7925000	Hearts.
7925000	7928000	Uh, anything else on your mind, Rama?
7928000	7933000	Some stuff. I just want to say, right now, Mako-chan just woke up and went, mmm, dill pickled chips.
7933000	7936000	I don't know why. She just loves them. But anywho.
7936000	7945000	I love the deep-fried ones that they have at, like, restaurants sometimes. Like, bar restaurants will have, like, deep-fried pickles. So good. So good.
7945000	7950000	They are good, but you know what, Rob? Right now, put a thing of coffee on. We got to talk.
7950000	7951000	Okay.
7951000	7952000	Alright?
7952000	7953000	We got to talk. What's up?
7954000	7964000	Pokemon Go. I mean, I've already said it on my personal Facebook. I'm tired of everybody bitching about something that they got for free.
7964000	7975000	I am tired of everybody bitching at the developers, the programmers. This is my field. I get it. I understand everybody's issues.
7975000	7980000	I understand everyone's complaints. They're doing the best that they can. They are fans of the series as well.
7980000	7987000	And I can tell you this. There are a lot of people in the whole IT tech programming field who suck talking to other people.
7987000	7995000	They'll keep everything within themselves. When it's done, they'll be like, here it is. You just won't even know half the time.
7995000	7997000	They'll be like, here. It's there. You know?
7997000	8005000	I think most people just need to take a step back and calm their tits and not react so emotionally because a lot of people, and I'm saying everybody,
8006000	8014000	there are some valid complaints about what's going on with Niantic. The fact that they don't have any type of real good PR system really sucks.
8014000	8019000	And I think they could use that right now really badly. And I'll definitely agree with that.
8019000	8029000	But I think at the same time, take a step back and ask yourself, does Niantic really exist to create the biggest cell phone game of all time and then piss everybody off?
8029000	8034000	Like because Niantic hates, like that's what some people are saying. Niantic hates the player base.
8034000	8038000	Take a step back and think about what you're really saying for a minute.
8038000	8045000	Like, is there money to be made in hating your player base? I'm not so sure about that.
8045000	8052000	And I think a lot of these issues, if you'll just calm your tits, give it a few days, it's going to work out.
8052000	8055000	It's going to be fine. And you'll have years and years to catch them all.
8055000	8061000	I'm sorry. Now I'm thinking of like, you remember those sprinklers that had the little hoses that went all over the place, the silly sprinklers?
8061000	8065000	I'm imagining tits like that now. Well, that's everybody right now.
8065000	8072000	Basically, like I'm in this Facebook community for Pokemon Go and like anytime I see a post in that community, that's what it looks like.
8072000	8077000	Hellrauma's post kind of looked like that a little bit, not your post specifically, but the comments kind of looked like that a little bit.
8077000	8082000	I got into it. Well, you know, when I say I got into it, like I, you know, I don't take it that seriously.
8082000	8084000	I haven't been on Facebook in three days. Good for you.
8084000	8086000	So I really need to do the same thing.
8086000	8089000	Because I'm tired. Tired, tired, tired.
8089000	8092000	Hey, at least it wasn't politics. I'd rather argue-
8092000	8093000	That's what chased me off.
8093000	8098000	I would rather argue about stupid Pokemon than fucking politics. That's it.
8098000	8100000	Well, I'm going to say goodbye to everybody now.
8100000	8101000	Bye.
8101000	8102000	Bye.
8102000	8103000	Anything else, Rama?
8103000	8113000	I just want to get that off my chest because you feel me on this. I mean, praise Breslau for what he said. Praise that man. Okay?
8113000	8117000	Yeah, I don't give that man kudos very often, but he deserved it for that one.
8117000	8125000	Yes, yes. Before I get out of here, I was going to show y'all a picture of my awesome Pokemon Go t-shirt, but I'll do that later.
8125000	8134000	But since you were talking about odd names and stuff like that, I'm going to post a link in the chat room called 14 Perfect Names People Gave Their Pokemon.
8134000	8137000	I'd recommend not drinking anything while you look at this list.
8137000	8143000	Is this stuff like the Love is Love on the Westboro Baptist Church and all that stuff? Things like that?
8143000	8150000	No, but it's more funny, tongue-in-cheek, borderline perverted. Stuff that, you know, like, you know what? I would have done the same thing.
8150000	8154000	I don't like perverted jokes, Rama. That's trashy.
8157000	8159000	You suck at trolling, Mr. Rob Roberts.
8159000	8160000	Yeah, right. Whatever.
8160000	8171000	Alright. Well, I look forward to your care package, and I'll be sure to send you a care package in return. And who knows, maybe if the label says Pokemon on it, don't be surprised.
8171000	8177000	If that happens, I will be giving them away as prizes on my show.
8177000	8178000	Hooray!
8179000	8193000	I do know for a fact there are people out there that I know that will buy them, and they have, and they're like, you realize what you're buying? Yes. Are you going? Alright. You go do you. I'll be over here.
8193000	8196000	Do you think that Bobby would let me bring back the VOG Network giveaways?
8199000	8200000	For a squirty?
8200000	8208000	If we're able to, if you're going to do this, I, Anime Jam Session will back this.
8208000	8217000	Just, we'll do a VOG Network giveaway, and we'll give away a squirty and a bag of ketchup potato chips, and just call it Friday Night Home Alone.
8219000	8220000	Where's the lie, though?
8222000	8224000	Alright, Rama, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls.
8224000	8226000	Alright, you stay fabulous, man.
8226000	8227000	Take care, my friend.
8227000	8228000	You too. Bye.
8230000	8233000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8233000	8239000	Act Afton Chat says, Black Wolf's ears must be burning hot right now. Probably smoke coming out of them.
8239000	8250000	Actually, if he's driving, I don't know what his schedule was, but if he's driving home, he probably is listening in his car, because, you know, those Tesla spaceships, he can beam whatever internet thing he wants.
8250000	8255000	He probably actually is listening on TuneIn right now, so hopefully he didn't crash the car.
8255000	8260000	That's alright. That's what the autopilot's for, is to help not crash the car in those situations.
8260000	8266000	Don't get started on that video. I think Bobby had to finally turn off the emails from that video, because it's been every-
8266000	8269000	Hey, I gotta get props. We finally got one to go viral.
8269000	8276000	Actually, I think that's the second one that went viral, because his Rainbow Road one was kind of viral, but this one's going, like, twice as much.
8276000	8277000	Rainbow Road.
8277000	8282000	Yeah, the Easter egg in the Teslas, where you can turn the GPS thing into Rainbow Road.
8283000	8288000	Well, go check out the video at VOG Network on YouTube, Loki, and you won't give me that puzzled face anymore.
8289000	8295000	Alright, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype. Meanwhile, while we wait for a call, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories you want to share with us?
8295000	8308000	Yeah, there's some good news regarding EVO and their coverage on ESPN. Apparently, they had some two million unique viewers, about averaging that 20 minutes each, so that's pretty good.
8308000	8315000	So, hopefully, that means more of the same type of thing going forward for future events. More coverage.
8317000	8328000	Awesome. One more call for calls. Put the call out there for calls. OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, we'd love to hear from you guys about anything.
8328000	8335000	It doesn't have to be perverted. Just because Rama calls in about pervert- I'm just kidding. It doesn't mean you have to. Anything else, Loki?
8336000	8337000	Nope.
8337000	8338000	Not a lot else going on?
8338000	8339000	Not a lot else going on.
8339000	8343000	Alright, what are you going to play this week while you're waiting for No Man's Sky to be released?
8343000	8354000	Probably just Pokemon Go. I've been trying to actually sit down and program, but like even last night, like after- I had to go in a different room because my wife's still watching, grazing out of me. It's very distracting.
8355000	8371000	And then that's when I realized that the update to Pokemon Go happened, so I had to help her get it installed, and of course there was a whole login issue, and after all that, and then finally I got to sit down and watch stuff, and it was uncomfortable seeing it at the kitchen table for that long.
8372000	8386000	So I went back into the living room, started watching videos, and like just literally passing out from being tired. So I'm trying to work. I have Unity up. I'm meaning to do it.
8386000	8389000	I launch the program, and then I just stare at the screen.
8390000	8411000	Seriously? That is exactly- well, it's because I've been kind of going back and forth on how I want to do the engine, because I want to redo everything again on the game I'm working on, and the one way I was going to do it, it's like it was way too complicated, and I don't even- like I kind of thought about it, I'm like, do I really need to be that complicated? No, not really, because it's ridiculous.
8411000	8430000	So I'm going back to what I was originally planning on doing, and so now I'm trying to find a better way to implement that, maybe something that's a little bit more complete, or something that someone's already started a framework on that I can try. Basically just trying to see how to optimize a voxel engine is basically it.
8431000	8444000	Alright. Well, since there's no more calls coming in, I guess we're going to close up shop for the night, and thank you guys. If you've thought of something after the fact, you want to email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.
8444000	8459000	And, you know, as I say at the end of every episode, thank you guys for listening to the show, and if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or five about the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only spread those voices if you use them.
8459000	8473000	So please, use your voice, and be on the show. A nice five star review at a place like iTunes or Google Play or wherever you found this show goes an awful long way as well.
8473000	8484000	But that is going to do it for another episode until we are back in seven days to do it all over again. Get really hyped about No Man's Sky, which will be out in just a couple of days at that point, and whatever else happens in gaming in the next week.
8485000	8491000	Maybe Pokemon Go changes something else this week, and that'll get everybody all in a tizzy, or there'll be something else. Who knows?
8491000	8494000	But meanwhile, final thoughts. Loki, your final thought tonight?
8494000	8500000	Well, even though he's not on the show yet, hopefully soon, but happy birthday to my son Josh. He'll be turning six tomorrow.
8500000	8504000	Oh, happy birthday! Six years old! My gosh. Time flies.
8504000	8506000	Exactly. He's playing Pokemon Go and everything.
8506000	8508000	That is awesome. Well, happy birthday.
8509000	8513000	That will be my final thought too, because you know what? I didn't really have anything else in mind.
8513000	8518000	So happy birthday to Joshua and anybody that might be celebrating a birthday in the coming days.
8518000	8523000	That is going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening. Really appreciate it.
8523000	8529000	We'll see you in seven days to do it all over again. Can't believe it's already going to be August. Where does the time go?
8529000	8531000	See you guys. Have a good one.
