Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Extroverts rejoice! DVR-Ace is out and receiving positive reviews, and Pokemon GO is out in the US!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now if only we could prevent Team Rocket from shutting it down from time to time.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Introverts, enjoy your personal comfort along with this week's news on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey, you know, I think I know some introverts playing both those things too.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But hey, welcome back everybody. It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Live tonight on July the 10th, 2016 with episode number 649 of our show.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Robertson, joining me here in lovely Studio N7, located in Sacramento, California.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Home of many Pikachus and Eevees, apparently. Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And Caterpie's in your bathroom.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, I hope it wasn't in the litter box, because somebody else Caterpie's in there.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, it was hanging on the shower curtain.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh great, that's good to know. How are you, DarkSakura?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm okay.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Good. We missed you last week.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I missed me too.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But I know, did you have a good 4th of July?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It was alright.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It was okay. It was alright.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I managed to shut my thumb in the sliding glass door, so I have to get it, I guess, burned through to lancet.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, that's scary.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's ugly.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, you are not going to be here next week though, right?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't know. I'm probably not, or I might be late.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The California Extreme is next week too, I think, is something else going on.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh my god.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Busy, busy time.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, it's just that I'm going to be a judge at an event.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, fun.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
For, hold on, let me get the event information, so go ahead and go to Loki.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Alright, Dirty Housekeeping, remind me, we'll plug that event.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Say hello also to Techmaster Loki.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hello.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
With a mouthful of breadsticks, complete radio professionalism going on over there, but I know how it goes.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You only got here to the show with minutes to spare, so you gotta eat.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can't, those rants tonight have to be fueled somehow, so there you go.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How are you doing, Techmaster?

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm doing fine.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah? Busy week?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No, not really?

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No, not really.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, good, then you had a chance to play lots of games, I'm sure.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It sounded like you said tech bastard.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tech bastard Loki. Some might call him that.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's fine.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't know about that.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey, you guys can also join us.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm fathered by Edward Stark.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Technology.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, it's live, of course, every Sunday night. Our show is live.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
vog.network.com, vognetwork.com.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Although our pal Bobby did have the night off, he is at another engagement right now, so he could not make his own show,

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but usually he will have his fun little show leading into what we do here, and he's got an anniversary show coming up.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You know, we just had an anniversary show. He's got one coming up as well, so we're all having birthdays right now.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You can, of course, join us live in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where Dungeon Buster theorizes Loki's restoring his mana for casting rants later.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes, that's how it works. You eat the food, you get the mana back, and then you can put everybody on blast later in the show.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Rob, I'm disappointed.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Because everyone knows that drinking stuff restores your mana, and food restores your HP.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sorry, sorry. Maybe I was thinking of one of those weird games that went against the grain and changed that formula.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No Go Deft in our chat room, I believe that's ActDeft under a new name, says Loki's rants are powered by breadsticks and hate.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I was going to say, I think in Final Fantasy though, at least Eleven, eating pies would give you...

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There you go. So some things would challenge the formula.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Pizza pie, breadsticks sort of like a pizza pie. That kind of works, right?

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That kind of works.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just want pie, really. Just pie.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Pizza pie, apple pie, pizza apple pie, I don't care.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Chocolate cream pie. Specifically. Or Boston cream, which is cake pie.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Look, I know we've talked a lot about cake on this show, we've talked a lot about pie, but Alan's birthday was this past weekend.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So Friday night we went to the Brazilian Grill out in Roseville, and you know, they're really yummy, but you know what we had for dessert?

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We didn't have cake or pie. We had flan.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And I feel like we don't give flan enough respect on OLR in our little dessert debates.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I just want to show a little love for flan tonight.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Have you eaten a flan recently?

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, but I did have egg custard in my milk tea.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I feel like we should have a little PSA. The more you know.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
A little thing that flies by after...

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We'll have Katy Perry standing on it.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Flying in on a giant tub of flan.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You realize someone should Photoshop that now?

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Dartit Studio says, I like Tech Bastard. Maybe there'll have to be a new name in the future. Who knows?

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Stoppy in chat says, I can't stand flan. It's like an earwax cake.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You know what, Stoppy, I'm going to need you to leave.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You know what I can't stand? People who are wrong.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's the show...

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Brad, you're asking what the hell is flan in a chat room when you could just look it up on the internet.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wikipedia.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I think it's a yummy custard type of thing.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a custard.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's like if they made milk in the jello and then sprinkled paprika on top or something.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No, it's more like a cinnamon.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It tastes like a churro.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's like a gelatinous churro.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When you look at it, you don't think it's going to be as delicious as it is.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So if you're a picky eater who judges things a lot by what it looks like...

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It is a subtle flavor though.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I always get the chocolate mousse or cake or whatever that they have there.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I always regret it because it's just like, I don't know, too intensely chocolate.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's like, okay, this is too much chocolate.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hold on there buddy, this is too much chocolate.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Alright, and Brad from Pod Culture says, you assume I care enough to do that.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You should, you should if you've never had it.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Alright look, we could talk about desserts all night long I'm sure, but it is a show about video games.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I want to get into gaming because even though our gaming news tonight is a little bit light compared to recent weeks,

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I truly feel a gaming, and you know, you know how sometimes I like to get a little dramatic on this show

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and sometimes I have the tin foil hat on, but I truly believe this.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I kind of think a gaming revolution has occurred this week.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And as much as we talk about World of Warcraft changed gaming

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and we talked about how Xbox Live changed gaming.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I really, really think Pokémon Go has changed gaming this week.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Fuck that, we were doing fucking Ingress at least a year before that.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I know right, the hipster old man in me is like, you sons of bitches pulling over at my park.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You know what?

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Fucking amateur.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I stumbled upon a dead body, fucking amateur.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We've been finding dead bodies for years now.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was cruising parks, I was in cemeteries at questionable hours.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I was in places that said restricted access, but I went there anyways just to hack a portal.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You fucking kids don't even understand.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Pokémon can be anywhere. If you want a portal, you gotta hike to it.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Who got you those portals? We did, fuckers, we did.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's right, those pictures on your Pokéstop? That was us.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You ungrateful sons of bitches.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You want to know who put the Pokéstop at the strip club? I did.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Niantic.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, but Niantic approved it.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It was actually, I felt my nerd cred shoot up a little bit, and then I was like, oh my god, what's wrong with me?

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
When I commented on a YouTube video, the one about the strip club, and they were like, thanks Nintendo.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I was like, Nintendo didn't really have anything to do with that, it was an Ingress portal.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You didn't get your ass thrown out of that strip club with a camera phone in a strip club.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We didn't go into the strip club, it was right behind it in the graveyard.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No, but I saw a picture of someone like they were catching a Pokémon in a fucking strip club.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You can see the dancer on stage.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Because Pokémon are everywhere, you can capture it.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, but that shit's gonna get your ass beat.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
She just caught a Caterpie in the potty.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But here's, okay, this is the thing, listen to this talk right now about the Pokémon and everything.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This is, I'm telling you guys, and you guys have probably experienced this a little bit, this is a social phenomenon right now.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And look, I understand there's a few of you guys out there that are gonna be like, I don't get it, Pokémon sucks, da da da.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, I don't get it either because there's no fucking game.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, hold on, we'll get to that in a minute.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But honestly, a lot of that talk, I'm gonna keep it real, because I like you guys.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
A lot of that talk just screams to me, I haven't downloaded and tried the game yet.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now, is the game perfect? Fuck no, it's got a lot of problems.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And Loki will have no problem addressing those problems shortly.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
However, I gotta tell you guys, okay, first off, and even though I am an Ingress Hipster and we make those jokes and all that stuff,

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the reality is, Alan, myself, Shane, we walked around downtown yesterday for a good three hours, probably got a good two mile walk in,

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
just walking to all these random places. Why? Pokémon.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We put off a lure at the park, and you know one thing I've learned about lures?

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They don't just lure Pokémon, they lure trainers.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We met like six other people playing this.

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The thing about Ingress is that in comparison to Pokémon GO, nobody's fucking playing Ingress.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And look, I love my Ingressers, I love you guys that are playing and so forth, but the reality is, because of the brand of Pokémon,

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and the ease of getting into this game and so forth, Pokémon GO has just blown the fuck up in a way that Ingress just wasn't able to do.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But the Hipster in me is very happy that we laid the foundation for this game.

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Just two things. Number one, me fussing at my phone at the post office, and the ten year old next to me going,

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh my god, I know, right? When I couldn't connect to the server.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And number two, Trixie Mattel on Twitter.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's kids, it's adults, it's grandparents.

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You know, to be fair, it's a lot of the same demographics we'd seen in Ingress.

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It was literally a little bit of everybody, but I mean again, in Pokémon GO, I have co-workers that I never suspected were playing video games at all.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That are obsessed, well I don't want to say obsessed with Pokémon GO, but that are talking about it at work and how on a lunch break they want to go lure Pokémon and stuff.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Like this is, gaming changed this week.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And yeah, it's got, it's broken and it has a lot of progress it needs to make.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You replace the word Pokémon with small children and they're pedophiles.

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But they're not, they're small children, or they're small Pokémon.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
God damn you.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Anyway, okay, so look, Loki, I know you've got issues with the game.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's talk about it. What's wrong with the game?

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Did they fix anything from when I played the beta? Because I think they just said, hey, you know what, this is ready to go, let's put a fucking store in there.

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And we're done.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, I don't fucking get it. There's no game to it.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I mean, there really isn't. You can, you know, capture gyms.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
For what? There's no points. There's nothing.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If there's no factions, there's no actual competitive portion of it other than like, cool, I captured the gym.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That'll be held for like two hours until some other person comes by and captures it again.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And it's just so fucking buggy. I understand it's free to play, but my fucking god, you did nothing.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Give it some more time to fix some of those fucking bugs. It is just broken.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, the gym thing is like unplayable. And even if you could play it, like you'll hold a gym, like you said.

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think the gym should be a team thing.

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, I mean, there's a gym within Aisha. Obviously, I don't want to give away where I live, but I'm sure most of you have a similar scenario.

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Everywhere.

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I live in suburbia and when I fire up my scanner, I can see a gym not that far away.

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's not next to my house, but it's where I can kind of see it and see what color it is.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That thing changes hand several times a day. In Ingress, I own that portal and when anybody comes to fuck with it, I take it right back.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But in Pokémon GO, I can't do it. I would have to live on that fucking gym.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, it's because these people are playing like, I don't know, to be honest, I don't know how people are leveling so fast because like, I played it quite a bit when the beta was going on for two weeks.

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And we had unlimited fucking everything. Like, all that shit you got to pay money for at the store, it was unlimited.

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So like, I was using the XP boost thing, fucking lures, you know, all that shit got to level 7 in two weeks.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And there's like people that are level 19 and 20. It's like, dude, what the fuck are you? Are you just doing this all the time now?

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I mean, do you work?

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's some of the questions we used to ask about certain Ingress players.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I still ask it about those players, but I mean, like at least then I can understand, you know, when they're hitting stuff at like three in the mornings.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I mean, that makes sense. But like, what the hell? I mean, I get it. But people are excited about Pokémon. I'll give them that.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But don't give Niantic a fucking pass for this level of shit. No one.

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But Ingress doesn't let me catch an Eevee in the bathroom.

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't, you know, first off, fucking AR people with that shit turned on in fucking amateurs, man. Just turn that shit off right away.

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And all these people in the car wrecks playing Pokémon, please. I caught like six Pokémon on the fucking freeway here today.

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Like, that is just, there is no excuse to that shit.

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It is a lot easier to catch Pokémon if you just turn that AR thing off.

208
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's also going to save your battery.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But I mean, the novelty of it. I mean, even bringing up my Twitter feed, one out of every five tweets is a camera picture of like, look, there's a Squirtle on my toilet.

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Or look, there's a Pokémon. I even posted one last night. We were at Benihana.

211
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And I thought it was funny because one of the little Paras or something, the little crab guys was standing on the grill.

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And I thought it made for a funny picture. I was like, oh, seafood time.

213
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You know, I thought it was funny, but like, that's a lot of what's going on on Twitter right now is just, you know, a lot of memes and things that have to do with this game.

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And it'll pass. People will calm down about it. And I, you know, I'm going to be the pessimist here. Shocking.

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I think people are going to get bored of this really fast.

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I got bored of this really fast before because if people are catching everything that quickly and people are leveling up that quickly,

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and then they're going to find, okay, all I can do is really take over gym, it's going to get boring really fast.

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's not like Ingress where you can kind of, at least, you know, there's team scores.

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's never ending Calvin Ball. Everything flips.

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, there's like actual scores that you're paying attention to and stuff like that. It's just now it doesn't really seem like a point.

221
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, here's the thing, you know, look, every MMO is botched in its first week, every single one.

222
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And, you know, to Niantic's credit, like, sure, this game was going to be popular because it was a free Pokémon game,

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
but even I am sitting here going, I didn't think it would be that popular with all these people playing it.

224
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And it's a lot of people. And so there's a part of me that's like, okay, maybe Niantic really wasn't ready for how many people wanted this.

225
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And to be fair, and I know we have a worldwide audience, so I want to, you know, acknowledge,

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
we probably have listeners in Canada and the UK that are like, fuck you guys, I can't even play the fucking thing. Shut up, Loki.

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't worry, if you have a Pokémon club membership, you know, you can't fucking play the thing either.

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, and we'll address some of those things later in the show, because Pokémon GO is in our news a little later in the show,

229
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,000
so we'll address some of those world issues and that. But, you know, I do believe, just based on what I've seen with Ingress

230
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and having played, you know, that for a couple years, Niantic is really good about every couple weeks there's a new version of Ingress

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
where they've done something. They added the Lawson power cubes or they put the cubes on the bar with the XM.

232
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Like, they do change that and regularly update it. So I feel like Pokémon GO, you know, even during the beta,

233
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
we got several client updates there too. So, you know, I think the client that we have now in Pokémon GO,

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
it's not going to stay that way forever. And I think these issues will get worked out and there will be new versions of the client that come out pretty soon.

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And so once things stabilize, then I think the real question is, and you do bring up some valid points, Loki,

236
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
what happens when I catch them all? Now what? Because I've been going balls to the wall, running in every park and everything around town.

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I've caught them all. Now what? Although I would speculate it's impossible to catch them all because they teased in that trailer

238
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
all those people in what was in New York City that were all capturing Mewtwo, you get the sense that like Ingress,

239
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Niantic will probably do live events with some of the legendary Pokémon. So I imagine not every Pokémon is in the game right now.

240
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There are some like Mewtwo.

241
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You know, the only way, if I've learned anything from the movie industry, the only way you're going to be able to catch Mewtwo

242
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
is by everybody throwing their Pokéballs directly into his dick at the same time.

243
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Stop. Let's see. Fifth Dream in chat says $5 to download your Pokédex completion certificate. Referencing a news story from last week, I think.

244
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Kaijuto in chat says they need Pokémon battles. Or maybe not. Maybe the fake, it's just an AR Pokédex is what draws people to it.

245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They don't have to learn about EVs and all that stuff. That is a valid point is that they kind of simplified Pokémon, maybe too much for some.

246
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Brad mentions, you know, catch a thousand of one type Pokémon, morph it into a shiny. Heaven helps Shane if they add shinies.

247
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, he's already told me. Like, he asked, he's like, are there shinies in Pokémon Go? I'm like, no, I don't think so.

248
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's just the first gen Pokémon. He's like, oh yeah, shinies weren't added until third or fourth gen or something like that.

249
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And so, he's like, yeah, I'm screwed once that comes out. Once the shiny thing happens.

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But, you know, again, the gym thing, the balance is really off. Like, the thing for the gym, it doesn't work right.

251
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like, we all try to attack a gym. It just freezes or the thing gets down to one hit point and it won't die.

252
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They added AR for the gym, which is fucking unnecessary, but they did that.

253
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, but whatever. So, but again, I think Niantic's gonna fix this.

254
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But then here's the question. Where does the game bottom out?

255
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And is this hype train gonna continue for weeks and weeks and weeks? Or is it gonna bottom out?

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Because when Mitomo first came out, I think a lot of people were checking that out, but who's still playing Mitomo now?

257
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Even I finally fell off the wagon. I kind of stopped checking Mitomo and I was doing it for a while.

258
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Darsak, are you still playing Mitomo regularly?

259
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Every day.

260
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Wow. Okay. So, there's some.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Especially now that they've added more level, levels now.

262
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So, I'm having a good time with it.

263
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay. Well, that's fair. But it still would be fair to say there's not as many people playing Mitomo as there were in the beginning, certainly.

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So, I mean, Pokemon Go is gonna have a bottom at some point.

265
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I think, like, you know, kind of just going back.

266
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Or is it? Maybe it won't.

267
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I think some of the things that would help or some of the things they have in, like, Ingress.

268
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Like, granted, I think the attacking, you know, and stuff, they're not gonna ever implement anything like that.

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But the missions are kind of cool, you know, where you go and visit locations and, you know, maybe, you know, visit the PokeStops or something like that.

270
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They could do something like that. It would be kind of cool.

271
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah, that'd be really cool if they took some of those missions from Ingress and put them in Pokemon where maybe you actually get a Pokemon as a reward for doing a mission.

272
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Or candy or stardust or something that's, you know, currency. You don't really get a lot of ways in the game right now.

273
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That would be pretty cool, I think.

274
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I think that would help. I mean, I don't know.

275
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Really, I know one of the things they're probably gonna add is just more Pokemon. I mean, they're gonna keep adding stuff to it eventually.

276
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

277
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So it's never gonna run out, but, like, after a while, it's just gonna be like, eh, you know, where do I go to get these Pokemon?

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I mean, it doesn't seem there's any rhyme or reason to some of them.

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Well, we'll see. I don't know. I'm not quite as pessimistic as Loki.

280
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't think you're gonna have the fever around it that we have right now, at least this week.

281
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But I think in about a month's time, I think people will still be playing it.

282
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You know, people might say, oh, once a week we're gonna go out and hunt Pokemon together. Like, it might become a thing for some people.

283
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Thank God there's no fucking Sojourner equivalent in this game.

284
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But I think for the most part, it's gonna, I think it'll still be a thing.

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And I think, you know what's funny? Go listen to the very first show that was put out this year.

286
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Not to swell my ego too much, but, you know, once in a while I have to pat myself on the back.

287
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We did our predictions for the year, and I said on that show, I said Pokemon Go is gonna be the biggest mobile phone game of all time.

288
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And if what we're seeing this week is any indication, absolutely right on that call.

289
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's way too early for that.

290
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Bigger than Candy Crush? Bigger than Draw Something? Absolutely.

291
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No, I think it's gonna just fizz out in a couple weeks.

292
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Can't wait to see where we're at six months from now, where they're adding Gen 3 or 4 Pokemon into the game and people are still-

293
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Make it more interesting. Like, I don't know. I just, I understand that, yes, Niantic will add updates and stuff.

294
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But, dude, like, the way the app has been released so far is, it just like, network issues aside, it is just fucking broken.

295
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like, why is that acceptable for any publisher at all?

296
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I thought the whole reason you have this beta test was to fix the problems, not rush it out because, oh, god damn it, we need to, you know, get those people to pay for, you know.

297
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I was surprised it came out as soon as it did. I was thinking it wasn't gonna be till the end of the month.

298
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah, I was like, you know, when this thing ended, I'm like, dude, this thing needs time to cook.

299
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I mean, even by the end of July, I think it's gonna be too quick and then they're like, oh, hey, it's coming out tomorrow.

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's like, holy shit, why? Why would you do that?

301
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You know, ActDeft does remind of an interesting point. Loki, you have to keep in mind, Pokemon Go hasn't gotten an official international release.

302
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah, and you-

303
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Not all people in the world have it.

304
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You know why? Because they're like, holy shit, this shit is fucking broken and that's why they, like, stop their-

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So, we're all beta testing it here in the States.

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah, we're beta test number two, I guess.

307
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Huh, interesting. Well, we'll see what develops. I still think this game is here to stay, but I do agree that it's got a lot of broken stuff, but I think Niantic's track record shows they're gonna evolve it, lol.

308
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The game will continue and I think there will be more of a game in there pretty soon for people to use their caught Pokemon.

309
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
We'll see. We'll see what develops with this.

310
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Again, if you guys want to chat along with the show, live.vognetwork.com and we'll take your calls later.

311
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm sure some of you want to talk about Pokemon Go later on. We'll take your calls.

312
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, but-

313
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, I also did have the event for next week.

314
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Sure.

315
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's gonna say what it was.

316
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah, go ahead. I wanted to finish a thought on Pokemon Go, but-

317
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh, sorry.

318
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No, that's okay. Go ahead.

319
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's a game merge that it's gonna be held in our Sacramento area and it's produced by IDGA Sacramento and Women Who Code Sacramento, so that's awesome.

320
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And you're gonna be at that?

321
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm gonna be a judge.

322
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Meet Dark Sakura.

323
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Make your game not suck.

324
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Awesome.

325
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm a strict judge.

326
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What was the other thing I was gonna say about Pokemon Go? Oh, this is the other thing. One last thought on that is that, you know, I still think the social phenomenon that's going on with this game is not to be ignored and it's huge.

327
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I mean, everybody's talking about this game that has a remote interest in video games.

328
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's going to- and the reason why I say gaming is forever changed this week, and even though Loki kind of laughs at that because the game's a little bit broken, you know every other company out there, especially ones that make mobile games and shitty ones at that, are looking at how do we make the next Pokemon Go?

329
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And there's gonna be so many knockoffs of this game coming your way real soon. Real soon.

330
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And I'm not even talking about the obvious stuff, like I'm sure there's a lot of people going, oh, LOL, there could be a Digimon game or-

331
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I would quit Pokemon Go for a Digimon game.

332
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Or whatever other Mon games are out there, but I think, you know, any successful cell phone game is usually followed by clones. Look at what fucking happened to Flappy Bird.

333
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Ooh, we're gonna catch some Skylanders soon?

334
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yep, yep. You know every other company is looking at this going, why didn't we fucking think of that? So-

335
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Because you're fucking dumb, because Ingress has been out for three years, you stupid idiots!

336
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, but, you know, again, without sounding too hipster grandpa-y, Ingress players built that network that Niantic is profiting off of big time.

337
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah, prof for my fucking paycheck, where's my fucking paycheck?

338
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You get paid in bursters.

339
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
No I'm not.

340
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't take payment in bursters.

341
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, Final Fantasy Go. Dardichia says, Puzzle and Dragons Go. Fifth Dream says, I would battle flans everywhere.

342
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Stoppy says, Oregon Trail Go. You could actually go down the Oregon Trail.

343
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't know if I want to go down the Oregon Trail.

344
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Let's see, Kaijuto says, Pokemon Go is a ripoff of Invisimals for the PSP and Vita, so it's been ripped off already. Oh, interesting.

345
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah, but Invisimals is crap.

346
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
AgDef says, Your paycheck is with every Oculus Rift backers check for selling to Facebook.

347
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Alright, we'll see what develops with Pokemon Go in the coming weeks. I kind of think- I'm interested to see the news stories.

348
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I did like the funny, you know, because people are making funny photoshops and stuff like that, so Dark Souls Go.

349
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That's really funny.

350
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I like- well, I don't like, but I think it's interesting that there's all this stuff in the media. Like, you know, a girl finds body by the river because she was trying to look for a Pikachu or whatever it was.

351
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So there's that. There's the whole unfortunate story about people are using the lure on the Pokestops to actually lure people out of their houses to rob them while the Pokemon lure is going.

352
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm like, that's kind of- that's actually really clever, even though it's really fucked up.

353
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah, you can't catch your wallet.

354
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So, don't steal things, assholes. It's not nice.

355
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Alright, we're going to get to the rest of our show, but of course every week we like to start off with a little bit of how was your gaming week, and what other games have you been playing this week besides Pokemon Go?

356
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
If anything, Dark Sakura.

357
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Other than Pokemon Go? Well, some Ingress.

358
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh yeah, Sims 4. I'm building houses. I'm going to fill a whole town full of nothing but pretty Sims that I make, and that's kind of it right now.

359
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Alright. Yeah, Pokemon Go took up a lot of my week too, so I didn't end up playing an awful, awful lot, but let's check in with Loki first.

360
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You know, with Konami in mobile games, maybe we can see, you know, like, a mobile game from them, like Pokemon Go.

361
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, P.T. Go.

362
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
P.T. Go. Silent Hills Go.

363
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That'd be fun.

364
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That'd be cool.

365
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You know, I have a problem. I really do have a problem. That problem is with clicker game addiction, and unfortunately I have played way too much fucking Tap my Katamari.

366
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Fuck you for bringing that into my life, by the way. Fuck you. Fuck you a hundred times or something hard and sandpapery because I can't stop playing that game either.

367
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I hate you.

368
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's a good time sink because Pokemon Go wasn't fucking working, so I couldn't play it from my house like I used to, but, um, yes.

369
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's just like, it's got that where you set yourself like a goal, okay, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna level this up a little bit.

370
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Oh, wait, I got some more money.

371
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay, well, I got to spend that money because, I mean, you know, you want to have the most cousins rolling while you're not playing, and then you get more money.

372
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh, well, I got to spend that money too, and it just fucking goes forever, and it never stops.

373
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm still playing it because it's entertaining, so whatever, you know, it's fine.

374
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And then, yeah, I played a little bit of Ingress because that's required, and a little bit of Pokemon Go just because, you know, it's kind of sucks.

375
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I actually leveled myself to, well, I leveled to five. I had leveled to four before on another, so I had an account through Pokemon Club, and their servers are fucked, so I was like, fuck this.

376
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I could wait until this, you know, gets fixed, which could be forever, or I'll just create one through Google Play, which, you know, my Google account is usually easier to log into, so I did that.

377
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I created another account, and I thought, oh shit, you know, now I'm gonna have to come up with a new username and all that.

378
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Nope, it fucking let me have the same username, so I don't know how that's possible, but whatever.

379
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So yeah, so I created a new account, leveled it up to five, so now I have one that's four and one that's five.

380
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The four probably never get played again, but I'm surprised it let me do that, and yeah.

381
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I have no intention to spend any money in this game whatsoever because those prices in that fucking store are fucking ridiculous.

382
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Oh, but let's put that $99 option out there.

383
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, but every game has an obscene, you know, money to spend cost thing in it, you know.

384
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Like Tap My Katamari, doesn't that have like a $75 candy bin or something?

385
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yes, but, I mean, if you're willing to watch the ads, which I did, and actually I'd like to get on a tangent about that too, since I do play a lot of it, so I watch a lot of the ads.

386
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Or I shouldn't say I watch a lot of the ads, I actually take a break from looking at the screen for about 30 seconds while those ads are playing, but I did actually see a lot of them.

387
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And holy shit, do all the mobile games that are on those ads, like all the fucking same.

388
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And there's like some shit I'm like, what the fuck kind of game? Do people actually play this shit?

389
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Like they had some Willy Wonka slot machine thing, which it's kind of cool that it was the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka, so not the Johnny Depp one, but what the hell?

390
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I mean, there's like some weird lotto shit on there, you know, people are getting pissed off at Counter Strike gambling and shit, and then they've got all this lottery shit on there.

391
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I don't know. A lot of really crappy games on there. And then fucking Angry Birds has like a fucking Bust-A-Move game now.

392
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So, I don't know, that's weird. But yeah, I'm not going to play any of those games either, so.

393
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But I'll take the free candy, and you know, they dole it out so often that it doesn't really matter, you don't need to pay real money to get that stuff.

394
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's it.

395
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Alright, before I get to my gaming week, I have an important announcement for Dark Sakura.

396
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Uh oh.

397
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That Raichu's back, and it's showing three feet somewhere from the ice. You're going to have to go to the park to find it or something, it's showing, it's a ways away, but it's in the radar.

398
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Dark Sakura may leave the show. For the first time ever, Dark Sakura may leave the show, right in the middle of it, to go find her fucking Raichu.

399
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Don't even try me, I am, uh, fuck.

400
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Would you really be mad?

401
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Dude, like seriously, like, since we started-

402
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You're really leaving to go get the fucking Raichu. She's gone. She's going.

403
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You know, since we started this show, that gym has changed colors twice already.

404
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, I know, I know, it's crazy.

405
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I am doing the right thing. I put down the phone.

406
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Dark Sakura changed her mind, she will not be hunting the Raichu right now. Alright.

407
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It better be there tonight.

408
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Ah, tangled!

409
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh cool, I'm almost level six.

410
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Alright, anyway, um, so unlike Loki, I may have spent twenty dollars on Pokemon Go, and I may be level eleven already, which is really nothing compared to most people right now in that game.

411
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Like, I couldn't really play the damn game for the first two days, so it wasn't really until this weekend when I was able to really start playing, so-

412
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah, I think the leveling must be-

413
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh, it's completely different than it was in the beta. It's much faster.

414
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah, the beta, that's probably why I only got the level, the level seven or whatever, I don't know what the equivalent was.

415
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Well, in the beta, they gave you great balls at level two, ultra balls at level three, and all that stuff, right? Great balls are at level twelve now.

416
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So, they definitely changed-

417
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But everything seems a lot easier to catch, so that's kinda nice.

418
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That's true too.

419
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's none of that, oh hey rat, hey, let's uh, hey Pidgey, how about you jump out of that fuckin' ball like eighty times, oh hey, or like, you know, you throw like a master ball at it or something, and it's like, yeah, fuck you, I'm just gonna jump out of this anyways, even though you got a nice throw and all that.

420
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So, yeah, it seems like some balancing and tweaking has happened there.

421
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:27,000
As far as other games I've been playing this week that aren't Pokemon GO, I've been playing Pokemon 3DS, actually. I'm continuing my quest in Alpha Sapphire.

422
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I have definitely progressed more in that game than any other Pokemon game that I've played, save for maybe Pokemon Yellow, so at least in a very long time, so there is that.

423
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Other ways, when it comes to like console stuff, I played a little bit more Grand Theft Auto, but not a lot, and then some other random console stuff, but nothing really new.

424
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I didn't really get into any other new games this week, so same thing with PC, I played a few matches of Overwatch, Alan's been really into the ranked mode thing.

425
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I am still not level twenty-five, cause I can't binge play that game the way other people do.

426
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I play a match or two, and I'm like, okay, I'm good, I'm done, I don't need to, I need to play a ton more.

427
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But, you know, Overwatch is still a thing that I'm playing a couple times a week, even if just for a little bit.

428
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So, that's really it for my gaming week.

429
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So for housekeeping, since Darsakha got her plug-in, I don't really have a lot else left, just a reminder we won't be here Labor Day weekend, but that's still a good six weeks away.

430
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So, that's that.

431
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

432
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

433
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
All that being said, let's get into some other gaming news.

434
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Things happened in the gaming industry that wasn't just Pokemon this week.

435
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So, let's get into it. Loki.

436
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Alright. Man, I'm full.

437
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Anyways, so Blizzard is going after some creators of some Overwatch cheats.

438
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So they have a cheat program that basically you pay a subscription to this company, and they give you special abilities, like the ability to see people on the map.

439
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Different, I guess, aside from map hacks and stuff.

440
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I don't know, but they were charging $1450 a month, so now they're going after the actual company that's making that.

441
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And they kind of did something similar, I think, with their MOBA game as well.

442
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I think they had something like that, some other cheating thing.

443
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But the suit, basically they're using the DMCA, you know, as the reason for the case since, you know, obviously they had to reverse engineer something to get it to work.

444
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But yeah. Cheaters suck.

445
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And basically they're gonna, you know, ban people that are caught using this.

446
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The interesting thing is, though, that the company, I think I was reading about it, maybe on another site, says that there's nothing Blizzard can do.

447
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Because they're in Germany or something, and so they're not subject to the laws here.

448
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So Blizzard can basically go suck it, is what the cheating company is saying.

449
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And I agree, cheaters suck, and Blizzard needs to put the ban hammer on people that are using this software, but, you know.

450
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I don't know if that works if they're doing business, though, in the United States.

451
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, I mean, again, that's just what they say, is that they're immune.

452
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That doesn't mean they really are, because you're right, if they're selling it in the United States, then they're kind of...

453
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And plus, Blizzard also has a presence overseas.

454
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
They also had a bot for Diablo, was the other thing, Diablo 3.

455
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
They had a bot, and apparently they had the company that made that actually won against Blizzard in Europe in 2013 for their honor bot.

456
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Really?

457
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
For honor buddy bot.

458
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I seem to remember that came up on the show a while ago, so I kind of wonder if that sets a precedent.

459
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And they also had a storm buddy heroes, or storm buddy bot that was for Heroes of the Storm.

460
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And they, I guess, won against them as well.

461
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Well, hey, shit, if you've won twice against Blizzard so far, I guess it wouldn't be a stretch that you win a third time.

462
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Alright, but don't let Blizzard catch you using that software, they're probably gonna ban you.

463
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So, enjoy that.

464
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Let's talk about something a little more positive, and something that's awesome, and that is breaking games legitimately.

465
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And something that was on full display this past week.

466
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:26,000
We talked about it a little bit on last week's show, but Summer Games Done Quick happened during this past week, and it officially ended yesterday.

467
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Grand total, $1,295,326 raised for charity, which was the Doctors Without Borders charity, I think based in France.

468
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Because it had a different name.

469
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Medicines Sans Frontieres.

470
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That's it, thank you very much.

471
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And, just in case you were wondering, Kill the Animals did end up winning for Super Metroid for this year's speedrun.

472
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So, they died.

473
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But don't worry, they're only pixels, and they do come back in one of the later games.

474
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Metroid Fusion.

475
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Also, let's see, they did announce the dates for the next awesome games done quick, which will be January 8th of 2017 through January 15th of 2017.

476
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Did you guys watch any of the Summer Games, er, yeah, Summer Games Done Quick? What did you guys think?

477
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Cool like it always is.

478
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah.

479
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Pepsi Man!

480
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Everybody's talking about this Pepsi Man thing. I didn't see it.

481
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You guys were watching it.

482
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's pretty funny.

483
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yeah? Is it like one of those games that's so bad it's good type of thing?

484
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah, it was a game that came out in Japan on PlayStation 1, I want to say.

485
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And, it was all in English. They had like Japanese text on the bottom, but it was all voice acted in English, and they had these really terrible cutscenes, like full motion video cutscenes.

486
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:50,000
With some like, redneck looking guy just drinking Pepsi and talking about Pepsi, and it was stupid. It had nothing to do with the game.

487
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Huh. Interesting.

488
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And the game itself is just weird.

489
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'll have to see it on YouTube.

490
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's like, you run and run and you avoid obstacles. It's kind of Paperboy-like. Except you just run.

491
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I did watch the one I watched the biggest chunk of. We actually, yesterday after our Pokemon run downtown, we came back here to cool off for a little bit. We were watching Summer Games done quick.

492
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I saw a little bit of the Pokemon Red run that they were doing. I saw just the very beginning of that, and I thought that was interesting.

493
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Because, you know, I didn't realize you could beat so many Pokemon without really leveling anything. I kind of thought that was something you had to do, but they sure knew their way around that.

494
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But then I also watched quite a bit, probably a good hour, of the Final Fantasy 6 speedrun that they were doing yesterday.

495
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And so that was pretty cool to see, because they have to bug out the game in some places.

496
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So like, Locke ends up wearing the merchant outfit that he steals for like, a good chunk of the game.

497
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And there's just other interesting little ways that they kind of...

498
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That'd be kind of cool to watch.

499
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yeah, there's other ways that they kind of break that game that I thought were really interesting.

500
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I was looking for, like, I heard they had some pretty cool stuff with Taskbot this year again.

501
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But I was trying to search, because I normally watch it just through the archives, because I never catch it when it's on.

502
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But, you know, I wanted to watch what they did this year with Taskbot.

503
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah, actually I'm hearing a lot about how Tetris the Grandmaster getting a lot of props for that.

504
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And of course, you know, I know one of the guys who used to listen to OLR a bit is now really heavily involved with that.

505
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So that's pretty cool how that all runs around.

506
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,000
A lot of folks... I didn't see this, but I certainly saw the response on Twitter and Facebook and so forth.

507
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
SHO 100 Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

508
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
The moment where the disabled gamer completed that indie game one-handed.

509
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
He gave a really emotional speech after doing an amazing job on his run.

510
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I didn't see it, so it's hard for me to comment on, but I'm gonna have to find that.

511
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Because a lot of folks on Twitter were saying the same thing.

512
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I guess donated during that and they had called it out or something.

513
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh, did he? Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. I heard he donated, but I didn't realize it was during that. That's awesome.

514
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It was some of the Super Mario RPG stuff was pretty cool, too.

515
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So getting the 12 flowers in the Bowser chase or the... what was the guy's name?

516
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I can never remember the bad guy who kidnapped Peach right at the beginning.

517
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Bust Boomer? Buster? Anyway, chasing him down.

518
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And someone accurately predicted out loud like how many flowers would get there in that chase. It was pretty fun.

519
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It was neat. Yeah, those guys really know that game inside and out.

520
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Or those games, anything they're speedrunning, they know them inside and out.

521
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So it was pretty cool to see. So big props to everyone involved with that.

522
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And we'll be talking about it again in six months when it's time for awesome games done quick.

523
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Fingers crossed for our buddy Flocko and his submission for P.T.

524
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I think he said he's going to try it every time until he gets in, so we'll see what happens.

525
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Meanwhile, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

526
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Well, we have hit a year anniversary since Iwata passed away.

527
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I always hate the term passed away. I just prefer died.

528
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Because why should you lessen the impact of something like that that happens?

529
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You know? But that's me.

530
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Anyway, it has been a year as of...

531
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Well, it's already July 11th in Japan, I believe.

532
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So it's been a year over there since everything went down.

533
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And it just makes me wonder, what do you think about Nintendo now?

534
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Kind of the direction it's going in.

535
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Or even just seeing Pokemon go, I mean.

536
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yeah, right. Actually, that was an interesting tweet I saw yesterday.

537
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Not to be too much of a downer, but it's a real bummer that Iwata can't see the cultural impact that Pokemon Go is having right now.

538
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But in a way, even though it's a really sad thing to say, in a way it's also kind of uplifting.

539
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's like, oh, but he knew that that was going to happen.

540
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And he'd probably be really thrilled that people are responding to it the way that they are.

541
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So in a way, it's actually a little bit uplifting, I think.

542
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I've had them look forward to it.

543
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yes. But I wonder how he'd feel about the NX delay.

544
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I think that ended up happening a little later.

545
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Then that one would be, it can't be helped.

546
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I think there's a lot of people definitely still thinking about Iwata and just the impact that he's had on gaming that's going to be felt for a very, very long time.

547
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's very similar to when Steve Jobs passed for Apple.

548
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The last product that he had worked on didn't come out for several years until after.

549
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So again, not to be a downer, but these things happen.

550
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So it's going to be several years before Iwata's presence on the gaming industry truly fades and moves into a newer generation of Nintendo.

551
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But anyway, a moment to tip our hats and remember Satoru Iwata one year later.

552
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Well, that being said, let's move on. Loki.

553
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
All right. So this is pretty cool. Red Dead Redemption has finally made it to the Xbox One backwards compatibility.

554
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And that was on Friday.

555
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And they're actually offering it now if you're a gold member for $7.49.

556
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And not only with that, you will also get some of the DLC for free.

557
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So they've got the Myths and Mavericks bonus pack and Legends and Killers pack are free.

558
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So go check that out and go play it if you have it on backwards compatibility, because it's awesome.

559
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
They even did like a thing with what was it?

560
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The website that does all the like frame rate tests and stuff. Digital Foundry, I think.

561
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
They did a test on the frame rates and everything for the game.

562
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And actually now it's all pretty much 30 frames per second consistently and not any sort of slowdowns or anything like they had before.

563
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So definitely check it out.

564
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Is that maybe why it kind of took a little longer for that to come out even though the beta had released some time?

565
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Or not the beta. It kind of leaked out, remember, for like a day that Red Dead Redemption was going to be backwards compatible?

566
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So they kind of were taking time to actually tweak some things and make it better?

567
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Possibly. Maybe for the consistent frame rate.

568
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But pretty much a lot of the games that are on backwards compatibility end up running better than they do on their original systems.

569
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's pretty cool though that it gives you a whole reason to go back and kind of look at it again, right?

570
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yep.

571
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Alright.

572
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Kaijuto in chat says, do yourself a favor and just buy the game of the year edition for cheap and play it that way.

573
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But some of the add-ons are all included and stuff, right? With the backwards compatibility?

574
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah, so definitely if you can get it digitally that way, that would be a way to go.

575
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's a great game. Just play it if you haven't.

576
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Alright, well moving on to another Nintendo game and that's Splatoon.

577
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And as you guys know, Splatoon is in a way winding down because the Splatfest will be ending.

578
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
The last Splatfest is going to be on July 22nd.

579
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
We already talked a little bit about that last week and there's the whole Team Cali and Marie and all that and who's going to join what team.

580
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But Nintendo did take a moment this week to just reiterate that they're not pulling support for online in Splatoon anytime soon.

581
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
They have said that the quote general online experience and service will continue.

582
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
So they're not ending the game or anything like that or going to pull the servers like EA would or something like that.

583
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The game will continue for the foreseeable future.

584
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Probably until the inevitable Splatoon 2 or Splatoon on NX or whatever it's going to be.

585
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Because y'all know this game is getting a sequel because pretty much everybody who played it loved it.

586
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So we'll see what develops with that.

587
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And good luck to everybody on that final Splatfest that's happening in a couple weeks.

588
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I was worried that it was happening this weekend because usually they announce it.

589
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
You pick your teams and it kind of happens the next weekend.

590
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But they gave a really big lead time this time.

591
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So you actually have until the weekend of the 22nd to do this.

592
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So good luck everybody who's going to be doing that.

593
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Alright, moving on before we get to release dates.

594
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Dark Sakura.

595
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Well I'm sure everyone knows I'm a big fan of the King of Fighters series.

596
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And not so much Fatal Fury but I love the characters in it.

597
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So coming out to Dead or Alive 5 is going to be Shiranui Mai.

598
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes, everyone's favorite ninja lady.

599
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Me bouncy! Because that's what she says when she wins the match.

600
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
That's not what she says.

601
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
She says, me bouncy!

602
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That's not what she says.

603
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
She shows a little bounce.

604
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's not what she says.

605
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's what I always heard as a kid.

606
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
She says, me bouncy.

607
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So, anyway.

608
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But, she was also my favorite character to play and not because of that.

609
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Because she was a badass with the flame kick and the fan throws and all that stuff.

610
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Yeah, the whole thing that I kind of hope is that they were saying like a KOF versus Dead or Alive.

611
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Is I'd like to see more of the King of Fighters folks in the game.

612
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I'd love to actually see a full versus series.

613
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
That would be pretty awesome.

614
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And also Team Ninja, well let me rewind.

615
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
She's going to be available in September.

616
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Team Ninja is also adding in new costumes based on some of the KOF outfits.

617
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And then this month there's also a bunch of costumes and a stage based on Shingeki no Kyojin Attack on Titan.

618
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I watched the trailer for that.

619
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It was pretty badass.

620
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I have to say it looked pretty interesting.

621
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So, there you go.

622
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the pass phrase Zoo.

623
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm getting some backup and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

624
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, I always thought me bouncy too.

625
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh good, it wasn't just my immature mind.

626
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I did use her in Fatal Fury Special.

627
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I think that was my favorite installment.

628
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah, honestly Fatal Fury Special still is one of my favorite fighting games.

629
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
She first showed up in Fatal Fury 2.

630
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, she was first in Fatal Fury 2.

631
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But then of course I loved her in Capcom SNK 2 as well.

632
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
That's one of those games we used to play at Golf Land right after DDR.

633
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It was Capcom SNK 2.

634
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh man, I wish they would have made a 3 to this day.

635
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I realize both companies are very different now, but that was a fighting game I'm always going to love.

636
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I liked when their artists did each other's characters.

637
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
That was the best.

638
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh yeah, because SNK vs Capcom is also kind of a trip.

639
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I loved seeing the differences in the style and how awesome it was.

640
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It's kind of a bummer we never got Tekken X Street Fighter.

641
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I know we got Street Fighter X Tekken, but remember we were supposed to get Tekken X Street Fighter and that kind of didn't happen.

642
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah, you get Akuma.

643
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, you get one character.

644
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Are you satisfied?

645
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
No, I'm not.

646
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Unless they're using that engine to then ultimately do Tekken X Street Fighter.

647
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Unless there's going to be DLC that's Tekken X Street Fighter.

648
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh, bite your tongue. Bite your tongue.

649
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some things that you'll be playing a lot sooner than Tekken X Street Fighter, that's for sure.

650
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Loki, starting in the US.

651
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Alright, I know there's not a whole lot this week.

652
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Let's see, so starting off, we've got, oh actually quite a bit.

653
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So, 7th Dragon 3 code VFD on the 3DS.

654
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Assault Suit Lanos on PC and Playstation 4.

655
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
They're doing a new Ghostbusters game that's going to be on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

656
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Kerbal Space Program on Playstation 4.

657
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Force on Playstation Vita.

658
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Necropolis on PC, Mac and Linux.

659
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Poly Bridge on PC, Mac and Linux.

660
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Song of the Deep on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

661
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Tumble Stone on PC, Playstation 4 and Wii U.

662
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Under Night, In Birth, EXE, Late.

663
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
These are Japanese titles, seriously, just throw random words in there.

664
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
That's going to be coming out on PC.

665
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And a game called Video Ball on PC, Mac and Linux, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

666
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And then, we've got some more stuff coming out a little later in the week.

667
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Push Me, Pull You on PC, Mac and Linux.

668
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Adrift on Playstation 4, which is, that's almost like I think a VR title at some point.

669
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
But I guess it can be played without VR.

670
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And then we have Monster Hunter Generations on 3DS.

671
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And Obliteracers on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

672
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Which I love that, I love that name by the way.

673
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And then actually on the weekend, Tumble Stone on Xbox One.

674
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And then that's it.

675
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Alright, well traveling to Japan, it's kind of a different story with the releases.

676
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Because as I was looking at the calendar, I was like, wow, there's nothing.

677
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
There's nothing on Playstation 4, there's nothing on Wii U, there's like nothing coming out in Japan.

678
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But then I got to the 3DS and I realized why there is nothing else coming out this week.

679
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Because out this week in Japan, Yokai Watch 3 version Sushi and version Tempura are both out.

680
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yes, those are the names of the two versions. Sushi and Tempura.

681
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm a big Tempura fan. I like fried fatty foods.

682
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Team Sushi.

683
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So, Yokai Watch 3, Sushi and Tempura are out on the DS this week.

684
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I realize those games did alright here, but they're huge in Japan.

685
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You know, all those Splatfest names and titles, they're really just testing out subtitles for the new Pokemon games.

686
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Perhaps.

687
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
You're going to have Pokemon Hot Dog, Pokemon Ice Cream, and...

688
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Pokemon Callie and Pokemon Marie? I don't know about that.

689
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Pokemon Autobots, Pokemon Decepticons.

690
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Stoppy in chat says, I'm waiting for Yokai Watch McRib.

691
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So, this is kind of cool, to interrupt the show.

692
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So, someone apparently is battling a Pokemon at the gym right now and I can actually see...

693
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yeah, you can see the animation in the scanner.

694
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Oh yeah, it's pretty cool.

695
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah, when a fight is actually happening at a gym, you see like a little puff cloud of smoke and electricity and stuff coming off the gym, like there's a fight going on.

696
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Like, you know, cartoons of cats and dogs fighting, that whole thing.

697
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

698
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Oh, like fights in the Sims?

699
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Gang, fight, gang, fight.

700
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Oh my gosh, it almost, like, every time you see that happening, don't you just want to run down to the park and go, nerds!

701
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Even though you're totally a nerd too, like...

702
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Oh, it's a Nidorino.

703
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Anyhow, let's see, going back, Tigerclaw says, Skye, have any of you guys found any Pokemon at the OLR studio?

704
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
You must have missed the very beginning of the show, Tigerclaw.

705
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I caught an Eevee on the table, a Caterpie in the bathroom, and I just caught a Nidorino.

706
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I did catch, I want to say I did catch a water Pokemon in a gutter, apparently, because I was on a walking trail, and there was like some drain runoff that was right there, and I guess there was like a seal bathing in the drain runoff.

707
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I got a Staryu, whatever those things are, I got one of those today at a winery. Those are the water types I can go for.

708
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I just got a Pidgey on my computer.

709
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Congrats.

710
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Alright, let's see, Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I wonder if Loki is going to run out and go, what are you doing? There isn't fun! This isn't a game yet! Stop it!

711
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
He very well might. Don't tempt him.

712
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
There's a Flareon up there now.

713
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

714
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Loki, what do you got for us first, while I catch this Nidorino, which is very important because I don't have this in my Pokedex yet.

715
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I like the people's names, though, that are on that gem. Sarah's Got Balls, Lifted Ideas, and Ricky the Prowler. If that doesn't sound like a pedophile name, I don't know what will.

716
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I love some of the Pokemon names. Like, I'm sure a lot of you have seen that story about the Pidgey that was on the White House that's called Murica, right?

717
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And then somebody put a...

718
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Can you see the Pokemon names? Because I had, like before in the beta, I had a... was it a Raticate that was Donald Trump?

719
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
On the gems you can. Yeah, and somebody has a Pokemon somewhere called Fuck Trump that was on a gem. I don't remember, I just saw that floating around on Twitter.

720
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You saw one too. Is the Westboro Church had one?

721
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Yeah, that's Love is Love with the Clefairy.

722
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Appropriate. Love it.

723
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,000
If I got a Pikachu, I would name it after this old, like, Flash animation that was out in late 1999, and call him Fuckachu.

724
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It was this guy who turned himself into a Pokemon named Calic. It was the dumbest thing ever. I have it somewhere on a hard drive.

725
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Act F'ed is correcting you in Chat Dark Soccer. It was a Clefable, not a Clefairy.

726
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Whatever! It's one of the pink ones that I don't like.

727
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
However, I will have everybody know, I accomplished something I couldn't ever accomplish in the beta on day one.

728
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Did you become the very best?

729
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Yes, because I caught a Pikachu, which for some reason, I fucking live in a neighborhood of Pikachus. I'm not complaining.

730
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But I also caught the very first day, Jigglypuff. Thank you, goodnight.

731
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's the one Pokemon I wanted. I got a Jigglypuff. Jigglypuff was like the fifth Pokemon I got.

732
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
No one can see that. Rob just pulled a Gia gun.

733
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
There's a reason why we're not a video show here at Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, Loki, what's Loki got for us in the news before we wrap things up?

734
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
More exciting news than actual Pokemon Go.

735
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Did I do my game releases? I didn't?

736
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Oh, no you didn't. So we should go to the UK first.

737
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yeah, I guess.

738
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Meanwhile, I will sit here and name Pokemon after drag queens.

739
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Oh my god, that's what we should do. We should just give them like, just make up drag names anyway.

740
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Just the same rules apply as was at, um, it was a horse game.

741
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Oh, um, uh, Derby Owners Club.

742
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Yeah, the same rules apply as Derby Owners Club.

743
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Rob had Politary.

744
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I did, I had Politary.

745
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Raichu is now the closest Pokemon showing on my radar.

746
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
What? Oh, girl. I've got Incense on right now.

747
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
We gotta get to break.

748
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
On the 13th is Fru for Xbox One.

749
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And the 15th, Ghostbusters on three different systems.

750
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And Obliteracers, which is actually kind of a neat name.

751
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Okay, I'm done. Loki.

752
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Alright. So, um.

753
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Bitch better show up.

754
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
No more delays in the future. It is coming. No Man's Sky has gone gold.

755
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And they posted to Twitter showing, hey, look, we got this wonderful DVD, Blu-ray that we're gonna, you know, have them press.

756
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And, yeah, woo! So it is coming now, August 9th.

757
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Congratulations. You did it.

758
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yes.

759
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Oh, shit, we lost the DVD. Or the Blu-ray. No, I'm just kidding.

760
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It failed Sony quality check. We have to go back to it.

761
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So, I'm excited. I can't wait to play that.

762
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yeah, it's about time. Because I've been looking forward to that game.

763
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It was supposed to be out for my birthday. That didn't happen.

764
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So, now, now I will get it in the coming weeks.

765
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But, but, but, but you got Mighty No. 9.

766
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Mighty No. 2.

767
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I can't wait.

768
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Actually, although, if, you know, Captain Spike over at Gameboi.org, they did, which is also here on the VOG Network, they did a show on Mighty No. 9 recently.

769
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And they kind of, you know, Spike said he played it and it's not bad. Like, the internet is really giving this game way too much shit.

770
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
The internet is wrong.

771
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
What's that?

772
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
The internet is wrong.

773
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Believe, imagine that. The internet is wrong.

774
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I just caught a vetinet on your butt.

775
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Oh, God. I imagine, at the end of the day, it's probably just not the game people expected it to be.

776
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Well, it's probably not what the footage they showed originally was.

777
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I doubt it's Pepsiman bad. Like, that's probably the point.

778
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
There's worse games than Pepsiman.

779
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah, Pepsiman. I think that was a better game than Mighty No. 9.

780
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I think Temple Run was actually inspired by Pepsiman.

781
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Well, I don't know if you guys love this game or hate this game, but you're going to have a real easy way to try this game out soon, and that is the game Evolve.

782
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
You remember Evolve? That came out not that long ago. It was a 4v1 type of game.

783
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Well, what's interesting about the future of Evolve is that Evolve is going to be going free to play, at least on PC.

784
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You know, Turtle Rock, who developed the game, has said a lot of very interesting things about the game, and they even called some of the things that happened behind the game a, quote, DLC shitstorm.

785
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So, there's going to be balance changes, UI improvements, map improvements, bug fixes, customization, and all that stuff.

786
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
On July 7th, all that package will be free as a beta to test server loads.

787
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:41,000
If you have previously bought the game, you are now a founder, and your content will transfer, and you're supposed to get some other type of extra gifts at some point.

788
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Turtle Rock also saying if this is successful on PC, they are considering transferring it over to consoles as well.

789
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So, we'll see. It's going to be interesting to see how this changes the game and what it could do to sequel potentials.

790
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Be very curious about that, because I kind of figured this game was going to be getting a sequel, but maybe that's going to be in question now. We'll see.

791
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Anyway, let's travel back to a time when, you know what, there wasn't, free to play games, no such thing.

792
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,000
No such thing. You would pay $40 for shit Atari 2600 games that were completely commercialized, like the Purina.

793
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Purina Chuck Weiningen.

794
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Okay, she went a little more recent than that.

795
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But, anyway, every week here on the show, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you little shits, stop capturing your caterpies.

796
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Stop capturing them and become partners with them.

797
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And enjoy this classic game of the week.

798
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Get chosen.

799
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

800
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Digimon World.

801
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I see what you did there.

802
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Digimon World is, it was put up by Bandai on PlayStation. It released in 1999.

803
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And it's about being a, you know, having a partner Digimon and raising them and helping save their island.

804
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So, you start off as a person who is brought to File City on File Island by Digimon to save everybody there.

805
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
The Digimon were losing their memories and turning feral, and so you have to help save them.

806
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You have to recover their memory and return back to the city.

807
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:33,000
So, you raise a single Digimon from its egg form, going into all the different levels of it.

808
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,000
After a while, it will start to fade with age and then turn back to an egg, so you have to raise it again.

809
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But as you go through the game, it's actually based on certain questions depend on if you start with Agumon or Gabumon.

810
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:58,000
So, it was pretty, you know, I mean the game itself, it was really a game for the fans.

811
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
They had a crazy, crazy marketing campaign to compete with Pokemon.

812
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Because at the time, yeah, that was around when Pokemon Red and Blue were both out.

813
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
There was a Digimon trading card game that came out with this.

814
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And then the game actually, the trading card game actually came out with Digimon World 2 in 2000.

815
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It didn't get the highest rating for Famitsu. It got a 23 out of 40.

816
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,000
But it sold well enough in the US to get a greatest hits release in a platinum range in Europe.

817
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
But it really was just a game made for the fans.

818
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Because you'd have to know more about, I think, the series to be able to really get the game.

819
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And I've played through it. I actually really enjoyed it, but I was also a pretty diehard Digimon fan.

820
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
It was really neat and it had other versions that came out.

821
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
There was Digimon World DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, Digimon World Data Squad, and Digimon World Championship.

822
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Even though they weren't really official games that were in the series, they were just localized that way.

823
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
There was Digimon World Re-Digitized, where it came for PSP.

824
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And then there was Digimon World Next Order that came out in 2015 for Vita.

825
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And there was also, I was trying to find the thing on it.

826
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
There was the Digimon V, what was it? Barcode Scanner. Do you remember that?

827
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Where this one brand of cereal would give you the best stats ever.

828
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,000
It was crazy, but I was always a bigger fan of Digimon than Pokemon, especially in terms of watching the anime.

829
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I liked the concept better. I didn't like that they're not your little pets.

830
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I liked that you actually teamed up with them and they could communicate with you.

831
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I liked the whole series better.

832
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Digimon World and I want a new Digimon game. I've been totally enjoying watching Digimon Adventure Try.

833
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
So, there you go.

834
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Done.

835
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

836
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Digimon World on the PlayStation. What an appropriate selection for everything going on in the world this week, Darsakra.

837
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
No, I love it. I love it. It's a little bit of a, hey, don't forget this one as well. Love it.

838
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Anyhow, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, some folks are remembering some of this.

839
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Dark Tetsuya says, oh, Barcode Battler. At least that's how I remember it.

840
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
But the story, it was a specific brand of ramen that breed a powerful monster.

841
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
That was it. And to answer Act Deaf's question about if I've tried the new Digimon game on PS4, not yet.

842
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You should put that on your to-do list.

843
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I should, but I've got, built 20 million other things I'm playing.

844
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
The gamer struggle, the very big gamer struggle.

845
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Let's see, Ragenator says, I did see some of the original Pokemon and Digimon anime series.

846
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Admittedly, the Digimon theme was slightly catchy, but the shows themselves were, I don't know, obnoxious for lack of a better term.

847
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You gotta watch them in Japanese.

848
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And I was gonna say, you didn't, your fandom was not about the US ones, you always watched the Japanese.

849
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:35,000
No, because I, my first exposure to the Digimon was watching the Japanese one, so that's sort of what I stuck with.

850
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I know those voices, so it's like going to watch, and Ranma and I have had this discussion.

851
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It's like going, like when I start to watch Ranma one half, I have to watch it in Japanese because those are the voices that I know better.

852
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:58,000
You know, for people who watched it in English, they know the American voices better, so that's their preference, so.

853
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I hear you. Alright, it's like when they change the voices. Like in Final Fantasy XIV, they changed voices in the expansion.

854
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It's like, wait a minute, these aren't the same people. Who are these new people doing the voices?

855
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
One of them is dead.

856
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Well, she died after Heavensward came out. That wasn't the reason why.

857
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
The new expansion.

858
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Well, the new expansion is now yet, but yes, her voice will have to change. Although her character's story kind of wrapped up, so they just may not put the character in the game anymore.

859
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
We'll see. We'll see what they do.

860
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Anyway, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, there's more of Orange Lounge Radio, including, yes, a FUGO Question of the Week this week.

861
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Some rapid fire news. We'll talk about some changes to Xbox avatars that are pretty awesome.

862
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
We'll talk a little more about Pokemon Go, because it does impact the news in some ways as well.

863
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:52,000
We'll talk about your emails and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

864
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 649 for this July the 10th of 2016.

865
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Our show in progress. If you missed the first part of our show, we spent some time in the beginning talking about the phenomenon that is Pokemon Go.

866
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Just talking about the big impact that it has. Loki talked about some things he'd like to see improved, for lack of a better term.

867
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
We are going to get into some rapid fire news in this segment as well.

868
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Next week on our show, I didn't realize this, I guess multiples of 50 are kind of a big deal. Next week would be episode 650.

869
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Although, I don't know, I guess we already did something for episode 600, so we just have the quiciniera to look forward to at this point.

870
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
We need episode evil.

871
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That's right, episode 666 is in sight.

872
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Yeah, I actually looked at that earlier today. That's going to fall sometime in November.

873
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Is that accounting for Labor Day being off?

874
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Uh, yes.

875
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Oh, you know what? I will also be gone gamer X week, so you gotta push it back one more week.

876
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Yeah, because we'll be gone gamer X week.

877
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
My mom might be in town.

878
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
A few more weeks and we can hit.

879
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I know, I'm like, we might make Christmas.

880
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Hopefully, Orange Launch Radio episode 666 will be visited by Satan Claus.

881
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
We'll summon the Krampus.

882
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Hey, you know what? My one wish, and I hope he's out there listening, for episode 666, I need him to be out there listening.

883
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I want Travis Donovan as DJ Satan to call into episode 666, Orange Launch Radio. It's the one thing I want in life.

884
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Make it happen.

885
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Tweet him or something. Let him know. He has to be here.

886
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It's time to prepare.

887
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
For those of you that don't know, when he had his show, Understation Live, he always closed each episode as DJ Satan.

888
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Although, I don't know if I was supposed to give away that it was actually him, just like you're not supposed to know that I'm Mr. Spanky.

889
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Like, we couldn't all tell.

890
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I gave away big secrets here on Orange Launch Radio. Big secrets, my bad.

891
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I'm going to get a hate mail tomorrow.

892
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Alright, let's do some rapid fire news, and then of course we will get to your calls in a little bit here.

893
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.

894
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But first, rapid fire news. Loki.

895
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So, here's what I love about Grand Theft Auto 5, and I really need to go back and play this.

896
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And actually, I think this is probably going to get me to do that.

897
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Especially Grand Theft Auto Online, because I really got out of that.

898
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I don't know. I didn't have as much fun as I thought I would in it.

899
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But, there's a brand new expansion coming out called Grand Theft Auto Online, Cunning Stuns.

900
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And what it does is it adds a bunch of new pieces to make up your own stunt tracks in the race creator.

901
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Because I don't know if you know, Rob, that in Grand Theft Auto Online you can go in there and make your own death matches, make your own racetracks and whatnot.

902
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And one of the things that people like doing, especially in the mod community on PC, is making giant fucking ramps and all sorts of stunt races and stuff like that.

903
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And they actually do that in the real game as well.

904
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:06,000
But now it's going to get ridiculous. They've got metal tubes you can race through with boost panels and fucking fan blades and all sorts of ramps and crazy shit.

905
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Fucking can't wait. It looks awesome.

906
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Perhaps they will have one where you can play as the badass librarian in a future expansion called Cunning Linguists.

907
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Cunning Linguists. Yes, maybe. That'd be awesome.

908
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I would look forward to that. DarkSakura, would you play the Cunning Linguists expansion?

909
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
You like grammar. I'm getting an eye roll.

910
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
There we go.

911
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:39,000
They're also adding new supercars, sports cars, motorcycles, and stunt themed apparel. And they'll be coming out on July 12th. Just a couple more days. For free, by the way.

912
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I like free.

913
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And I'm sure you'll be looking forward to a wonderful... Well, at least you installed all the patches and everything and you have yours in standby. It'll automatically install it.

914
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Nice.

915
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And then, on top of that, Final Fantasy VII is coming to Android for the premium price of $16. No thanks.

916
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Can you tell me I can play Final Fantasy VII on my phone without any fucking controls? For $16, which is probably more than they charge on the Playstation Store? Oh, fucking sign me up.

917
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I think it does have controller support. I would hope that it has controller support. But it is going to be available. Check it out. Go grab it.

918
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
DarkSakura, can you do your story six?

919
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Sure. Why not?

920
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:54,000
For folks who are playing Gunvolt 2, Shovel Knight's going to be a guest boss in that game. And the trailer actually looks pretty neat, but he looks like he's going to be pretty hard to beat in that one. If you haven't seen the trailer, go check it out because it's pretty cool.

921
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:18,000
And then, perk up at death, there is going to be a Kirby Cafe in Japan. It's going to, actually there's not really a whole bunch more information on that, but it's probably going to be really, really good food. Probably fluffy, adorable, Kirby things.

922
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I bet it'll be like some marshmallow dishes, which actually sounds pretty disgusting to me, but other than that though.

923
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It's really one of those adult cafes and you know, well, it's Kirby themed. They suck, right? He sucks things with his mouth.

924
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Loki, knock it off. Anything else about the Kirby Cafe, DarkSakura?

925
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I'm done. Fucking done.

926
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Hey, that System Shock remake that came up a couple of weeks ago on the show, it made its Kickstarter goal. $900,000 it actually raised. That is of course the remake of the 1994 game.

927
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:07,000
There is still time to go in the Kickstarter though, so I guess this means stretch goals. But yeah, so the System Shock Kickstarter made it, so it's going to be coming.

928
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So you can follow progress on that. At Nightdive Studio on Twitter is where you can actually follow that for updates on that.

929
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And some folks in chat are surprised to hear that. Yeah, so pretty cool.

930
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Also, speaking of Kickstarters, there is a game called Pray for the Gods. That's P-R-E-Y.

931
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:37,000
That was a boss climbing action survival game that I think was originally announced some time ago, but now it's like a Kickstarter.

932
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's fucking fantastic, by the way.

933
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah, this is something I guess you've been following because I don't know much about this.

934
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Well, I just saw someone had posted a link to it in Twitter or NeoGaf or something like that and it looks like, you know, it has a very big Shadow of the Colossus vibe to it.

935
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Like they show the guy, he's fighting this giant bird thing and he grapples onto it with a grappling hook and he's climbing on the fur just like he would in Shadow of the Colossus.

936
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It looks pretty awesome.

937
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Well, they're looking to raise $300,000, which seems a little low for something that looks this good graphically, but they do have an interesting plan.

938
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:25,000
The plan is that they're going to launch it on PC with five bosses and then they will roll it out to like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 after the PC version.

939
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
So they're not going to do things that held back other games like Mighty No. 9 by trying to launch everywhere at once.

940
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
So it seems like they've got the plan figured out.

941
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I want to see a team of three people making it.

942
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Oh my gosh. That's a pretty intense looking game for coming from just three people. That's pretty awesome.

943
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

944
01:15:45,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Every week we ask a question and we read some of our favorite responses here on the show over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and Google Plus.

945
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Yes, Google Plus is still a thing. Google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

946
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
You know, I end up saying that every week. Yes, Google Plus is still a thing.

947
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:22,000
We'll actually start on Google Plus tonight if it'll load here for me on this ancient computer that we broadcast the show from as it tries to open our question of the week, which is about Pokemon Go.

948
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It's no secret that many gamers everywhere are suddenly staring at their phones as they collect Pokemon as Pokemon Go officially released this week.

949
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
We want to ask you what you think about the staying power of the game.

950
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
We don't hear too much about Miitomo anymore. Candy Crush and Draw Something, they aren't what they once were.

951
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Do you think Pokemon Go will have staying power as a mobile title? Why or why not?

952
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Starting with Act Def tonight who says Pokemon Go is here to stay. It has the potential to grow even further than other games and apps like Miitomo.

953
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Hopefully Niantic solves the problems Go currently has, but I know that people will still be playing it years from now.

954
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Philip W. answers over on Google Plus saying if they don't fix the issues and introduce some more expected features in depth for a Pokemon game, there's definitely going to be a drop off, but it'll likely remain popular.

955
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And then we're going to check in over at Facebook where we ask the same thing at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

956
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And we got some answers here starting off tonight from Rageinator who says, I don't know, I'm not part of Pokemon Go's target audience and never cared for the franchise.

957
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:39,000
All I'll say is this, Pokemon as a whole has a lot of staying power and a pretty good sized fan base. How long will Go last? I don't know. The best I can offer as an answer is a while.

958
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You know though honestly though Rageinator, I kind of think Pokemon Go is targeting everybody, at least based on what I see people playing it.

959
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I mean it might seem like it's a kids thing, but because Pokemon's been around 20 years, I know so many 30-somethings who were playing it when they were younger that are like eating this up.

960
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And I may or may not be one of them, just saying.

961
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Fifth Dream says, I'm not sure about staying power. If they periodically add content and new generations of Pokemon, I think it could last a good while.

962
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I'm astonished at how popular and widespread it seems to be at the moment, so it could be around a while. I'll say this, I'm considering buying a better phone so I can play it on a trip next month.

963
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:23,000
William Murderface says, take whatever the staying power of Ingress is and add a multiplayer of 4 or 5 due to the theme.

964
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Honestly, based on what I've seen, try 30 or 40 as the multiplier.

965
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Anyway, due to the theme and mechanical differences, this assumes that they keep releasing new Pokemon and have regular events, possibly using legendary Pokemon as incentives for mass participation.

966
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Without those, I think it's dead in a few months. With them, well, more than 5 years. With proper maintenance, this game has the potential to be around longer than all those you name combined, plus some.

967
01:18:51,000 --> 01:19:00,000
SSG100Matt says, it's too early to say one way or the other. It'll be up to Niantic to keep the game going with events, updates, and improvements as often as possible.

968
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:13,000
As mentioned above, the attention that the game is getting is huge right now. If the game is updated often with plenty of events, then it'll last a while. Otherwise, people will get tired of catching Rattatas all day and it'll phase out by the end of the year. Niantic has their work cut out for them.

969
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:27,000
CainIam says, it depends if they can get their servers issues worked out, and if they add other features like trading or trainer battles between people, then there's a good chance that with the occasional update to the Pokedex to add in some new Pokemon, then yeah, Go has legs.

970
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Redertainment says, I believe Pokemon Go will have a larger and more loyal user base than Ingress because Pokemon Go is an already established property.

971
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Also, Pokemon Go gives me an excuse to go out on walks. I mean, besides exercise and being outside and all that shit.

972
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Degenerate Johnny says, since Pokemon has a strong established fan base, I'm going to say that it has the potential of having a very long lifespan.

973
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Especially considering what was said during E3 when Game Freak mentioned the possibility of integrating Pokemon Go with newer Pokemon games like Sun and Moon.

974
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I just want to address that real quick though, Degenerate Johnny. I really, really, really do not think it's going to be something like you can import your Pokemon from one game into the other.

975
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I mean, for one, Pokemon Go is only Gen 1, but because the way you level Pokemon is so different and the game itself is different, it would just throw off the balance.

976
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
You'd probably just get like, hey, you purchase this game, you get a code, hey, now it's like you unlock this.

977
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yeah, you're going to get items or like maybe a Pokemon that you unlock in one game or the other. I think it'll be something like that.

978
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,000
But it's not, I'm not expecting, and maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised, but I'm not expecting a deep integration.

979
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I'm expecting perks for playing both and they're mainly cosmetic or pokey medic.

980
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And lastly, Mega Man X400. I've never really been sure how to pronounce my co-host from reading his fundamental, his handle online.

981
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I think it's Mega Man X400 says, almost didn't make it in time because I was out playing Pokemon Go lol.

982
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Wait a minute, aren't you in Canada? I thought the game didn't come out in Canada yet.

983
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Can't you just download the APK or whatever?

984
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Probably, probably.

985
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Of course, if you're on iOS.

986
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:22,000
No, there was even ways to do it on iOS. People were making accounts in foreign countries and all that stuff to get, remember it came out in New Zealand like one whole day before it was out here?

987
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
It did, I didn't even notice.

988
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Anyway, as for the staying power, it's Pokemon, which the original game is still going strong. The game has a lot of potential for future growth.

989
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I have faith they will continue to invest into this game more so than Miitomo or any other mobile game.

990
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So there you go, those are the answers from our Facebook and Google Plus community, the Fugu Question of the Week.

991
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Since we kind of already answered that earlier in the show, I won't ask everybody in here in the studio to do it again.

992
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Instead, we will move on for more long form news, starting with Loki.

993
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:04,000
So yeah, they've done an update to the Xbox One avatars, and now they have options to have wheelchairs.

994
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Which is kind of great for gamers that might be disabled, or if you want to roll a Professor X type character, then you can go ahead and do that.

995
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So that's pretty cool, and that's what else they're going to be adding.

996
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Yeah, and they have like an Xbox themed wheelchair.

997
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:32,000
It's one of those things that you really think should have just been in there a long time ago, and then when you hear it wasn't there and they have to add it, you kind of go,

998
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Oh, well, gee, that seems like something they should have done a long time ago, but I suppose...

999
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:51,000
No, I don't really think it is, because if you look at all the other places that use avatars, like hell, your Miis don't have real bodies, let alone actual wheelchairs or anything like that.

1000
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Yeah, but still, representation is awfully nice, so for those gamers...

1001
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Yeah, it's nice that they're doing that, don't get me wrong. I think it's awesome. I just wish the Miis looked better, because they look like shit.

1002
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Alright, fair enough. I guess that's a little harder to argue with.

1003
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Okay, moving on, let's talk about Capcom and Street Fighter V.

1004
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
People are playing Street Fighter V online, but some people are playing with characters they shouldn't be playing with.

1005
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Because apparently, when the cinematic story expansion came out last week, players actually got to see Juri and Urian, who have not been released in the game yet, but they are actually in one of the story mode's chapters.

1006
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So apparently, some folks went in and figured out how to tweak settings and make both these characters playable online, even though they're not out yet.

1007
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I don't know how the hell they did that, but you know what we say on this show, hackers gonna hack. If the data's there, they'll figure out how to get it on.

1008
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:57,000
So anyway, producer of Street Fighter V, Kochi Sugiyama, actually went on Twitch as part of Capcom's regular stream that they do there.

1009
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
They actually said that they've seen the videos on how to make the characters playable in online play.

1010
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,000
So when you put this stuff on YouTube, how to do it, good chance is the people behind the game will actually see it too.

1011
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So they have a good understanding of how to see who's been using them, because the technique is out there for everybody to see, they know how they're doing it and how to figure out who you are.

1012
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Don't punish the people doing it, just fix the fucking problem.

1013
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Well, they do say that anyone who they know is using the characters will be dealt with strictly.

1014
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
They also talked about a glitch that gives Ibuki some frames of invulnerability after landing from a particular type of air throw.

1015
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
They are saying that's unintended and will be patched out, but nobody will be banned over that.

1016
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Just fix the shit.

1017
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I always say like, oh you found a bug in our game and we're gonna ban you.

1018
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It kinda blows my mind that all the data was there for them to be able to play online in the first place, but at the same time I also realized they had to get story mode out ASAP,

1019
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:08,000
because, you know, releasing Street Fighter without the single player story mode was a little, you know, they got razzed for that before, so, I don't know.

1020
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Kaijuto in chat says, what are they gonna do to them? Tiger uppercut them? They might, they just might.

1021
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Although I don't think Sagat is in Street Fighter 5, right? I don't think he's there.

1022
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I could be wrong, but I don't think so.

1023
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Anyway, DarkSagra, what do you have for us?

1024
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
A good story about Pokemon Go. A very good one.

1025
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Apparently it is having a positive effect on the player's mental health for one very big reason.

1026
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:49,000
You know why that is? They're going outside. They're being in the world. They're getting sunshine, which, I mean, sunshine, first of all, that's vitamin D.

1027
01:25:49,000 --> 01:26:06,000
It helps give you energy and keeps you healthy, but people are actually going out and experiencing the world and interacting with other people and just walking and generally feeling better, which is having a very positive effect on their mental health.

1028
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:23,000
It's helping people who, you know, have been sort of shutting themselves off due to other, you know, mental health issues have more incentive to go out and do things and really having a very positive effect, so, good.

1029
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, in regards to being out in the sun, it also burns.

1030
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
That's true.

1031
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
You know what? Some people will turn to ash when they let the sunlight hit them.

1032
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Ash, alright. Ash, catch them.

1033
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Fuck off.

1034
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Let's see. Alan Alchemy in chat says, not like your cliched basement dweller, though I'm sure they're going outside more too.

1035
01:26:50,000 --> 01:27:03,000
No, all jokes and that stuff aside, it's really cool. And, you know, part of why I said this is like a cultural phenomenon of sorts is that it's really cool that this is having this kind of impact on people that, you know, can really nurture positive change in people's lives.

1036
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:13,000
You know, I met a girl who said, yeah, I'm going to lose, you know, she's a bigger gal, and she said to me, she said, I'm going to lose 100 pounds and it's going to be because of this game.

1037
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:21,000
She said, I'm walking more, I'm doing this stuff. She's like, I'm so motivated to go out and catch Pokémon, so I'm going to lose 100 pounds, it's going to be because of this game.

1038
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
So, we'll see.

1039
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Let's see. S2100 Matt says, I went on a hike near a waterfall this weekend and met a couple playing Pokémon Go also.

1040
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Yep, they're everywhere. Brad from Pod Culture says, it does if you're a ginger. I got near a 100 watt light bulb, I get a sunburn.

1041
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I know those feels, bro. I also am a ginger, and so, yeah, I can't be out in the sun very long or I start to feel really, ugh.

1042
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
That's why you play at night.

1043
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Well, and the summer this week has been very, very tolerable, especially considering we live in Satan's Taint with temperatures sometimes.

1044
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Like, okay, we're not Arizona bad, but, love you guys in Arizona, but we're not that hot bad.

1045
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Would they be like Satan's asshole?

1046
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It gets pretty fucking hot here, but it's actually been pretty merciful this week, so like when we went outside on Saturday it was probably only 80 degrees, so I felt fine.

1047
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I just wore a hat, and so, you know, I got a little pink on my neck because gingers, we don't tan, we just burn, so I got a little pink on my neck, but that's about it.

1048
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:30,000
So, alright. Fifth Dream, kind of following that up in chat, says, I would like Pokemon Go in the autumn, winter. Fuck Pokemon hunting in this heat.

1049
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Kaijuto says, I'm in New York City, my local news just ran a story on Pokemon Go. The NYPD put out a don't text and drive poster with Squirtle on it.

1050
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Yeah, I'm hearing that local, you know, and there's-

1051
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I'm not texting, I'm fucking catching Pokemon.

1052
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I'm not texting, officer. I was throwing balls.

1053
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:57,000
You've probably seen these pictures floating around Facebook and stuff, too, of the businesses that have signs that say, you know, Pokemon is for paying customers only,

1054
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:07,000
because I guess people, to catch certain Pokemon, would go inside the store, even though, again, my ingress experience tells me that you don't need to be standing right on top of the freaking portal to capture it,

1055
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
unless they used four axes and you need to ultra strike it, but Jarvis, that son of a bitch, in a nutshell-

1056
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I don't understand either, because you can, like, just, from my driving experience, if you see it on the screen, or even if you turn the screen, you can just tap that shit,

1057
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:29,000
and it's like, whoop, there it is. I mean, you don't need to, like, walk right up to it, you just tap it and, oh, hey, look, I can attack it from a mile away.

1058
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I mean, I don't understand why people are going places.

1059
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah, apparently-

1060
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Getting out of your car, what?

1061
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:43,000
And people are talking about productivity, too. In fact, speaking of Travis, who I name checked earlier in the show, he posted some update where he said,

1062
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I had to tell my employees to stop playing Pokemon Go, and I was like, you're no fun, Dad!

1063
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Because how else do you respond to Travis?

1064
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Let's see, Stoppy in chat says, police chew catches you when you text and drive.

1065
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I like that, you should do posters, Stoppy.

1066
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Alan Alchemy says, yeah, I don't get that because the range is pretty large. They should be no reason why five feet inside a business would make a difference.

1067
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
You know what's also funny? Just kind of, like, talking about the differences between Ingress and, like, Pokemon Go.

1068
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Ingress is like a game, like, you don't want people knowing that you're playing it, because you're, like, being all sneaky and stuff and doing that.

1069
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And in Pokemon Go, like, everybody's just like, hey, hey, hi, hi, you know, it's like, you're just hiding your phone.

1070
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I'm not doing anything.

1071
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I don't want the other team to know.

1072
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I don't want them to know my license plate and follow me home, because that sick shit has happened in Ingress, but I won't go there.

1073
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Anyway, that's why I'm actually kind of glad Pokemon Go isn't as competitive, because competition will bring out the really gross side of some people.

1074
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And I've seen that in the other game, and it's not fun.

1075
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
It's also three teams, which has divided everybody.

1076
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Yeah, right? Well, let's be, Dark Soccer had the best meme about that whole thing, is that, you know, because we're all Team Mystic, for the record.

1077
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
We're all on the blue team, just so y'all know. But Dark Soccer, what was that meme you had?

1078
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
It had, like, a, I found the home bases of the other teams, and it was, like, a red and a yellow garbage can or something.

1079
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yeah, it was, like, a red trash can and a yellow recycle bin.

1080
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Love it. But that, look, a little smack talking is okay.

1081
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,000
A little smack talking is okay, but that's as far as we're gonna take it.

1082
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
You can throw shade along with those balls.

1083
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
That's right, that's right. We know how to throw a little shade with our balls here on Team Mystic.

1084
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Alright, Loki, what do you have for us before we get to the mailbag soon here?

1085
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Speaking of Pokemon Go, Niantic has made comments regarding the whole server problem, saying that, you know, they are holding off on releasing it in other regions, because of server issues.

1086
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Now, it has launched in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, but they are holding back on other locations until they figure out what the fuck is going on with their shit.

1087
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So, yeah, they've been, the thing's been freezing, the app's been crashing, like, fucking crazy. Like, if it just goes into, like, sleep mode, it's like, oh, yeah, I'm fucked.

1088
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So, yeah, I really feel for my friends in the UK that can't get in the game yet, I feel for you guys, but I just need you to understand, we can't have you in the game right now, the servers are bad enough.

1089
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:34,000
And by the time you're in, everything will be better, and all these, you're gonna be like, what was Loki so angry about, because this game is so much better than what he was saying.

1090
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Yeah, because it's a little rough right now out there, so, you get your Pokemon soon, don't worry, you guys.

1091
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Don't worry, if you want your Pokemon fixed, you wanna get in on all that, Ingress, there's no lag in Ingress, it's free, play it, learn where all your portals are.

1092
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Yeah, spend some time in Ingress and you're gonna learn where all the stops are, because that's the one advantage us old school, you know, AR gamers have.

1093
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
We know where all that shit is.

1094
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:12,000
So, including some of the more obscure stuff, because, like, Shane was like, where are we gonna be able to find a gym that isn't taken anywhere, and I was like, there's a cemetery up in the town of El Dorado, I bet nobody's gone to.

1095
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Damn it.

1096
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Shit, I just said it on my show, god damn it. No, I'll find another.

1097
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Speaking of Ingress, I'm actually coming up on some of my portals that I've had for a while, you know, they're actually starting to tick further than my last one.

1098
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Oh, are you waiting for the other team to come on day 89 and have a party and sweep them all? Is that what you're waiting for?

1099
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I don't think they will, because it involves walking, and I don't know if they're going to, and even if they get that one, I have six more behind a fence that's not gonna open up until October, so I'm still good.

1100
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And you probably shouldn't say that here on this program, but we'll see.

1101
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And no one gives a shit.

1102
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
No one gives a shit.

1103
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I don't know, we've met some crazies, Loki, probably haven't met as many as I have.

1104
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Alright, moving on, let's, or was that it, or was there, didn't you want to say something about this whole tip?

1105
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, also, there's another tip, if you don't want to choose one of the three, start your Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

1106
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Because basically, it allows you to catch one of the three, and if you don't want to pick one of them, what you can do is say, fuck y'all, I'm walking away.

1107
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I'm leaving, yes, so, in the game, it starts off, you can choose between a Charmander, a Bulbasaur, or a Squirrel.

1108
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
If you walk far enough away, they'll keep kind of following you, it'll keep reappearing.

1109
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
But eventually, Pikachu will appear, and you can choose Pikachu.

1110
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Honestly, I don't know why you would want to, because Pikachu is very common, and the other ones I haven't seen at all, so, you know, I would choose one of the other ones who gives a shit, you'll get Pikachu eventually.

1111
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Yeah, I know, I'm like, if you want a Pikachu, just come to Studio N7, because they keep spawning here.

1112
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Again, I'm not fucking complaining, we even got, apparently there's a Raichu nearby, too, so, I'm not worried about that.

1113
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
And that's gonna be mine.

1114
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Darusaka's gonna get in her car.

1115
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I love Raichu.

1116
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
All right.

1117
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I've already enlisted you for guard duty.

1118
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:09,000
What are some other little tips you guys have learned? I've noticed this is very popular clickbait on Facebook right now, is 12 things about Pokemon Go that you don't know.

1119
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
What are some tips that you guys have learned about Pokemon Go?

1120
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Turn the AR off.

1121
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Turn the AR off.

1122
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Sometimes the AR is funny.

1123
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:28,000
It'll save your, well, that's fine, but, like, once you do it a couple times, and you're like, okay, cool, just turn it off, it makes it way easier to catch things, it also makes it, like, a lot easier to not have your battery drained to nothing.

1124
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Because this game will drain your battery to nothing really quickly.

1125
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:43,000
If you're playing in a car, just know that the GPS is fucking like this shit, because their app is just, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with it.

1126
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
But it is, oh, speaking, hey, look at that, there's a fucking Pikachu.

1127
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Surprise.

1128
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Darusaka's getting on her phone.

1129
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Don't judge me.

1130
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
But, yeah, so the, the, do you want to get a picture of Pikachu on the table and send it to the OLR Twitter?

1131
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It's gonna be on my, it's gonna be on my computer while I'm looking at Pokemon Go stuff.

1132
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I was gonna say, the GPS is lagged, like, I found that, like, I have to, like, I see the landmark, I'm driving past it, have to count, like, a few seconds, and then spin it, and it goes.

1133
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
So, yeah.

1134
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I would say the tip that I have for people is don't forget about the eggs, because the game doesn't say anything about the eggs.

1135
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
So, the minute you go to a Pokestop and you see that you hack a little Yoshi looking egg.

1136
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Someone's put a little lure on you when your Pokestop's there.

1137
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,000
If, if it's the certain player name I've seen before, I think that person lives right across the street.

1138
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Anyway, isn't that creepy that I know that? Ingress has taught me how to be a creeper. Anyway, um.

1139
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I don't know, oh.

1140
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Don't, don't say it on air, don't say it on air.

1141
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I like the name though.

1142
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Wait, now I gotta look. Hold on, show me your phone.

1143
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Oh, no, Ashley, that's a new name.

1144
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
A peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-tew.

1145
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
A person named Wiener15.

1146
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Um.

1147
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Peek-a-pee.

1148
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Wienerdog.

1149
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Uh, what was I gonna say about, oh, the eggs.

1150
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:12,000
The minute you hack an egg, go into your Pokemon screen, swipe to the right, and put that egg in an incubator.

1151
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,000
You can buy more incubators on the store if you want, or I think you get an incubator when you hit level 10.

1152
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
You get one in the beginning.

1153
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Yeah, you do, you do have an infinite use one in the beginning.

1154
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,000
And then I got another one like at five, or five or six at five.

1155
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,000
But my point is, incubate that egg, because when the egg hatches, you'll probably get a new Pokemon.

1156
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,000
But even if you get something like a Pidgey or a Rattata or something that's everywhere, you get a ton of candy.

1157
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
You get way more candy than you get when you catch them.

1158
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And that can really help in evolving and upgrading the Pokemon.

1159
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And then the other little quick tip I'd throw in there as well, don't forget to collect your defender bonus.

1160
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:56,000
And since right now it's like fucking impossible to hold gyms, I would just say the minute you control a gym, get your defender bonus.

1161
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Because you get 500 Stardust and 10, it's not a lot, but it adds up, 10 of the gold coin currency that is like the premium currency that you can spend in the store.

1162
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Not $10, 10, which I think 100 costs 99 cents, like 10 cents basically.

1163
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:21,000
But that adds up. If there's like a cluster of three gyms downtown and you can take them every day, then catch that defender bonus and get your...

1164
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
In the beta you could have up to 10 in the defender bonus that you claim every day.

1165
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I kind of don't think you're going to be able to hold 10 gyms, but if you want to prove me wrong and get your free dollar and Poke currency every day, you can do it.

1166
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Go for it.

1167
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
All right. Any tips that you've come across Dark Soccer that you would want to throw out there for people?

1168
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Whip it out in the bathroom. You never know what you'll get.

1169
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Moving on. Talking about Play Anywhere. You remember when this was announced to E3 this year?

1170
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Microsoft talked about Play Anywhere saying that every new title coming out on Xbox One will be shared between Xbox One and Windows 10.

1171
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Well, Microsoft kind of changed that a little bit this week. It's not every new title.

1172
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:16,000
You see, it was every title that was at E3 by Microsoft Studios is going to be a part of this.

1173
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
But at least we have confirmed for this list.

1174
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Gears of War 4, Forza Horizon 3, ReCore, Sea of Thieves, Halo Wars 2, Scalebound, Killer Instinct Season 3, State of Decay 2, Ark Survival Evolved, Cuphead, We Happy Few, and Crackdown 3.

1175
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Those games are confirmed will be part of Play Anywhere, but not every game is necessarily confirmed.

1176
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
But those are some big ones. Forza Horizon.

1177
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Crackdown 3 and PC.

1178
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Yeah, right?

1179
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
That could be fun.

1180
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Sounds like fun.

1181
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I'm excited.

1182
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
All right, let's take a moment to go to our mailbag.

1183
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Every week you guys email us.

1184
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to actually send us an email.

1185
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Again, that's Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1186
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Dark Soccer dives into the mailbag every week head first and pulls out some of our favorite emails to read here on air.

1187
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Squish, squish.

1188
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Hey OLR Crew, AZHP here.

1189
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Just wanted to chime in since you were all confused as to why Apple no longer releases things the day they announce them and why it would also be difficult to release a game console the day of an announcement.

1190
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,000
The FCC requires all devices with a wireless antenna be submitted to certification before it can be sold.

1191
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:40,000
These submissions for certification take time and are public record, meaning people can find out about unannounced products by watching the certification list.

1192
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Sorry, certification list.

1193
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:49,000
This is the reason why manufacturers announce the devices ahead of their release because it would be spoiled by an FCC listing otherwise.

1194
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Hope this clears things up.

1195
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Keep up the great work. You're truly AZHP.

1196
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
You know, I didn't think about the wireless thing. That's a really good FYI.

1197
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:05,000
You know, we see things about, we even have stories on this show about patent leaks and trademark names and rating board leaks.

1198
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
So all these sorts of certifications tend to leak things.

1199
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I just think, I still, you know, the wireless thing makes a lot of sense, don't get me wrong.

1200
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:20,000
But I still think it's just because of the internet, we live in a day and age where something like the Sega Saturn just ain't ever going to happen again.

1201
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
So, but you're right.

1202
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
People aren't looking for it.

1203
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:30,000
You're right. I did ask last week about, well, didn't Apple used to do that at one point and now things are delayed a little bit even though they get them out really fast?

1204
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
But that makes an awful lot of sense what AZHP says in the email.

1205
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
So, cool.

1206
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Last email?

1207
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Last email.

1208
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:44,000
It's needlessly pedantic, but I don't care for the use of 8-bit to mean blocky.

1209
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:50,000
There's no way an NES or Master System could have ever produced anything even remotely resembling Minecraft.

1210
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And the story cutscenes of Five Nights at Freddy's reminds me of more of Atari 2600 graphics.

1211
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,000
A console which I believe, despite never advertised as such, is referred to as a 4-bit system.

1212
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Come to think of it, nobody ever refers to blank bit before 8 or after 64, maybe 128.

1213
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,000
What exactly does blank bit mean in this context?

1214
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
How many bits is, say, the PlayStation 4? Thanks.

1215
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I don't know a lot. I'm not as technical-minded as, say, Bobby Blackwolf or Loki or somebody.

1216
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,000
But my understanding is 8 bits is in the chip.

1217
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Every value can be a certain length and it literally means 8 bits.

1218
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:41,000
So it can be like a number between, what, 2 to the power of 8 would be a number between 0 and 256, right?

1219
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So the words, so to speak, in the programming code are that long and that's limited in the NES, the 8-bit.

1220
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I believe the Atari 2600 is technically also an 8-bit console.

1221
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Some people call it 4-bit. It's not. It's 8-bit.

1222
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And the thing that might surprise you, PlayStation 4, you ask how many bits is that?

1223
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And most people will refer to the generations of video game consoles to say,

1224
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:13,000
So it's, you know, NES was 8-bit, Super Nintendo was 16-bit, then the Nintendo 64 was 64-bit,

1225
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
and then the PlayStation 2 was 128-bit.

1226
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Actually, no. This might surprise you, but my understanding is the PlayStation 4 is also 64-bits.

1227
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
It has not gone up from 64-bit.

1228
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Chips are out there that go higher, but 64-bit is kind of the standard,

1229
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
and the analogy for this would be your Windows operating system.

1230
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,000
You hear a lot about 64-bit mode versus 32-bit mode, right?

1231
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
So 64 is kind of the, again, maybe somebody tech-minded,

1232
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,000
because I'm giving you a really, like, what I've collected from articles I've read over the years,

1233
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
but 64 is essentially as high as most mainstream things go right now.

1234
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
In the end, it's also really irrelevant these days anyway.

1235
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:04,000
There's no real call for it, because what people look more for is actual raw processing power

1236
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:11,000
when it comes to a system now, so it's really just fallen into the way of irrelevancy.

1237
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Dungeonbuster, of course, our chat room jumping in here, too.

1238
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

1239
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Bit in Sky's context refers to the code instruction length.

1240
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
More bits enables more complex instructions.

1241
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
That's the TLDR explanation for it.

1242
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I like TLDR explanations. I think they're easier to understand.

1243
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
So, cool.

1244
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I apologize. I think there was another question buried in that email

1245
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:40,000
besides just what does bit mean and what is the PlayStation 4?

1246
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
How many bits are we at now?

1247
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Was there another question in there that I missed?

1248
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I don't think so.

1249
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I don't think so either.

1250
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,000
How many came next? We don't really use it.

1251
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Yeah, I think you can read stuff about, I think it goes as high as 512 bits,

1252
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
but I don't think anything practical out there really uses that.

1253
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:07,000
That's expensive, yo.

1254
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,000
But I do understand the whole Minecraft would have never been possible on the NES.

1255
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I think it's just the graphical style.

1256
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I think just the pop culture words that are on people's tongue for a lot of people,

1257
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
retro and 8-bit are like the same thing for a lot of people,

1258
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
even though technically that may not necessarily be true.

1259
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
That's all.

1260
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Good email, though. Good discussion.

1261
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
All right. Well, if that's it for the emails, I'll beg for some more.

1262
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.

1263
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And Stopby and Chat with a good point. Don't test them.

1264
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
They just got Cave Story to work on the Genesis.

1265
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
D-Makes can be a lot of fun, though.

1266
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Remember Halo 2600, anybody?

1267
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
D-Makes can be an awful lot of fun.

1268
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:00,000
All right. Let's get to the FUs of the week, because sometimes on this show we have to get ranty.

1269
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I've got a list.

1270
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
FU to racist assholes.

1271
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,000
FU to people defending murderers.

1272
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,000
FU to all of the weird, I guess, injuries I've amassed over the past week

1273
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:41,000
and having to get them all taken care of over the course of this month and pain in general.

1274
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And, yeah, it's just been a shitty week ready for something, you know,

1275
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
ready for something a little nice to happen instead.

1276
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I'm done.

1277
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I guess, just after you two not having access to my TV because my damn wife is watching stupid Grey's Anatomy all over again.

1278
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,000
It's also fucking distracting, because anything that's on TV, whether it be my stupid kids,

1279
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,000
not to say my kids are stupid, but their stupid shows that they watch,

1280
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,000
or Grey's Anatomy, or just whatever is on TV.

1281
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I'm, I guess, predisposed to watch what's on TV, even if it's fucking uninteresting.

1282
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And I hate that, because I want to work on programming games and stuff, and my brain's like,

1283
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Shiny! Watch TV! And it's fucking annoying.

1284
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I guess I go to the other room.

1285
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,000
But then when I go to the other room, I just end up playing fucking Tap My Katamari, so that doesn't work either.

1286
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Alright, my FU of the week goes to the restaurant where we had dinner last night,

1287
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,000
because I had reservations for 7.30, but thanks to the front door person,

1288
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I guess not really being able to effectively communicate with me,

1289
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
she did not realize that I was telling her our whole party was here, even though she had said to me,

1290
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
it'll be just a few minutes, there's a couple tables in front of you.

1291
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Thirty minutes later, finally, one of the other gals comes out and says,

1292
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Oh, you guys weren't checked in. You guys are all here? Yes.

1293
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,000
And so, yeah, that was unfortunate that even with the reservation, we still ended up waiting a good 45 minutes,

1294
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
but the food was still really, really good, and yeah.

1295
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
The manager hooked us up with some freebies, so that's always nice when they realize they screw up.

1296
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Free flan?

1297
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,000
No, no free flan at this place. It was free appetizers.

1298
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:40,000
So, I'll take it. I like food. Otherwise, FU to the fact that I drank a lot this weekend.

1299
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I went out with Grandpa last night, that's all you need to know.

1300
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
That boy likes to drink, if you never heard Hoard House back in its heyday.

1301
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the Skype line,

1302
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Loki.

1303
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
So this is kind of a neat little incentive, but apparently,

1304
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Ubisoft will give you the full version of Trials of the Blood Dragon,

1305
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
if you're very good at Trials of the Blood Dragon.

1306
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And the way you prove this is by playing the demo.

1307
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
And if you play the demo and complete the demo with less than 15 faults,

1308
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
you get the game for free.

1309
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
And of course, it's going to be on the PC version.

1310
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
They don't have that working yet on any other version of the game,

1311
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
but PC version, though, if you download it and complete it,

1312
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
then you get the free version of the game.

1313
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
It's alright.

1314
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I mean, if you're a fan of Trials, you might as well try it.

1315
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
But I already bought it, so, you know.

1316
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
So that's it.

1317
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Alright. So you already bought it, so no freebie for you, huh?

1318
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Well, I bought it on PlayStation 4, like when it first came out,

1319
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
and then I tried it and it was like, okay, and I kind of got bored of it.

1320
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I'll play it again later.

1321
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
What I need to do is buy Trackmania.

1322
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
That's what I should really do because that game is pretty fun.

1323
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Well, you know what we like to do on this show is judge Konami

1324
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
about all the freaking pachinko machines that they make

1325
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
because it seems like that's their only business now

1326
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
is making pachinko machines of all your favorite 8-bit, ha ha,

1327
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
video game franchises such as Castlevania and Metal Gear and so on.

1328
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Well, there may be another publisher that we're going to have to start teasing pretty soon,

1329
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
and that is Squeenix.

1330
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
That's right, Square Enix, apparently getting into the pachinko business.

1331
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:43,000
There's a leaflet going around in Japan that shows that the Star Ocean series

1332
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,000
and Lord of Vermillion are going to be the first pachinko machines that are out there.

1333
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
I don't care, and the reason why is because they're still making games.

1334
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Fuck, if you want to make games, you want to make pachinko slot machines,

1335
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
by all means, go right ahead and do that.

1336
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
It's when you say, fuck you guys, we're not making games anymore,

1337
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
we're just going to make pachinko slot machines, and I have a problem.

1338
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Now, apparently Square Enix actually did kind of follow up some of this story

1339
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:12,000
going around saying that, well, actually we're not officially entering the pachii slot business.

1340
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Let's see, in the document it was stated that Square Enix is entering the business,

1341
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
but that's not a fact.

1342
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Again, we used the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy logos without permission,

1343
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
which resulted in a misunderstanding from our company and our services,

1344
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:31,000
so I guess that was the company that sent out the original brochure or whatever,

1345
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:36,000
but it does seem like Lord of Vermillion is going to end up being a machine.

1346
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I just feel like Square Enix is probably trying to distance themselves from it a little bit.

1347
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Probably what Loki says, they've still got another bread and butter here,

1348
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,000
so if they're just licensing this out to somebody else to make a machine, then whatever, right?

1349
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:55,000
It's like how they have Price is Right and Wheel of Fortune slot machines everywhere in Reno and Vegas.

1350
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Those shows are still on, right?

1351
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:03,000
All right. Well, believe it or not, that is the last story that we have on our show roll tonight.

1352
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I need to get our Skype line open. I don't even have Skype open yet. I need to get on that.

1353
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:12,000
But shortly here you will be able to call us at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1354
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,000
We also do have the old school phone number as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1355
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Of course, my Skype is not coming up right away here. I forgot to launch it during the break, and I usually do.

1356
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Do we have any last minute stories while I get this up and running?

1357
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
One thing we haven't talked about, because I don't know how many people are interested or know about it,

1358
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:37,000
but apparently there is a whole Counter-Strike GO gambling scene with skins and everything.

1359
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Yeah, I heard a little bit about this.

1360
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:44,000
With that, there's a few websites that kind of facilitate that.

1361
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:54,000
One of those being CSGO Lotto, and apparently it was owned by some YouTubers who didn't make any mention that they owned it,

1362
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,000
and were kind of saying, hey, look at this cool site we found, and look at all this money that we're winning off of it.

1363
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,000
And so they didn't disclose that, and they were trying to get people to go to it.

1364
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:11,000
They're actually the owners of the actual website, so there's that kind of drama.

1365
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:18,000
And so now, because of that, they've been kind of called out on by H3H3 and a lot of other people.

1366
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Losing trust with your viewers is really not something you want to do on YouTube.

1367
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Remember what happened with the Fine Brothers a few months ago with that whole mess about the whole Let's...

1368
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Not Let's Play, but Kids React or whatever it was. The word React. Yeah, yeah.

1369
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Yeah, so that sucks.

1370
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Well, our Skype is up and running, and some folks have figured that out because we are getting calls here right now.

1371
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Hi, you're on Orange Hospital. Who's this?

1372
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
It's Trainer Rama. How is everyone tonight?

1373
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Great, Rama. How are you doing? How's Pokémon GO going for you?

1374
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:56,000
It's going pretty well. I'm actually considering to buy an external, you know, a protection case for my phone with a built-in battery.

1375
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Even though I already walk around with the extra battery pack and a charger.

1376
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,000
I'm sorry. I'm just laughing my ass off because, again and again, here I am, that old man sitting back on the chair going,

1377
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Yep, I was there for Ingress, and I ended up buying two external batteries.

1378
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:19,000
We got a battery big enough that Allen and I can both plug into it when we go to the Anomalies events.

1379
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
So when you play the game nonstop for five hours, we have a battery that can charge both of us.

1380
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:29,000
So it's just so funny to hear that now all the Pogo players are like, oh, the struggle, the struggle for battery life.

1381
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Yes, I know that struggle, kid.

1382
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:40,000
See, here's the funny part. On the anime cosplay convention aspect, we've already been walking around with these big old battery packs

1383
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,000
because we want to take pictures and post them all over social media, and now that everybody's jumping on getting these,

1384
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:51,000
we're like, oh, I remember getting this, having this already at this price. I've already had this. Welcome to the club, kid.

1385
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I see. It is a different way, but yeah, I got it.

1386
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Have you picked your team yet?

1387
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Absolutely. We are all team Mystic here in the studio.

1388
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
I'm going to see about getting y'all some patches.

1389
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Oh, that's awesome. Dark Soccer apparently knows somebody that does decals.

1390
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
He ordered them.

1391
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
That's awesome.

1392
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
He didn't make them. He ordered them.

1393
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I'm sure they'll sell the official stuff soon. Niantic does that for Ingress.

1394
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Niantic fucked up not having that stuff already out there day one.

1395
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
The hoodies and everything.

1396
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Look, I'm having a great time with this. Friday night, I walked out of my house.

1397
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I'm like, okay, I'm going to do a quick 30-minute walk around the house, around the neighborhood, and come home.

1398
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:43,000
That turned into a one-hour trek, and I was running into caravans of people going out collecting Pokémon.

1399
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I'm running into little groups of 2, 3, and 4 walking around doing this. Mind you, it's 11 o'clock at night.

1400
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I was amazed by it.

1401
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
One of my Ingress people, or my Ingress hangouts, I should say.

1402
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:04,000
One of my Ingress hangouts just during the taping of the show about 30 minutes ago has posted some pictures.

1403
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:10,000
One of the gals is playing Ingress downtown in one of the parks and sent some pictures from the park.

1404
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
It's swarming with people on a Sunday night.

1405
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I'm looking in this picture. There's easily 30 people in this photograph all staring at their phones.

1406
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Then she sent a picture of what Pokémon GO looks like in-game.

1407
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,000
There's 5 lures going off all at the park at once, and there's just people everywhere.

1408
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Again, when I talk about the whole Pokémon GO as a social phenomenon, this is it.

1409
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Even if you yourself aren't playing, just go to the park on a weeknight, or better yet, on a Saturday as the sun is setting.

1410
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Look at this, what's going on right now.

1411
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
This is why I'm saying this is a social phenomenon.

1412
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
This is new. This is uncharted territory for gaming in a way.

1413
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Yes, I even say that as a long time ago.

1414
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Getting so many people out of their houses.

1415
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
As a long time ago.

1416
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Can you come in and steal their shit?

1417
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Don't be stupid when it comes to leaving your house.

1418
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I got recruited to be part of a team, Mystic Facebook group.

1419
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
They're pointing out, you know, I'm having a meetup here, let's go do a walk.

1420
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I'm seeing a post of, this team is taking over, I need backup.

1421
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
It's just been amazing.

1422
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I'm seeing the memes, and I'm already seeing a couple of people talking like,

1423
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
well if you're this team, we can't be friends anymore, this and that.

1424
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
I'm just like, I'm waiting for someone to come to me and give me shit for being Team Mystic.

1425
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
It doesn't matter, there's no game yet.

1426
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Yeah, the teams kind of don't matter.

1427
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
It's not even like it is in Ingress.

1428
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Like in Ingress, it's like, seriously Shane, if you roll blue in Ingress, I can't help you.

1429
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I cannot help you in this game.

1430
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
There is nothing I can do for you.

1431
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
You can't play this game when you're over at my house if you choose the team.

1432
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
But in Pokemon Go, it's like whatever, do whatever the fuck you want.

1433
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
It's not serious.

1434
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
People are taking it to that level though.

1435
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
That's sad.

1436
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
What's that?

1437
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
People are taking it to that level and it's kind of sad.

1438
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Yeah, and I don't think Pokemon Go is ever going to be constructed to be.

1439
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I think they kind of learned some things from Ingress and some of the darker things that have happened in that game.

1440
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:10,000
And I think they don't want, especially a game that quote unquote is targeted for kids even though we all know it's their parents that are really playing.

1441
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I don't think they want something to kind of go to that level.

1442
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:26,000
But a couple quick things I wanted to mention because you mentioned that story is that I have a buddy that runs a Facebook group about, you know, Pokemon Go started one for our area.

1443
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And there is an event for a Pokey pub crawl Friday or Saturday, I don't know, at some point during the weekend next weekend.

1444
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:41,000
There are currently 850 people who have said yes I'm going on that invite to a pub crawl.

1445
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I just want you to know every year at PAX East they have a Pokey crawl like that Thursday night.

1446
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Oh, it's going to get interesting next year when it rolls around.

1447
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Yeah, seriously.

1448
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:57,000
And then the other funny story I have is that you know Shane Allen and I were all walking around downtown yesterday, and we came across a gym.

1449
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And Shane goes, we should we should take this gym because it just turned yellow and it just has some really low level Pokemon on it let's get it.

1450
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:19,000
And these two people that are sitting on the curb the girl there I shouldn't say girl she was more of like probably a young 20 she looks that up up at us and says, Hey, we just took that and spent time buffing that.

1451
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:36,000
And it was kind of an awkward moment, but it wasn't like serious like she was kind of like laughing. Yeah, she's kind of laughing as she said amateur move you know the if you played ingress that's right if you play ingress you know to shut the fuck up until it's time to strike.

1452
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Fucking amateurs.

1453
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
God damn it Shane didn't you learn anything from ingress.

1454
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:52,000
All joking aside it was just one of those fun funny interactions, and you know what we ended we just said you know what, let's just keep on moving we're not going to waste the time to attack this gym and we didn't we just kept on moving.

1455
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,000
So, which would have never happened in ingress and ingress I would have blew it up anyway.

1456
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I was at a party last night, and like, maybe an hour into I look around, half the people are on their phones playing Pokemon go. Oh yeah, it's crazy.

1457
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Yeah, I mean the people who are not playing Pokemon go I've really got to be irritated by how popular.

1458
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:24,000
That's life you know hey, it happens. Let people have their fun as long as they're not hurting anybody over right.

1459
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Damn right. Anything else you want to share with us tonight Rama.

1460
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Quick thing I caught the whole thing about the whole Blizzard lawsuit thing, something similar is happening in the anime fandom, real story short, guy runs a convention sued a local blogger for bad press pretty much he hated the review of his conventionally suing him over that, and the lawsuit got thrown out because of jurisdiction.

1461
02:00:49,000 --> 02:01:02,000
They actually set up shop in the guy's town, just to counter, just to refile. So knowing Blizzard if they're going to do this, go this way, they're going to probably set up like a set up shop in Germany, just so they can push ahead with this lawsuit.

1462
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Wow.

1463
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Well, you know, Blizzard's not a small company they have the resources to do something like that so we'll see.

1464
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:18,000
All right. All right, my friend I'm gonna let you go so we get some more calls, I'm sure they can hear more about this story you just referenced on anime jam session.

1465
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Yes, they will.

1466
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
All right, awesome. I'm gonna let you go buddy take care.

1467
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
All right, you too.

1468
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Yep. Bye.

1469
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype but the phones ringing ringing ringing so let's get to another call. Hi on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1470
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Hey, it's Toppy. How you guys doing?

1471
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Hey, great, Toppy. Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?

1472
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Hey, I just wanted to compliment Loki because he brought up that story about CSGO betting because that is huge and there is just so much bad shit that's coming out from that. I mean, I can't believe that those guys even did that on their channel.

1473
02:01:49,000 --> 02:02:10,000
What's your perspective on all this and your take? Because I have to admit because I don't follow a lot of YouTube gaming channels and maybe that's just the old man in me which we've heard a lot from tonight and I don't know how I feel about that but the reality is because my heart's always been with podcasting, I've never kind of gone full in on following a lot of these YouTubers.

1474
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:20,000
So I kind of look at it from the outside and I kind of go, well, that does seem really shady but I didn't really see it all go down. So what's happening from your perspective?

1475
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:30,000
From my perspective, I think that it's really a couple of guys who have gone totally out of touch with reality which seems to happen a lot with these big YouTubers and he really just wanted to take advantage of his community.

1476
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I mean, lead them to this horrible gambling site that he owns that we don't know the full story of it but some people are saying that these bets were rigged in the favor that a lot of people would lose and then these guys could just win anytime that they want.

1477
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:54,000
We don't know if that's true yet but it seems to be the case that it's leading in that direction but so far no concrete evidence. But even then, I mean, they know who their audience is.

1478
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:05,000
You could watch those videos where, you know, the infamous video where he's talking about, hey guys, I just found this new site where you could bet on these cool skins and all this other stuff and you could tell he is not talking to adults there.

1479
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:16,000
He knows that his channel is marketed towards kids and he's telling kids to go to a gambling site because it's so cool and you can make so many thousands of dollars. It's just really, really scummy stuff.

1480
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
How is that legal though? Is the site hosted not in the U.S. or something?

1481
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Well, no, because it's with skins and the skins don't have monetary value but on Valve, on Steam, you can sell them for people to sign them on.

1482
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Loki has it right. But yeah, apparently the skins, you can kind of think of them as poker chips kind of. So they're not dealing directly with money but they are worth money.

1483
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:55,000
At least as I understand it, I didn't even know that this was a thing before it popped up in the news but you can take those skins and apparently go to another site where you can exchange it for, I think it translates almost directly into Steam credit.

1484
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:06,000
So if you have a $400 skin, you could trade it for $400 in games and then sell off the game keys and then you take a little bit of a hit on that but you could walk away with $300 right there.

1485
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:12,000
There's different ways that you can actually sell this or just find somebody who will pay you $400 for a skin.

1486
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Wow. Okay, so now I understand a little more of the science behind it but you said something that I think is a very, very valid point and that some of these YouTubers kind of get lost in their own fame, basically.

1487
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:38,000
And I say this a lot about people who do Twitch for a living and who do YouTube for a living and congrats. Sometimes you get very lucky in getting those breaks and so forth.

1488
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:52,000
But I always kind of say, you know, the internet gave it to you, the internet can take it away. So, you know, trust is so important with a lot of these and I think these guys are kind of hosed with this whole thing coming out and probably rightfully so it sounds like.

1489
02:04:52,000 --> 02:05:04,000
And I don't know all the facts, but it definitely sounds like these guys are pretty hosed and you got to wonder like, you know, when you're making your living off of Twitch or YouTube, are you thinking about things like retirement?

1490
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:22,000
And the serious fact that these things don't last forever. Now, most of the people that I think are getting into Twitch and YouTube, they're probably in their low 20s anyway where, shit, the job I had in my low 20s in the beginning, I didn't really save or plan well either.

1491
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:33,000
So it's not like all hope is lost forever. But as the years go on, you know, you got to kind of wonder, are people that are getting into this, are they planning for the future and what they're going to do when it's all over?

1492
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:47,000
You know, Dark Soccer and I love to, on this show, get on tangents about drag queens. But I bring that up for an appropriate reason because, you know, drag is very popular right now thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race and these queens that go on the show.

1493
02:05:47,000 --> 02:06:01,000
They make a lot of money doing shows and all that stuff. But Michelle Visage, one of the judges on the show, you know, I saw, I listened to a podcast that she was on and she was kind of talking about that she tells them all the time, this will all go away someday.

1494
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Your fame will not last forever in this. You need to think about every dollar you make. You need to save 75 cents or 50 cents. You need to put money away so that you can ride this out when it's gone.

1495
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Yeah.

1496
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
So it's-

1497
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,000
That drag body doesn't last forever. You don't want to be the Joe Pesci of drag queens, you know?

1498
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
But you could be DMed them.

1499
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Now wait a minute.

1500
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Work it while you have it, baby. Work it.

1501
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I feel like that would be my calling card is that I would be the Joe Pesci of drag queens. I'm going to remember that one.

1502
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
You'd be an angry man?

1503
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
That'll be my name.

1504
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:50,000
We always joke, like myself and my coworker, about opening a restaurant chain called Pesci's where we just act like complete assholes to people.

1505
02:06:50,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I thought that really was a chain of restaurants somewhere like in Southern California or something where like the whole deal was to get smack talked by the staff or anything. Anyway, we digress way away from the original topic, but that's what happens here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1506
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Rama does bring us another really good point, kind of bringing it back though. All this talk is quite the reality in the cosplay community.

1507
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:24,000
And that's another community where, you know, you got folks who, you know, get a lot of business from the photo shoots and the celebrity they basically, excuse me, build up online.

1508
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
That goes with any modeling job.

1509
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Of course. You know, one day you're not going to have a six pack anymore. You're going to have a bowling ball. It happens to everybody, you know?

1510
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
And that day could come a lot sooner than you think.

1511
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
That's right.

1512
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:48,000
And the part that really gets to me is, the part that I haven't seen anybody else bring up, is that there's no penalty for these guys on YouTube. Their channels are not at stake or anything.

1513
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:59,000
And that's what really gets to me because pretty much they committed their crimes on their channel, but they have no fear that their channel is going to be locked up or anything. That's a total point that nobody has brought up yet.

1514
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:12,000
And I actually create content on YouTube and whenever you get a content ID strike, whenever you get like that copyright notice or whatever, which I've had some and they've been wrongful and I've fought them and I won.

1515
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:20,000
But every time you get one of those, YouTube sends you the ugliest fucking letter in the world, you know, saying, you know, this is strike one, three strikes, we're going to delete all your stuff.

1516
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:26,000
They send you a terrible letter and this guy, it doesn't seem like he has any of those problems to worry about. They're just sending him a check.

1517
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:34,000
So that's the part that really gets me. At least on YouTube, his channel is not at risk right now and I don't think that's something that anybody else has brought up.

1518
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:44,000
YouTube is so out of control in so many ways, especially when it comes to copyright and all this stuff. I feel like I've been waiting for three years at least for the bubble to burst on YouTube with all this stuff.

1519
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:52,000
And it's just like, you know, it's just, there's not enough. I mean, I keep saying YouTube needs to moderate more. They need to moderate more. I just, I don't think they can.

1520
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:00,000
There's so much content on YouTube. It's impossible to moderate, but they kind of have to, especially some of these big money making channels.

1521
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:09,000
I think any channel that makes above X amount of dollars, a real person's got to look out once in a while to make sure they're not breaking the rules and not rely on some fucking automated system to do it.

1522
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:19,000
I would hope so. I would hope that they could just put one, one rule, one simple rule out there. If you are using your channel to commit a crime, then that's it. Your channel is gone. Zero tolerance. I would hope.

1523
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I don't know. This guy pulls in a lot of water, I guess.

1524
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:32,000
And then YouTube gets to pocket a good portion of that money. So maybe they bend the rules. Who knows? I've been waiting for that YouTube competitor to step up. I haven't seen it yet, but who knows?

1525
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:39,000
I mean, there's, there's been talk that Amazon's been trying something, which you kind of get the sense of with Twitch and we'll see. We'll see.

1526
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
We're gonna have to do it, Rob. RobTube. Let's get it started.

1527
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
RobTube. That sounds too similar to RedTube, but it might be okay with that.

1528
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Oh, shoot. We might be misdirecting our fans.

1529
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Then again, though, you'd probably be inviting the people like that to join your service because, you know, in the name, I mean.

1530
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,000
That's right. We're going to rob you blind. Yeah. I don't have, I don't have the best name for that. I don't know.

1531
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:07,000
TubeGo. Go is really big right now. So maybe, you know, TubeGo. Who knows?

1532
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
PornGo. Porn.

1533
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I think we need to end this phone call and it's totally not your fault, Stoppy. I apologize.

1534
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
No problem at all.

1535
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
All right. Thanks for the call. I appreciate it, buddy.

1536
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Take it easy, guys.

1537
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
All right. You too. Bye bye.

1538
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
I mean, that would be awesome. You can catch wild porn and just by walking around to your park.

1539
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
All right. Any other last minute stories tonight, Logie?

1540
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:37,000
No, but I do need to, I bet, you know, I keep forgetting or remembering like late Saturday each week that they're doing that PlayStation VR demo thing at Best Buy.

1541
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I need to go over there and actually do that.

1542
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
All right.

1543
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:49,000
No, this is not a story, but Kotaku, the evil K, has a headline for...

1544
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Which, to be fair, has gotten a little better over the years once I first read the riot act at them on this program.

1545
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
But they still have some real clickbait headlines.

1546
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Like Pokemon Go could be a death sentence for a black man.

1547
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Oh, yeah. I've heard about that story. That taps into a lot of...

1548
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
That wasn't a Kotaku story, though, was it? I don't think it was.

1549
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:20,000
It was something that was out there on Twitter, which ties into a lot of other issues that are going on in the world right now that I think some of us play video games to escape a lot of that fuckery.

1550
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:28,000
But, I mean, I would think that's not necessarily the case, considering that, you know, it seems like a ton of people are playing, so you're gonna be in a big group of people.

1551
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I'll close on this note without going too much into the controversy that's out there in the world.

1552
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:45,000
It's just the whole fact that there's some really heartwarming stories about how Pokemon Go has brought people together, and it's what the world needs right now.

1553
02:11:46,000 --> 02:12:01,000
It's what we need right now, is to just fucking get along in our common goal of catching little creatures to do our bidding for us in fighting to the death in the honor of our arbitrarily chosen team. Isn't that right?

1554
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Yeah.

1555
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Alright. Anyhow. Any other thoughts here at the end of the show? Any other last minute stories or anything like that? DarkSock, are you doing okay? She's ready to go catch that Raichu if it's still out there.

1556
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
I think it's wandered off by now.

1557
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Ah, I ran away.

1558
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I didn't see it when I checked last time.

1559
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Someone else caught it.

1560
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:29,000
It seems like though it hangs out for a bit, because there was a Golem at the park yesterday, which is Geodude's fully evolved form, right?

1561
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:36,000
And all three of us were able to catch it. Myself, Alan, and Shane. I think it stays around for a little bit so everybody has a chance and then disappears.

1562
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
So, I think they're just on a timer. I don't know.

1563
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Kaijuto in chat says, can't we all just get along and catch Pokemon? I think I agree. Let's just go catch some Pokemon.

1564
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Dungeon Buster says, I was thankful there was some summer games done quick to watch this past week. Me too, my friend. Me too.

1565
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
That's going to bring us to a close of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1566
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,000
And I want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight and participating with the show.

1567
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:12,000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please consider leaving us a five star review on a place like iTunes or Google Podcast or wherever it is that you found this show.

1568
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:19,000
And tell a friend. It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if we're able to actually have those voices heard.

1569
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Let's go right into everybody's final thought. Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

1570
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:29,000
I want Cheesecake or Pinkberry. Or both. And a Raichu.

1571
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Cheesecake flavored Pinkberry.

1572
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
And a Raichu.

1573
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
And cooked Raichu.

1574
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:49,000
My final thought for tonight is, all the angry old man on the lawn chair stuff aside, I think it is so awesome that people are out there moving and that the community is growing and that we're meeting people.

1575
02:13:50,000 --> 02:14:00,000
And I think, you know, again, as kind of referenced in that last little bit there, I think that's what the world needs right now is just, you know, Pokemon and just be safe out there when you're playing the game.

1576
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Don't make bad decisions in the pursuit to catch those Pokemon. Like, don't listen to Loki. Never play the game while you're driving. That's a bad idea.

1577
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:18,000
And just be safe when you're crossing the street, all that stuff. Because we don't want anybody to end up on the news and ruin Pokemon Go for all of us.

1578
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

1579
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I really need to stop playing this stupid game.

1580
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Tap my Katamari?

1581
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:34,000
If it's not one thing, it's another. So, we'll see what game takes over next week.

1582
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:42,000
I do know which game will take over next week because I purchased, since I don't own an Xbox One, and I already have Red Dead Redemption, so that's no big deal.

1583
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:50,000
The other game that came out this week on PlayStation 4 was the PS2 version of The Warriors.

1584
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Oh, I didn't realize that.

1585
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
So, that is a fucking awesome game if you haven't played it yet. So, I purchased that.

1586
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Alright. We'll look forward to hearing more about that next week.

1587
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:05,000
So, have fun this week. Be safe out there catching your Pokemon and playing all the video games out there.

1588
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
For those of you in Japan, enjoy Yo-kai Watch 3 this week.

1589
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:15,000
And all the other games that are playing. Those of you continuing to play Overwatch here in the States, have fun. Don't be a jerk online.

1590
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
We'll see you in 7 days with Episode 650 here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
