00:00.000 --> 00:17.200
This week, Google has announced their entry into the gaming festival circuit, bringing

00:17.200 --> 00:19.760
a venue and date out for Android game developers.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.520
And that's just one tidbit of tonight's news.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.640
Join us for this and the rest of the week's video gaming news, and it all starts right

00:24.640 --> 00:27.520
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.520 --> 00:32.840
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:32.840 --> 00:36.240
and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.240 --> 00:42.720
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 651 for this July the 24th

00:42.720 --> 00:44.440
of 2016.

00:44.440 --> 00:51.000
We are here broadcasting from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, assembled to talk

00:51.000 --> 00:55.440
about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:55.440 --> 01:00.720
Here in studio is myself, Rob Roberts, on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.

01:00.720 --> 01:04.280
Not joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.940
She actually had to bow out, and you'll have to excuse us, we're going to have to kind

01:08.940 --> 01:13.800
of change our flow on the fly tonight because we were planning on her being here, but unfortunately

01:13.800 --> 01:17.280
you guys, if you were listening to last week's show, she had that surgery, right?

01:17.280 --> 01:23.760
I guess it was maybe Monday before the last episode, and something is flared up with it

01:23.760 --> 01:28.560
or something, so she has a lot of pain and she can't drive, so getting over to the studio

01:28.560 --> 01:32.300
does require driving, so sadly she's going to bow out.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.920
She could have come on on Skype or something, but I think she'd rather rest up, and hopefully

01:35.920 --> 01:42.160
she feels better, so send your hearts emotes to her at DarkSakura on Twitter.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
She will be back.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.920
She said she'll be back come hell or high water next week.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.480
Joining us, though, live in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
Hello.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
How are you?

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
I'm fine.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.680
So, we were chatting a little bit before the show, and you said you are living in Bizarro

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
World right now, right?

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
Yes, I am.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
What's going on?

01:56.680 --> 02:05.120
I'm living in Bizarro World because I was playing Pokemon Go, and then on Friday, my

02:05.120 --> 02:11.440
wife, because originally I'd want to take my son out to downtown Sacramento to go play

02:11.440 --> 02:15.600
Pokemon Go because I have a phone for him to play on and he wanted to do that, but then

02:15.600 --> 02:20.840
it became 105 degrees on the weekend, so I was like, eh, no, we'll go to a mall that's

02:20.840 --> 02:22.320
air-conditioned and go play.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.040
That's a good idea.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.140
No, it's not a good idea.

02:26.140 --> 02:31.060
The GPS in malls, they're just, no, it is absolute shit.

02:31.060 --> 02:35.200
It's worse in, I guess, okay, we're going to get Sacramento on y'all for a minute.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.280
It's way worse, from my Ingress experiences, it's way worse in Sunrise Mall than it is

02:39.280 --> 02:40.320
in Arden Mall.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.320
Like Sunrise Mall?

02:41.320 --> 02:42.320
It's in Galleria, yeah.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.320
Oh, interesting.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.320
I've never had a problem in Galleria.

02:44.320 --> 02:49.520
Yeah, Galleria, it was just, I was in the ocean most of the time because, yeah, that's

02:49.520 --> 02:50.740
what happens when you can't.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.440
Because Roosevelt's so close to the ocean.

02:52.440 --> 02:57.480
No, it's because that's what happens when you go to 0-0 on your GPS.

02:57.480 --> 03:02.200
We did end up finding a spot that was nice and, you know, between two PokeStops, it was

03:02.200 --> 03:07.040
in the sun, which I wasn't too happy with, but it was all right, it was air-conditioned

03:07.040 --> 03:08.960
as well, so we played there for a little bit.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.480
But anyways, long story short, yeah, she was not going to let me take him there because

03:12.480 --> 03:14.760
she thought he was going to get kidnapped or something.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.680
Like I couldn't pay attention to playing a phone game and taking him with something in

03:18.680 --> 03:19.680
the mall.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.320
I'm like, this is ridiculous.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.580
We have this hangout for Ingress players who are playing Pokemon Go, and Loki and I are

03:25.580 --> 03:29.600
obviously both in it because we're Ingress players playing Pokemon Go, and you guys actually

03:29.600 --> 03:34.640
were like venting to the chat about this, going, help, does anyone else think this sounds

03:34.640 --> 03:39.040
rational that my wife will not let me take the kid to the mall to play Pokemon Go because

03:39.040 --> 03:40.240
the kid's going to get kidnapped?

03:40.240 --> 03:43.600
And I said, buy a leash.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.240
That's why they make kid leashes.

03:45.240 --> 03:50.760
I mean, he had more trouble, you know, playing in the mall because he was walking around

03:50.760 --> 03:53.200
and like almost running into people because he's not used to that.

03:53.200 --> 03:58.200
Me on the other hand, I can commute to work and like, she's like, I can't catch these.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.320
Oh, sorry.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.520
Spoiler a little bit.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.520
So yeah.

04:01.520 --> 04:07.600
So anyways, Friday she decided to download Pokemon Go on her phone for whatever reason.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.600
Everyone else is doing it.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.600
There must be something about it.

04:09.600 --> 04:16.500
So, um, so she did it and I did one of the mom blogs post about, Oh no, it doesn't matter.

04:16.500 --> 04:21.200
But like it was, you know, so she did that and she's been obsessed with this entire weekend.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.880
Like we've had to make special trips to Sutter street, which is like a nearby, like old town,

04:26.880 --> 04:32.360
the gold Folsom Bay basically has a lot of near the prison, a much safer place to, it

04:32.360 --> 04:36.120
has a lot more, but while we didn't take the child, the child stayed with, you know, the

04:36.120 --> 04:37.120
grandparents.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.160
So she, she wanted to just go down there and to do that.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.760
I'm like, it's a hundred degrees outside.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.080
I'm like, you want to go?

04:43.080 --> 04:44.080
So?

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
Yeah.

04:45.080 --> 04:50.440
She's like, so we can go to like, we at least go to the ice cream store over there and you

04:50.440 --> 04:51.440
get some ice cream.

04:51.440 --> 04:58.680
It is, it is really a tragedy that in 651 episodes of the show, Mrs. Loki, I think she,

04:58.680 --> 05:02.000
she cameoed on some of the earliest episodes before you guys were even married.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
But like, there, there's no, I don't even know if we'll ever get her on again, but she's

05:06.000 --> 05:08.120
so fricking funny.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.280
Like, that's, that's the part that Loki doesn't explain very well.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.600
She is one of the most hilarious people you will ever meet.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
Yeah.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.080
She, we always like when we're driving like home today, like first, like we're going to

05:18.080 --> 05:21.920
the grocery store and she's like, okay, go buy the pokestop first.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.920
You know?

05:22.920 --> 05:27.480
I'm like, all right, now, now did the wife tease you for Ingress?

05:27.480 --> 05:31.720
Cause this is, oh yeah, all the time, all the fucking time.

05:31.720 --> 05:35.880
And like, let's be honest here, like this weekend she's played it more than I have as

05:35.880 --> 05:37.480
far as Pokemon goes.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.900
I mean like, I mean, I guess I took the kid to the mall and so I played a little bit there

05:40.900 --> 05:45.660
and with her, but most of the time I was just kind of sitting there.

05:45.660 --> 05:48.480
But yeah, she's been playing it, you know, most of the time and like we have to make

05:48.480 --> 05:52.160
stops so she can do, and like I have to catch Pokemon for her cause she doesn't know how

05:52.160 --> 05:54.960
to throw the Pokeballs yet and stuff.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.440
And I mean, it's just, I don't know.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.440
She like texted me earlier.

05:59.440 --> 06:04.680
I was like, yeah, we went to the, this park, you know, and did that.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.400
I'm like, okay.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.400
This is Bizarro World.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.400
So in Bizarro World, your wife is playing more video games than you.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.400
And I'm trying to put the kids to bed.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.960
I'm like, can you maybe stop playing that game so we can put the kids to bed right now?

06:18.960 --> 06:22.200
And that's when I was like, what the hell just happened with my life?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.200
What is my life?

06:23.200 --> 06:26.600
Uh, I've got to introduce the chatters cause they're, they're hilarious.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
I'm sorry.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.600
Real quick.

06:28.760 --> 06:34.560
You know, you know how like you do something and it's pretty cool, then your parents start

06:34.560 --> 06:37.160
doing it and it's not so cool anymore.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.160
Yeah.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.160
It's kind of getting that vibe.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.360
I'm like, okay with it.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.220
I can't really think of a lot of things like that.

06:44.220 --> 06:48.080
Maybe when my mom got really into South Park, which yes, is a thing that happened.

06:48.080 --> 06:53.160
My mom loved, like my mom's favorite TV show is South Park and so like, I can't watch it

06:53.160 --> 06:54.160
anymore.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.160
But no, it's all right.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
It's fun.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.160
She's getting into it.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.160
But like, I don't know.

07:00.160 --> 07:04.160
I mean, whatever it is, what it is.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.160
All right.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.160
She's having fun.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.160
I guess.

07:07.160 --> 07:11.360
I got to get to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night

07:11.360 --> 07:16.000
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show turned

07:16.000 --> 07:19.880
11 years old tonight, by the way, happy 11th anniversary, Bobby Black Wolf.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.880
One of the longest running video gaming shows out there.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.240
There's a very small club of shows that are 10 plus years and we're fortunate enough to

07:27.240 --> 07:28.240
be in it.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.560
And Bobby is as well.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.920
And of course we have our chat room.

07:31.920 --> 07:37.960
So if you are listening live here on Sunday night, you can join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.960
And there's a lot of chat here.

07:39.960 --> 07:45.320
Stoppy in chat says, bizarre world for Loki as in everything is happy and not at all frustrating.

07:45.320 --> 07:50.080
No, that's just, yeah, I don't, yeah, it is bizarre world.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.600
No, that's never a thing.

07:52.600 --> 07:57.020
And obviously with all this Pokemon chat, a very kind plug from William Murderface in

07:57.020 --> 08:01.180
chat saying, Sky, I've been listening to the new Pokestop podcast and as usual, you're

08:01.180 --> 08:02.180
doing a great job.

08:02.180 --> 08:03.180
Well, thank you very much.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.500
We're having a lot of fun doing that show.

08:05.500 --> 08:11.540
The fever around Pokemon Go, which I already had a love for AR gaming because of Ingress

08:11.540 --> 08:14.700
has just basically fueled my love for Pokemon in general.

08:14.700 --> 08:18.940
And now I'm getting into the handheld games and Shane is living in bizarro world because

08:18.940 --> 08:21.260
it's like, wait, Rob wants to talk about Pokemon now.

08:21.260 --> 08:24.860
So it's kind of, I guess, a similar thing.

08:24.860 --> 08:25.860
Let's see.

08:25.860 --> 08:30.100
Rob in chat says, I just came back from a big Pokemon Go event here in my city.

08:30.100 --> 08:34.260
Tigerclaw with a question saying, tried to catch some Pokemon this weekend, but don't

08:34.260 --> 08:35.920
have any Pokeballs.

08:35.920 --> 08:38.460
How do you get Pokeballs without going to some stuff?

08:38.460 --> 08:40.860
Do they give you some free ones per week?

08:40.860 --> 08:46.060
You get some when you level up, but, but yeah, I had a problem where I ran a Pokeballs this

08:46.060 --> 08:47.060
weekend as well.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.820
And the problem is like, I go to the, I go to a lot of the Pokestops, but I get like

08:50.820 --> 08:51.820
potions.

08:51.820 --> 08:53.180
I like, I had to dump.

08:53.180 --> 08:56.940
I've been dumping tons of potions and revives cause I have like a hundred of each and I

08:56.940 --> 08:58.220
don't need that shit.

08:58.220 --> 09:02.500
You'll have to find a very dense area of portals, Tigerclaw.

09:02.500 --> 09:09.460
And honestly, some of the best places for that is cemeteries, downtowns, colleges, um,

09:09.460 --> 09:12.020
anything that's going to have a lot of artistic type of landmarks.

09:12.020 --> 09:16.420
So if you have a very artistic part of town, uh, that would be one, uh, you have to find

09:16.420 --> 09:19.080
a portal dense area and just walk around.

09:19.080 --> 09:23.300
Think of it, think of it too as, um, you can hatch eggs while you're doing it.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.480
So you put some eggs in the incubator and you can do that.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.740
And uh, yeah, unfortunately that's one way to do it.

09:27.740 --> 09:31.360
You could spend money and buy them in the shop, but I think that is one of the worst

09:31.360 --> 09:32.360
things to buy in the shop.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.360
I really do.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.360
It is.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.820
And I had to do it though because like I was seriously just sitting there spinning that

09:37.820 --> 09:44.460
shit and getting nothing and, and, and on top of that being the level that we are now,

09:44.460 --> 09:49.700
you get all these like bullshit that happens with the fucking Pokemon, not excluding when

09:49.700 --> 09:51.160
the game is all fucked up.

09:51.160 --> 09:56.940
So like they'll pop out of the fucking shit, like I'll throw down fucking a raspberry and

09:56.940 --> 10:02.380
use it, you know, a great ball to try to catch a fucking low level Pidgey that just won't

10:02.380 --> 10:04.700
fucking stay in the goddamn ball forever.

10:04.700 --> 10:05.700
Yeah.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.940
I saw an article this week that was talking about, cause you know, there's, there's people

10:08.940 --> 10:12.340
out there that want to, want to hate on Pokemon go, but this was, this was pretty fair.

10:12.340 --> 10:15.940
It's talking about the end game struggle, you know, that the game gets a lot harder,

10:15.940 --> 10:20.260
but then, you know, I don't want to repeat myself from Pokestop, but I will just say

10:20.260 --> 10:21.260
this.

10:21.260 --> 10:25.620
Remember that these games are not designed to be beat in two weeks.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.980
This game is supposed to last a very long time.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.820
They don't want you to catch them all in two weeks.

10:29.820 --> 10:35.520
I realized somebody did, if you don't count six of them that nobody has, you know, somebody's

10:35.520 --> 10:39.660
gotten closer than anyone else will say, I realized that news is around there and they

10:39.660 --> 10:42.180
found out the level cap is 40 and all this stuff.

10:42.180 --> 10:45.240
But just remember these games are not meant to beat in two weeks.

10:45.240 --> 10:50.020
And I think if you are trying to beat it that fast, you're going to burn it, you burn yourself

10:50.020 --> 10:51.020
out.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.020
It's just like burning.

10:52.020 --> 10:55.620
That's where half of my Poke balls goes like from this shit or when the game decides, Hey,

10:55.620 --> 10:56.620
guess what?

10:56.620 --> 10:57.620
You're gonna throw curve balls forever.

10:57.620 --> 11:00.460
Now it's like, I didn't like to throw curve ball.

11:00.460 --> 11:04.220
It's an actual, like I've actually purposely done it before, which I still don't understand.

11:04.220 --> 11:07.040
I mean, it's supposed to make it easier to catch them, which is bullshit.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.840
That's like saying, you know, it'd be a whole lot easier for me to throw this baseball with

11:10.840 --> 11:13.120
my left hand blindfolded and backwards.

11:13.120 --> 11:18.160
I mean, that's kind of what they're asking there, but to actually throw a curve ball,

11:18.160 --> 11:19.920
you have to like spin the Poke ball around.

11:19.920 --> 11:24.320
You'll actually draw circles with your finger on the screen and it spins and then you throw

11:24.320 --> 11:25.320
it.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.560
But there's this wonderful glitch that happens, especially when you're using your great balls

11:28.560 --> 11:33.280
or whatever that for whatever fucking reason decides, Hey, it's just going to throw a curve

11:33.280 --> 11:35.800
ball randomly.

11:35.800 --> 11:40.200
Like as if there's some magical force field blocking the fucking Poke balls.

11:40.240 --> 11:44.600
Or as if your phone did like a hiccup because something in the background refreshed and

11:44.600 --> 11:45.960
so it reads the touches wrong.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.560
I kind of think that's what causes it.

11:47.560 --> 11:53.120
But anyway, I will say this, you know, for what it's worth, again, longtime Ingress player,

11:53.120 --> 12:00.460
the current Ingress version that's out there is, if I'm not mistaken, it's 1.104.0.

12:00.460 --> 12:02.560
That's the version number they're on.

12:02.560 --> 12:08.000
They've done 104 updates to Ingress since, when did they go into 1.0?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.320
When did they officially launch it?

12:09.320 --> 12:10.320
About three years ago?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.720
We'll say about three years ago.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.920
It was four years because they did a three year thing at the center.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.400
Yeah, but it was in beta for the earliest stuff.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.720
So I think it's just about three years.

12:18.720 --> 12:25.520
So my point is that, you know, and not every update has been substantial, but like power

12:25.520 --> 12:28.520
cubes were not in the game in the beginning.

12:28.520 --> 12:32.720
They did not have, certainly didn't have like Lawson cubes and some of these other items

12:32.720 --> 12:33.720
that are there now.

12:33.720 --> 12:38.800
Axeshields and stuff, those were not around in the first few versions and the, you know,

12:38.800 --> 12:39.800
portal network grew.

12:39.800 --> 12:44.640
So there's, there's a lot that changed and I really do believe Pokemon Go will get this

12:44.640 --> 12:45.640
as well.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.680
It's just probably going to take them a little time to get the amount of people on the team

12:49.680 --> 12:54.040
that they really need because somehow they underestimated the amount of people that would

12:54.040 --> 12:55.860
want to play Pokemon, but it's a lot.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.400
So I think it'll get better though.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.400
I really do.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.880
Boy, how about that?

13:00.880 --> 13:03.600
Three weeks in a row, we're opening up talking about Pokemon Go.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.960
This is not a lot of news otherwise.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.960
Well, and it really, I mean, it really is the biggest thing in gaming right now.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.360
Anybody who's a gamer, anybody who's not a gamer is playing it.

13:12.360 --> 13:18.800
It's really blowing my mind on just what a big cultural phenomenon this thing is.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.680
But there is something else big going on this weekend I want to talk about here at the top

13:21.680 --> 13:26.680
of the show and that's Comic-Con, which I feel like, especially in the general geek

13:26.680 --> 13:29.660
universe, you know, I know we don't talk a lot about the geek movies and stuff.

13:29.660 --> 13:34.900
We have other shows at VOG Network that do that, but there definitely was a lot of that

13:34.900 --> 13:35.900
news this weekend.

13:35.900 --> 13:36.900
Right?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.500
You saw like the Wonder Woman trailer, which looked hot.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.900
Even the Justice League trailer didn't look that bad.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.860
The Justice League trailer was not bad.

13:43.860 --> 13:47.060
It was a lot better than the last movie.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.060
Yeah, exactly.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.060
It's coming with a secret.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.060
Okay.

13:50.060 --> 13:51.060
Well, it wasn't bad, so it's good.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.060
Let's see.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.060
And then what else?

13:53.060 --> 13:57.740
We know that Brie Larson is now Miss Marvel or Captain Marvel, excuse me.

13:57.740 --> 14:01.140
Well, you know, whatever, but, you know, I'm sure Dark Soccer would have a lot to say

14:01.140 --> 14:02.140
about that.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.780
Brie Larson, a local girl, you know, she's a Sacramento, California native.

14:04.780 --> 14:07.540
So yeah, local connection there.

14:07.540 --> 14:08.540
And let's see.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.540
What else did they announce this weekend?

14:09.540 --> 14:10.540
It seems like there's just a lot.

14:10.540 --> 14:11.540
There's a lot of new.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.500
Oh, the Star Trek is huge.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.500
They have it.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.220
It's called Star Trek Discovery is the name now.

14:16.220 --> 14:17.220
That's huge.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.660
The CBS All Access show.

14:19.660 --> 14:23.180
The new Doctor Strange trailer was pretty cool.

14:23.180 --> 14:24.180
Oh, yeah.

14:24.180 --> 14:29.100
The new, they had another trailer for a lot of Warner stuff.

14:29.100 --> 14:33.760
So another trailer for Suicide Squad, which that looks fantastic.

14:33.760 --> 14:40.800
And then another trailer for the Lego Batman movie, which just looks fucking hilarious

14:40.800 --> 14:43.020
with the origin of Robin in this.

14:43.020 --> 14:48.220
Sorry, I'm just catching up on chat over at live.vognetwork.com and this joke about Pokemon

14:48.220 --> 14:49.220
Go is pretty good.

14:49.220 --> 14:52.060
Kaijuto in chat says, I use the Tinder app a lot.

14:52.060 --> 14:53.620
So my curve swipe is great.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.020
You like that?

14:55.020 --> 14:56.020
That's good.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.820
All these balls just keep going to the left.

14:57.820 --> 14:58.820
Go figure.

14:58.820 --> 15:00.460
Let's see.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.620
Brad from Pod Culture says the Flash and the Arrow trailers were cool.

15:03.620 --> 15:08.420
I know, like, I know a lot of other shows on our network like Pod Culture, Critical

15:08.420 --> 15:11.820
Myth love that CW universe of shows.

15:11.820 --> 15:17.380
So that's the Netflix universe of shows with all the Defenders.

15:17.380 --> 15:21.720
They also had Iron Fist and Luke Cage.

15:21.720 --> 15:27.180
And I know this isn't necessarily comic books, but I do feel like there's a lot of geek crossover

15:27.180 --> 15:28.180
with this.

15:28.180 --> 15:31.940
But you, first thing you said when you walked in here tonight was about Netflix and everybody's

15:31.940 --> 15:33.980
talking about this show, right?

15:33.980 --> 15:34.980
Yes.

15:34.980 --> 15:37.700
So I've been watching, I just started watching Stranger Things.

15:37.700 --> 15:41.660
Well, I should say, I'm not started, I'm halfway through it now.

15:41.660 --> 15:42.860
It's fantastic.

15:42.860 --> 15:43.940
It's absolutely fantastic.

15:43.940 --> 15:46.740
All the good things people are saying about it is absolutely true.

15:46.740 --> 15:48.540
It's well shot.

15:48.540 --> 15:49.820
It's got great music.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.340
It's got a great story.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.340
Great cast.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.420
It's one of the best TV shows I've ever seen.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.980
And it's like it's an 80s throwback.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.980
It's basically like an 80s throwback.

15:57.980 --> 16:00.540
There's a very, a lot of Spielberg, John Carpenter.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.420
Winona Ryder's the star, for fuck's sake.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.180
She's not a, I mean, she's a supporting star.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.180
She's the biggest name.

16:07.180 --> 16:08.180
She's the biggest name.

16:08.180 --> 16:09.180
But yeah, it's fantastic.

16:09.180 --> 16:14.540
I mean, seriously, even just start watching the first episode and as soon as that title

16:14.540 --> 16:18.900
sequence hits, you're just like, fuck yes, I'm watching the rest of this.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.220
That's pretty much it.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.500
It's just like, this is so fucking awesome.

16:22.500 --> 16:26.740
You played that for me and I did get a very Unsolved Mysteries vibe from it.

16:26.740 --> 16:28.860
It's so good.

16:28.860 --> 16:34.660
Any person our age, you hear that Unsolved Mysteries theme and you just like, it's PTSD.

16:34.660 --> 16:38.180
Like you just, I shouldn't make a lie if something's so serious, but you know what I mean?

16:38.180 --> 16:41.980
Like you just, you just suddenly like, oh my God, oh my God, this guy's going to be

16:41.980 --> 16:45.300
on TV and scare the hell out of me and there's going to be some dramatic reenactment that's

16:45.300 --> 16:46.460
going to scare the hell out of me.

16:46.460 --> 16:49.860
But yeah, it's pretty good and I don't know what they're going to do for like a second

16:49.860 --> 16:50.860
season.

16:50.860 --> 16:54.300
I've heard things that I don't know if it's going to be the same since I haven't finished

16:54.300 --> 16:55.300
this one yet.

16:55.300 --> 16:59.700
Um, we don't know like what the end is, but you know, I don't know if they're going to

16:59.700 --> 17:05.140
do this, like it's going to be just a different thing altogether because the way they broke

17:05.140 --> 17:06.820
it out, each episode is a chapter.

17:06.820 --> 17:09.180
So it's like chapter two, blah, blah, blah.

17:09.180 --> 17:11.100
It's very much like a, you know, science fiction book.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.100
So I don't know.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.100
It'd be pretty cool.

17:13.100 --> 17:17.940
Well, so the whole reason I brought up Comic-Con and comics and stuff was to talk about comic

17:17.940 --> 17:24.060
based video games and maybe ones that you've enjoyed because I do kind of feel like a lot

17:24.060 --> 17:26.500
of them have not been so great.

17:26.500 --> 17:31.580
Like it kind of suffers from that movie syndrome too, is that a lot of the stuff they release

17:31.580 --> 17:35.460
is really kind of, I don't know, I don't know.

17:35.460 --> 17:39.020
Marvel Ultimate Alliance kind of recently definitely had its fans, right?

17:39.740 --> 17:41.500
You know, so I'm not saying they're all bad.

17:41.500 --> 17:47.580
I remember, well, see, I, my brain goes to Batman on the NES, but that really was more

17:47.580 --> 17:50.300
of a movie game than it was a comic game.

17:50.300 --> 17:55.540
But Batman on the Commodore 64 back in the day, that was a comic game for sure.

17:55.540 --> 17:59.720
What do you, what do you think, Loki, comic book based video games that you can think

17:59.720 --> 18:00.720
of that were good?

18:00.720 --> 18:02.500
How about you guys in chat over at live.vognetware.com?

18:02.500 --> 18:06.940
Well, I mean, you know, my son and I, we play the Lego Marvel stuff, so those are pretty

18:06.940 --> 18:07.940
good.

18:07.940 --> 18:13.340
And even though I played a little bit of Lego, Lego DC or Lego Batman 2, which is basically

18:13.340 --> 18:17.580
Lego DC, that was all right.

18:17.580 --> 18:21.740
I mean, the Lego universe games are kind of fun, but like even all those, you see all

18:21.740 --> 18:24.300
the little characters and everything, and there's like a bunch of characters since I

18:24.300 --> 18:26.940
don't read a lot of the comics, like who are these people?

18:26.940 --> 18:30.940
Then you see, like my son has a poster now, Marvel poster, I got him, and I'm like, oh,

18:30.940 --> 18:31.940
hey, there's that guy.

18:31.940 --> 18:35.540
There's Absorbent Man, you know, I recognize him from the Lego game, you know, that kind

18:35.540 --> 18:36.540
of stuff.

18:37.260 --> 18:41.180
I don't know, I think a lot of it kind of gets me back into like the actual, like the

18:41.180 --> 18:44.540
Marvel universe and everything, especially the cinematic stuff.

18:44.540 --> 18:50.020
Yeah, I can't really think of a lot of like games I've played.

18:50.020 --> 18:54.240
I mean, before that, I would say Marvel versus Capcom.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.240
That series is pretty cool.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.140
Okay, that's a damn good answer.

18:57.140 --> 18:59.940
I don't know if there is a better answer to be honest, but we'll see.

18:59.940 --> 19:02.380
Looking at chat, let's look at chat because they've got some ideas.

19:02.380 --> 19:06.740
Stoppy in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says, my favorite comic-based game is Spider-Man

19:06.740 --> 19:08.740
on the PlayStation 1.

19:08.740 --> 19:13.060
There's a lot of chat right now about Injustice 2, which I guess they talked about this weekend

19:13.060 --> 19:18.980
at Comic-Con, Tiger Claw saying they did two new characters, Wonder Woman and Blue Beetle.

19:18.980 --> 19:21.020
Injustice 1 is a pretty good game though.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.020
You know, it's really not bad.

19:23.020 --> 19:26.080
Honestly, still haven't played it yet, and I haven't in my queue because it was free

19:26.080 --> 19:27.080
with the...

19:27.080 --> 19:28.080
It was free on PlayStation.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.080
Yeah, I haven't.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.080
I have not played it.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.080
You should check it out.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.800
It's on that same engine as Mortal Kombat, the newer ones, so it plays really well.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.200
I mean, obviously it doesn't have fatalities or any of that stuff, but they do different

19:39.200 --> 19:40.200
things.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.200
It's fun.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.200
I like it.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
I guess I'll try it.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
Let's see.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.720
Dungeon Buster says, Ultimate Alliance is pretty good.

19:46.720 --> 19:51.680
The sequel is kind of meh, but worth playing if only to hear Thor spew anti-registration

19:51.680 --> 19:52.680
lines.

19:52.680 --> 19:58.000
Let's see, Tiger Claw says, I learned about the Marvel universe by playing Ultimate Alliance.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.920
I like how the game introduces you to these characters, and you can get all sorts of backstories

20:01.920 --> 20:02.920
about them.

20:02.920 --> 20:07.320
And Dungeon Buster says, the X-Men Legends game by Raven Software were really good.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.280
Are those the old ones from the early 90s?

20:10.280 --> 20:12.080
There were some X-Men games in the early 90s that were boss.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.240
X-Men Legends were PlayStation 2, I want to say.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.240
Is that the...

20:15.240 --> 20:18.400
Well, there's also the X-Men arcade game, which was pretty awesome.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.000
That was definitely more about the...

20:20.000 --> 20:25.720
Well, was it the comics, or was it the 90s animation?

20:25.720 --> 20:27.480
I think the arcade was maybe the animation.

20:27.960 --> 20:32.160
Maybe, because I think it was to try and copy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' success, which

20:32.160 --> 20:36.120
was also a big animation in the 90s, and the arcade definitely had a lot of vibe from that.

20:36.120 --> 20:40.640
Speaking of which, a little tangent here, I happened to catch an episode of the Ninja

20:40.640 --> 20:48.200
Turtles show on Nickelodeon, and what the fuck happened to that show?

20:48.200 --> 20:50.880
I did not fucking recognize that shit at all.

20:50.880 --> 20:51.880
You grew up.

20:51.880 --> 20:52.880
You grew up.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.880
No, no, no.

20:53.880 --> 20:54.880
Get off my lawn.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.880
Stop.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.880
Okay, here's what happened.

20:57.280 --> 21:02.800
I'm not sure if this is maybe a mini story arc spinoff of the actual show or something

21:02.800 --> 21:06.920
like that, or if this is what the fucking show's become.

21:06.920 --> 21:11.960
Basically the Ninja Turtles show is pull the fucking Saints bro, where it's just...

21:11.960 --> 21:16.840
The 80s cartoon was, they're in New York, they're fighting in the other foot clan, and

21:16.840 --> 21:20.680
the craziest thing you have is like Krang and all that shit.

21:20.680 --> 21:26.520
What I watched the fucking other day was, they're in space with this robot.

21:27.160 --> 21:33.760
There's fucking frog people, some sort of triceratops people, and they're doing space

21:33.760 --> 21:34.760
battles.

21:34.760 --> 21:38.360
I'm like, this is not fucking close to Ninja Turtles at all.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.600
At all.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.080
What the fuck is going on?

21:41.080 --> 21:46.280
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

21:46.280 --> 21:51.220
Comics zone on Genesis, says Stopy, is good but hard.

21:51.220 --> 21:54.120
Not based on a specific comic though, as far as I know.

21:54.120 --> 21:58.960
There are some original comic games, there's not a lot, but I remember one on the Commodore

21:58.960 --> 22:04.000
64 that was one of my absolute favorites that was ever on that system, it was called Accolade

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Comics.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.080
Man, if I'd thought of this before the show, I would have totally done this as a classic

22:08.080 --> 22:10.520
game this week, but I guess I'll have to save it for another week.

22:10.520 --> 22:14.720
You actually, it was like a choose your own adventure thing, where the comic would load

22:14.720 --> 22:20.400
on the screen, and each panel would load as you chose your own adventure.

22:20.400 --> 22:25.040
And you might choose something that leads you to death, which is bad, or you might choose

22:25.040 --> 22:28.680
something that leads you to an arcade game sequence that you would have to play to get

22:28.680 --> 22:30.700
to the next sequence of comics.

22:30.700 --> 22:31.700
That game was badass.

22:31.700 --> 22:36.160
I think it was one of the later Commodore 64 releases, but I remember that was one of

22:36.160 --> 22:40.320
my favorites, Accolade Comics, I think that was the company, Accolade Software that made

22:40.320 --> 22:41.320
that.

22:41.320 --> 22:45.400
Yeah, that was one of my favorites.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.760
Looking back on comic based games, we have some-

22:47.760 --> 22:51.960
And as Tigerclaw mentions, yes, did you notice Raph having a girlfriend in the series?

22:51.960 --> 22:55.920
Yes, because that's how the fucking episode ended with him about to kiss her, and that

22:55.920 --> 22:56.920
was it.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.840
I was like, what the fuck is going on with this show?

22:59.840 --> 23:03.800
I thought all the episodes were supposed to end with a pizza party.

23:03.800 --> 23:09.720
I just don't, I don't, when you take your fucking series into space is when I think

23:09.720 --> 23:15.080
it starts to, you lose it for me, Saints Row.

23:15.080 --> 23:21.160
Alright, we're going to move on, we've got some gaming news to get into for this week,

23:21.160 --> 23:28.480
but I do want to, of course, do a few plugs here, vognetwork.com, if you guys have seen

23:28.480 --> 23:32.920
Star Trek Beyond, which I still need to see, there's a review up there from one of the

23:32.920 --> 23:37.120
guys at Critical Myth, Bronzethumb, and I still need to see this, but I see some of

23:37.120 --> 23:41.420
the response reviews already coming in, it seems like people are loving Beyond compared

23:41.420 --> 23:44.480
to the last movie, which is a good sign for me, because I didn't really care for the last

23:44.480 --> 23:50.840
movie, I liked the first one, not the second one, so yeah, maybe Kelvin Timeline is all

23:50.840 --> 23:54.200
about the odd-numbered movies, I don't know, so.

23:54.200 --> 23:59.800
Or like, you know, would they refer to it like the alternate, well, I guess like alternate

23:59.800 --> 24:04.400
universe in the show I'm watching is the upside down?

24:04.400 --> 24:07.480
Maybe, I don't know.

24:07.480 --> 24:12.880
Now you're making me think this is the introduction to the opposite sketch, but let's see, so

24:12.880 --> 24:18.720
yeah, check that out, Flacco's got another summer movie preview as well, so you can rank

24:18.720 --> 24:22.920
the cool movies that you want to see, although I'm very upset that he left the absolutely

24:22.920 --> 24:27.400
fabulous movie off the list, because that's my most anticipated movie of summer, but I

24:27.400 --> 24:32.280
suppose not everybody remembers the British original, so yeah, definitely check that out

24:32.280 --> 24:37.200
and rank those, and I've got like a ton of stuff in the queue, because I'm so far behind,

24:37.200 --> 24:41.400
because I've been doing way too many podcasts lately, so lots of great stuff coming up.

24:41.400 --> 24:49.320
I do want to also plug, Bobby Blackwolf did a video about, kind of like a response to

24:49.320 --> 24:51.240
all the controversy about Tesla Autopilot.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.840
Yeah, I had to talk someone down while I was getting my smog check, you know, because they

24:55.840 --> 25:00.120
were saying, garbage, like, oh yeah, did you hear about that guy that got killed by one

25:00.120 --> 25:01.120
of the self-driving cars?

25:01.120 --> 25:02.760
I'm like.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.440
Did you hear about the 50,000 that got killed by the non-self-driving car?

25:06.440 --> 25:11.120
I mean, whatever, anyway, I think, now you have a video you can show.

25:11.120 --> 25:14.960
Bobby's got a great kind of response to that whole thing, and you can check that out on

25:14.960 --> 25:18.800
our YouTube channel, at VOG Network, very exciting.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.600
Let's see, what else do I have to say?

25:20.600 --> 25:25.000
We will be off on Labor Day weekend, because I will be at DragonCon, so I hope to meet

25:25.000 --> 25:26.240
you guys in Atlanta.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.880
I don't know yet if we actually have any panels this year, I haven't heard back from Podcast

25:30.880 --> 25:37.360
Track, so I hope we'll be around regardless, even if we don't get invited to do an official

25:37.360 --> 25:41.760
panel, we'll still be lurking around that area, and probably shooting our own stuff,

25:41.760 --> 25:46.160
now that Bobby's got all the video stuff, so we'll kind of be doing a slightly different

25:46.160 --> 25:48.920
approach to DragonCon this year, so that's really exciting.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.200
Who knows what's going to happen.

25:51.200 --> 25:57.200
And I think that's it, otherwise, plug in my own podcast, Pokestop Podcast, guys on

25:57.200 --> 26:02.520
the show, everything that's at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.080
Let's get into some gaming news this week.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.400
Look, you want to start us off.

26:06.440 --> 26:11.120
All right, so there is some information that's kind of come out from Pokemon Go, and this

26:11.120 --> 26:14.760
is due to some data mining.

26:14.760 --> 26:19.400
So for example, we found out that there is an actual cap to the trainer level, which

26:19.400 --> 26:23.340
is 40, and it's going to take you a while to get there, though, because in order to

26:23.340 --> 26:29.000
level up to 40, actually from one to 40 is 20 million experience points.

26:29.000 --> 26:36.120
And in fact, just level 39 to 40 is five million, so that definitely steps up quite a bit after

26:36.120 --> 26:37.120
level 20.

26:37.120 --> 26:42.640
Pokemon themselves also have level caps, they only go up to 30, so pretty much anything

26:42.640 --> 26:48.200
you catch at 30 or greater is only going to be that same level until you actually increase

26:48.200 --> 26:52.960
its stats using the Stardust and Candy and all that fun stuff.

26:52.960 --> 26:57.080
Each Pokemon also has their own capture and flee rates.

26:57.080 --> 27:02.840
There's also some Pokemon do become harder to catch as you level up, no shit, and we

27:02.840 --> 27:05.360
figured that out quite a long time ago.

27:05.360 --> 27:12.480
Of course, you know, it's pretty obvious that you get bonus, or it makes, it helps to get

27:12.480 --> 27:19.600
those nice, great throws or whatever, and the curveball throws help capture Pokemon

27:19.600 --> 27:20.600
as well.

27:20.600 --> 27:25.120
It kind of works into that whole flee rate and everything.

27:25.120 --> 27:32.560
You know, of course, the other, we know that the Mewtwo, Moltres, Zapdos, Artuno, and Lead,

27:32.560 --> 27:37.960
other, I guess those four are legendary Pokemon, so probably going to be something to do with

27:37.960 --> 27:42.080
the actual, you know, events that they do.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.440
They said that Farfetch'd is out there, and actually I did see that someone did catch

27:45.440 --> 27:49.880
it in Japan, so there is Farfetch'd as well.

27:49.880 --> 27:55.600
They said each Pokemon now also has their base, like a base attack amount, and of all

27:55.600 --> 28:01.260
the Pokemon that are available in the game, the strongest for the non-legendary is Dragonite,

28:01.300 --> 28:07.020
and then, of course, Mewtwo has a base attack of 284, so slightly higher, and then they're

28:07.020 --> 28:15.380
also saying that there's, let's see here, that there's, now I'm not familiar with the

28:15.380 --> 28:23.980
game too much, but that there's the same type attack bonus in this game as well as in the

28:23.980 --> 28:29.740
portable games, so if you're using, for example, a Grass Pokemon and you use a Grass move,

28:29.740 --> 28:34.060
you get a 25% bonus to attack, so that's kind of nice.

28:34.060 --> 28:37.700
And then apparently the Master Ball's in the game, because it was in the beta, but no one's

28:37.700 --> 28:39.180
come across it yet.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.180
Hmm.

28:40.180 --> 28:46.060
All right, well, I guess there's still more to be unveiled as people progress in this

28:46.060 --> 28:47.260
game and so on.

28:47.260 --> 28:54.180
Let's see, going to the chat over at live.voggenetwork.com, JD is saying Farfetch'd is a regional exclusive,

28:54.180 --> 29:00.460
so are Konguskon, Taros, and Mr. Mime, which Taros is the one that's here in the US, and

29:00.460 --> 29:06.300
they say Mr. Mime I think is Europe, and what Konguskon I guess would be Eurasia?

29:06.300 --> 29:08.420
So how did that one guy catch them all?

29:08.420 --> 29:09.420
Did he actually go traveling?

29:09.420 --> 29:10.420
Australia, what am I saying here?

29:10.420 --> 29:15.940
Did he actually go traveling or did he travel using the power of GPS spoofing?

29:15.940 --> 29:20.500
Well, they may hatch in eggs, I think they all hatch in eggs, so if you get lucky with

29:20.500 --> 29:22.140
the eggs, you get that.

29:22.140 --> 29:27.140
Yeah, that's what Alan Alchemy says, they are hatchable from 5k eggs, they are just

29:27.140 --> 29:28.980
region locked finding on the street.

29:28.980 --> 29:31.300
I have 10k eggs, so I wonder what that is.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.380
Usually it's evolved Pokemon I think at that point, you get more advanced stuff.

29:34.380 --> 29:36.900
Well those are ultra rare ones, they're like the 10k, so.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.140
Yeah, yeah, so he gets good stuff in there.

29:40.140 --> 29:44.020
JD says Serebii has a list of what's in eggs, I've seen a chart float around on Twitter

29:44.020 --> 29:50.340
out there, and not all the 2k eggs are bad, because your Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtles

29:50.340 --> 29:51.340
are in those 2k eggs.

29:51.340 --> 29:55.020
I've been trying to find more Charmanders in starting Pokemon and stuff, because how

29:55.020 --> 29:56.380
the fuck am I supposed to level this guy up?

29:56.380 --> 29:57.620
Did I tell you what happened at work?

29:57.620 --> 30:01.460
I don't usually talk about work on this show, but I think the stories we're sharing.

30:01.460 --> 30:06.060
So I'm sitting at my desk doing my job, writing a training guide, this is what I do, and one

30:06.060 --> 30:10.860
of the managers comes through the office and whispers in a very loud voice, Charmander,

30:10.860 --> 30:14.900
Charmander, and suddenly everybody discreetly is taking out their phones and sure enough

30:14.900 --> 30:16.980
there's a Charmander at the front of the building.

30:16.980 --> 30:26.820
We had one of those, the dragon ones, actually, was in front of one of our buildings, everyone

30:26.820 --> 30:29.420
was running out to the parking lot to get it and stuff.

30:29.420 --> 30:34.140
I didn't because I heard it too late, and unfortunately, you know.

30:34.140 --> 30:38.740
Well you don't live far, you don't work far from where that Dratini farm is.

30:38.740 --> 30:40.980
No, yeah, that's definitely there.

30:40.980 --> 30:44.900
What's kind of nice, we have like a local, they have like a Google Maps that people are

30:44.900 --> 30:49.500
adding stuff like, you know, stuff that's on the actual map, like all the different

30:49.500 --> 30:51.940
and pokestops and everything, and also where different farms are.

30:51.940 --> 30:56.420
So there's like a Dratini farm, I was actually browsing using that pokivision.com website,

30:56.420 --> 31:00.300
which I recommend you check out while it's still up, although they've been having trouble

31:00.300 --> 31:04.500
staying up because of the demand and the servers, you know, so if they get hit too hard or the

31:04.500 --> 31:06.600
servers get hit too hard, it goes down.

31:06.600 --> 31:10.900
But it's fucking useful, like my son wanted to get a Pikachu, so I searched the area,

31:10.900 --> 31:14.980
and oh there's a Pikachu right here on this street, drove over to right where it was,

31:14.980 --> 31:16.420
boom there's a Pikachu.

31:16.420 --> 31:23.380
So it actually uses the API in the game somehow, I know it has to do with, it logs in somehow

31:23.380 --> 31:27.080
using the Poke Club stuff, because I know they were saying they were having trouble

31:27.080 --> 31:32.380
getting it to work when that's down, and then it tells you where the stuff is, and you can

31:32.380 --> 31:37.420
scan every 30 seconds and check out the whole area and find all this stuff.

31:37.420 --> 31:38.980
It's pretty crazy.

31:38.980 --> 31:44.460
And I'm sure not what Niantic intended to be done, so we'll see what happens with that.

31:44.460 --> 31:49.960
JD in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, I'm wondering if the API pokivision uses has

31:49.960 --> 31:52.360
anything to do with the wearable.

31:52.360 --> 31:59.900
And Bobby is realizing by scanning his house, it turns out my house is a Pokemon hotspot.

31:59.900 --> 32:03.300
Pikachu has spawned in our backyard I don't know how many times.

32:03.300 --> 32:04.300
So you're not alone.

32:04.300 --> 32:08.140
One of the things I heard is that the spawn points for these, I mean whereas they'd spawn

32:08.140 --> 32:15.240
randomly, are set, so like if a Pikachu spawns in one spot, it'll keep spawning there eventually

32:15.240 --> 32:16.240
later on.

32:16.240 --> 32:21.740
I was almost, I was convinced that it is tied to the what they call XM distribution in Ingress.

32:21.740 --> 32:26.180
Yeah, it could be, and I think a lot of, definitely population density has a lot to do with it

32:26.180 --> 32:31.440
because in the areas that are more dense, you'd find there's more Pokemon there.

32:31.440 --> 32:35.820
So where I'd get more points for creating a field over that, that's where the Pokemon

32:35.820 --> 32:36.820
are.

32:36.820 --> 32:37.820
Makes sense, makes sense.

32:37.820 --> 32:42.540
Alright, well let's move on and talk about Ubisoft with a comment that they've made on

32:42.540 --> 32:43.820
Nintendo NX.

32:43.820 --> 32:47.100
Oh, we couldn't go a week without an NX story even though Nintendo's-

32:47.100 --> 32:48.100
Oh wait, wait, wait.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.100
Wait.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.100
What?

32:50.100 --> 32:51.100
Since we were just talking about Pokemon, I got a text from my wife.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.740
I wanted to make sure that I mentioned this real quick.

32:53.740 --> 32:54.740
We all hear this.

32:54.740 --> 32:55.740
Okay.

32:55.740 --> 33:00.820
She said, I put down an Incense, I, one got away, I caught one, then the game glitched

33:00.820 --> 33:03.580
out while I was catching one, restarted it, it wouldn't let me back in.

33:03.580 --> 33:06.900
By the time I did, 10 seconds were left on the Incense.

33:06.900 --> 33:13.380
Poopy emoji.

33:13.380 --> 33:18.340
It's really the poopy emoji that made that story.

33:18.340 --> 33:22.820
Same thing happened to me the first day the game launched, so yeah, it's just, hopefully

33:22.820 --> 33:26.300
Niantic gets those server issues worked out, but it seems like it's gotten a lot better.

33:26.300 --> 33:31.120
Well she has like an iPhone 5 and for some reason that thing takes forever to log in.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.120
I bet.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.120
I don't know what the problem is.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.120
I bet.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.120
Alright, let's see.

33:35.120 --> 33:42.520
So, the CEO of Ubisoft has talked about Nintendo NX and he's actually saying it's really great,

33:42.520 --> 33:47.200
saying quote, on the NX, what we have seen is really great, so we think having a new

33:47.200 --> 33:51.960
machine coming is going to help the industry to continue to grow and take lots more casual

33:51.960 --> 33:54.200
players back in the industry.

33:54.200 --> 33:59.040
Of course, we have no idea what the specs are or anything, but this is noteworthy because

33:59.040 --> 34:05.680
of course Ubisoft kind of went all in on the Wii U in the beginning, creating one of

34:05.680 --> 34:11.720
the best third party games that was on the Wii U, or probably even the best, Zombie U,

34:11.720 --> 34:17.360
which was great, and then they promptly abandoned the Wii U when that game didn't sell up to

34:17.360 --> 34:21.800
expectations because the Wii U wasn't selling, except for Just Dance, but we don't count

34:21.800 --> 34:22.800
that.

34:22.800 --> 34:27.000
I just don't know if I can trust Ubisoft with telling me what's good and what's not.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.520
After all, Ubisoft decided, hey, you know that Wii Fit volatility sensor that you guys

34:32.520 --> 34:35.400
want to push to never getting them out with, we're going to come and release something

34:35.400 --> 34:39.640
like that as well for meditation or something.

34:39.640 --> 34:45.820
Hey, you guys are really into video games and stuff, how about we release a laser tag

34:45.820 --> 34:46.820
set instead?

34:46.820 --> 34:52.200
So, they don't necessarily have a good judge of hardware, it seems like.

34:52.200 --> 34:56.040
So, I'll wait and see.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.040
Fair enough.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.880
Alright, why don't you do this next, because you feel passionate about this story that

35:00.880 --> 35:04.080
Jamie was going to tell us about, so I think you should do this.

35:04.080 --> 35:09.640
Ah yes, so Sonic Mania, this is kind of cool, they had some stuff, well aside from the really

35:09.640 --> 35:14.400
fucking terrible livestream that they did, they did have some announcements, so one of

35:14.400 --> 35:16.440
those is being Sonic Mania.

35:16.440 --> 35:22.680
It is a throwback to the classic Sonic games, so they've got the Sonic, the Hedgehog 1,

35:22.680 --> 35:27.360
2, 3, I think Knuckles and all that stuff is there.

35:27.360 --> 35:34.380
And then, this brand new fan-made game that's being endorsed as well, and it's got the three

35:34.380 --> 35:38.880
main characters, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.

35:38.880 --> 35:44.540
And they're going to have new twists and new stages and that kind of stuff.

35:44.540 --> 35:48.200
And that's supposed to be coming out on all major platforms in the spring of 2017.

35:48.200 --> 35:54.840
Okay, but you had some pretty strong thoughts on this when you saw the trailer, right?

35:54.840 --> 35:55.840
The trailer for this?

35:55.840 --> 35:57.320
I thought the trailer for this looked okay.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.760
Oh no, this is something else, the livestream or something.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.000
The livestream was fucking terrible.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.760
They had like, buzzing the entire time in the audio, and it's just really awkward.

36:06.760 --> 36:12.080
If you want like a good summary of it, because, I mean, just to explain, it would, it doesn't

36:12.080 --> 36:13.080
do it justice.

36:13.080 --> 36:19.200
Go check out Jim Sterling, he's got a kind of a shit show compilation of what they did

36:19.200 --> 36:22.320
during the livestream, and it's just, it's very awkward.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.320
It's very awkward.

36:23.320 --> 36:27.640
Like, they were trying to show footage of, or show the trailer for Sonic Mania, and it

36:27.640 --> 36:31.560
wasn't fucking working, just as their audio wasn't working, and they're like, we've got

36:31.560 --> 36:36.720
some great news for you, you know, you guys watching at home, and you know, the fans of

36:36.720 --> 36:41.420
the Sonic series, and the great news is, and the audio cut out during the whole fucking

36:41.420 --> 36:45.220
news that they were talking about, it was hilarious.

36:45.220 --> 36:56.180
So yeah, show, not great, trailer for this looked pretty cool, so I'm down with that.

36:56.180 --> 37:01.340
The also, I was gonna say, I don't remember if this was on our show rollout, no.

37:01.340 --> 37:07.780
So they also did have, aside from Sonic Mania, there's, I wanna say projects, was it Sonic

37:07.780 --> 37:12.000
Project 2017 or something like that, I don't remember what it's called, but basically they're

37:12.000 --> 37:19.280
doing a new Sonic Generations game, and they showed Sonic, you know, the classic Sonic,

37:19.280 --> 37:22.980
and then there's a third Sonic, which may be a Sonic Boom Sonic, which no one really

37:22.980 --> 37:27.340
wants him, but he wasn't in the trailer, I just know there's three of them, and they're

37:27.340 --> 37:31.200
basically fighting off against some giant robots or something, and it was just, it was

37:31.200 --> 37:35.860
completely CG animated, it wasn't like an actual gameplay thing or anything, but that's

37:35.860 --> 37:41.740
coming as well, and that'll be Holiday 2017, so there is another game coming, so two games

37:41.740 --> 37:42.740
next year.

37:42.740 --> 37:43.740
They don't look bad.

37:43.740 --> 37:47.420
Yeah, the Sonic Mania especially, it looked like what Sonic Episode 4 should have been,

37:47.420 --> 37:48.420
or Sonic Part 4.

37:48.420 --> 37:53.100
Yeah, and Sonic Mania basically is like saying, hey, this is, you know, made by the people

37:53.100 --> 37:59.340
that made Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors, you know, the two good games, so that's hopeful.

37:59.340 --> 38:03.880
Going to the chat for some comments over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, Sonic

38:03.920 --> 38:07.720
Mania looks legit, I'm down for it, but I'm cautious.

38:07.720 --> 38:13.880
Bob Coffee says, the live stream only reached 6 out of 10 on the Konami E3 2010 scale.

38:13.880 --> 38:14.880
I don't know.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.480
I think it was probably worse than Konami.

38:17.480 --> 38:22.640
Lizzie Dartitsuya says, I did like the Studiopolis level, had a ton of neat Sega Easter eggs

38:22.640 --> 38:26.480
hidden throughout the level, and one thing I didn't know, Studiopolis is the name of

38:26.480 --> 38:31.480
the recording studio where they do the dialogue for all the modern Sonic games and the Sonic

38:31.480 --> 38:32.480
Boom cartoon.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.040
Well, I don't know.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.440
Is that a good thing, though?

38:35.440 --> 38:36.440
I'm just kidding.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.440
I'm kidding.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.440
Maybe.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.440
I guess.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.440
Maybe.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.440
All right, what else is in the news, Logie?

38:41.440 --> 38:47.480
All right, so we can talk a little bit about, oh God, in it, about, we talked about Sonic,

38:47.480 --> 38:51.160
and you know, Sonic Boom, really terrible.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.960
I mean, it's just not a great series.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.360
The games aren't that great either.

38:56.360 --> 39:00.360
But this is like, this is kind of confusing, because now we have Mega Man, which is a great

39:00.360 --> 39:05.800
game series, which is getting an animated cartoon which looks like absolute shit.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.720
At least I don't agree with the art style.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.720
It just, no.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.720
No.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.360
And why is there a tiny Mega Man on his head?

39:11.360 --> 39:13.320
It makes no fucking sense.

39:13.320 --> 39:20.600
But they're doing a new Mega Man game, which, you know, they chose to make it based on the

39:20.600 --> 39:27.880
upcoming Mega Man, Man of Action cartoon, rumored that to be, they're saying that they're

39:27.880 --> 39:30.760
going to be developing two different versions of the game.

39:30.760 --> 39:34.080
One's going to be like the main version of the game, which is for, you know, the consoles

39:34.080 --> 39:36.080
and everything, more powerful stuff.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.600
Then the other one's going to be for 3DS and mobile, and that's going to be Outsource.

39:39.600 --> 39:43.160
The 3DS and mobile one's going to be obviously the weaker of the two.

39:43.160 --> 39:50.200
They're saying one thing about the game that they did notice that the naming, the way they

39:50.200 --> 39:54.120
named the characters isn't necessarily going to be like, you know, Fireman, you know, that

39:54.120 --> 39:55.120
type of stuff.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.720
It's going to be based off of like musical names.

39:57.720 --> 40:02.200
So like they're given examples of Flare Symphony, Frostbite, Sonata, Saber, Waltz.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.600
What are these Castlevania titles?

40:04.600 --> 40:08.120
So it sounds like, is there going to be a boss named Nocturne of the Moonlight?

40:08.120 --> 40:09.120
Is that?

40:09.120 --> 40:13.240
But basically they said that the game is going to look like, you know, like a Mega Man game,

40:13.240 --> 40:20.320
just, you know, with, you know, better graphics, which makes me worry that, oh God, it's going

40:20.320 --> 40:24.000
to be a Capcom version of fucking Mighty No. 9.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.320
I mean, cause like, that's what happens when you make a copy of a copy.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.960
The quality really starts to degrade.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.360
Didn't anyone watch Multiplicity?

40:31.360 --> 40:35.440
I mean, don't we know what happens when you keep cloning?

40:35.440 --> 40:43.680
It's just, it's not, I just like, oh God, the cartoon does not look good.

40:43.680 --> 40:44.960
It just does not look good.

40:44.960 --> 40:50.260
It looks like, yeah, you know, we were totally respected franchise.

40:50.260 --> 40:52.300
We want to go in a different direction with it.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.040
It's like, no.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.920
And then, hey, you know what?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.120
Fans want a new Mega Man game.

40:57.120 --> 41:01.820
So we really want to push this new cartoon that we have.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.880
So we're going to make it based off that.

41:03.880 --> 41:04.880
Why?

41:04.880 --> 41:09.520
Uh, JD does have a good point in our chat over at live.vognetware.com.

41:09.520 --> 41:13.880
Mega Man's always had music references, rock and roll, et cetera.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.480
So they're always, you know, rock man.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.480
That's true.

41:16.480 --> 41:23.520
But no, I, I don't even think it really matters what we call them.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.820
You literally just did this.

41:24.820 --> 41:28.660
You make a very good point and I'm going to choose to ignore it.

41:28.660 --> 41:29.660
I'm sorry.

41:29.660 --> 41:35.300
It's just like, I have, I have the artwork of Mega Man staring at me and it's just like,

41:35.300 --> 41:39.620
no, it does not work for me.

41:39.620 --> 41:40.620
It doesn't.

41:40.620 --> 41:41.620
I mean, it's fine.

41:41.620 --> 41:47.940
Let's, let's give it the benefit that maybe it's good.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.180
You really don't know till you play it.

41:50.180 --> 41:51.220
You don't know, Loki.

41:51.220 --> 41:52.860
I don't know until I watch the reviews for it.

41:52.860 --> 41:54.900
I ain't fucking touching that thing.

41:54.900 --> 41:55.900
Uh, let's see.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.660
And dark Tetsuya says rush.

41:57.660 --> 41:58.940
Don't forget rush.

41:58.940 --> 42:02.780
Well, what truly one of the greatest bands of all time, right?

42:02.780 --> 42:04.740
We need a new robot dog named journey.

42:04.740 --> 42:06.900
That's what we need.

42:06.900 --> 42:07.900
Mark my words.

42:07.900 --> 42:08.900
I'd be fine with that.

42:08.900 --> 42:09.900
Me too.

42:09.900 --> 42:10.900
All right.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.420
Anyhow, uh, let's move on now.

42:12.420 --> 42:16.500
Let's talk about a re-imagining of a franchise that I think looks great.

42:16.500 --> 42:20.340
I'm really excited about this based on the trailer, uh, kind of a follow up to something

42:20.340 --> 42:23.900
we had talked about, um, a few weeks ago on the show, because this had leaked through

42:23.900 --> 42:27.940
a ratings board or something like that, but it was officially announced with a trailer

42:27.940 --> 42:33.180
this week that Pac-Man championship edition two is happening.

42:33.180 --> 42:35.180
So I'm playing a little bit of the trailer here in the background.

42:35.180 --> 42:40.980
Uh, so you can hear some of the music, which the music is almost some of the best part

42:40.980 --> 42:44.420
of any of these Pac-Man games, but I'm very excited about this.

42:44.420 --> 42:46.500
Uh, it just, it just looks different.

42:46.500 --> 42:50.660
Like now the board tilts in different directions, which looks weird.

42:50.660 --> 42:55.700
And the ghost trails will kind of like pop up and it does this weird like tempest thing

42:55.700 --> 42:58.860
where it zooms through the middle of the board, jump onto a new board.

42:58.860 --> 42:59.860
I think so.

42:59.860 --> 43:02.340
But that isn't completely out of character for Pac-Man because that was Pac-Mania.

43:02.340 --> 43:07.900
I think the ghosts are jumping jumping over walls and stuff because that's kind of cool.

43:07.900 --> 43:08.900
Yeah.

43:08.900 --> 43:09.900
I don't know.

43:09.900 --> 43:10.900
And see like the board like tilts and shifts and stuff.

43:10.900 --> 43:14.660
And then there's that when he flies through the air and he eats the trail of ghosts.

43:14.660 --> 43:18.740
So I'm really, I mean, obviously trailers are meant to show you all the best parts of

43:18.740 --> 43:19.740
the game.

43:19.740 --> 43:23.240
I'm really curious what this is going to look like actually in motion there.

43:23.240 --> 43:26.620
So, uh, yeah, and boss battles are in this too.

43:26.620 --> 43:31.320
So, uh, God, I, I want this to be out now, but, uh, apparently I'm going to have to wait

43:31.320 --> 43:32.320
a little bit longer.

43:32.320 --> 43:37.100
I think they say at the end of the trailer, it is going to be September of 2016.

43:37.100 --> 43:41.060
It's going to be out on the Xbox one, the PlayStation four and steam of course.

43:41.060 --> 43:44.120
And they are saying it is a digital only release.

43:44.120 --> 43:49.920
And sorry, I do not see Wii U on the list or any handheld, but then again, I don't know.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.960
I guess Pac-Man championship edition never did release on those consoles, but I guess

43:52.960 --> 43:55.120
anything's possible with the NX, right?

43:55.120 --> 43:56.120
Who knows?

43:56.120 --> 43:59.680
You can't handle the power of Pac-Man.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.720
It's so much to render.

44:01.720 --> 44:02.720
Yeah.

44:02.720 --> 44:06.520
I'm very, very, very excited about that.

44:06.520 --> 44:08.880
So let's see, I'll talk about this one as well.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.380
Dar Sakura was going to bring this to the table tonight, but as I mentioned earlier

44:11.380 --> 44:17.140
in the show, she had to bow out at the last minute due to some pain related to the surgery

44:17.140 --> 44:18.140
she had.

44:18.140 --> 44:23.900
Um, anyhow, Overwatch, uh, got an update, uh, this week and actually this, uh, specifically

44:23.900 --> 44:26.380
the console's got updated with this as well.

44:26.380 --> 44:30.060
The PC got this, I think very early in the week, like Monday, and then the console's

44:30.060 --> 44:34.180
got it a little later in the week, but that new character, Anna is now available in the

44:34.180 --> 44:40.220
game and the console patch actually nerfs two of the characters, Torbjorn and Symmetra,

44:40.260 --> 44:42.180
which they said they were going to do.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.260
And, uh, it is not the same on PC.

44:44.260 --> 44:49.740
I mean, obviously both platforms got Anna, but the nerves for Torbjorn and Symmetra and

44:49.740 --> 44:54.460
their turret damage, uh, being reduced by 30%, that's only on consoles.

44:54.460 --> 44:56.020
That is not on PC.

44:56.020 --> 45:03.140
And this is apparently because it is harder to have the precision aiming on a controller

45:03.140 --> 45:05.020
as opposed to keyboard and mouse.

45:05.020 --> 45:10.700
And since the turrets are auto attack, people are winning every time with Torbjorn and Symmetra

45:10.700 --> 45:15.780
because it's basically like a smart attack where you don't have to aim at all with those.

45:15.780 --> 45:19.460
So it was too overpowering, so they've nerfed it by 30%.

45:19.460 --> 45:25.460
Also in this patch for PC and console, buffs for Zenyatta, who probably one of the least

45:25.460 --> 45:29.380
used support classes, I think people don't realize that Zenyatta can actually attack

45:29.380 --> 45:30.380
pretty well.

45:30.780 --> 45:34.780
So, you know, if you want to heal and do damage, he's a good choice.

45:34.780 --> 45:37.660
But they've buffed him a little bit, which is great.

45:37.660 --> 45:39.660
And then they also did D.Va.

45:39.660 --> 45:41.140
They've changed a lot.

45:41.140 --> 45:44.140
She was already pretty popular, but that's probably just because it's a character.

45:44.140 --> 45:45.340
People really like her.

45:45.340 --> 45:50.540
But now, um, the defense matrix move is an alternate fire and there's a recharge meter

45:50.540 --> 45:54.060
for it and self-destruct is faster as well.

45:54.060 --> 46:00.080
But they are saying Anna is causing crashes on Xbox One and Mei's ice walls are not breaking

46:00.080 --> 46:01.400
when they normally should.

46:01.400 --> 46:04.840
Blizzard did confirm this pretty quickly and that they're working on fixes.

46:04.840 --> 46:09.640
For all I know, this has already been fixed, but since I don't play the game on Xbox One,

46:09.640 --> 46:11.040
I'm not sure.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.040
So, awesome.

46:13.040 --> 46:17.280
Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com has been following over.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.440
He plays a lot more Overwatch than I do.

46:19.440 --> 46:24.740
He says, the Symmetra nerf was a surprise to everyone and everyone on the console forums

46:24.740 --> 46:27.560
thinks it's totally ridiculous and not needed.

46:27.560 --> 46:31.240
But the Torbjorn nerf they knew was coming and everyone was welcome.

46:31.240 --> 46:35.520
But he says, Blizzard leaked it out like a fart so when people saw it in the patch notes

46:35.520 --> 46:37.100
they were like, what?

46:37.100 --> 46:41.840
And he says, going into the game mechanics a little bit, her turrets are so easy to kill

46:41.840 --> 46:46.800
and if you run into a room with her turrets and don't run out, that's your problem.

46:46.800 --> 46:52.520
So a little confusion there on why Symmetra got the nerf just like Torbjorn did, but having

46:52.520 --> 46:57.160
played both those characters, even on PC, I love Torbjorn's turret.

46:57.160 --> 47:01.320
I mean, okay, yeah, it's pretty cool that it automatically does damage, but if you can

47:01.320 --> 47:05.000
place that thing in just the right place, you can really piss the opposing team off

47:05.000 --> 47:08.800
and it's a lot of fun and it makes it super, a lot of fun as well.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.080
So there you go, some Overwatch changes.

47:12.080 --> 47:15.320
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some upcoming video

47:15.320 --> 47:16.320
games.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.320
We'll start in the US with Loki.

47:17.320 --> 47:25.420
Alright, so this week we've got Phantom Brave on PC, Quadrilateral Cowboy also on PC, Fairy

47:25.420 --> 47:34.380
Fencer F, Advent, Dark Force on Playstation 4, Headlander on PC and Playstation 4, Minecraft

47:34.380 --> 47:41.260
Story Mode Episode 7, Access Denied coming out on PC, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Xbox

47:41.260 --> 47:47.380
360, Xbox One, and mobile, and then Hyper Light Drifter coming out on Playstation 4 and

47:47.380 --> 47:48.900
Xbox One.

47:48.900 --> 47:54.580
We're getting the HD remasters of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1 and 2 this week on PC, Playstation

47:54.580 --> 48:02.020
4 and Xbox One, Mutant Mud Super Challenge on PC, Playstation 4, and Playstation Vita,

48:02.020 --> 48:13.580
and then, let's see, it looks like Blade Arcus from Shining EX on PC, and Tokidin 2 on Playstation

48:13.580 --> 48:16.900
3, Playstation 4, and Vita.

48:16.900 --> 48:19.160
Sounds like a busier week than we've had recently.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.500
And apparently a little bit of a delay, but Stardew Valley on Mac and Linux.

48:22.660 --> 48:26.300
Oh, I did not know they were even getting a port, that's great.

48:26.300 --> 48:30.380
Maybe you want to work on getting the UK dates up while I read the Japanese ones here.

48:30.380 --> 48:35.700
So while we go over to Japan, we're going to look at a new Idolmaster game is out in

48:35.700 --> 48:37.860
Japan this week on the 28th.

48:37.860 --> 48:39.820
How many of y'all are Idolmaster fans out there?

48:39.820 --> 48:43.580
Well, Idolmaster Platinum Stars is coming out on the Playstation 4.

48:43.580 --> 48:47.580
This is actually the first Idolmaster game on the Playstation 4.

48:47.580 --> 48:52.820
They're saying in this game, new character models, new facial expressions, dynamic camera

48:52.820 --> 48:58.240
work during concert scenes, and you can even get crowds of up to 50,000 people.

48:58.240 --> 49:02.900
You pick one of 13 idols to produce and focus your training efforts on.

49:02.900 --> 49:06.700
I don't know why Idolmaster never really showed up over here, or did it?

49:06.700 --> 49:07.700
Did they ever try Idolmaster over here?

49:07.700 --> 49:08.700
I don't think they did.

49:08.700 --> 49:10.540
No, the closest thing you had to it was Hatsune Miku.

49:10.540 --> 49:14.540
Yeah, I know Hatsune Miku, and that's kind of a very, I don't want to say cult game,

49:14.540 --> 49:18.180
but it's kind of, you know, it's got its following, but it's not a triple-A title by

49:18.180 --> 49:19.180
any means.

49:19.180 --> 49:20.180
Well, who knows?

49:20.180 --> 49:23.660
Maybe, I wish they just would try releasing it digitally or something, you know?

49:23.660 --> 49:25.100
I don't know, anyway.

49:25.100 --> 49:28.740
But Idolmaster is out in Japan on the Playstation 4 this week on July 28th.

49:28.740 --> 49:35.940
You can also look forward to, in Japan this week, Tokaiden 2 comes out in regular and

49:35.940 --> 49:38.180
Treasure Box editions.

49:38.180 --> 49:40.420
That's from Koei Tecmo this week.

49:40.420 --> 49:42.860
Look forward to that on the Playstation 4.

49:42.860 --> 49:52.580
Also, a price reduction on Dragon Ball Xenoverse and Guilty Gear Revelator gets, I guess, some

49:52.580 --> 49:55.140
type of re-release there with new subtitles this week.

49:55.140 --> 49:59.900
Also, Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force this week.

49:59.900 --> 50:07.780
Going to some of the other consoles, the Vita this week has Sekaiichi Nagai 5 Funkan comes

50:07.780 --> 50:15.080
out this week, Mega Tagmension Blanc plus Neptune vs. Zombies, that's a mouthful.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.860
That is out this week as well.

50:16.860 --> 50:23.500
Tokaiden 2 is out on Vita as well, and Strawberry Knots in regular and limited edition.

50:23.500 --> 50:28.660
I do not know what Strawberry Knots is, but it is not actually about strawberry.

50:28.660 --> 50:35.060
I think this anime girl wearing a very short skirt who's about to show you her knots, her

50:35.060 --> 50:39.580
name is probably Strawberry, or at least that's how that goes in my mind.

50:39.580 --> 50:44.020
Let me lastly quick look at the 3DS to see if there's anything this week.

50:44.020 --> 50:47.500
Oh, Puzzle and Dragons has two new releases this week.

50:47.500 --> 50:52.800
There's Ryu no Shu and Kami no Shu both come out this week on the 3DS in Japan, so if you

50:52.800 --> 50:55.980
are into Puzzle and Dragons, you have that to look forward to.

50:55.980 --> 50:57.700
So how about the UK, Loki?

50:57.700 --> 51:00.920
I'm not sure how accurate this list is, but I'm going to read it anyway.

51:00.920 --> 51:07.040
So we have AW Phoenix Festa on, looks like Vita.

51:07.040 --> 51:13.640
Help the game on PC, is that like, no, I don't know what that is, anyways, and then they

51:13.640 --> 51:18.080
are saying that the Batman, the remasters are coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

51:18.080 --> 51:21.440
which I believe those are deleted at the end of the year, but whatever.

51:21.440 --> 51:26.680
So yeah, they're saying Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City on PlayStation 4 and Xbox

51:26.680 --> 51:27.680
One.

51:27.680 --> 51:33.280
I won't buy that though, so I'm not sure if that's accurate, however, I do have a second

51:33.280 --> 51:35.560
list I was going to take a look at here real fast.

51:35.560 --> 51:42.440
Furry Fencer F Advent Dark Force on PlayStation 4, they're saying We Have a Few coming out

51:42.440 --> 51:48.520
as well digitally on Xbox One and PC, and Olli Olli Epic Combo Edition on PlayStation

51:48.520 --> 51:50.520
4.

51:50.520 --> 51:56.160
Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, AkumaJP says, Idle Master died with Xbox 360.

51:56.160 --> 51:59.640
I didn't realize that, but then why are they bothering with PlayStation 4?

51:59.640 --> 52:01.560
Maybe it was cheap to put together, who knows.

52:01.560 --> 52:05.880
Orange Right says, I thought it was released as a very expensive iOS game.

52:05.880 --> 52:06.880
Really?

52:06.880 --> 52:07.880
I did not know.

52:07.880 --> 52:08.880
If that's the case, I did not know that.

52:08.880 --> 52:09.880
Huh.

52:09.880 --> 52:10.880
I'll have to look that up.

52:10.880 --> 52:14.600
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week,

52:14.600 --> 52:19.920
which I'm going to take over tonight, since I had to think of something last minute here.

52:19.920 --> 52:23.740
I'm going to let Dark Soccer, Dark Soccer had picked a pretty big one for this week,

52:23.740 --> 52:25.960
so I think she'd rather talk about it in a future week.

52:25.960 --> 52:30.080
So I picked another one that I bet a lot of you haven't heard of, but it's timely.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.640
We'll get into that after a couple more news stories here.

52:32.640 --> 52:33.640
Loki.

52:33.640 --> 52:38.860
So Google has announced that they're going to be hosting a brand new independent games

52:38.860 --> 52:40.240
festival in San Francisco.

52:40.240 --> 52:45.200
It's going to take place at the Terra Gallery on September 24th.

52:45.200 --> 52:51.640
It's going to be dubbed the Google Play Indie Games Festival, and they're taking submissions

52:51.640 --> 52:59.520
right now for Android developers for different, you know, games that are both fun and innovative.

52:59.520 --> 53:05.200
And yeah, so they're really only interested in games from development teams, or smaller

53:05.200 --> 53:10.240
development teams, so like 15 or less, or fewer, I guess, employees.

53:10.240 --> 53:15.280
And then, yeah, so that's kind of cool that they're going to be doing that.

53:15.280 --> 53:19.640
I'm going to be curious to see what the turnout is on that, especially, you know, there's

53:19.640 --> 53:22.440
a lot of Android games out there.

53:22.440 --> 53:25.800
I mean, it'd be nice to see if some of these submissions are getting a little bit of a

53:25.800 --> 53:28.120
highlight on the Google Play Store or something like that.

53:28.120 --> 53:32.000
I mean, it'd be interesting to see what they've got planned here.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.400
Yeah, and let's not forget, you know, Pokemon Go from Niantic.

53:36.400 --> 53:40.720
Niantic used to be a part of Google, so one could say that Niantic was once one of these

53:40.720 --> 53:42.320
little indie studios.

53:42.320 --> 53:45.600
You know, I guess it's hard to call something indie that's an offshoot of Google, but still,

53:45.600 --> 53:47.120
you know, Google's got their eye on that stuff.

53:47.120 --> 53:48.120
Right.

53:48.120 --> 53:49.120
Yeah.

53:49.600 --> 53:52.000
Does this mean they're going to be getting more gaming stuff?

53:52.000 --> 53:57.880
I mean, because I know for a while there they were talking about maybe like, maybe the rumors

53:57.880 --> 54:01.360
were like they were going to be doing like a set-top box like Ouya or something, but

54:01.360 --> 54:03.880
I don't know if that's going to ever happen anymore.

54:03.880 --> 54:05.760
It could be partially because of the phones.

54:05.760 --> 54:09.040
It could be like an Android thing, but I think what I think it really is, you know, Google

54:09.040 --> 54:14.040
is kind of interested in society's next big thing, whatever that may be.

54:14.040 --> 54:16.840
You know, and you can credit a lot of what's happening with Pokemon Go.

54:16.840 --> 54:20.320
You can kind of trace that back to Google, but you know, when you look at some of these

54:20.320 --> 54:25.120
indie games that have been downright phenomenons, and I'm talking things like Minecraft, indie

54:25.120 --> 54:30.000
game, Five Nights at Freddy's, indie game, Stardew Valley, I think is kind of coming

54:30.000 --> 54:31.660
up on one of these, indie game.

54:31.660 --> 54:37.560
You know, I think Google would want to have a piece of that, even if they aren't normally

54:37.560 --> 54:38.640
a gaming company.

54:38.640 --> 54:42.180
I think they would love to, you know, if they can kind of find and nurture that next big

54:42.180 --> 54:48.900
thing, which you know, again, some would argue they did with Pokemon Go, I think they

54:48.900 --> 54:54.980
would, I would very much like to have a part of that, so this could be part of it.

54:54.980 --> 54:58.060
Some would like to also think it's just good guy Google, you know?

54:58.060 --> 54:59.060
Maybe.

54:59.060 --> 55:00.060
Maybe.

55:00.060 --> 55:05.420
Let's see, going to chat over at live.fognetwork.com, Stoppy says, I'm always interested in what

55:05.420 --> 55:06.460
games get featured.

55:06.460 --> 55:08.980
It seems these guys can never get enough coverage.

55:08.980 --> 55:11.500
Pretty sad because some games are really great.

55:11.540 --> 55:14.740
And JD reminding us that Ouya got bought by Razer.

55:14.740 --> 55:16.500
So Ouya's long gone at this point, right?

55:16.500 --> 55:20.460
Because they just merged it into the Razer thing, right?

55:20.460 --> 55:21.460
What's the Razer thing?

55:21.460 --> 55:24.140
Didn't Razer have their own set-top box at some point?

55:24.140 --> 55:25.140
Oh god, everybody does.

55:25.140 --> 55:26.140
They still have, what is it?

55:26.140 --> 55:27.140
The Nvidia Shield.

55:27.140 --> 55:31.340
The only reason I know that's even a thing is because when I was looking for my, you

55:31.340 --> 55:33.060
know, Bluetooth controller.

55:33.060 --> 55:39.020
Brad says, I bought the, Brad from Pod Culture in chat says, I bought the Razer Forge, aka

55:39.020 --> 55:40.020
Ouya 2.

55:40.020 --> 55:41.020
It was the Razer Forge.

55:41.020 --> 55:44.500
How are you liking your Forge?

55:44.500 --> 55:46.740
Have you forged some new gaming experiences with it?

55:46.740 --> 55:51.180
Does it make you go, ooh yeah, or uhh, no.

55:51.180 --> 55:56.020
I can't imagine it's that much different from owning like a Steam box in some way, or not

55:56.020 --> 55:58.140
the Steam TV thing.

55:58.140 --> 55:59.140
I don't know.

55:59.140 --> 56:00.580
Except that's not Steam coming out.

56:00.580 --> 56:05.060
Brad from Pod Culture says, it isn't bad actually.

56:05.060 --> 56:06.060
Okay.

56:06.060 --> 56:07.060
Alright.

56:07.060 --> 56:08.060
Anyhow, let's see.

56:08.100 --> 56:11.180
I want to talk about Rock Band Rivals.

56:11.180 --> 56:12.180
Rock Band Rivals.

56:12.180 --> 56:15.240
Some details on this, they talked about it at E3, but now we know some more details on

56:15.240 --> 56:16.240
Rock Band Rivals.

56:16.240 --> 56:21.340
It's going to be a $30 expansion that will bring new features to Rock Band 4.

56:21.340 --> 56:27.140
A story-based career mode and a series first, they're saying, a synchronous multiplayer

56:27.140 --> 56:31.740
mode with both cooperative and competitive options.

56:31.740 --> 56:34.860
So this is the first time I think that Rock Band's getting competitive play.

56:34.860 --> 56:40.500
They are saying that regular online multiplayer will hit Rock Band 4 for a free update, but

56:40.500 --> 56:44.740
they're saying that Rock Band Rivals is supposed to be like a counterpart for online play.

56:44.740 --> 56:47.380
I guess it kind of expands on this.

56:47.380 --> 56:51.780
You can team up with other players to create crews, which are in-game groups, and then

56:51.780 --> 56:56.200
you compete in challenges each week, which will, you know, contribute to the group's

56:56.200 --> 56:59.780
success as a whole if you pass, you fail, or what have you.

56:59.780 --> 57:03.940
And so it's trying to get people back on to check with Rock Band 4 and play it pretty

57:03.940 --> 57:04.940
regularly.

57:04.940 --> 57:09.900
There's also what's called a Rock You Drama mode that's supposed to be like VH1's

57:09.900 --> 57:16.260
Behind the Music that takes live-action footage and Rock Band gameplay, and it will make a

57:16.260 --> 57:18.980
documentary about your rise to stardom.

57:18.980 --> 57:23.220
See, the only way I could see you, you know, crashing and burning in this, you know, at

57:23.220 --> 57:29.460
the end of that documentary thing is, you remember the Rock Band's intros, you know,

57:29.460 --> 57:33.140
where they're just playing, you know, music on top of cars in front of trains and like

57:33.140 --> 57:34.820
crazy stuff like that.

57:34.820 --> 57:35.820
That's how you die.

57:35.820 --> 57:42.740
You play your final show on top of a car, train, and you die.

57:42.740 --> 57:46.400
This is interesting because it sounds to me kind of like, you know, like Guitar Hero,

57:46.400 --> 57:50.300
the new Guitar Hero, kind of had the live-action footage with it, and it was actually pretty

57:50.300 --> 57:51.300
well received.

57:51.300 --> 57:54.220
So it's interesting that Rock Band, they aren't copying it, they're doing their own

57:54.220 --> 57:56.540
take on it, which is kind of interesting.

57:56.540 --> 58:02.200
I don't know, this is something I might want to check out, and I wasn't feeling so

58:02.260 --> 58:07.080
great about Rock Band 4, but now it sounds like this might be the Rock Band 4 that I

58:07.080 --> 58:08.080
wanted to play.

58:08.080 --> 58:13.360
I'm not sure how I feel about 30 extra dollars to play it, but at least it sounds like some

58:13.360 --> 58:17.680
of that is coming over into the regular game, so you can maybe like test it out before you

58:17.680 --> 58:18.680
buy.

58:18.680 --> 58:19.680
I don't know.

58:19.680 --> 58:24.800
You also do get 10 tracks for your time for what it's worth, including Semisonic's closing

58:24.800 --> 58:25.800
time.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.240
You get some pre-order bonuses too.

58:27.240 --> 58:33.720
One More Time from Maroon 5, 3 AM by Matchbox 20, and one of the other 10 tracks worth pointing

58:33.720 --> 58:35.920
out, Sia's Chandelier.

58:35.920 --> 58:40.040
And if you can do the dance that the girl does in the video while you play the song,

58:40.040 --> 58:42.280
I think you should be able to get bonus points.

58:42.280 --> 58:46.600
So that's some talented dancing going on there.

58:46.600 --> 58:50.860
Or if you can play like Sia does, with the hair completely covering your eyes so you

58:50.860 --> 58:52.840
can't actually see the notes on the screen.

58:52.840 --> 58:54.240
That might be pretty cool as well.

58:54.240 --> 59:00.800
Anyhow, 30 bucks for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, or you can get a bundle of everything

59:00.800 --> 59:04.960
together for $60 if you don't yet own Rock Band 4.

59:04.960 --> 59:09.560
So in other words, if you waited to buy Rock Band 4, then for the price of Rock Band 4,

59:09.560 --> 59:10.560
you're going to get both.

59:10.560 --> 59:14.600
Doesn't that make you feel good early adopters?

59:14.600 --> 59:16.760
I'm trying to be hopeful.

59:16.760 --> 59:17.760
All two of you.

59:17.760 --> 59:20.480
I'm very much trying to be hopeful.

59:20.480 --> 59:21.960
We'll see.

59:21.960 --> 59:23.920
Comments and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

59:23.920 --> 59:26.360
Stoppie says, a $30 expansion?

59:26.360 --> 59:27.360
Ouch.

59:27.360 --> 59:30.880
JD says, I didn't realize they were still making Rock Band games.

59:30.880 --> 59:34.160
Yeah, Harmonics is kind of having a problem with that.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.160
Exactly that.

59:35.160 --> 59:36.160
Let's see.

59:36.160 --> 59:39.360
Brad from Pod Culture says, where is all my previous Rock Band content?

59:39.360 --> 59:40.680
God damn it.

59:40.680 --> 59:43.480
And I kind of agree with that.

59:43.480 --> 59:44.480
And let's see.

59:44.480 --> 59:49.000
Stoppie says, you can make your own band and play for beer like the good old days.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Hopefully that will be in the docudrama.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
We'll see.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.040
I don't know.

59:52.040 --> 59:56.640
Anyway, let's go back to a more classic time, shall we?

59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.280
Back when games, you know, if they were broken on the first release, then that's it.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280
No patch.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.280
Nothing to do.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.040
I'm going way back this week with my pick because Dark Soccer, she will usually step

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.360
into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be playing this this

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360
week.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.360
But she's not here.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360
So I'm taking over.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.920
And the criteria is that the game does need to be 10 years old or more.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.680
And I think tonight's game, if I'm not mistaken, is over 30 years old, which I'm going to date

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.920
myself a little bit.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.760
Yeah, this game was released in 1984, so it's over 30 years old.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.780
But maybe some of you will recognize it.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.400
This is a timely choice.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.600
Some of you may recognize it from this theme.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600
That's right.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.880
The classic game of the week is Summer Games by Epyx on the Commodore 64.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.360
Of course I picked the Commodore 64.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.880
And by the way, this is one of the only parts of the game where music actually plays.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.000
Otherwise it's a lot of ambient noise in the background.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.640
So don't be surprised if the music in the background kind of cuts in and out.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.920
So anyway, yes, the pick this week is Summer Games, which was one of the Epyx games.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:10.880
That's E-P-Y-X games that was released on the Commodore 64 in 1984, but it was also

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:17.760
ported to the Apple II, the Atari 2600, believe it or not, the 7800, the XL and XE.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.160
And it was on the Sega Master System, which I didn't realize that, and I never played

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.440
that version.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:30.020
There was also an Amiga version, a Spectrum version, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST versions.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:36.000
And then it actually came out on the Commodore 64 Direct-to-TV that was released in 2004.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.520
I don't know if you guys remember that, but like how we're getting a mini NES this year.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.360
There was a Commodore 64, one of those in 2004, which I never bought, and I really should

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.440
have as a single tear rolls down my face.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.240
Maybe I could find one on eBay.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240
I don't know.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:56.280
Anyhow, interesting thing about this, this really was basically the Olympics on the Commodore

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.280
64.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.920
Without getting the Olympics license.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.920
That's right.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.360
This game never uses the word Olympics, and you aren't playing in the Olympics, you were

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.080
playing in the Epyx games, and you can represent one of several countries.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.720
I think there was like, I don't know, maybe like 18 or maybe 27 countries, but one of

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.680
the countries, and I'm using my quotey fingers, was Epyx.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.200
You could actually play, you could represent the US, you could represent Canada, you could

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.920
represent, you know, Mexico, you could represent all these different companies, or you could

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.240
represent Epyx, which would play the Jumpman Jr. theme.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.000
If you represented, because like you're, when you won a medal in the game, it would actually

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.340
play the theme for whatever, you know, country you were.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:40.000
And so as a kid, this was a way that I got to learn national anthems besides just the

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
US.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Who knew?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.200
Did you ever play this as a kid, Logie?

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.960
I don't think I ever did.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.640
But no, it's funny though, like, so that would totally make like some of the track and field

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:55.040
events, you know, more unique if that bullet was chasing after you.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.200
Let's see, so there are eight events in the game, I'm sorry, seven events I think in the

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.200
game.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:07.500
Pole vault, platform diving, sprinting, gymnastics, freestyle swimming, skeet shooting, and rowing.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.900
And I can tell you like three of those four events was just how fast can you wiggle the

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.540
joystick back and forth.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.540
That's how you ran in the game was just, it was like track and field, you remember Konami's

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.420
old arcade game track and field?

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.240
Some of the events were a lot like that, and I would say summer games almost had more in

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.920
common with track and field than some other stuff.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.620
You could save your world records to the disc, which you know, was kind of a big deal in

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.040
the 1984.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:36.100
But what I also think was really cool about this, let's talk about the sequel because

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.460
who knows if they'll ever make, or if we'll ever talk about this game again.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.500
But the sequel to the game was summer games two, and summer games two had some new events,

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:49.300
and actually summer games two was the one I happened to play first.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:54.420
And that had, it also had rowing in it, it had equestrian, it had fencing and cycling,

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.140
like it had some different events.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:00.380
But what was really cool is that if you had summer games two, you could actually link

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:05.780
to summer games one, and you could do all the events in one giant Olympics, and it would

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:09.620
just tell you to put in the disc for summer games one when those events came up.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.300
So that's really cool, like that makes me think like, come on, you DDR fans remember

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.940
append mode in DDR third mix, right, where you'd switch out the disc and put in second

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.940
mix?

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.940
It's like that.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.940
But in the 80s.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.280
So that's really cool, I think.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.780
And of course, there was a winter games as well that many of you are talking about in

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.540
chat over at live.vog network.com.

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:33.300
And yeah, that was another kind of sequel-ish, I don't know, I always played California games.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.180
I don't see the interesting thing about California games.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.280
Was that an epics game?

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.280
It was an epics game.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280
What is?

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.040
So maybe, you know, this was a huge game, you know, the reason why I bring this up,

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.680
it's not just the timeliness of the Olympics being around the corner and all that.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.760
But this was a very successful game for the Commodore 64.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:56.440
And I guess some historians actually refer to it as the most sustainably popular in the

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.740
long life of the Commodore 64, which of course, was one of the most popular home computing

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.480
devices in the 1980s.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.480
So yeah, I mean, summer games is really a legend on this system.

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.120
And so yeah, I guess I'm not, I always thought California games had more in common with skate

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.120
or die.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.040
I don't know why I'm thinking of that as an EA game.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:20.520
Not really mean, I mean, it had like, it had a half pipe, well, what did it have?

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:27.000
It had like, it had BMX, I'm thinking of the Atari Lynx version, so, had BMX, Hacky Sack,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.920
Surfing, and...

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.120
You're right, California games was a derivative of summer games and winter games, I never

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120
realized it.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:40.360
It was half pipe, roller skating, surfing, BMX, foot bag, and flying disc.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.200
Did you know there was a California games too?

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.640
I never realized that.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.520
That was hang gliding, jet ski, snowboarding, body surfing, and skateboarding.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.520
That's pretty cool.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.080
Maybe that's why I associated it more with the skater die.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.800
Skater die really needs to come back.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.560
Well, and then they had, there was skier die, was the direct-

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.560
Skater die.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.560
Yeah.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.560
Skater die too, though.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.560
Yeah, that's right.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.560
There was.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.760
But yeah, seriously, skater die needs to come.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.400
That's a game that like this year made, modern skater die.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.400
Absolutely.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:15.040
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says, I have VCR California

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.240
games from Epyx.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.240
I never realized that they did one of those.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.560
How'd you do that?

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:24.680
Well, you know, VCR games were like huge for like a year.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.200
Yeah, I know.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.960
I owned the Action Max at one time.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.480
So that was like, that was an awkward time.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.480
Let's see, this is, this is from my dad who said he was never a gamer yet had a Coleco

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.280
vision with like 80 games, bought the Action Max and like a Nintendo and all these other

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.080
obscure things.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.080
Interesting.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.800
And Bobby Blackwolf says it was a traditional board game, but some spaces would say play

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.160
the next clip and the clip would show if you succeeded or failed.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.400
So it sounds super basic.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.400
Okay.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.400
Yeah.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.400
Interesting.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.240
Bobby Blackwolf also saying summer games two is my favorite game back in the day.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.240
Yeah.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.480
I like summer games too, because the events weren't just the wiggling of the joystick

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.480
and all that.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.720
You had some other stuff, like, especially like fencing and stuff.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.560
And especially in winter games, like when you did the ice skating events and stuff,

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.080
you really had to think about, okay, I want to do a jump here.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.000
I want to do a, you know, and actually had a little soundtrack that would play during

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
the event.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.600
So those games were a lot of fun.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.360
So I wanted to acknowledge as we head into the Olympics this year, I thought this was

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.000
a good week to acknowledge summer games, your classic game of the week on the Commodore

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.040
64 and a variety of other systems.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040
I'm sorry.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:37.160
It wasn't halo when Jamie isn't here, but she did put out a, um, a decree on Twitter

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.840
that she had the right to veto it if it was ever halo.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:45.680
So she's thinking ahead to, to the inevitable week when, when Loki tries to, uh, your decrees

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.480
have no power here, she, she might have an issue with that.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480
Loki.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480
She might have an issue with that.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480
All right.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.320
Uh, when we take a break, we're going to come back with plenty more show.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.400
We've got some rapid fire news coming at you.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:02.440
We also have some more, um, news stories to get into and, um, Hey, we forgot to talk about

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.440
our gaming weeks.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.440
I just realized we never got into your, we talked about your wife's gaming week.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.960
We didn't talk about ours, speaking of living in Bizarro world.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.640
So we'll get into our gaming weeks as well.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.840
We'll get into that a little late.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:18.520
Uh, we may have some guests joining us in studio, supposedly heading back from where

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.520
they were at.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.640
So we'll see who knows what awaits us when we come back with more of orange lounge radio,

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:32.760
right after this.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:38.200
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on July the 24th, 2016 with episode

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:44.360
number 651 of our show already in progress, myself and Loki here in studio.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.560
And I already know what Loki's playing on his phone over there because I see his fingers

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.080
going tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.040
I haven't played it most of the, well, I have played it most of the week, but I didn't play

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040
it this weekend.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.800
And of course we're talking about tap Mike Katamari if you have no idea what, what we're

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.800
talking about there.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.520
Uh, which, um, I've been playing a little bit of that, but not a ton.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.520
I like you.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.600
I kind of went a few days without playing it.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.080
I think because like, you know, between Pokemon go and ingress, it's boring after a while.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.000
It's like, it's, it's, I don't know.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.800
It's just something to do while I'm sitting here because, well, I'm sorry that this show

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800
is boring.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.800
It's not boring me.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.320
It's just like, it doesn't require me to pay attention to it at all.

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.320
It is.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.320
It is.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320
It's kind of a Zen thing to do.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.680
It's like, uh, you know, like when you are sitting in like a classroom or something,

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.000
you're playing with like slinky Rubik's cube or something that kind of, you know, something

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.760
keeps you, you're tactile or whatever.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.760
All right.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.600
Anyhow, uh, we're into some rapid fire news, uh, quickly here and then we'll get into our

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.600
gaming weeks.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.120
So, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.120
All right.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.480
So, um, as I mentioned, you know, during our release dates, Marvel ultimate Alliance is

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.880
going to be coming out of the agency remastered, they announced it at San Diego comic con.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.440
And um, not only will he be able to purchase those separately, um, individually they're

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.000
going to be sold for $39.99, but you can also get a bundle that saves you a little

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.760
bit of money for $60 and get one and two.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:06.920
And it'll be Marvel ultimate Alliance's first time on PC as well.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.920
I will have to wait.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.920
I don't know.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.920
Those are supposed to be pretty good games.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.760
I haven't actually played them yet, so I may have to check those out when they're on sale.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.100
I might check it out, but I feel like if I can hold off till black Friday, they'll be

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.800
even cheaper.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:29.360
So this is unfortunate, but apparently, um, uh, Shuhei Yoshida's Twitter has been hacked

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.800
as you know, a lot of different people have been, especially celebrities that are on the

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.200
internet have been hacked.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:42.600
Um, you know, he, uh, as unfortunately, I'm not sure if it's the same kind of the same

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:48.520
method as how they were, um, getting into other celebrities out there using two factor

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.440
authentication and cloning their phones.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:58.580
But in this case, a hacking group called our mine, um, had taken it over for a little bit

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:05.320
and they're also the same ones claiming that they were hacking Pokemon Go servers.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:10.240
To be honest, I don't think Pokemon Go servers needed any help.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.760
No one would even know.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760
Yeah.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.160
I think Pokemon Go kind of went down on its own.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.160
Yeah.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:21.960
So, uh, well, yeah, so they just basically, you know, they posted a few tweets and that

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.960
was about it.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:28.360
You know, basically saying it's our mind and X-Box forever, ha ha funny.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.360
No one cares.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360
All right.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.520
Uh, well, let's, uh, go to some other stories here, including, uh, and by the way, maybe

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.600
you want to pull up what Jamie was going to talk about already.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.600
So this is interesting.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.360
So they're going to be making a Pokemon movie, but it might not be what you think, uh, and

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.160
maybe Pokemon Go is to thank for this.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:52.640
I don't know, but deadline, which is usually a, a, a website or a blog that reports a little

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.880
more on a movie news than they do on gaming news.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.600
Uh, apparently the studio legendary pictures who made the recent Warcraft movie, but they've

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.760
done a lot of big, big movies.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.200
Like the Batman BN series is all them.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.600
And you know, uh, they, they do a lot of big stuff.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.800
Uh, Jurassic world was them too, right?

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.020
I think it was maybe anyway, uh, legendary has gotten Nintendo and the Pokemon company

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:18.140
to sign off on a live action Pokemon movie.

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:23.460
Uh, apparently legendary is going to make a movie specifically about detective Pikachu,

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.260
Danny DeVito for Pikachu's voice.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.260
I know, right?

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.540
Somebody get Danny DeVito on this immediately.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:33.900
Like this is where now fans dreams can come true.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.020
And Danny DeVito can be the voice.

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:40.120
I feel like Nintendo would never sign off on it, but we can dream.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.200
So yeah, uh, it's going to be a mystery tale in the Pokemon universe starring detective

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.200
Pikachu production expected to begin in 2017.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:53.740
But I would not get too excited until we know a voice, a director, you could do with, it's

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:54.740
always sunny in Philadelphia.

01:12:54.740 --> 01:13:02.800
You can just be like there that, you know, the gang collects Pokemon or, uh, Alan alchemy

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.120
and chat over at live.vogmentwork.com suggests a Pokemon movie directed by Lars Von Trier

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:11.560
rated NC 17.

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.560
That shot that.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.560
So what's his style called where it's like you just, you basically are shooting something

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.620
on a fucking home cam quarter.

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:24.080
You're doing your whole movie natural, like dog dogmo was a Kevin Smith film, but it's

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.560
something he has like this certain method of shooting movies that's just basically like

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.560
cheap.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.980
No, not found footage either.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:31.980
I don't know.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:32.980
It's yeah, I don't know.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.740
Speaking of found footage, do you see there's another trailer or new trailer for a Blair

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:37.740
witch movie?

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:43.060
Apparently the woods is in fact a Blair witch sequel and everybody's losing their fucking

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.120
mind about it because this is a proper sequel.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:50.980
Unlike the big studio one they did a couple of years after the first movie, I guess they're

01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.540
kind of, I thought it was like a reboot or something.

01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:56.280
I didn't actually know this is a set in the same universe.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.100
It's the girl's brother from the first movie.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.100
Yeah.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.660
So I guess there is, are they doing all found footage like, or still, you know, it didn't

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:05.660
seem like it.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:10.700
It was a trailer cause it didn't look like it kind of, it didn't look like found footage,

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.940
but they shot it like a shaky movie kind of like, I think they're, so I think they wanted

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.920
to get away from found footage cause a lot of movies do that now, the horror movies,

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.800
but they still kind of wanted to keep that cause remember the big thing with the original

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.660
was that like the camera shakes so much you're going to barf cause it's just like on the

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.660
big screen in the theater.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.400
It was a big problem when it first came out.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.740
So I think they still want to kind of keep that style of like violent, you know, movie,

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.740
but violent nausea.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:37.740
Yeah.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.160
Anyway, I don't know what that has to do with games, but maybe, maybe there'll be a video

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160
game tie in.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.640
They had a Blair Witch video game.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.640
Did they have a Blair Witch video game?

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.640
I think it was a PC game.

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.400
I think you're on PlayStation one.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.680
I feel like there was something maybe, maybe, I don't know, maybe not.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:54.000
I could have made that up anyway.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
This is kind of cute.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:04.120
A Twitter account for Xbox in the UK posted re-imagined Xbox games as Pokemon Go.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.120
That's right.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:09.200
You can check this out on their Twitter from Xbox UK that says we've caught the Pokemon

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.520
Go fever and couldn't help but wonder what some of our games might look like.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:18.340
And there's some doctored screens of Forza Go, Crackdown Go, and Halo Go.

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.320
And obviously it's just a little tongue in cheek thing, you know, making a joke about

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.840
Pokemon Go like a lot of companies are doing.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.380
But what was funny about it is that they're all showing that they're running on Windows

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:30.640
phones, which Pokemon Go, they don't have Windows phone support.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.640
That's why they have to.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.040
So they have to come up with their own thing.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:39.820
But then it also kind of made me think like I would totally play Forza Go, but they have

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:44.440
to think of a way to keep it safe because obviously it can't be about racing and the

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.000
things that you do in Forza.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.400
It's all the opposite stuff that like Ingress and Pokemon Go, it's like it only counts your

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:53.820
distance if you're moving, you know, below, you know, 20 some miles an hour.

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.560
It's like it only counts your distance if you're moving over that.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.680
Over the speed limit is what would count the speed limit.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.880
They have to do something safe.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880
I don't know.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:07.440
Yyr in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Crackdown Go sounds awesome.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.320
Skills for kills agents, skills for kills.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.080
I think wasn't there supposed to be some game somebody was talking about in one of the Ingress

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.040
Hangouts I think where like you actually use your phone to like kill people.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.040
Yes, actually.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.040
No, it is a thing.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.960
It's an Indiegogo project right now.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.720
I don't remember the fuck it's called.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:24.880
It's like laser tag.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:30.560
So you you get a case that goes on your phone and you use your phone like you hold your

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:34.440
phone out in front of you to basically shoot the other players.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.440
Huh.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440
So it is a thing.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.480
DarkTetsuya in chat suggests a future list list on Go game we want to see.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.760
We might have to schedule that for a future week.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.200
Also Tigerclaw wanted to link us to this before we get to your news.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:53.480
There was a Blair Witch trilogy of video games, in fact, on Windows based PCs.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:59.240
There was Blair Witch Volume 1, Rust and Par, Volume 2, The Legend of Coffin Rock, and Volume

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240
3.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240
Oh, that's what it was called.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.240
It was called Father I.O.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.280
The Ellie Kedward tale.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:12.400
Yeah, Father I.O. is the laser tag game that's on Indiegogo and they're saying or it's the

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.880
I'm sorry, Father I.O.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.160
It's what is it called here?

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:19.120
It's I don't think it's actually called Father I.O.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:25.000
It's the god load you stupid page.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Internet difficulties.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.360
No, they're just like, it's garbage.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:37.080
Basically, no, no, we're just not going to do this fucking have to log in to see your

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080
stupid page.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.680
No, that's not going to happen.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:45.760
They have like, yeah, the interceptor is what they're calling the actual like gun thing.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:51.280
And it looks like it's basically they're calling it the first real life, massively multiplayer

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.120
laser tag game.

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.700
So let me see if I can spin this around here.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:00.720
So this is basically what it looks like, which is great radio for you to be a visual right

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.720
now.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:07.560
Go search the Googles for father that I.O. or OK, Indiegogo laser tag.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.560
Looks very Tron.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560
Yeah.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.920
So you get that thing and then you basically slap it on your phone and it has, you know,

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.480
they're saying it's Bluetooth.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.760
It's got some infrared receivers, emitters and a built in battery so that you can play

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.760
a little bit longer.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.360
But yeah, that's the game is basically we're running around shooting each other.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360
All right.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.400
I don't know how we got on that topic from Pokemon Go clones, but that's all right.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.920
Let's move on.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.400
What what what what would have dark soccer talk to us about tonight?

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.780
Should we talk about grandiose three?

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:43.980
It's now going to be available on the PlayStation store.

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:48.160
And yeah, it's under the PlayStation two classics banner.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.100
You can check it out.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:54.500
Also, I think, yeah, it's going to be ten dollars.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.460
I will wait until a sale or something.

01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:01.300
Yeah, again, one of those games to wait for Black Friday.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.700
Yeah, exactly.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.700
Or the flash sale.

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:04.700
Not necessarily.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:12.220
Animal Crossing New Leaf is getting some amiibo based updates later this year.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:16.940
So they're going to be adding content, of course, before the Amiibos only worked with

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:21.780
that happy home designer, which, I'll be honest, is kind of a waste of a Pokemon game animal

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:23.240
crossing game.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.060
But they're going to be adding compatibility later this year.

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:30.940
And it's going to basically be supporting both the Amiibos and the Amiibo cards.

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:34.180
And what exactly is it going to do?

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.340
I don't know.

01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:39.300
Basically, they're saying that they have new animals as well.

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:42.900
They're going to be showing off them, including some that look like Callie and Marie from

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:49.540
Splatoon, as well as a squid themed house, or, you know, I don't know.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.300
That'd be kind of neat.

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.900
And new figures, I guess, are going to be released as well.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:59.660
So it looks neat.

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.660
I don't know.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:03.820
I didn't play this really on the 3DS, but I mean, it's kind of cool that they're adding

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:08.740
this, especially for a game that came out back in 2012, I mean, it's kind of amazing

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.820
to even see updates for that.

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:16.380
But I guess if you can do that and sell some more Amiibos in the process, why not?

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:20.300
I never really understood the point of happy home designer, but I think, you know, full

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.220
fledged animal crossing game is pretty cool.

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:25.060
Does this mean we're going to see some more updates for older games as well?

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:28.820
I mean, other older games, that'd be kind of cool.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:33.780
I love that they're going back and like updating a really old title, even if it's, you know,

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:36.420
Amiibo stuff, but still, I think that's pretty cool.

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:37.420
Yeah.

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:41.860
And like they're showing that, like I said, you know, they have the Amiibo stuff for like,

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.940
they have Splatoon themed stuff in there.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.620
So that's kind of neat that you'll be able to use your Amiibos for something.

01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:52.140
I'm always about, you know, having more, you know, make those things have a purpose, you

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:55.580
know, have some more support in these games and there should be more of them that support

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.340
them if you're going to push this platform.

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:02.700
YYR in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Nintendo has announced that the primary function

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:06.460
of Animal Crossing New Leaf's Amiibo support is to incite a Loki rant.

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.460
I know this is true.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.460
I read it on the internet.

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:13.740
And they have also got, was it, they're showing off, let's see, what else do they have here?

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.740
Oh, that's about it.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:15.740
Yeah.

01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.740
So neat.

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:17.740
Okay.

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:18.740
Yeah.

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:22.180
I mean, I don't really care too much about Pokemon on 3DS.

01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:28.180
I mean, it's, I don't know Pokemon, Animal Crossing.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.180
It's cool.

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.460
I mean, might as well support these older titles.

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:36.100
I mean, I'm just surprised that we haven't heard of a new Animal Crossing game yet, but

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.100
I guess that's for the NX.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:42.660
If the NX really is a console slash handheld hybrid, Animal Crossing seems like a perfect

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.660
fit for that, but we'll see.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:46.660
Time will tell.

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:47.660
Yeah.

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:48.660
All right.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.460
Let's, let's go to, how was your gaming week?

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:52.900
Cause we never did that at the beginning of the show.

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.980
So I think now's a good opportunity for us to take a trip and talk about what we've been

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.660
playing this week.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:02.220
I think I probably forgot cause I don't have a lot of new stuff in my gaming week, but

01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.540
maybe you, you had a different experience.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:04.540
Loki, I don't know.

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.540
No, I did not.

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:08.820
And I didn't get to play any console games this week because once again, my wife has

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.420
been monopolizing the TV.

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:13.540
Thankfully we've taken a break or as I used to say, she's taking a break from watching

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:19.260
Grazing Anatomy so that we can watch, um, Stranger Things, but, and you know, eventually

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:25.980
that's going to end and it's just going to be the Grazing Anatomy repeat of all 10 seasons

01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:26.980
again.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:27.980
God.

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:30.100
I hate that show.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:35.900
Uh, so no, this week I've been playing Pokemon Go a little bit.

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:39.180
Um, a lot of it's been mainly just to and from work.

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.580
I've never really been playing, you know, the only time I actually went out and played

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:47.580
was like, uh, you know, this weekend I took my son to the mall to play it.

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:52.220
Um, we wanted to go downtown or somewhere outdoors, but it just didn't work out.

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:57.700
Like you know, the weather that we have right now, it's like 90 like at 10 o'clock.

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:02.380
It's just, it's not good unless you get out there like super early, which we just didn't

01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:03.940
cause I had to get my car as long.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:09.620
Um, so I played that, I played Ingress just enough to, um, you know, keep all my streaks

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.620
going and everything.

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:14.660
And I actually did do some fielding stuff because I was in the areas to do that and

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:18.780
it's been a lot easier now that with the local drama and everything to be able to take over

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:19.780
certain areas.

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:24.260
Um, so been doing that and then of course, you know, tap my katamari, been playing that

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.260
a little bit.

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:28.740
Um, this game really has no point, so eventually I'll get bored with it.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:35.100
Um, but for now I just, you know, playing for really no reason cause there's no point

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.100
to the game.

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:39.940
Uh, I have to admit my gaming week has not been that exciting.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:44.460
I was still playing Final Fantasy 14, which got the deep dungeon patch this week, which

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:49.220
was, it was okay, but I was just, I was hoping it would be a little more solo friendly and

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:54.420
it definitely seems like the deep dungeon is, and, and you know, if you don't know or

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:58.220
following Final Fantasy 14 news, it's basically like a randomly generated dungeon that you

01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:03.540
can run, um, over and over again as a, it's kind of like a different, like little side

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:07.180
thing, like an exploration side thing that they've put in the game basically.

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:11.620
Um, but it's not tuned very well for solo play.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:16.380
Uh, I mean if you want to do like super hard mode and I guess that's the point of it, you

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.540
can do solo play, but then if you're playing with like four people, you can practically

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:20.700
steamroll through it.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:24.300
So I don't know, I feel like I would have liked the balance to have been a little different

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:28.300
or even maybe customizable with different rewards and that would have been very cool.

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.300
But uh, yeah, I don't know.

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:34.820
It just, I like it more than the last exploration thing they tried to do, which was the Diadem.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:38.060
Um, but uh, it's, I was kind of hoping for more.

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:42.700
Um, I also checked out on the PlayStation 4 this week and I did a quick live stream earlier.

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:47.420
Uh, I did a live stream for Gradius 2, which they released on the PlayStation 4 as part

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.040
of the Arcade Archives.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.020
And one thing I learned during the live stream is that boy, am I fucking terrible at Gradius

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:58.700
2, which is the song that, or which is the game that Burning Heat came from, uh, in the

01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:59.700
first stage.

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.060
Remember that old, uh, DDR 2DX song?

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.060
Yeah.

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.860
So, uh, you could watch me play that game for a little while and be very, very, very

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:10.340
terrible at it on the archives on my Twitch channel at Rob Rogers.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.540
So like all games you play.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:12.540
Oh, hi Shane.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.540
How are you?

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:14.540
Hello.

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:15.540
Fine.

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:16.540
I'm tired.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:17.540
Thank you for randomly dropping in the show and blessing us with your presence.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.540
How are you?

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:19.540
You're welcome.

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.540
I'm so sleepy.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.540
Why are you late?

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:23.060
You could have been here to fill in for Dark Sakura.

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.100
Okay.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.460
So I've been moving all day, so I'm exhausted.

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:33.460
And me and my friend, we went and saw Spirited Away in the theaters on 35.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.740
I thought your friend was going to stay and be on the show.

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.180
No, he's got stuff he needs to do.

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.300
He'd probably be more interesting than you, but.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.300
Wow.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:44.220
Well, I guess we're going to turn off this mic a whole bunch tonight just to annoy you.

01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:48.100
Oh, and I've got all these things I can rustle too, because I haven't finished my food.

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:52.420
He knows that's my pet peeve when he rustles the fricking paper on the microphone.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:53.780
Okay.

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:54.780
No, all kidding aside.

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:55.780
So you went in some movies.

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.780
Yeah.

01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:57.780
Yeah.

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.780
We saw Spirited Away at a local theater.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.940
They had it on 35 millimeter film.

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.860
I've never even seen that movie.

01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.460
So it was my first time seeing it and it was subbed, not dubbed.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:07.460
Oh, interesting.

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:08.460
What'd you think?

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.460
It was good.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:15.820
It, like, I don't know, the way they kind of wrapped everything up really quick at the

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:20.060
end was annoying, but I also didn't want to sit there for another two hours just so they

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.740
could wrap everything up.

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:25.500
But it was still a good movie, despite it sounding like I'm complaining about it.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:26.500
I'd see it again.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.060
And that theater was cool.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.060
I really liked that theater.

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.060
Oh, yeah.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.060
It's a gorgeous theater.

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.060
Yeah.

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.060
Akuma JP in chat asks, why?

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:36.660
And I'm not sure if that's a question about Gradius 2 or if that's a question about Spirited

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.700
Away, because this is kind of a random thing to just show on the big screen out of nowhere,

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:40.700
but.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:41.700
Yeah.

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:42.700
They're doing another one.

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:43.700
They're doing Howl's Moving Castle on August 14th.

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.700
Oh, that's a really good one.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.340
I'll be at Power Morphicon, so I'll be able to see it.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:48.340
I'll go without you.

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:49.340
All right.

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:50.340
Sounds like a plan.

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.340
Yeah.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:52.940
And it says, OK, why now?

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:53.940
Spirited Away.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:54.940
I don't know.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.420
I just they I don't know.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:00.420
Apparently, they showed it yesterday and the demand was so great that they decided to do

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:01.420
it again today.

01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.780
And it was like packed that entire theater was full.

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:08.740
This is also like one of the art house cinemas downtown.

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.660
It's not one that usually plays a lot of mainstream movies.

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.500
So I think once in a while they do special screenings to play all the Pokemon movies

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.860
out of there.

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:19.540
I'm using my quotey fingers, cult movies.

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:20.820
They seem to do that once in a while.

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:21.820
Yeah.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:24.060
They also like it's the theater that will play A Wonderful Life.

01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:25.380
It's a Wonderful Life at Christmas.

01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:26.380
Yeah.

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:27.380
On their marquee.

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:29.980
They had like they're going to have weird science there and Lethal Weapon.

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:30.980
Awesome.

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:34.220
So, yeah, they do that, I guess.

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:35.860
But not Rocky Horror Picture Show.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.860
Thank goodness.

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:37.860
Shut up.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.460
We've been trying to do that at that theater for years.

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:41.540
I can see why it has a stage and everything.

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:44.540
Well, so does the one we do it at now has all that, too.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:47.420
But the location for that one is great.

01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:48.420
Anyway.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.420
All right.

01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.420
So we were talking about How Was Your Gaming Week?

01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:52.020
So I was talking about Gradius 2.

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:58.380
And then I wanted to mention real quick, I also this week may have spent a little money

01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.900
to reactivate World of Warcraft.

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:06.300
And yeah, I've been playing with the guys from gamebuoy.org in their guild.

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:07.580
I don't know.

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.580
They had a big patch this week.

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:11.460
I was curious.

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.580
Fourteen has kind of slowed down a lot.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:17.080
I mean, yeah, they had the deep dungeon patch, but I don't know, I'm kind of just waiting

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.940
on the expansion for Fourteen.

01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:23.540
So now seemed like a good time to check out WoW and see what's kind of changed and different.

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.500
And you know, it's inevitable that as somebody who did play WoW for years and years and even

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:32.020
had a podcast on it at one time, I have to at least check out the expansion.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:36.900
I think as a player that played so long, you are required to like even I'm required to.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:37.900
Yeah.

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.740
And so as much as you might want to roll your eyes, you know, I am rolling my eyes because

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:43.340
you pay like I wanted to see the changes.

01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.620
And so I just made a trial character.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:51.860
It's not a great way to see the changes, but I'm not paying Blizzard yet.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.020
Yet is the key word there.

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.020
Just saying.

01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:55.020
Yeah.

01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:56.020
All right.

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.260
Um, let's see.

01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.620
That's really it for my gaming week.

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:01.380
Isn't that enough between all the standard stuff?

01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:03.020
I mean, I dipped into Diablo three.

01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:06.680
I didn't even realize season six ended at some point and they're starting season seven

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:07.680
in a couple of weeks.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.620
I had to dip into Diablo three, but not a lot, a lot of L's.

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:11.980
Shane, how about you?

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:12.980
So she just joined us.

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:13.980
How was your gaming week?

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.980
What kind of video games you played this week?

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.340
Um, I played Pokemon.

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:18.540
That's that's how I play.

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:25.140
Like for real, I can't not Pokemon go cause I'm like, as I talked about on the podcast

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:32.460
that we have for Pokemon, um, which I forget the name of it right now, um, just things

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.460
slipped my mind.

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.460
The pokey.

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:35.460
Stop podcast.

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:36.460
There you go.

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.460
Stop for all the Pokemon chat.

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:42.500
Anyway, that three foot bug or whatever is just really, really terrible.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.580
But that's why you use pokey vision.

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:49.900
But I don't want to have to use something extra just to be able to hunt them down because

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:51.620
I like going saves you.

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:55.060
It saves you time for having to hunt them down because you can go, okay, I need this

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.060
one.

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.060
Oh, it's right there.

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.060
But that's not the fun of Pokemon.

01:29:58.060 --> 01:29:59.060
Go for me.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:02.940
The fun of Pokemon go is getting with friends and then just like looking at the radar and

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:06.220
seeing what's near and then if something pops up, we start to hunt it.

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:10.300
It's not like I'm, I do want to go to like the Dratini farm that's in Sacramento.

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:16.440
But beyond that, I just like driving around and oh look, there's a freaking something

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.440
or other.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.740
I don't even know why I'm missing at this point, but I like that aspect and that bug

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:22.940
is ruining it for me.

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:27.860
But I'm talking about Pokemon X, Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire.

01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:33.700
I just play that constantly shiny hunting and I redid or I'm still in the process of

01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:37.460
redoing my info chart thing.

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:41.180
Just so you know, Pokevision says there's a Vulpix down the street.

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.180
Don't even care.

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:43.520
Four minutes left on it.

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:48.660
That's cool for that Vulpix who's going to go get murdered by people.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:53.900
But I redid my little spreadsheet and I, you know, I was on our podcast, I was like, oh,

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.900
I'm just like above 60 barely maybe.

01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:59.660
No, I'm pushing 70 now apparently after doing all my updates.

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:03.300
So I am over 10% of the way done.

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:06.140
So that makes me happy.

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:07.140
And that's it.

01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.140
Cause I don't play any other games.

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:09.140
All right.

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.620
Well, Pokemon is a big investment.

01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:11.620
Yeah.

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:13.620
Let's yeah.

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:20.140
Between all the copies I'm getting for Sun and Moon at this point, I'm at eight copies

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:26.300
of that game total when it comes out between the games I'm going to keep and the ones I'm

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.500
gifting.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:34.180
So Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, remember he lives in Japan and says my Yo-kai

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:39.340
Watch 3 is like collecting dust now ever since Pokemon Go released here.

01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:41.820
Interesting timing how that worked.

01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:47.980
I wonder if they did that on purpose because what didn't Yo-kai Watch 3 have like no competition

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:48.980
right when it came out.

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:49.980
Like no other games released.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:53.860
Yeah, we did the, we went over the releases the other week and yeah, nothing else was

01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:54.860
out that week.

01:31:54.860 --> 01:32:00.340
So that is some clever timing because a lot of people are like that.

01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.220
Whether it was intentional or not.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:03.220
That's gotta be intentional.

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:07.420
I gotta say though, I think the Yo-kai event that's coming to Final Fantasy 14 looks really

01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:08.420
cute.

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.420
I really want that ghost mount.

01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:17.100
Yeah, it is a, it's a cute event that's coming, but still, that's crazy that that had to be

01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:18.100
planned.

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.940
You know what, you can actually get that Vulpix right now because it's within distance from

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:20.940
us.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:23.580
I should turn on Pokemon Go.

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.580
I haven't done it all today.

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:26.420
Well, now that's a different story, right Shane?

01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:28.700
Yeah, cause I don't have to get up.

01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:29.700
Just sit right here.

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:34.340
I think I should bring up my phone as well and make Loki do another story here at Orange

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:35.340
Lounge Radio.

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.060
I would assume by now you caught the Vulpix anyway.

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:40.220
No, I don't know.

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:44.200
I know I did in the beta, but like, you know, a lot of these Pokemon that were in the beta

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.380
that were just all over the place, you know, like, oh, hey, cool.

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:50.220
It's doing the fucking curveball glitch again.

01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:51.220
That's awesome.

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.220
Curveball glitch?

01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:54.500
I fucking like just throwing my balls in nowhere.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:59.260
Out of context, that's an amazing, even Shane's laughing.

01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:02.100
Okay, seriously, fuck this bullshit.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:07.900
Well, we'll just put you on hold for a while.

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:11.420
Anyways, seriously, fix your shit.

01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:17.220
This is kind of tragic, you know, because it was a promo for like a video game that

01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.620
is kind of okay.

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:24.100
I mean, I don't know, but they were doing a promo shoot for that brand new Ubisoft extreme

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:31.260
sports game called Steep, and there was a pro skier, Matilda Rapinport, who got caught

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:35.060
in an avalanche during the shoot and died.

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.620
So absolutely tragic.

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:41.140
That's got to be a terrible way to go, but of course, you know, they're deeply saddened

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:47.940
to learn that she's died, and, you know, she's a remarkable free-skiing athlete.

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:50.620
And yeah, that was pretty terrible.

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:53.860
That's, yeah, that's tragic that that happened.

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:58.700
I mean, I guess it's not totally about video games, but it just also goes to show that

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:04.100
these commercials and stuff, you know, sometimes they do some really extreme stuff to show

01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:05.100
on the television.

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:09.100
I wonder if they'll memorialize certain games somehow.

01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:10.380
I think they would have to.

01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:11.380
I really hope they do.

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.380
I really hope they do.

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:16.460
Well, to try and lighten the mood a little bit, let's talk about LEGO Dimensions and

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:19.060
some new expansion packs that are coming out for LEGO Dimensions.

01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:21.540
Now, we already knew about this because of E3.

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:26.500
They've already talked about these new packs, but we got some of the details about when

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.940
and what we're getting.

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:33.460
So, first off, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which will be, I guess, six

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:37.380
new levels and new bricks for the LEGO Gateway.

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:40.180
It's, yeah, that's pretty cool.

01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:42.460
I guess there's two packs that actually come with this.

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:46.300
There's a story pack and a second pack that's like a fun pack.

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.780
So they're doing a lot for this, but they're expecting this movie to be...

01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:52.340
So is the story pack not fun because they had to make a fun pack also?

01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:56.820
No, I think the fun pack is just a different figure and I don't think it actually has the

01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:59.980
levels in it, so there are probably different prices is what it is.

01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:04.020
The Sonic the Hedgehog pack will have a new level with locations from Sonic games, including

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:07.020
Green Hill, Emerald Coast, Labyrinth, and more.

01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:11.060
They'll have a Sonic mini figure and a three-in-one Sonic speedster.

01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:15.720
Wait, real quick, speaking of Sonic, did we already cover the Sonic stuff from this week?

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.420
We did, but I'm sure you have something to say.

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:21.340
I just want to talk about the music from the trailer, how I kept that on loop like crazy

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:23.260
because it was so good.

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:25.780
And I also want to talk about for Loki right now that I caught that Vulpix.

01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:26.780
Yeah, I did too.

01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:27.780
That was like an hour ago.

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:32.020
Yes, let me describe the series of events that happened with Vulpix.

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:36.940
So first we had the stupid, you know, curveball glitch thing, which didn't fucking work.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.060
What is the curveball glitch?

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:41.700
The curveball glitch is basically where when you're throwing, normally to do a curveball

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:44.300
you have to make little circles and then you throw.

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:48.060
A curveball glitch means it just fucking does it when it fucking feels like it.

01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:49.060
Oh, well that...

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:51.940
And it will keep doing it just because it fucking feels like it.

01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:52.940
And then on top of that...

01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:54.020
I think it's Logi's phone.

01:35:54.020 --> 01:36:01.460
And then on top of that, so I, you know, I closed the app down, put it back up, and then,

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:08.140
or no, I'm sorry, I, you know, put it to sleep, brought it back up again, that was fixed.

01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:12.300
I threw the thing and then it started doing it again.

01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:15.980
Close it, put it back up again, or, you know, put it to sleep, put it back.

01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:19.900
GPS lost, the whole thing fucking froze.

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:24.420
Closed the whole app down, brought it back, Vulpix spawned again, and immediately disappeared.

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:27.660
So fuck this fucking game.

01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:29.580
Can I, can I go back to talking about Legos, please?

01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:33.620
Because the next one is Gremlins, and I kind of think Shane wants to know the details about

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.620
the Gremlins pack.

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.620
Yes, please, because I do love Gremlins.

01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:41.420
Okay, so the Gremlins team pack will have rivals Gizmo and Stripe Lego minifigures.

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:47.660
You can rebuild the 3-in-1 RC Racer vehicle into the Gadget, Omatic, and Scarlet Scorpion,

01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:52.100
and the 3-in-1 Flash and Finish into Rampage, Record Player, and Stripe's Throne.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.300
I wish they were doing Gremlins 2 instead, because I think that would lend itself better

01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:02.380
to Lego Dimensions because it's so goofy, whereas Gremlins 1, while kind of goofy, was

01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:04.060
also pretty dark.

01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:07.840
ET, the Extra Terrestrial, is out also.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.260
It will have an ET Lego minifigure, and you can build the Phone Home device and rebuild

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:16.320
it into Mobile Uplink and Supercharged Satellite.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.520
And then lastly, Adventure Time.

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:23.760
The Adventure Time fun pack will have Marceline the Vampire Queen as a Lego minifigure, and

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:27.980
then you can build the Lunatic Amp to make some noise and rebuild it into the Shadow

01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:32.120
Scorpion and Heavy Metal Monster for extra in-game powers.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.120
So there you go.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.080
That is some details on the upcoming Lego packs.

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.480
Cool.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.680
They're all coming out in November, by the way.

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.320
Let's move on with, I guess I'll do this one, unless you have it up, Loki.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.320
Jamie's next story.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.680
I have them all up.

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.040
Okay, you want to talk about this then?

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.400
Yeah, we can talk about it.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.760
So this is kind of different.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:58.400
I'm not sure how wide of an audience this is going to be for, but Square Enix is developing

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:06.720
a game specifically for the Apple Watch, and it's a game called Chaos Rings.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:13.480
Or it's from a series, Chaos Rings, but now it's a spinoff called Cosmos Rings, which

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:15.160
you can only play on an Apple Watch.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.640
And they don't really have any other details other than it's going to release later this

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:21.640
summer.

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.400
I'm very curious to know how with that tiny screen, but I'm sure that's what a lot of

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.400
people are thinking right now, is how's that going to work with such a tiny screen, but

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400
we'll see.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.960
You have some screenshots.

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.680
It doesn't really look like much.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:43.680
Is it something that maybe teams up with your phone or with a Mac or something that would

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.680
maybe elaborate?

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:45.680
I don't know.

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:46.680
Maybe.

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:47.680
I don't know.

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.680
It just doesn't look like much.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.680
I would not be interested to play this.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:50.680
It almost looks like...

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:57.480
It reminds me of a higher definition version of those PocketStation games.

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:03.800
They're very limited, lower resolution, they kind of played in conjunction with other things,

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:07.320
but it just doesn't look that great at all.

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.480
I don't really know what the point of it is.

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.200
All right.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.240
So you also have some Pokemon Go news for us.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.560
Boy, we can't stop talking about this game.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.480
Make this quick, because some people in chat are like, oh God, they're talking about Go

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.480
again.

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.480
It's the biggest thing in gaming right now.

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:22.460
Yeah, so Pokemon Go, it's launched in Japan.

01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:23.720
That's a pretty big deal.

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.640
So they did that.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:28.120
And also France, actually.

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.520
So it launched in France as well.

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:36.040
And then, this is a little bit more regional, but Zipcar, which is I guess like an Uber

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:41.080
or something like that, they're doing free chauffeured rides for Pokemon Go players in

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.080
Boston.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:47.960
So you can, you know, normally you would rent those cars, I guess.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:53.640
So Zalenny reserved the cars to go play around the city.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.120
Neat, I guess.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.120
I guess, yeah.

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.000
How did you make money off that, though?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.400
Maybe it's a brand awareness thing.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:10.880
Yeah, they're also supplying snacks, water, and phone chargers for those playing Pokemon

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.880
Go.

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.800
All right.

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.440
Let's talk about something that might be too little, too late.

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.440
I don't know.

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:22.280
But Nintendo this week released a demo to Star Fox Zero.

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.280
That's right.

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.440
If you want to check out Star Fox Zero, you can actually check out a free downloadable

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440
demo.

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.440
There's pretty much the game's tutorial mode, and there's also the Battle Begins animated

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.240
short tacked on there.

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:36.640
So it should give you a good feel if you're going to actually enjoy the game or not, which

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.720
a lot of critics didn't.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.600
But a lot of people seem to like it well enough.

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.960
I don't think I was hearing a lot of bad feedback, but I don't think the game sold very well

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:46.960
either.

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:51.280
So I'm really surprised that Nintendo didn't try to push this demo a lot sooner.

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.660
I mean, I understand if maybe they didn't want it out there week one, but I'm really

01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:00.340
surprised they didn't get it out there within the first month because Star Fox Zero came

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:02.300
out what, like three months ago?

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:03.300
I don't know.

01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:07.980
Anyway, Nintendo may be changing things up because a free version of Metroid Prime Blast

01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:14.220
Ball also came out, and this is before Federation Force, which is supposed to include this as

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:15.220
a part of it.

01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:20.140
So interesting that they are putting that out a little early to try to raise awareness

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.820
for Federation Force, which I didn't realize is only a month away.

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.220
Holy moly.

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:31.300
Maybe I'll check out the Star Fox Zero demo just to see if, kind of what I think.

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:35.020
How many times do they get to play the demo because of this bullshit that they have these

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:38.460
stupid play limited demos?

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:41.180
I don't know if it has a play limit or if it does, they're not talking about it.

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.620
It probably does.

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.900
Like all their demos do.

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:47.540
Yeah, but have you ever hit or even gotten close to the limit?

01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:48.540
Even Bravely Default?

01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:49.720
But why even have a limit?

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.720
It's a fucking demo.

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.260
I don't understand that.

01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:55.940
Oh well, if they could play the demo a bunch of times, then you're just not gonna buy the

01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:56.940
game.

01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:01.780
If your game is that fucking lame that a demo can suffice for you, the gameplay in it, then

01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:04.980
your game is not good enough.

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:05.980
I don't know.

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:10.420
I don't know the logic behind it either, but I'm assuming it's so that it can't exist years

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:12.220
and years and years from now or something.

01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.220
I don't know.

01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:14.220
That's dumb.

01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:21.060
Or it's like everybody learned their lesson after Konami with P.T., like that overshadowed

01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:23.820
anything that they're ever gonna do for the rest of their history.

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.260
Good point.

01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:33.900
All right, let's go to our mailbag.

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:39.340
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and usually Dark

01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:43.700
Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read her favorite emails for you.

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:49.340
However, since she is out unexpectedly tonight, I will be taking on that role bravely in her

01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:50.340
behalf.

01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:55.260
Maybe you can still, of course, always send us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:42:55.260 --> 01:43:00.500
Let's get to our first email tonight from Andy R., who's emailing us about, guess what?

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.500
Pokemon Go.

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.500
That's right, Pokemon Go.

01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:06.220
Hey, some more Pokemon Go for you, because why not?

01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:09.340
It's almost like he knew what tonight's show is gonna turn into.

01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:12.180
First, I do wanna say that I agree with Loki.

01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:14.620
The game's mechanics really aren't that good.

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:18.300
The gym fighting is especially boring and exacerbated by the server troubles that make

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:21.460
it near impossible for me to even fight gyms.

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:25.760
Somehow the game has its hooks in me, though, and I've been taking a lot of midnight walks

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.020
to catch Pokemon when I would otherwise be avoiding this Phoenix heat.

01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:34.120
Side note, my FU of the week goes to Niantic for releasing this during the time of year

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:37.100
when it's 110 degrees almost every day.

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.100
You poor soul.

01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:42.900
Anyway, uh, second, and what I really wanna get to, but why is this game bringing out

01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:44.880
the assholes so much?

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:49.000
Maybe it's just my Twitter or Facebook, but recently the number of Pogo posts is starting

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.240
to be outweighed by the I'm not playing Pokemon Go because I'm not 10 years old posts.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:58.020
On a base level I can get it, the pushback against something that's popular or getting

01:43:58.020 --> 01:43:59.020
a lot of hype.

01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:04.400
I feel the same every Superb Owl season, or when people are going nuts for a new Call

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.840
of Duty game, a series I've never been into.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.480
But I feel like what sets the Pogo hate apart is how much it seems to be targeting the players

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.420
more than the game itself.

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:17.660
The cultural zeitgeist that preceded the Star Wars movie last year was certainly accompanied

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:22.660
by a ton of the the Star Wars movies really aren't that good counterculture, but I didn't

01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:25.940
see anyone calling Star Wars fans fat or lazy.

01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:30.740
Meanwhile, every other anti-Pogo post insinuates that players are basement-dwelling neonates

01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:35.780
with a severe lack of social skills or talking about how the poster doesn't need a stupid

01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:37.780
app to get them to exercise.

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:42.060
Andy, when they say those things, they're only talking about team instinct.

01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:44.980
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm not...

01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:50.460
Don't take that seriously, I'm not getting into the team war hype, but sometimes it's

01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:52.740
a little fun to throw a little shade, a little shade.

01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:57.380
Andy R. concludes, what do you think of the reactions to this game, or is this just the

01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:58.860
internet being the internet?

01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:02.260
Thanks, Andy R. What do you think?

01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:06.980
Shane, what do you think of all the anti-Pogo stuff that's out there?

01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:08.540
I don't really see it, to be honest.

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.580
Well, you don't even log into Facebook, really, right?

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.580
Is that why?

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:15.700
It's on Twitter, and what did I see today after I got out of the movie?

01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:24.060
Everybody going crazy over actual artwork of the leaders from Pokemon Go, and it's like

01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:30.700
everybody's still having a good time, and I see an occasional celebrity or faux celebrity

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:35.420
have to say something like, oh, this is worthless, go do something better.

01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:41.020
But that's it, normal, genuine people on Twitter seem to be like, this is so much fun, and

01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:44.300
I love socializing with everybody and getting out and doing this.

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:50.500
I think it is a large part the internet being the internet, and because on social media,

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:56.860
a lot of people crave attention, because it's very easy to get on social media.

01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:02.780
And sometimes the quickest way to get attention is to run counterculture against whatever

01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:05.060
is the big thing right now.

01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:06.660
And I think this happens with a lot of stuff.

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.220
I don't think it's necessarily limited to video games.

01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:14.420
Like you illustrated in your email, it's about movies.

01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:21.860
I think it's a huge part of why politics is so fucking gross this year, even compared

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:25.140
to eight years ago, four years ago.

01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:30.260
I think just more of the whole me, me, me, listen to me, and if you disagree with me,

01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:37.220
block unfriend and all that type of stuff, I think a lot of that plays into it, in my

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.220
opinion.

01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:39.220
I don't know.

01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:42.620
Loki, what do you think about the whole, why do people feel the need to shout from the

01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:44.860
rooftops that Pokemon Go is stupid?

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:46.860
Because people want attention.

01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:47.860
Yeah.

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:48.860
That's pretty much it.

01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:51.860
Is it getting them attention, though?

01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:55.020
Besides an eye roll, are they getting attention from these posts?

01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.020
Well, I think sometimes-

01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.020
I don't know.

01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.020
It depends who's saying it.

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:02.380
Especially when these celebrities are like, I don't get this stuff, and then they'll be

01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:05.540
the ones that denounce it, and then they'll try it, and they'll be the ones that are like,

01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:06.540
oh, this is so awesome.

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.780
Why aren't you doing this?

01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:13.100
And they'll completely, it's like, well, hey, but didn't a couple weeks ago you say that?

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:15.420
And it's just like, no, they're not going to acknowledge that.

01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:17.640
So quick little story about that.

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:23.380
There is a former Power Ranger actor on Instagram decided to post something trying to rally

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:26.180
support about how stupid this all was.

01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:29.380
He got no support and took that post down.

01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:30.380
I thought that was hilarious.

01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:34.140
It's like, nope, nobody's going to bite for your attention right there.

01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:35.140
Interesting.

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.140
Yes.

01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.900
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:42.780
Vid Power says, we need some Team Harmony up in here.

01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:47.780
Every time somebody says Team Harmony, this is my brain, I immediately think of the Harmony

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:49.860
Hut from Addams Family Values.

01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.860
Do you remember this?

01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:51.860
No.

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:52.860
What is that?

01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:53.860
Oh, come on.

01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:54.860
Somebody.

01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:57.580
They had to go to the Harmony Hut.

01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:01.820
It was kind of like the punishment where they had to watch Disney movies and it would force

01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:02.820
them to turn happy.

01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:04.200
I saw that movie so long ago.

01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.200
Somebody out there.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.200
I've never seen that movie.

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.200
Somebody has to fucking know what I'm talking about.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.940
Cause it's exactly what I think of when you talk about Team Harmony.

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:09.940
Oh, thank you.

01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.780
Akuma JB says, yes.

01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:12.780
Okay.

01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:18.160
JD says in chat, a lot of the hate comes from Facebook, the same kind of people who post

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:20.820
minions images.

01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.940
It's honest to God.

01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:25.540
It's really time for Facebook to die.

01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:29.480
And on a side note, some people have been asking me lately, like, where's the Fugu question

01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:30.780
of the week?

01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:34.740
And here I'm torn because did you not do in this week?

01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:35.740
I forgot.

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:36.740
I forgot.

01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:39.060
And I've been forgetting a lot recently, honestly.

01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:40.420
And you know, that's my bad.

01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:45.800
I find that I've been logging into Facebook less and less and once in a while I'll go

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:51.020
post something, but I'm almost like, then there's things like, I'll try to reply to

01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:52.020
someone's post.

01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:55.820
Like I replied to someone's post the other day with something like very well intentioned.

01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:02.780
And I got this, like, I kid you not six paragraph reply on how what I said was not taken the

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:04.540
way that I meant to say it.

01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:07.420
And that I was like, you know what, fuck Facebook.

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:08.420
Fuck you.

01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:09.420
Fuck Facebook.

01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:10.420
Fuck all this.

01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:11.420
Fuck your high horses.

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:12.420
I'm out.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.420
It's not Facebook.

01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.660
It's just dumb people and dumb people are everywhere.

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:16.660
But no way.

01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:18.280
Here's the problem I have with Facebook.

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.100
People are not inherently dumb.

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:22.500
I really don't believe I'm not that cynical.

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:28.280
That's not me, but Facebook really gives everybody a platform to fucking be dumb.

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.280
That's what it is.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.700
It extracts the dumbness out of people.

01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.740
That's what Facebook does.

01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:35.460
So there's a part of me, honest to God, even though I love that you guys participated in

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:39.460
it, it's probably with one of our, one of our most like interactive segments.

01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:43.900
There's a part of me that just wants to not contribute to Facebook culture.

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:45.820
Is that so wrong?

01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:48.900
That's my honest to God answer for where did the Facebook question of the week go?

01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:51.260
I don't want to help Facebook anymore.

01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:52.260
It sucks.

01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:57.580
That's why I just took my email, post the question at the end of the show, send in your

01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:58.580
emails.

01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:01.340
That's what we do on, on ranger pride.

01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:02.340
Kind of.

01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:08.060
We do put it on Facebook sometimes when either of us remembers, but Facebook to me lends

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:14.160
itself to giving people a really long winded platform to explain all of their thoughts

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.820
and stupid rationale.

01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:19.160
Sometimes like Twitter, you got this much room to try to type it in.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:21.920
So you only have this much room to be stupid.

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.900
And so it just works out better in my opinion.

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:27.800
Now, what I was going to say about Facebook though, is their fucking notifications are

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.980
still fucking pissing me off.

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:31.380
And I do everything in my power.

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:34.480
Like I've made sure that I dialed those notifications back.

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:40.820
Why am I getting fucking notified when a friend is commenting on his own picture or made it

01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:43.860
a, you know, posted that picture and made a comment on it.

01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:45.540
I didn't fucking like that picture.

01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.400
I didn't even see that picture.

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:51.380
I should not be getting fucking notifications on that shit.

01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:57.120
And I thought I turned that off and I know I've turned that off several times or in why

01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:01.040
like even comment on anybody's posts anymore because as soon as you do get fucking chain

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:05.100
of all the different people that have commented on it because Facebook needs to let you know,

01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:09.400
you need to know, uh, JD and chat says, I missed the live journal days.

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400
I do too.

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.400
And you know what?

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:14.500
The one big difference between live journal and Facebook was, was that I could disable

01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:17.980
the fucking comments anytime I wanted to on, on live journal.

01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:18.980
And I can't do that on Facebook.

01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:22.260
And I swear to God, it's the one thing that really, really, really holds Facebook back

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:23.260
sometimes.

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:24.260
I don't know.

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:25.940
I'm just, I'm just kind of over it.

01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:31.440
So I didn't mean for that to be a tangent and ER, but I guess, I guess the answer to

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:34.320
this question hit a fucking nerve somewhere along the line.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:37.940
And I, I, I, I guess that's the, my answer to your question.

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:41.860
Why do people feel the need to shout from the rooftops that they're anti something because

01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:44.160
social media fucking sucks sometimes.

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:46.180
That's that's, that's my answer.

01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:48.180
So why, why should I continue to support it?

01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.180
I don't know.

01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:50.180
Anyway.

01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:51.180
Uh, let's see.

01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:55.120
I'm looking at some other comments, uh, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:59.360
Fifth dream says, Twitter is worse for that now I turned off show tweets I might like,

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:01.600
Oh, I think he's talking about more of the reordering thing.

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:02.600
The thing I do kind of like,

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:05.520
Yeah, no Twitter with it's all here's stuff he missed.

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:06.520
I'm like, I don't care.

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.520
I can scroll down.

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:08.520
Here's people who should follow.

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:09.520
Nope.

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.520
I would have followed them by now.

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.920
Here's a like top tweets.

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.700
No, I don't care about that at all.

01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:14.700
That stuff is annoying.

01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:19.240
I just really like on Twitter that it forces people to keep it brief and it is very easy

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:22.060
for me to filter out stuff I don't want to see.

01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:25.700
I also don't like it how the Twitter app starts me off where I was last time.

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.460
So I have to scroll up through three days or two days, however long it's been since

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:32.180
I logged in to see the top tweets again.

01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:36.600
Um, but of course, Twitter, I mean not, I'm not praising Twitter cause Twitter has its

01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:41.940
own issues and we Lord knows we saw a ton of those this past week, but whatever.

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:48.460
Anyway, um, where else am I, uh, looking at more comments now the chat room is lighting

01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:50.340
up over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:55.780
Uh, let's see, Dar Tetsuya says, okay, stuff I missed is nice just so I don't have to spend

01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:59.020
all day on Twitter, but yeah, tweets you might like is dumb usually.

01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:00.020
I don't like that either.

01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:01.020
Um, okay.

01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:02.020
Anyway, sorry.

01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:06.660
Sorry for the tangent Andy R, but I hope you, I hope you're satisfied with the answer to

01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:09.020
the question.

01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:14.980
One more email tonight at participate at orangesontrader.com from Y Y R who says, hello L R I'm following

01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:17.780
up my email from last week with an update.

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:21.620
Following customer feedback, Dave and busters has decided to change course on their pricing

01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:27.500
for premium play on DDRA and now cost one credit as opposed to two and by now the setting

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.580
should have been adjusted at all locations.

01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:33.140
So as of now, normal and premium play both cost one credit.

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:37.820
In other words, there's no reason not to choose premium as you get extra insurance against

01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:42.580
failing out before your third song, the ability to earn extra stages and more for no extra

01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:43.580
charge.

01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:46.700
Note that this feature does require an E amusement card.

01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:50.780
Well, that would be the extra charge, but that's okay.

01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:52.940
It's a little bit, it's much less than what it was before.

01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:56.260
Uh, if you don't use a card, the option will not be available.

01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:00.940
Rob to answer your question, yes, all United States round one locations should also have

01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:03.860
the new North American version of DDRA as well.

01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:08.740
I will end my email by saying this, Rob, your game request from last week's episode has

01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:09.740
been heard.

01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:10.740
Oh joy.

01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:11.740
I don't even remember.

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:12.740
What are you talking?

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.540
I don't remember which game it was last week.

01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.540
I have a short term memory.

01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:16.740
Was it the grandma on the gun thing?

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:17.740
I don't know.

01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:20.540
Look, YYR will deliver it and I will be happy.

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:21.540
I know that.

01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:25.680
But um, I just, you know, one game at a time, YYR, you gotta, you gotta make sure multitasking

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:26.860
gets out first.

01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:29.860
You know, I heard he submitted snake party today though.

01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:30.860
That's exciting.

01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:36.620
I'm going to hit up round one on my trip back up to here in August and I will go look at

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:41.660
their DDR ace or whatever it's called machine and I'm not going to play it, but I just want

01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:43.500
to see if my songs are still on it.

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:46.740
Like, do I still have songs I made on there?

01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:48.140
Can't you just go up to Roseville?

01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:50.140
I mean, yeah, it's a Dave and Busters.

01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:54.220
I have to go to Dave and Busters.

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.980
What's some of the step art that you did in DDR games recently?

01:54:57.300 --> 01:55:02.860
I thought, yeah, because it still had Hottest Party stuff and I think that's kind of what's

01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.460
keeping my stuff alive is the Hottest Party stuff.

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:10.140
What are some of the songs you did the step art for that people might not know?

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:17.340
Beautiful Inside from Hottest Party and what else did I do?

01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:21.420
There were two songs in the next Hottest Party that I did.

01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:25.540
I don't remember the names, but I don't even know if they ever made it to the arcade, but

01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:29.220
I still have MP3s of them somewhere.

01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:31.020
Would your name still be in the credits of the game?

01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:32.420
I'm sure it's not anymore.

01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:35.220
I was going to say, if they used your step art from all those years ago, is your name?

01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:36.220
Sue.

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:41.140
That's kind of awesome though.

01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:44.740
You hypothetically might be able to play one of Shane's step charts.

01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:50.780
When we went to Sunnydale Golf Land two years ago, because it was the same day as PT coming

01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:54.900
out for everybody, they had a DDR machine there, whatever DDR that was, which was the

01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:59.580
most recent at the time, it still had stuff I did on it because I made Jim and Annie play

01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:00.580
it.

01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.940
I was like, I just want to feed my ego, play these songs.

01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.100
That's awesome.

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:12.500
Orange Right in chat says, can confirm Beautiful Inside Cube Hard Mix is in DDR-A still.

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:13.500
There you go.

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:16.500
So I'm still in it.

01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:21.620
And his ego, literally his head just swelled by a few inches here in the room while we

01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:22.620
read that.

01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:23.620
That was a fun song to make.

01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:24.620
Memories.

01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:26.740
Oh, is memories hidden in the game?

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:30.300
That would be terrible because that's a garbage sound of a song.

01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.300
All right.

01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:32.300
That's it for emails.

01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:33.300
You guys should email us as well.

01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:38.420
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.

01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:40.700
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:44.380
Just because Dark Sakura isn't here doesn't mean we don't get angsty once in a while.

01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:47.420
So let's get to it.

01:56:47.420 --> 01:57:02.660
Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:11.300
I guess just FU2 and FU2 Pokemon Go for being so fucking glitchy.

01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:12.300
I don't know.

01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:14.620
That's mainly it.

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:16.620
It's just...

01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:17.620
Come on.

01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:22.580
I understand that the game is, you know, it's early and stuff, but dude, this shit should

01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:24.260
not be this fucking buggy.

01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:29.260
I mean, come on, Niantic, seriously, fix this shit.

01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:36.420
Um, let's see, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I have a car payment again because

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:42.140
I bought a new car yesterday and actually I'm really excited.

01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:43.180
It's a nice car.

01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.180
Yeah, I like it a lot.

01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.180
It's pretty too.

01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:49.100
So, um, yeah, I, um, I like my new car a lot.

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:54.460
I guess I can say on it, is it bad if I say I have a 2016 Prius and, um, I, yeah, I wanted

01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:57.740
to go hybrid and I love, yeah, I like driving it.

01:57:57.740 --> 01:57:58.740
It's fun.

01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:02.940
Um, so looking forward to driving it more, but I'm not looking forward to the car payment.

01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:07.180
So FU2, um, not just being able to pay it all off in one big payment, but that would

01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:09.180
be something if I could do that.

01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:11.020
Last but not least, Shane, do you have any FUs of the week?

01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:16.420
FU2 moving, I'm so exhausted, like so exhausted.

01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:17.420
Moving does suck.

01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:25.500
And FU2 having to go to work tomorrow because today was not a day off because of the moving.

01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:26.500
All right.

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:31.860
Uh, you know, I was thinking, um, since, uh, that song that you did is still in DDR, beautiful

01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:38.400
inside, you know, to, to, to feed your ego even more, should we request that people take

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:43.800
a picture of them playing DDR, playing your song in DDR and tweet it to you?

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:48.120
Can someone in the chat room, cause I don't have access to the chat cause I don't know

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.120
how to do it.

01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:52.760
Um, can someone linked an entire song list for ACE so I can look at it.

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.280
I just want to see what else is on there.

01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:55.280
Just go to Wikipedia.

01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:58.160
No, cause when I went there last time, it just showed their new stuff and the things

01:58:58.160 --> 01:58:59.160
they removed.

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:00.560
But if you're not in chat, how are you going to see the list?

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:02.720
Cause you can tell me and then you can text it to me.

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:04.720
I'm not going to read 700 song names here on air.

01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:05.720
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.200
But just, you can, you can read me a link.

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:08.920
You just got a Bomani style.

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.720
I'm sure they've got a Bomani style.

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:11.920
I just said Wikipedia.

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:12.920
Okay.

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:13.920
Orange, right?

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:14.920
Remy Wiki.

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:15.920
Remember that?

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.920
No, I don't.

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:17.920
I'll find it though.

01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:20.920
Go to Remy Wiki.com and there's a dance, dance revolution, a full song list article.

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.640
Is that good enough?

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:23.960
All right.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:24.960
We'll see.

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:25.960
Probably.

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:26.960
Yes.

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.960
Thank you.

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:28.960
Orange, right?

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:29.960
I'm trying.

01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:30.960
I'm trying to help him out.

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:31.960
All right.

01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:32.960
Thank you for the suggestion.

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:33.960
I forgot about Remy Wiki.

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:34.960
How do I search this?

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:35.960
Look at the upper, right?

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:36.960
Where Wikis usually have a search bar.

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.720
Okay.

01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:39.720
Lord.

01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:40.720
All right.

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:41.720
Let's move on.

01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.360
And then we're going to get to your phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:48.880
on Skype.

01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:51.280
Actually though, Shane, pay attention because this may be of interest to you.

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:52.960
Loki, what do you have?

01:59:52.960 --> 02:00:00.040
So there's been like social economy, social media rep on Reddit who's been just responding

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:04.080
to some questions and comments and that type of thing.

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.440
I guess his name is Ben.

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:10.480
And he's of course, you know, criticism I should add to that as well.

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:21.640
Basically saying that, you know, they want, Konami wants to earn you back.

02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:25.160
Are they giving us like two for one plays on their pachinko machines or something?

02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:28.920
No, they're basically saying that, you know, they're not, you know, totally doing away

02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:30.980
with console games.

02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:35.120
Saying that they may have, or, well, I wouldn't say it's constantly, yeah, Metal Gear Solid

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:40.400
is going to possibly have an announcement to come next year in celebration of the 30th

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:41.400
anniversary.

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:42.400
Yeah.

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:51.040
And then basically, you know, saying if they find, you know, they're reviewing their IP

02:00:51.040 --> 02:01:00.600
and they're trying to see if they have a good fit for Silent Hill because I just can't take

02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:01.600
this seriously.

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:02.600
I'm sorry.

02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:03.600
I just like, sorry.

02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:04.600
Yeah.

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:06.080
Well, I hope to have you back.

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:07.480
Well, you know what?

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:10.680
I hope to have a million dollars and that ain't going to fucking happen.

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:13.480
Your hope is worth fucking nothing.

02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.300
You know who says that a lot, actually?

02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:17.160
I hope to have stuff.

02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:22.680
My son, he's all, man, he's all, I really wish I could have that ice cream right there,

02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:29.720
or I really wish I could have, you know, a new video game, or I really wish I could have,

02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:32.640
you know, that pizza that you're eating.

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:36.120
This is just like the Konami version of this.

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:38.560
I really wish we could earn our fan base back.

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:42.560
Well, I really wish you weren't fucking stupid in fucking alienating your entire fan base,

02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:46.360
canceled one of the most anticipated games that your company was producing and decided

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:49.720
to go to the pachinkos and said, fuck you to everybody else.

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:53.040
That's kind of how I wish you, oh, and then how you treated your developers, you know,

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.040
like shit.

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:58.440
Look, I don't blame this social media guy though, because I feel like he kind of knows

02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:02.580
what has to be done that like somebody has to apologize for what the fuck is happening.

02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:06.460
So I kind of give this guy massive kudos for literally putting himself in the line

02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:07.460
of fire.

02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:08.940
But it's also giving us false hope.

02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:09.940
Yeah.

02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:13.180
And I think, I think honestly, you know, it speaks more than anything else is results.

02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:16.260
And I'm kind of with JD in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:22.180
JD says, Konami, if you want me back, release home versions of 2DX and Poppin and DDR.

02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:24.260
Well, I mean, I don't know.

02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:28.380
I think some of those games aren't necessarily going to sell well, but I, I would really

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:30.500
love BeatMania 2DX to make a comeback.

02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:34.260
There's a user, it's on Reddit, he goes by Konami US social.

02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:38.380
So that people are in the assumption that's the social media rep for Konami.

02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:41.660
Although it could be a complete troll account, so who knows, but it doesn't seem like he's

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:43.660
trolling too much.

02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:45.360
I don't know.

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:48.660
I just going to say it's going to take a lot to fucking get us back.

02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:54.340
And even if you announce a fucking new game for consoles for Metal Gear Solid, at most

02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:58.220
it's probably going to be a remake and good luck.

02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:02.660
I mean, I'd be curious though, what kind of talent they might try to bring into these

02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:05.820
games to try to woo people over to them.

02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:08.980
I mean, they could recruit some really big name out there.

02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:12.140
We just don't know about it because we don't, haven't heard of it, but Metal Gear could

02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:17.540
land a really big name or, um, you know, Silent Hill might get a scary movie director or something

02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:19.860
that's going to surprise us behind it.

02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:23.420
Like, I don't know, the people that made Saw, although I hate Saw, I really hope that doesn't

02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:24.420
happen.

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:25.420
Why did I say that?

02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:26.420
That's a horrible thing to suggest.

02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.580
Maybe he gets like, like John Carpenter from Halloween or something.

02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:31.540
No, that is not the spirit of Silent Hill.

02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:38.100
That's the spirit of the garbage Western Silent Hills, which are garbage and they're garbage.

02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.100
Are they garbage?

02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:40.100
Yes.

02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:41.100
I don't.

02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:42.100
What about a Japanese horror movie director?

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:43.740
No, you have to have.

02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:44.740
Okay.

02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:45.740
So I was on board for PT.

02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.300
How about David Lynch with Twin Peaks?

02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:48.300
No.

02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:49.300
Well, that could work.

02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:50.300
Aha.

02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.660
That could, that could possibly be okay.

02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:52.660
All right.

02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:54.460
Now we're onto something.

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:58.220
But no, you can't, you can't do Silent Hill anymore, Konami.

02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:01.260
You just need to give it up to somebody that cares, because you guys don't.

02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:03.300
Several people in chat are yelling Guillermo del Toro.

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:05.340
Well, they've already, they've already burned the bridge.

02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:07.540
Oh yeah, they super burned that bridge.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:08.540
Yeah, I don't.

02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:13.260
Well, and it's kind of sad because he's not in Kojima's latest game.

02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:15.540
No, he's not.

02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:22.020
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Alliance Radio at vognetwork.com,

02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:23.780
use the pass phrase, ground.

02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:24.780
All right.

02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:25.780
All right.

02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:30.660
So let's move on with one more story here about Uno going to be making a comeback.

02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:34.100
You remember Uno on the Xbox 360?

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:37.820
Those of you that weren't really gaming a lot 10 years ago may forget that Uno on the

02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:40.540
360 was actually kind of a big deal.

02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:44.740
Like it was one of those Xbox live arcade games that did very, very, very well in the

02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:46.300
early days of the Xbox 360.

02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:48.580
And Uno is going to be making a comeback.

02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:52.900
It was announced that Uno is going to be getting a game adaptation for the PC, PlayStation

02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:57.500
4 and Xbox One, and it even has a release date, August 9th, 2016.

02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:59.420
But does it have camera support?

02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:02.540
Yes, it has camera support.

02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:09.340
Most importantly, we will have camera support, which, you know, just means it's only a matter

02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:13.960
of time before someone exposes themselves while playing Uno, which I never really understood

02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:15.140
camera support in Uno.

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:19.580
I think it was really a novelty on the Xbox 360, because remember, that was before Kinect.

02:05:19.580 --> 02:05:22.780
Xbox 360 had those little cameras things, right?

02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:23.780
So anyway.

02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:29.700
No, dude, I don't know why I said dude, but breaking news, I have tons of songs in this

02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:32.620
DDR game still.

02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:36.420
Let me finish the story and then you can tell us while we wait for some calls what songs.

02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:40.420
We don't know exactly what Uno will have in it, like if it's going to have Uno Rush and

02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:44.220
all that stuff too, but it's Ubisoft that is doing it.

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:46.960
And yes, voice and video chat will be a part of it.

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:52.020
So I'm sure some Twitch streams are going to be a hoot and a holler by the time this

02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:53.020
release is there.

02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:54.020
So yeah.

02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:55.020
Let's see.

02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:57.500
I'm looking at some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:01.640
Vidpower in chat says, Uno was such an important Xbox Live arcade game.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:04.500
It really was, despite all the fact that we kind of make jokes about it.

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:09.660
Like it was a really, I mean, people bought that camera for Uno of all things.

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:11.460
It was a crazy thing.

02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:13.160
Let's see.

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:18.440
Other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com fifth dream says Uno VR please.

02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:19.440
That might be a bit much.

02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:20.440
Let's let's be real.

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:21.440
It's a bit much.

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.440
Okay.

02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:24.160
Um, that is it for the stories we have.

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:28.840
We're going to open up our Skype line over at a one eight seven seven game OLR or username

02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:31.360
on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word.

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:32.360
The Skype line is open.

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:35.080
If you want to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight or maybe something

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:36.080
that we missed.

02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:37.080
Shane.

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:42.300
So your, your games or your steps charts that remain in DDR or what?

02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:43.820
So I future list is still there.

02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:44.820
That's awesome.

02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:45.820
Oh, that's awesome.

02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:46.820
I love that.

02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:47.820
I didn't know you did the art for that.

02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:48.820
Or step step or whatever.

02:06:48.820 --> 02:06:49.820
Yeah, I did that.

02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:55.140
Um, I'm starting at the bottom now and going up, uh, uh, Bilela Samba still there.

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.140
Wow.

02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:59.020
Uh, yeah, I know that's, that should have been gone by now.

02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:05.900
Um, soul crash is there, uh, freeway shuffle is there.

02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:09.620
The flyaway remix is there, fires there every day.

02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:10.620
Every night is there.

02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:11.620
All right, that's enough.

02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:14.380
Good for you that you still have a lot of songs in the game.

02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:16.660
So should people tweet you pictures of themselves playing it?

02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:17.660
Sure.

02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:19.780
And they can say how garbage some of them are because some of them are really garbage.

02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:20.780
All right.

02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:21.780
We got a phone call coming in.

02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:22.780
Let's get to it.

02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:23.780
Hi.

02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:24.780
You're on orange lounge radio.

02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:25.780
Who's this?

02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:26.780
Uh, this is a YYR.

02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:27.780
Hey, YYR.

02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:28.780
How you doing, buddy?

02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:29.780
Uh, not too bad.

02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:30.780
Actually pretty good.

02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:36.220
Considering, uh, finally after probably a good six, seven years, snake party is in peer

02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.220
review.

02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:38.220
Congratulations on that.

02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:42.260
How long does the game usually take from a peer review to actually release on the console?

02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:47.180
Well, uh, now is probably not the best time to really judge.

02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:52.380
Um, simply because we're at the very tail end of Xbox live indie games, like six weeks

02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:54.180
from now, it's all over.

02:07:54.180 --> 02:08:01.820
Um, so there aren't that many reviewers now, so I'm hoping less than six weeks, but generally

02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:07.540
when it was more populated anywhere from, uh, one to three weeks, depending on volume

02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:13.500
and also if you had any problems that people could fail you on, that would obviously make

02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:14.500
it take longer.

02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:17.500
Cause then you had to wait a week, uh, they call it jail.

02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:18.660
You're in jail for a week.

02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:21.740
You can't resubmit for at least another week.

02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:26.340
And then, you know, you fix your problems, you resubmit and then you start over.

02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:33.620
Um, so, uh, you said in six weeks everything is gone, but that's just the new submissions

02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:34.620
part, right?

02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:35.620
Not like the store and all this stuff.

02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:38.340
The new submissions, peer review, all of that goes away.

02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:42.820
Um, the games that are on there, the, you know, 3000 plus games that are on there will

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:45.060
remain on sale for another one year.

02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:46.060
Okay.

02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:50.060
So at least it's not like when you released, um, pixel poops on the PlayStation Vita where

02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:52.900
it was like up for four weeks and that was it.

02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:53.900
Yeah.

02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:58.860
But, uh, I, I really send my thanks to the 60 or so people who, uh, who bought it.

02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:00.620
Hey, it's not a bad number.

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:02.620
Listen to this show.

02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:03.620
That's not bad.

02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:04.620
I was one of those people.

02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:06.500
You have 60 people that listen to the show.

02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:07.500
What the hell?

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:08.500
That's great.

02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:09.500
That's awesome.

02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:13.460
Hey, by the way, did you know we have a celebrity here in studio?

02:09:13.460 --> 02:09:16.060
We have the, uh, world renowned step chart artist.

02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:17.540
Shane is here.

02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:24.660
I was really psyched when he showed up because it's just, Oh my God, I have played some of

02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:26.660
those songs.

02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:30.100
So apparently some of my favorite ones are not on here.

02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:31.780
I'm looking at you in chat.

02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:34.820
Some of the chat is responding to some of these songs that, and again, if you're just

02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:39.700
joining us, uh, if you've played dance, dance revolution, ACE or a, which is the new one

02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:44.020
that's a Dave and busters and round one, Ooh, saberwing stayed on apparently songs that

02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:45.900
Shane worked on when he was at Konami.

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:46.900
What?

02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:47.900
That was 10 years ago at this point.

02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:50.380
Yeah, I actually are still in the game.

02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:52.980
So, uh, some, some folks in chat, orange, right?

02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:55.540
Here's, here's ready for this ego inflation.

02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:57.140
Fire was a good chart.

02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:58.140
You're welcome.

02:09:58.140 --> 02:09:59.140
And orange.

02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:00.140
Right.

02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:02.220
Notice it's like anytime I remotely reference anything, Bamani orange, right.

02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:03.500
Is right there to save my ass.

02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:08.100
If I stay at state something incorrect, uh, let's see, uh, dark Tetsuya says, Oh, Shane

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.100
did freeway shuffle.

02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:10.100
Yep.

02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:11.100
I did.

02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:12.100
Oh, those are good steps.

02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:13.100
I played the double chart.

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:14.100
Did you write the double chart?

02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:15.100
Yeah.

02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:16.100
I did all of those.

02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:20.700
Uh, JD says, Shane should make a list and put it on the OLR Wiki or something.

02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:25.780
Uh, and dark Tetsuya is offering to help you if you can like send him a list from this

02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:26.780
game, at least I could.

02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:27.780
Yeah.

02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:29.420
I don't know if I can remember.

02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:31.340
Like that's a decade ago.

02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:36.060
Well, and our pal, what we have other friends of all our pal Mel B would have done a lot

02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:37.260
of step charts too.

02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:38.260
Right.

02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:39.260
I thought so.

02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:40.260
Huh?

02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:41.820
Interesting.

02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:45.060
Some other folks that were affiliated with the show, I can get the credits to roll.

02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:49.020
And if, uh, if your name's not still in there, I'll, uh, I'll send the lawyers after.

02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:50.020
Thank you.

02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:54.340
I want rights to sweet code and in silent Hills and I won't, that that'll be enough

02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:55.340
for me.

02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:56.340
Here's the thing though.

02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:57.340
Did they put you as Shane?

02:10:57.900 --> 02:10:58.900
Yeah.

02:10:58.900 --> 02:10:59.900
Oh, okay.

02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:00.900
Yeah.

02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:01.900
Shane uses, Shane uses his middle name.

02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:02.900
Like I do.

02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:03.900
So I was just curious.

02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:04.900
Anyway.

02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:05.900
Uh, let's see.

02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:06.900
So I'm sorry.

02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:10.460
Sorry to derail, but you know, when you have a celebrity in studio, they, their ego takes

02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:11.460
priority.

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:12.460
It does.

02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:14.940
Uh, what else did you want to share with us tonight?

02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:15.940
Why?

02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:16.940
Why?

02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:21.500
Well, actually the reason I called, I don't usually do this, but, um, because this concept

02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:26.140
is so early and I'm honestly not sure if it would be worth buying, I'm going to remind

02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:29.500
you of what you said last week and I'm going to share what I have here.

02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:30.500
Oh God.

02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:31.500
I'm so excited.

02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:32.500
Okay.

02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:39.020
So this started when Loki was complaining about his wife watching Grey's Anatomy's 8,000

02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:42.380
episodes back to back for the second time, by the way, because we've already gone through

02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:46.340
all the episodes and that she's like, there's nothing else on, we're just going to watch

02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:47.340
it again.

02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:50.580
I'm like, why doesn't she watch the other Shonda shows?

02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:51.580
Like scandal?

02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:55.460
Like even I like scandal, she was in the scandal and she tried to watch it again, but like,

02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:56.460
I don't know.

02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:57.460
She just stopped again.

02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:01.100
So she didn't remember what happened when she left off and God, I don't want to watch

02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:02.100
all that again.

02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:03.100
All right.

02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:07.060
So yes, Loki was ranting about the wife monopolizing the television with the Shonda verse, which

02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:13.180
left him with his PC with his, you know, 500 steam games on it and therefore he has nothing

02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:14.180
to play.

02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:15.180
Exactly.

02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:16.180
Oh yes.

02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:17.180
Okay.

02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:18.180
Yes.

02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:19.180
I remember.

02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:20.180
Go ahead.

02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:21.180
Go ahead.

02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:22.180
I remember now though.

02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:23.180
So you suggested there should be a game called I have nothing to play.

02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:24.180
Yes.

02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:25.180
Okay.

02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:26.900
All right.

02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:27.900
I'm with you.

02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:28.900
I do remember this.

02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:32.340
So, so basically what you have is you have this game where you're essentially sitting

02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:38.020
in a web browser and there are three storefronts available that you can visit at any time.

02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:40.700
The gray station store.

02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:48.900
I think a smog and a also mumble bundle.com and I love it.

02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:49.900
I approve.

02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:54.620
And of course there's always something on sale, like ridiculous sales.

02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:59.980
They'll, um, they'll be, uh, running, give me an, uh, uh, early August sale sale for

02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:00.980
no reason.

02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:07.620
Genre sale, sale, sale, like, um, and basically this game is, uh, a Christmas sale in July.

02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:08.940
Can you put that in there for me?

02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:14.100
A Christmas sale in July, because I swear to God, I was at the mall the earlier this

02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:17.900
week and I had to text Shane, there was five nights at Freddy's dolls and I was looking

02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:21.160
at the mall like, Oh, and I texted Shane pictures of the dolls.

02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:25.980
And as I'm sitting there looking at these five nights at Freddy's dolls, the first Noel,

02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:31.820
the Christmas Carol starts playing on the radio and I was like, it is fucking July.

02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:33.140
Why is it Christmas Carol?

02:13:33.140 --> 02:13:37.220
Um, Best Buy just did like a black Friday in July sale.

02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:39.500
Yeah, I guess it's your Amazon did their thing too.

02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:40.500
So okay.

02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:41.500
So anyway, yes.

02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:42.500
Uh, that, that's my other request.

02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:45.140
A Christmas in July sale.

02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:47.420
So basically, and I don't know if this is fun.

02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:51.140
I don't know if anyone would actually buy this, but the point of this game is to buy

02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:58.040
games and add them to your library, your smoke library and your, your, um, your gray station

02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:01.200
for library and to not actually play anything.

02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.340
And it'll track like how much money you've saved, how much money you actually spent.

02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:09.680
Um, the ratio of spent to save the number of games purchased and there'll be leaderboards

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:10.940
for all that crap.

02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:15.620
I don't know if I know the online multiplayer stuff is really hard and it might complicate

02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:19.540
things too much, but I almost feel like why, why are, what you're describing to me would

02:14:19.540 --> 02:14:23.660
be a brilliant card game card game.

02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:24.660
Huh?

02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:25.660
Yeah.

02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:26.660
Right.

02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:30.740
Because then that way it's kind of like, that's how the sales are controlled and you buy the

02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:33.380
games in your hand that are like cards.

02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:35.380
But maybe if somebody could get a better deal, I don't know.

02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:38.820
I haven't really thought this out, but as you're describing it to me and maybe it's

02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:43.300
the fact that we just talked about Uno and what a big game that was, I'm like, this almost

02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:46.780
sounds like a card game because it's like you're trying to kind of like, like, like

02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:50.580
monopoly or something like you're buying and selling and exchanging properties and stuff.

02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:51.580
So it's like you're trying to hoard.

02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:56.220
You have to have the biggest hoard of games that you bought at the cheapest possible.

02:14:56.220 --> 02:15:00.780
That fixes the biggest problem with this concept, which is it's funny, but there really isn't

02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:02.140
much of a game there.

02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:06.420
I mean, basically I put a whole bunch of, of work into this.

02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:10.060
Um, there are several different possible types of developers.

02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:14.300
You've got your triple A developer, your middle tier, your indie, you're just straight

02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:20.100
up awful developer with poorly translated descriptions and cobbled together graphics.

02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:25.060
Um, and then, you know, it would randomly choose one of those and then randomly generate

02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:29.920
a game, um, based on a genre, which is also randomly chosen.

02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:36.380
You have your simulator games like grandma simulator, pushup simulator, 2017, uh, you

02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:41.380
have slice of life narrative games like my sister's anxiety or before showering.

02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:47.380
I mean, this is just, uh, you know, randomly generated games with randomly generated descriptions

02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:50.620
and you know, cobbled together screens and things like that.

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:51.940
I love this so much.

02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:52.940
I love this so much.

02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:56.620
You, you, you, you make dreams a reality while I are, you're the person that makes dreams

02:15:56.620 --> 02:15:57.620
come true.

02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:00.500
And I gotta say, I have to read some of these comments in chat because they're so amazing.

02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:03.980
Uh, dark Tetsuya says, okay, this sounds hilariously meta.

02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:05.420
Uh, let's see.

02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:08.540
Fifth dream says, the best part is when you click anything in the game, it just opens

02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:11.780
your steam client and starts a random game and tells you to fuck off.

02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:13.020
I don't know if it should do that.

02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:14.020
I don't know if it should do that.

02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:17.740
Uh, Rama says, rage nator would be the first person to buy this game.

02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:18.740
Okay.

02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:19.780
Real talk, real talk.

02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:24.060
You have to have the little mascot that teaches you how to play the game that pops up in the

02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:28.300
corner that says, and his name is going to be sale inator.

02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:29.300
Okay.

02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:33.460
After our favorite caller here at OLR and he's going to pop and he always has to start

02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:40.780
off by saying, hi, this is sale inator here and I have a tip or like, did you know that

02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:43.740
this is on sale or there's a hot sale or something like this.

02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:47.580
And so like sale inator would actually advise you to where all the good sales are at.

02:16:47.580 --> 02:16:50.580
So I want you to, I want you to think about that.

02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:51.580
Okay.

02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:52.580
Is he even listening tonight?

02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:55.900
I haven't seen him in chat.

02:16:55.900 --> 02:17:01.140
If this actually becomes a thing that comes out on steam, it would, it would be at a list

02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:06.180
price of like $30 and would always be 90% off.

02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:07.180
I love it.

02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:08.180
Yes.

02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:09.180
Always.

02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:10.180
Just perpetually a 90% off game.

02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:11.180
Uh, let's see.

02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:14.380
JD says, uh, Oh, Hey, yeah, that would work.

02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:15.940
A drafting style game.

02:17:15.940 --> 02:17:16.940
Like dominion.

02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:17.940
Yes.

02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:18.940
Card.

02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:19.940
Card building games are huge white right now.

02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:20.940
Oh my God.

02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:25.660
You're building, you're building your library of steam games that you're getting on sale.

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:28.420
This is, this is genius right there.

02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:30.420
That's patent pending idea.

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:31.420
Patent pending.

02:17:31.420 --> 02:17:32.820
I get, I get half the proceeds.

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:33.820
No, I'm kidding.

02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:34.820
I don't.

02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:35.820
You, you, you do all the work.

02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:36.820
Why?

02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:37.820
Why?

02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:38.820
I know.

02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:39.820
I know you will be kind and put in some OLR jokes and plugs for indie podcasting and I'll

02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:40.820
be happy.

02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:41.820
Oh my God.

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:42.820
This is, wow.

02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:43.820
All right.

02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:46.220
Well I'm still, honestly, I still have to work on multitasking.

02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:47.220
You do.

02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:48.220
Yeah.

02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:49.220
Um, put it on the list.

02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:50.220
This is actually something to think about.

02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:51.220
And you know what?

02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:57.020
Amy, Amy was, Amy always tells me how she feels and she's like, this sounds stupid, you know,

02:17:57.020 --> 02:17:58.020
as a game.

02:17:58.020 --> 02:17:59.020
Period.

02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:03.060
I mean, maybe it's funny, but this sounds stupid because all you'd be doing is buying

02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:05.740
games and adding them to your library.

02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:09.340
So to actually put a card game in there that actually, wow.

02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:10.340
Okay.

02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:11.340
All right.

02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:12.340
Something to think about now.

02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:15.740
I, I, I, it's why we are, I'm like your consultant.

02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:21.420
By the way, if you posted ideas in chat, um, message me your names so I can get you in

02:18:21.420 --> 02:18:22.420
there.

02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:23.420
Um, let's see.

02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:26.580
Raginator in chat says, I'm here and listening.

02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:27.580
Oops.

02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:28.580
All right.

02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:33.860
Um, Hey, Raginator, the whole thing is a compliment and you know it, you know, we're, we are about

02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:40.180
to immortalize you in a video game, uh, on steam nonetheless, uh, SSG100 Matt says, wow,

02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:44.580
this is something, hopefully nobody steals the idea and makes it before YYR does.

02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:45.840
Patent pending.

02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:47.560
You listening, Bobby Black Wolf?

02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:55.320
I know people, I know celebrities here in studio that have lawyers.

02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:56.320
Don't you dare.

02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:57.400
All right.

02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:01.200
I have homework clearly, and I've already taken almost 12 minutes of your time.

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:04.640
No, it was worth every goddamn minute and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:05.640
All right.

02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:08.300
All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go for now though so we can get some other calls.

02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:09.300
Good luck.

02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:10.300
Good luck with multitasking.

02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:11.300
Good luck.

02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:12.300
Start, get your notepad.

02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:14.680
And every time you think of a good idea for this, uh, and if you want to talk further,

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.680
we totally can.

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:16.680
I love this brainstorming.

02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:18.240
Thanks for the feedback and suggestions.

02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.240
Thank you everybody.

02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:20.240
You're welcome.

02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:21.240
Anytime my friend.

02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:22.620
Hey, have a great week guys.

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:23.620
You too.

02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:24.620
Bye buddy.

02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:25.620
Yep.

02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:26.620
Bye bye.

02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:29.600
I think, you know what, the beautiful thing about that phone call is I really feel like

02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:30.600
he's going to do it.

02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:35.840
Like I just, it may not be this year, it may not be next year, but I feel like that is

02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:39.960
going to be a game at some point that I will play at magfest and I'm going to be like,

02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:42.280
Salinator was my idea.

02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:48.560
All right, uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on skype if you want to, uh, give us

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:54.800
a call, uh, and Akuma JP says, we must always have a game or excuse me, we must have a game

02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.880
that is always coming soon by Loki.

02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:03.760
Hey, yeah, there has to be like a, you can't call it green light, but maybe there's like

02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:08.920
smog has like a yield division or something and uh, you know, yield to the new games that

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:12.280
are coming and Loki just has one there that never seems to get made.

02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:13.280
I don't know.

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.280
We'll see.

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:16.480
And it'll be called half life three.

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:20.320
All right.

02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:22.460
No games of the number three, you're not allowed.

02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:23.460
That could be okay.

02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:26.560
There's a little rule twist for your card thing.

02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:30.760
Games with the number three in them are not allowed on the smog store.

02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:31.760
Things like that.

02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:32.760
All right.

02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:36.200
Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on skype.

02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:38.880
Really just the problem is we've been asking the wrong questions.

02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:42.600
They're going to pull a Microsoft and it's just going to jump the half flight for everyone.

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:43.600
Yay.

02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:47.800
Gabe's like, Hey, listen, you guys have been just asking about half life three all the

02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:50.960
time when that's coming out and I'm just saying, I don't know when it's coming.

02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:57.160
If only you'd asked about half life four, I could have said, yeah.

02:20:57.160 --> 02:20:58.160
All right.

02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:01.160
Uh, now the chats are a lighting up there.

02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:04.800
Bobby Black Wolf suggests half life for the search for half life three.

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:08.480
Uh, dark to see you says, isn't that what the developer of leisure suit Larry did?

02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:09.480
Wow.

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:10.480
Way to throw it back.

02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:11.480
But I think you're actually right.

02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:12.480
I think that did happen.

02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:13.480
Anyway.

02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:14.480
Um, one more shout out for calls.

02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:17.120
Orange launch radio, all one word on skype.

02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:18.900
Are you, are you still looking at the Wiki, Shane?

02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:19.900
Like stroking your ego?

02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:21.440
No, I'm reading big brother stuff.

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:22.440
Oh no.

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:24.200
I saw the songs I've done.

02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:25.960
Uh, they stop at a certain point.

02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:27.360
So I stopped watching big brother.

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:28.360
I've been bad.

02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:31.160
I watched the first week or so and then I just kind of fell out.

02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:33.400
It's hard because the show is on Sunday night, right?

02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:37.640
It's on like Sundays and Wednesdays and Thursdays, all the nights I have podcasts.

02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:38.640
Yeah.

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:40.520
So I just read about it.

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:42.360
I don't think I've seen an episode in forever.

02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:43.360
That's okay.

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:48.040
You just finished editing the show and then you go and watch stranger things and then

02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:49.040
you're done.

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:50.600
I have another FU of the week.

02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:51.840
Oh, well go ahead.

02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:59.680
Since we, um, FU to the fact that not all of the Danganronpa anime is out because I

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:05.000
need to know what happens and I literally did a free trial to Funimation just so I could

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.360
watch it.

02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:10.840
So what the hell is a bullet hell game anime like?

02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:12.200
Is it just like, what was it?

02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:13.920
The game's not a bullet hell game.

02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:17.320
I mean it's a, it's like a Phoenix Wright style.

02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:18.320
That's right.

02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:19.320
I'm sorry.

02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:20.320
But they use bullets.

02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:25.640
They use like truth bullets and stuff during the trials, but it's just two episodes in.

02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:27.200
They have two different versions going on.

02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:30.720
They have one that takes place after three and one that takes place before one with the

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:32.800
cast of two.

02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:37.120
And I'm just like so engrossed already is so good.

02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:41.840
And it makes me annoyed that I don't have all my episodes yet, but we get them same

02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:43.040
day as Japan does.

02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:45.520
So it's not like I'm even behind.

02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:47.480
I just have to wait.

02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:49.040
It's frustrating.

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:50.480
All right.

02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:53.360
Well unfortunately there's no more calls coming in, so I'm going to go ahead and close up

02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:55.360
the Skype line for tonight.

02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:58.800
But Hey, if you want to, it's probably because a lot of our regular callers called into Bobby

02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:00.720
tonight because he had his 11th anniversary.

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:03.120
So I understand it's no big deal.

02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:06.360
But if you want to email us your thoughts, you can always send us an email, participate

02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:07.360
at orangesonsradio.com.

02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:11.720
Of course you can always tweet us as well, twitter.com slash O L R, but we are going

02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:13.480
to go ahead and start to wrap up for tonight.

02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:18.120
I want to thank you guys for downloading our show and checking it out or listening to us

02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:19.120
live.

02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:20.560
However you consumed orange on radio this week.

02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:21.860
Thank you so much for being here.

02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:24.840
If you like what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or five about

02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:25.840
the show.

02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:29.720
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only

02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:32.160
if the gamers are here to listen to it.

02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:35.860
So, um, uh, you know, again, help us spread the word.

02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:36.860
That's all we ask.

02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:37.960
Uh, that's going to do it.

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:41.720
We're done a little early tonight, but I guess that gives us time to go hunt Pokemon or something.

02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:42.720
I don't know.

02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:43.720
We'll see.

02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:44.720
It's all common shit around here.

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:45.720
Oh, excuse me.

02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:46.720
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:54.000
Oh, since after I caught like the 120th Pidgey, it's like, we're going to start saying it.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.000
I could use a different.

02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:56.720
Oh, that's a lot of XP for evolving them over.

02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:57.720
It is.

02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:58.720
That's I got the 17.

02:23:58.720 --> 02:23:59.720
All right.

02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:00.720
Anyway.

02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:01.720
Uh, any final thoughts for us tonight?

02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:02.720
Loki.

02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:04.840
I guess I should get on working on a game.

02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:05.840
Yeah.

02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:10.040
I want to have, you know, have a reputation for not releasing anything.

02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:11.040
Yeah.

02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:13.040
Uh, Shane, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:15.040
Thank you for filling in for a little bit of the show here.

02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:16.040
You're welcome.

02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:17.040
No, I just want to sleep.

02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:18.040
All right.

02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:21.720
Well, don't sleep there on the chair cause that'll be awkward in the morning.

02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:24.760
Um, Alan stepped into studio randomly wanting to say something.

02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:25.760
Yes, Alan.

02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:32.000
I have an emergency F you of the week F you to the fact that I was, I had like three or

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.720
four dollars in loose change in my hand and then I was picking up little bits of trash

02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:36.720
off my desk.

02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:41.280
And when I went to the garbage whole handful went in and I'm not rooting through the trash

02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:43.960
for like a bunch of dimes and nickels.

02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:48.400
So F you to throwing away $4 and change for $4 for $4.

02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:49.400
I dig through the trash.

02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:50.400
Well, it depends.

02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:51.400
What's in there.

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:52.400
Do you have like day old food?

02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:53.400
Cause I don't know about that.

02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:56.840
But I think if it's just papers, it's all you work.

02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:58.800
Anything at your work is just papers.

02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:01.640
I dig through that for $4 being lazy.

02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:02.640
All right.

02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:05.480
Thank you for interrupting the show to share your tragedy with us.

02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:08.920
Uh, my final thought is a feel better dark Sakura.

02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:12.960
And uh, if you're listening, I hope you are here next week.

02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:15.480
That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:16.600
Have a great week, everybody.

02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:21.120
Happy gaming, happy Pokemon hunting or whatever game it is you decide to play this week.

02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:24.200
We will see you in seven days all over again.

02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:25.200
No Bobby next week.

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:28.640
Cause he's at a, um, uh, convention in Kentucky.

02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:33.800
So, uh, do, uh, tune into us next week, probably at six o'clock, we will be here Pacific nine
