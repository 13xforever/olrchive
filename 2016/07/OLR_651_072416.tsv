0	17200	This week, Google has announced their entry into the gaming festival circuit, bringing
17200	19760	a venue and date out for Android game developers.
19760	21520	And that's just one tidbit of tonight's news.
21520	24640	Join us for this and the rest of the week's video gaming news, and it all starts right
24640	27520	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27520	32840	Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet
32840	36240	and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36240	42720	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 651 for this July the 24th
42720	44440	of 2016.
44440	51000	We are here broadcasting from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, assembled to talk
51000	55440	about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
55440	60720	Here in studio is myself, Rob Roberts, on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.
60720	64280	Not joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
64280	68940	She actually had to bow out, and you'll have to excuse us, we're going to have to kind
68940	73800	of change our flow on the fly tonight because we were planning on her being here, but unfortunately
73800	77280	you guys, if you were listening to last week's show, she had that surgery, right?
77280	83760	I guess it was maybe Monday before the last episode, and something is flared up with it
83760	88560	or something, so she has a lot of pain and she can't drive, so getting over to the studio
88560	92300	does require driving, so sadly she's going to bow out.
92300	95920	She could have come on on Skype or something, but I think she'd rather rest up, and hopefully
95920	102160	she feels better, so send your hearts emotes to her at DarkSakura on Twitter.
102160	103160	She will be back.
103160	105920	She said she'll be back come hell or high water next week.
105920	108480	Joining us, though, live in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
108480	109480	Hello.
109480	110480	How are you?
110480	111480	I'm fine.
111480	113680	So, we were chatting a little bit before the show, and you said you are living in Bizarro
113680	114680	World right now, right?
114680	115680	Yes, I am.
115680	116680	What's going on?
116680	125120	I'm living in Bizarro World because I was playing Pokemon Go, and then on Friday, my
125120	131440	wife, because originally I'd want to take my son out to downtown Sacramento to go play
131440	135600	Pokemon Go because I have a phone for him to play on and he wanted to do that, but then
135600	140840	it became 105 degrees on the weekend, so I was like, eh, no, we'll go to a mall that's
140840	142320	air-conditioned and go play.
142320	144040	That's a good idea.
144040	146140	No, it's not a good idea.
146140	151060	The GPS in malls, they're just, no, it is absolute shit.
151060	155200	It's worse in, I guess, okay, we're going to get Sacramento on y'all for a minute.
155200	159280	It's way worse, from my Ingress experiences, it's way worse in Sunrise Mall than it is
159280	160320	in Arden Mall.
160320	161320	Like Sunrise Mall?
161320	162320	It's in Galleria, yeah.
162320	163320	Oh, interesting.
163320	164320	I've never had a problem in Galleria.
164320	169520	Yeah, Galleria, it was just, I was in the ocean most of the time because, yeah, that's
169520	170740	what happens when you can't.
170740	172440	Because Roosevelt's so close to the ocean.
172440	177480	No, it's because that's what happens when you go to 0-0 on your GPS.
177480	182200	We did end up finding a spot that was nice and, you know, between two PokeStops, it was
182200	187040	in the sun, which I wasn't too happy with, but it was all right, it was air-conditioned
187040	188960	as well, so we played there for a little bit.
188960	192480	But anyways, long story short, yeah, she was not going to let me take him there because
192480	194760	she thought he was going to get kidnapped or something.
194760	198680	Like I couldn't pay attention to playing a phone game and taking him with something in
198680	199680	the mall.
199680	201320	I'm like, this is ridiculous.
201320	205580	We have this hangout for Ingress players who are playing Pokemon Go, and Loki and I are
205580	209600	obviously both in it because we're Ingress players playing Pokemon Go, and you guys actually
209600	214640	were like venting to the chat about this, going, help, does anyone else think this sounds
214640	219040	rational that my wife will not let me take the kid to the mall to play Pokemon Go because
219040	220240	the kid's going to get kidnapped?
220240	223600	And I said, buy a leash.
223600	225240	That's why they make kid leashes.
225240	230760	I mean, he had more trouble, you know, playing in the mall because he was walking around
230760	233200	and like almost running into people because he's not used to that.
233200	238200	Me on the other hand, I can commute to work and like, she's like, I can't catch these.
238200	239320	Oh, sorry.
239320	240520	Spoiler a little bit.
240520	241520	So yeah.
241520	247600	So anyways, Friday she decided to download Pokemon Go on her phone for whatever reason.
247600	248600	Everyone else is doing it.
248600	249600	There must be something about it.
249600	256500	So, um, so she did it and I did one of the mom blogs post about, Oh no, it doesn't matter.
256500	261200	But like it was, you know, so she did that and she's been obsessed with this entire weekend.
261200	266880	Like we've had to make special trips to Sutter street, which is like a nearby, like old town,
266880	272360	the gold Folsom Bay basically has a lot of near the prison, a much safer place to, it
272360	276120	has a lot more, but while we didn't take the child, the child stayed with, you know, the
276120	277120	grandparents.
277720	280160	So she, she wanted to just go down there and to do that.
280160	281760	I'm like, it's a hundred degrees outside.
281760	283080	I'm like, you want to go?
283080	284080	So?
284080	285080	Yeah.
285080	290440	She's like, so we can go to like, we at least go to the ice cream store over there and you
290440	291440	get some ice cream.
291440	298680	It is, it is really a tragedy that in 651 episodes of the show, Mrs. Loki, I think she,
298680	302000	she cameoed on some of the earliest episodes before you guys were even married.
302000	306000	But like, there, there's no, I don't even know if we'll ever get her on again, but she's
306000	308120	so fricking funny.
308120	311280	Like, that's, that's the part that Loki doesn't explain very well.
311280	313600	She is one of the most hilarious people you will ever meet.
313600	314600	Yeah.
314600	318080	She, we always like when we're driving like home today, like first, like we're going to
318080	321920	the grocery store and she's like, okay, go buy the pokestop first.
321920	322920	You know?
322920	327480	I'm like, all right, now, now did the wife tease you for Ingress?
327480	331720	Cause this is, oh yeah, all the time, all the fucking time.
331720	335880	And like, let's be honest here, like this weekend she's played it more than I have as
335880	337480	far as Pokemon goes.
337480	340900	I mean like, I mean, I guess I took the kid to the mall and so I played a little bit there
340900	345660	and with her, but most of the time I was just kind of sitting there.
345660	348480	But yeah, she's been playing it, you know, most of the time and like we have to make
348480	352160	stops so she can do, and like I have to catch Pokemon for her cause she doesn't know how
352160	354960	to throw the Pokeballs yet and stuff.
354960	358440	And I mean, it's just, I don't know.
358440	359440	She like texted me earlier.
359440	364680	I was like, yeah, we went to the, this park, you know, and did that.
364680	367400	I'm like, okay.
367400	368400	This is Bizarro World.
368400	372400	So in Bizarro World, your wife is playing more video games than you.
372400	373400	And I'm trying to put the kids to bed.
373400	378960	I'm like, can you maybe stop playing that game so we can put the kids to bed right now?
378960	382200	And that's when I was like, what the hell just happened with my life?
382200	383200	What is my life?
383200	386600	Uh, I've got to introduce the chatters cause they're, they're hilarious.
386600	387600	I'm sorry.
387600	388600	Real quick.
388760	394560	You know, you know how like you do something and it's pretty cool, then your parents start
394560	397160	doing it and it's not so cool anymore.
397160	398160	Yeah.
398160	400160	It's kind of getting that vibe.
400160	402360	I'm like, okay with it.
402360	404220	I can't really think of a lot of things like that.
404220	408080	Maybe when my mom got really into South Park, which yes, is a thing that happened.
408080	413160	My mom loved, like my mom's favorite TV show is South Park and so like, I can't watch it
413160	414160	anymore.
414160	417160	But no, it's all right.
417160	418160	It's fun.
418160	419160	She's getting into it.
419160	420160	But like, I don't know.
420160	424160	I mean, whatever it is, what it is.
424160	425160	All right.
425160	426160	She's having fun.
426160	427160	I guess.
427160	431360	I got to get to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night
431360	436000	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show turned
436000	439880	11 years old tonight, by the way, happy 11th anniversary, Bobby Black Wolf.
439880	442880	One of the longest running video gaming shows out there.
442880	447240	There's a very small club of shows that are 10 plus years and we're fortunate enough to
447240	448240	be in it.
448240	450560	And Bobby is as well.
450560	451920	And of course we have our chat room.
451920	457960	So if you are listening live here on Sunday night, you can join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
457960	459960	And there's a lot of chat here.
459960	465320	Stoppy in chat says, bizarre world for Loki as in everything is happy and not at all frustrating.
465320	470080	No, that's just, yeah, I don't, yeah, it is bizarre world.
470080	472600	No, that's never a thing.
472600	477020	And obviously with all this Pokemon chat, a very kind plug from William Murderface in
477020	481180	chat saying, Sky, I've been listening to the new Pokestop podcast and as usual, you're
481180	482180	doing a great job.
482180	483180	Well, thank you very much.
483180	485500	We're having a lot of fun doing that show.
485500	491540	The fever around Pokemon Go, which I already had a love for AR gaming because of Ingress
491540	494700	has just basically fueled my love for Pokemon in general.
494700	498940	And now I'm getting into the handheld games and Shane is living in bizarro world because
498940	501260	it's like, wait, Rob wants to talk about Pokemon now.
501260	504860	So it's kind of, I guess, a similar thing.
504860	505860	Let's see.
505860	510100	Rob in chat says, I just came back from a big Pokemon Go event here in my city.
510100	514260	Tigerclaw with a question saying, tried to catch some Pokemon this weekend, but don't
514260	515920	have any Pokeballs.
515920	518460	How do you get Pokeballs without going to some stuff?
518460	520860	Do they give you some free ones per week?
520860	526060	You get some when you level up, but, but yeah, I had a problem where I ran a Pokeballs this
526060	527060	weekend as well.
527060	530820	And the problem is like, I go to the, I go to a lot of the Pokestops, but I get like
530820	531820	potions.
531820	533180	I like, I had to dump.
533180	536940	I've been dumping tons of potions and revives cause I have like a hundred of each and I
536940	538220	don't need that shit.
538220	542500	You'll have to find a very dense area of portals, Tigerclaw.
542500	549460	And honestly, some of the best places for that is cemeteries, downtowns, colleges, um,
549460	552020	anything that's going to have a lot of artistic type of landmarks.
552020	556420	So if you have a very artistic part of town, uh, that would be one, uh, you have to find
556420	559080	a portal dense area and just walk around.
559080	563300	Think of it, think of it too as, um, you can hatch eggs while you're doing it.
563300	565480	So you put some eggs in the incubator and you can do that.
565480	567740	And uh, yeah, unfortunately that's one way to do it.
567740	571360	You could spend money and buy them in the shop, but I think that is one of the worst
571360	572360	things to buy in the shop.
572360	573360	I really do.
573360	574360	It is.
574360	577820	And I had to do it though because like I was seriously just sitting there spinning that
577820	584460	shit and getting nothing and, and, and on top of that being the level that we are now,
584460	589700	you get all these like bullshit that happens with the fucking Pokemon, not excluding when
589700	591160	the game is all fucked up.
591160	596940	So like they'll pop out of the fucking shit, like I'll throw down fucking a raspberry and
596940	602380	use it, you know, a great ball to try to catch a fucking low level Pidgey that just won't
602380	604700	fucking stay in the goddamn ball forever.
604700	605700	Yeah.
605700	608940	I saw an article this week that was talking about, cause you know, there's, there's people
608940	612340	out there that want to, want to hate on Pokemon go, but this was, this was pretty fair.
612340	615940	It's talking about the end game struggle, you know, that the game gets a lot harder,
615940	620260	but then, you know, I don't want to repeat myself from Pokestop, but I will just say
620260	621260	this.
621260	625620	Remember that these games are not designed to be beat in two weeks.
625620	627980	This game is supposed to last a very long time.
627980	629820	They don't want you to catch them all in two weeks.
629820	635520	I realized somebody did, if you don't count six of them that nobody has, you know, somebody's
635520	639660	gotten closer than anyone else will say, I realized that news is around there and they
639660	642180	found out the level cap is 40 and all this stuff.
642180	645240	But just remember these games are not meant to beat in two weeks.
645240	650020	And I think if you are trying to beat it that fast, you're going to burn it, you burn yourself
650020	651020	out.
651020	652020	It's just like burning.
652020	655620	That's where half of my Poke balls goes like from this shit or when the game decides, Hey,
655620	656620	guess what?
656620	657620	You're gonna throw curve balls forever.
657620	660460	Now it's like, I didn't like to throw curve ball.
660460	664220	It's an actual, like I've actually purposely done it before, which I still don't understand.
664220	667040	I mean, it's supposed to make it easier to catch them, which is bullshit.
667040	670840	That's like saying, you know, it'd be a whole lot easier for me to throw this baseball with
670840	673120	my left hand blindfolded and backwards.
673120	678160	I mean, that's kind of what they're asking there, but to actually throw a curve ball,
678160	679920	you have to like spin the Poke ball around.
679920	684320	You'll actually draw circles with your finger on the screen and it spins and then you throw
684320	685320	it.
685320	688560	But there's this wonderful glitch that happens, especially when you're using your great balls
688560	693280	or whatever that for whatever fucking reason decides, Hey, it's just going to throw a curve
693280	695800	ball randomly.
695800	700200	Like as if there's some magical force field blocking the fucking Poke balls.
700240	704600	Or as if your phone did like a hiccup because something in the background refreshed and
704600	705960	so it reads the touches wrong.
705960	707560	I kind of think that's what causes it.
707560	713120	But anyway, I will say this, you know, for what it's worth, again, longtime Ingress player,
713120	720460	the current Ingress version that's out there is, if I'm not mistaken, it's 1.104.0.
720460	722560	That's the version number they're on.
722560	728000	They've done 104 updates to Ingress since, when did they go into 1.0?
728000	729320	When did they officially launch it?
729320	730320	About three years ago?
730320	731720	We'll say about three years ago.
731720	733920	It was four years because they did a three year thing at the center.
733920	736400	Yeah, but it was in beta for the earliest stuff.
736400	738720	So I think it's just about three years.
738720	745520	So my point is that, you know, and not every update has been substantial, but like power
745520	748520	cubes were not in the game in the beginning.
748520	752720	They did not have, certainly didn't have like Lawson cubes and some of these other items
752720	753720	that are there now.
753720	758800	Axeshields and stuff, those were not around in the first few versions and the, you know,
758800	759800	portal network grew.
759800	764640	So there's, there's a lot that changed and I really do believe Pokemon Go will get this
764640	765640	as well.
765640	769680	It's just probably going to take them a little time to get the amount of people on the team
769680	774040	that they really need because somehow they underestimated the amount of people that would
774040	775860	want to play Pokemon, but it's a lot.
775860	777400	So I think it'll get better though.
777400	778400	I really do.
778400	780880	Boy, how about that?
780880	783600	Three weeks in a row, we're opening up talking about Pokemon Go.
783600	784960	This is not a lot of news otherwise.
784960	788960	Well, and it really, I mean, it really is the biggest thing in gaming right now.
788960	792360	Anybody who's a gamer, anybody who's not a gamer is playing it.
792360	798800	It's really blowing my mind on just what a big cultural phenomenon this thing is.
798800	801680	But there is something else big going on this weekend I want to talk about here at the top
801680	806680	of the show and that's Comic-Con, which I feel like, especially in the general geek
806680	809660	universe, you know, I know we don't talk a lot about the geek movies and stuff.
809660	814900	We have other shows at VOG Network that do that, but there definitely was a lot of that
814900	815900	news this weekend.
815900	816900	Right?
816900	818500	You saw like the Wonder Woman trailer, which looked hot.
818500	820900	Even the Justice League trailer didn't look that bad.
820900	823860	The Justice League trailer was not bad.
823860	827060	It was a lot better than the last movie.
827060	828060	Yeah, exactly.
828060	829060	It's coming with a secret.
829060	830060	Okay.
830060	831060	Well, it wasn't bad, so it's good.
831060	832060	Let's see.
832060	833060	And then what else?
833060	837740	We know that Brie Larson is now Miss Marvel or Captain Marvel, excuse me.
837740	841140	Well, you know, whatever, but, you know, I'm sure Dark Soccer would have a lot to say
841140	842140	about that.
842140	844780	Brie Larson, a local girl, you know, she's a Sacramento, California native.
844780	847540	So yeah, local connection there.
847540	848540	And let's see.
848540	849540	What else did they announce this weekend?
849540	850540	It seems like there's just a lot.
850540	851540	There's a lot of new.
851540	853500	Oh, the Star Trek is huge.
853500	854500	They have it.
854500	856220	It's called Star Trek Discovery is the name now.
856220	857220	That's huge.
857220	859660	The CBS All Access show.
859660	863180	The new Doctor Strange trailer was pretty cool.
863180	864180	Oh, yeah.
864180	869100	The new, they had another trailer for a lot of Warner stuff.
869100	873760	So another trailer for Suicide Squad, which that looks fantastic.
873760	880800	And then another trailer for the Lego Batman movie, which just looks fucking hilarious
880800	883020	with the origin of Robin in this.
883020	888220	Sorry, I'm just catching up on chat over at live.vognetwork.com and this joke about Pokemon
888220	889220	Go is pretty good.
889220	892060	Kaijuto in chat says, I use the Tinder app a lot.
892060	893620	So my curve swipe is great.
893620	895020	You like that?
895020	896020	That's good.
896020	897820	All these balls just keep going to the left.
897820	898820	Go figure.
898820	900460	Let's see.
900460	903620	Brad from Pod Culture says the Flash and the Arrow trailers were cool.
903620	908420	I know, like, I know a lot of other shows on our network like Pod Culture, Critical
908420	911820	Myth love that CW universe of shows.
911820	917380	So that's the Netflix universe of shows with all the Defenders.
917380	921720	They also had Iron Fist and Luke Cage.
921720	927180	And I know this isn't necessarily comic books, but I do feel like there's a lot of geek crossover
927180	928180	with this.
928180	931940	But you, first thing you said when you walked in here tonight was about Netflix and everybody's
931940	933980	talking about this show, right?
933980	934980	Yes.
934980	937700	So I've been watching, I just started watching Stranger Things.
937700	941660	Well, I should say, I'm not started, I'm halfway through it now.
941660	942860	It's fantastic.
942860	943940	It's absolutely fantastic.
943940	946740	All the good things people are saying about it is absolutely true.
946740	948540	It's well shot.
948540	949820	It's got great music.
949820	951340	It's got a great story.
951340	952340	Great cast.
952340	954420	It's one of the best TV shows I've ever seen.
954420	955980	And it's like it's an 80s throwback.
955980	957980	It's basically like an 80s throwback.
957980	960540	There's a very, a lot of Spielberg, John Carpenter.
960540	963420	Winona Ryder's the star, for fuck's sake.
963420	966180	She's not a, I mean, she's a supporting star.
966180	967180	She's the biggest name.
967180	968180	She's the biggest name.
968180	969180	But yeah, it's fantastic.
969180	974540	I mean, seriously, even just start watching the first episode and as soon as that title
974540	978900	sequence hits, you're just like, fuck yes, I'm watching the rest of this.
978900	980220	That's pretty much it.
980220	982500	It's just like, this is so fucking awesome.
982500	986740	You played that for me and I did get a very Unsolved Mysteries vibe from it.
986740	988860	It's so good.
988860	994660	Any person our age, you hear that Unsolved Mysteries theme and you just like, it's PTSD.
994660	998180	Like you just, I shouldn't make a lie if something's so serious, but you know what I mean?
998180	1001980	Like you just, you just suddenly like, oh my God, oh my God, this guy's going to be
1001980	1005300	on TV and scare the hell out of me and there's going to be some dramatic reenactment that's
1005300	1006460	going to scare the hell out of me.
1006460	1009860	But yeah, it's pretty good and I don't know what they're going to do for like a second
1009860	1010860	season.
1010860	1014300	I've heard things that I don't know if it's going to be the same since I haven't finished
1014300	1015300	this one yet.
1015300	1019700	Um, we don't know like what the end is, but you know, I don't know if they're going to
1019700	1025140	do this, like it's going to be just a different thing altogether because the way they broke
1025140	1026820	it out, each episode is a chapter.
1026820	1029180	So it's like chapter two, blah, blah, blah.
1029180	1031100	It's very much like a, you know, science fiction book.
1031100	1032100	So I don't know.
1032100	1033100	It'd be pretty cool.
1033100	1037940	Well, so the whole reason I brought up Comic-Con and comics and stuff was to talk about comic
1037940	1044060	based video games and maybe ones that you've enjoyed because I do kind of feel like a lot
1044060	1046500	of them have not been so great.
1046500	1051580	Like it kind of suffers from that movie syndrome too, is that a lot of the stuff they release
1051580	1055460	is really kind of, I don't know, I don't know.
1055460	1059020	Marvel Ultimate Alliance kind of recently definitely had its fans, right?
1059740	1061500	You know, so I'm not saying they're all bad.
1061500	1067580	I remember, well, see, I, my brain goes to Batman on the NES, but that really was more
1067580	1070300	of a movie game than it was a comic game.
1070300	1075540	But Batman on the Commodore 64 back in the day, that was a comic game for sure.
1075540	1079720	What do you, what do you think, Loki, comic book based video games that you can think
1079720	1080720	of that were good?
1080720	1082500	How about you guys in chat over at live.vognetware.com?
1082500	1086940	Well, I mean, you know, my son and I, we play the Lego Marvel stuff, so those are pretty
1086940	1087940	good.
1087940	1093340	And even though I played a little bit of Lego, Lego DC or Lego Batman 2, which is basically
1093340	1097580	Lego DC, that was all right.
1097580	1101740	I mean, the Lego universe games are kind of fun, but like even all those, you see all
1101740	1104300	the little characters and everything, and there's like a bunch of characters since I
1104300	1106940	don't read a lot of the comics, like who are these people?
1106940	1110940	Then you see, like my son has a poster now, Marvel poster, I got him, and I'm like, oh,
1110940	1111940	hey, there's that guy.
1111940	1115540	There's Absorbent Man, you know, I recognize him from the Lego game, you know, that kind
1115540	1116540	of stuff.
1117260	1121180	I don't know, I think a lot of it kind of gets me back into like the actual, like the
1121180	1124540	Marvel universe and everything, especially the cinematic stuff.
1124540	1130020	Yeah, I can't really think of a lot of like games I've played.
1130020	1134240	I mean, before that, I would say Marvel versus Capcom.
1134240	1135240	That series is pretty cool.
1135240	1137140	Okay, that's a damn good answer.
1137140	1139940	I don't know if there is a better answer to be honest, but we'll see.
1139940	1142380	Looking at chat, let's look at chat because they've got some ideas.
1142380	1146740	Stoppy in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says, my favorite comic-based game is Spider-Man
1146740	1148740	on the PlayStation 1.
1148740	1153060	There's a lot of chat right now about Injustice 2, which I guess they talked about this weekend
1153060	1158980	at Comic-Con, Tiger Claw saying they did two new characters, Wonder Woman and Blue Beetle.
1158980	1161020	Injustice 1 is a pretty good game though.
1161020	1163020	You know, it's really not bad.
1163020	1166080	Honestly, still haven't played it yet, and I haven't in my queue because it was free
1166080	1167080	with the...
1167080	1168080	It was free on PlayStation.
1168080	1169080	Yeah, I haven't.
1169080	1170080	I have not played it.
1170080	1171080	You should check it out.
1171120	1175800	It's on that same engine as Mortal Kombat, the newer ones, so it plays really well.
1175800	1179200	I mean, obviously it doesn't have fatalities or any of that stuff, but they do different
1179200	1180200	things.
1180200	1181200	It's fun.
1181200	1182200	I like it.
1182200	1183200	I guess I'll try it.
1183200	1184200	Let's see.
1184200	1186720	Dungeon Buster says, Ultimate Alliance is pretty good.
1186720	1191680	The sequel is kind of meh, but worth playing if only to hear Thor spew anti-registration
1191680	1192680	lines.
1192680	1198000	Let's see, Tiger Claw says, I learned about the Marvel universe by playing Ultimate Alliance.
1198000	1201920	I like how the game introduces you to these characters, and you can get all sorts of backstories
1201920	1202920	about them.
1202920	1207320	And Dungeon Buster says, the X-Men Legends game by Raven Software were really good.
1207320	1210280	Are those the old ones from the early 90s?
1210280	1212080	There were some X-Men games in the early 90s that were boss.
1212080	1214240	X-Men Legends were PlayStation 2, I want to say.
1214240	1215240	Is that the...
1215240	1218400	Well, there's also the X-Men arcade game, which was pretty awesome.
1218400	1220000	That was definitely more about the...
1220000	1225720	Well, was it the comics, or was it the 90s animation?
1225720	1227480	I think the arcade was maybe the animation.
1227960	1232160	Maybe, because I think it was to try and copy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' success, which
1232160	1236120	was also a big animation in the 90s, and the arcade definitely had a lot of vibe from that.
1236120	1240640	Speaking of which, a little tangent here, I happened to catch an episode of the Ninja
1240640	1248200	Turtles show on Nickelodeon, and what the fuck happened to that show?
1248200	1250880	I did not fucking recognize that shit at all.
1250880	1251880	You grew up.
1251880	1252880	You grew up.
1252880	1253880	No, no, no.
1253880	1254880	Get off my lawn.
1254880	1255880	Stop.
1255880	1256880	Okay, here's what happened.
1257280	1262800	I'm not sure if this is maybe a mini story arc spinoff of the actual show or something
1262800	1266920	like that, or if this is what the fucking show's become.
1266920	1271960	Basically the Ninja Turtles show is pull the fucking Saints bro, where it's just...
1271960	1276840	The 80s cartoon was, they're in New York, they're fighting in the other foot clan, and
1276840	1280680	the craziest thing you have is like Krang and all that shit.
1280680	1286520	What I watched the fucking other day was, they're in space with this robot.
1287160	1293760	There's fucking frog people, some sort of triceratops people, and they're doing space
1293760	1294760	battles.
1294760	1298360	I'm like, this is not fucking close to Ninja Turtles at all.
1298360	1299600	At all.
1299600	1301080	What the fuck is going on?
1301080	1306280	Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1306280	1311220	Comics zone on Genesis, says Stopy, is good but hard.
1311220	1314120	Not based on a specific comic though, as far as I know.
1314120	1318960	There are some original comic games, there's not a lot, but I remember one on the Commodore
1318960	1324000	64 that was one of my absolute favorites that was ever on that system, it was called Accolade
1324000	1325000	Comics.
1325000	1328080	Man, if I'd thought of this before the show, I would have totally done this as a classic
1328080	1330520	game this week, but I guess I'll have to save it for another week.
1330520	1334720	You actually, it was like a choose your own adventure thing, where the comic would load
1334720	1340400	on the screen, and each panel would load as you chose your own adventure.
1340400	1345040	And you might choose something that leads you to death, which is bad, or you might choose
1345040	1348680	something that leads you to an arcade game sequence that you would have to play to get
1348680	1350700	to the next sequence of comics.
1350700	1351700	That game was badass.
1351700	1356160	I think it was one of the later Commodore 64 releases, but I remember that was one of
1356160	1360320	my favorites, Accolade Comics, I think that was the company, Accolade Software that made
1360320	1361320	that.
1361320	1365400	Yeah, that was one of my favorites.
1365400	1367760	Looking back on comic based games, we have some-
1367760	1371960	And as Tigerclaw mentions, yes, did you notice Raph having a girlfriend in the series?
1371960	1375920	Yes, because that's how the fucking episode ended with him about to kiss her, and that
1375920	1376920	was it.
1376920	1379840	I was like, what the fuck is going on with this show?
1379840	1383800	I thought all the episodes were supposed to end with a pizza party.
1383800	1389720	I just don't, I don't, when you take your fucking series into space is when I think
1389720	1395080	it starts to, you lose it for me, Saints Row.
1395080	1401160	Alright, we're going to move on, we've got some gaming news to get into for this week,
1401160	1408480	but I do want to, of course, do a few plugs here, vognetwork.com, if you guys have seen
1408480	1412920	Star Trek Beyond, which I still need to see, there's a review up there from one of the
1412920	1417120	guys at Critical Myth, Bronzethumb, and I still need to see this, but I see some of
1417120	1421420	the response reviews already coming in, it seems like people are loving Beyond compared
1421420	1424480	to the last movie, which is a good sign for me, because I didn't really care for the last
1424480	1430840	movie, I liked the first one, not the second one, so yeah, maybe Kelvin Timeline is all
1430840	1434200	about the odd-numbered movies, I don't know, so.
1434200	1439800	Or like, you know, would they refer to it like the alternate, well, I guess like alternate
1439800	1444400	universe in the show I'm watching is the upside down?
1444400	1447480	Maybe, I don't know.
1447480	1452880	Now you're making me think this is the introduction to the opposite sketch, but let's see, so
1452880	1458720	yeah, check that out, Flacco's got another summer movie preview as well, so you can rank
1458720	1462920	the cool movies that you want to see, although I'm very upset that he left the absolutely
1462920	1467400	fabulous movie off the list, because that's my most anticipated movie of summer, but I
1467400	1472280	suppose not everybody remembers the British original, so yeah, definitely check that out
1472280	1477200	and rank those, and I've got like a ton of stuff in the queue, because I'm so far behind,
1477200	1481400	because I've been doing way too many podcasts lately, so lots of great stuff coming up.
1481400	1489320	I do want to also plug, Bobby Blackwolf did a video about, kind of like a response to
1489320	1491240	all the controversy about Tesla Autopilot.
1491240	1495840	Yeah, I had to talk someone down while I was getting my smog check, you know, because they
1495840	1500120	were saying, garbage, like, oh yeah, did you hear about that guy that got killed by one
1500120	1501120	of the self-driving cars?
1501120	1502760	I'm like.
1502760	1506440	Did you hear about the 50,000 that got killed by the non-self-driving car?
1506440	1511120	I mean, whatever, anyway, I think, now you have a video you can show.
1511120	1514960	Bobby's got a great kind of response to that whole thing, and you can check that out on
1514960	1518800	our YouTube channel, at VOG Network, very exciting.
1518800	1520600	Let's see, what else do I have to say?
1520600	1525000	We will be off on Labor Day weekend, because I will be at DragonCon, so I hope to meet
1525000	1526240	you guys in Atlanta.
1526240	1530880	I don't know yet if we actually have any panels this year, I haven't heard back from Podcast
1530880	1537360	Track, so I hope we'll be around regardless, even if we don't get invited to do an official
1537360	1541760	panel, we'll still be lurking around that area, and probably shooting our own stuff,
1541760	1546160	now that Bobby's got all the video stuff, so we'll kind of be doing a slightly different
1546160	1548920	approach to DragonCon this year, so that's really exciting.
1548920	1551200	Who knows what's going to happen.
1551200	1557200	And I think that's it, otherwise, plug in my own podcast, Pokestop Podcast, guys on
1557200	1562520	the show, everything that's at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
1562520	1565080	Let's get into some gaming news this week.
1565080	1566400	Look, you want to start us off.
1566440	1571120	All right, so there is some information that's kind of come out from Pokemon Go, and this
1571120	1574760	is due to some data mining.
1574760	1579400	So for example, we found out that there is an actual cap to the trainer level, which
1579400	1583340	is 40, and it's going to take you a while to get there, though, because in order to
1583340	1589000	level up to 40, actually from one to 40 is 20 million experience points.
1589000	1596120	And in fact, just level 39 to 40 is five million, so that definitely steps up quite a bit after
1596120	1597120	level 20.
1597120	1602640	Pokemon themselves also have level caps, they only go up to 30, so pretty much anything
1602640	1608200	you catch at 30 or greater is only going to be that same level until you actually increase
1608200	1612960	its stats using the Stardust and Candy and all that fun stuff.
1612960	1617080	Each Pokemon also has their own capture and flee rates.
1617080	1622840	There's also some Pokemon do become harder to catch as you level up, no shit, and we
1622840	1625360	figured that out quite a long time ago.
1625360	1632480	Of course, you know, it's pretty obvious that you get bonus, or it makes, it helps to get
1632480	1639600	those nice, great throws or whatever, and the curveball throws help capture Pokemon
1639600	1640600	as well.
1640600	1645120	It kind of works into that whole flee rate and everything.
1645120	1652560	You know, of course, the other, we know that the Mewtwo, Moltres, Zapdos, Artuno, and Lead,
1652560	1657960	other, I guess those four are legendary Pokemon, so probably going to be something to do with
1657960	1662080	the actual, you know, events that they do.
1662080	1665440	They said that Farfetch'd is out there, and actually I did see that someone did catch
1665440	1669880	it in Japan, so there is Farfetch'd as well.
1669880	1675600	They said each Pokemon now also has their base, like a base attack amount, and of all
1675600	1681260	the Pokemon that are available in the game, the strongest for the non-legendary is Dragonite,
1681300	1687020	and then, of course, Mewtwo has a base attack of 284, so slightly higher, and then they're
1687020	1695380	also saying that there's, let's see here, that there's, now I'm not familiar with the
1695380	1703980	game too much, but that there's the same type attack bonus in this game as well as in the
1703980	1709740	portable games, so if you're using, for example, a Grass Pokemon and you use a Grass move,
1709740	1714060	you get a 25% bonus to attack, so that's kind of nice.
1714060	1717700	And then apparently the Master Ball's in the game, because it was in the beta, but no one's
1717700	1719180	come across it yet.
1719180	1720180	Hmm.
1720180	1726060	All right, well, I guess there's still more to be unveiled as people progress in this
1726060	1727260	game and so on.
1727260	1734180	Let's see, going to the chat over at live.voggenetwork.com, JD is saying Farfetch'd is a regional exclusive,
1734180	1740460	so are Konguskon, Taros, and Mr. Mime, which Taros is the one that's here in the US, and
1740460	1746300	they say Mr. Mime I think is Europe, and what Konguskon I guess would be Eurasia?
1746300	1748420	So how did that one guy catch them all?
1748420	1749420	Did he actually go traveling?
1749420	1750420	Australia, what am I saying here?
1750420	1755940	Did he actually go traveling or did he travel using the power of GPS spoofing?
1755940	1760500	Well, they may hatch in eggs, I think they all hatch in eggs, so if you get lucky with
1760500	1762140	the eggs, you get that.
1762140	1767140	Yeah, that's what Alan Alchemy says, they are hatchable from 5k eggs, they are just
1767140	1768980	region locked finding on the street.
1768980	1771300	I have 10k eggs, so I wonder what that is.
1771300	1774380	Usually it's evolved Pokemon I think at that point, you get more advanced stuff.
1774380	1776900	Well those are ultra rare ones, they're like the 10k, so.
1776900	1780140	Yeah, yeah, so he gets good stuff in there.
1780140	1784020	JD says Serebii has a list of what's in eggs, I've seen a chart float around on Twitter
1784020	1790340	out there, and not all the 2k eggs are bad, because your Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtles
1790340	1791340	are in those 2k eggs.
1791340	1795020	I've been trying to find more Charmanders in starting Pokemon and stuff, because how
1795020	1796380	the fuck am I supposed to level this guy up?
1796380	1797620	Did I tell you what happened at work?
1797620	1801460	I don't usually talk about work on this show, but I think the stories we're sharing.
1801460	1806060	So I'm sitting at my desk doing my job, writing a training guide, this is what I do, and one
1806060	1810860	of the managers comes through the office and whispers in a very loud voice, Charmander,
1810860	1814900	Charmander, and suddenly everybody discreetly is taking out their phones and sure enough
1814900	1816980	there's a Charmander at the front of the building.
1816980	1826820	We had one of those, the dragon ones, actually, was in front of one of our buildings, everyone
1826820	1829420	was running out to the parking lot to get it and stuff.
1829420	1834140	I didn't because I heard it too late, and unfortunately, you know.
1834140	1838740	Well you don't live far, you don't work far from where that Dratini farm is.
1838740	1840980	No, yeah, that's definitely there.
1840980	1844900	What's kind of nice, we have like a local, they have like a Google Maps that people are
1844900	1849500	adding stuff like, you know, stuff that's on the actual map, like all the different
1849500	1851940	and pokestops and everything, and also where different farms are.
1851940	1856420	So there's like a Dratini farm, I was actually browsing using that pokivision.com website,
1856420	1860300	which I recommend you check out while it's still up, although they've been having trouble
1860300	1864500	staying up because of the demand and the servers, you know, so if they get hit too hard or the
1864500	1866600	servers get hit too hard, it goes down.
1866600	1870900	But it's fucking useful, like my son wanted to get a Pikachu, so I searched the area,
1870900	1874980	and oh there's a Pikachu right here on this street, drove over to right where it was,
1874980	1876420	boom there's a Pikachu.
1876420	1883380	So it actually uses the API in the game somehow, I know it has to do with, it logs in somehow
1883380	1887080	using the Poke Club stuff, because I know they were saying they were having trouble
1887080	1892380	getting it to work when that's down, and then it tells you where the stuff is, and you can
1892380	1897420	scan every 30 seconds and check out the whole area and find all this stuff.
1897420	1898980	It's pretty crazy.
1898980	1904460	And I'm sure not what Niantic intended to be done, so we'll see what happens with that.
1904460	1909960	JD in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, I'm wondering if the API pokivision uses has
1909960	1912360	anything to do with the wearable.
1912360	1919900	And Bobby is realizing by scanning his house, it turns out my house is a Pokemon hotspot.
1919900	1923300	Pikachu has spawned in our backyard I don't know how many times.
1923300	1924300	So you're not alone.
1924300	1928140	One of the things I heard is that the spawn points for these, I mean whereas they'd spawn
1928140	1935240	randomly, are set, so like if a Pikachu spawns in one spot, it'll keep spawning there eventually
1935240	1936240	later on.
1936240	1941740	I was almost, I was convinced that it is tied to the what they call XM distribution in Ingress.
1941740	1946180	Yeah, it could be, and I think a lot of, definitely population density has a lot to do with it
1946180	1951440	because in the areas that are more dense, you'd find there's more Pokemon there.
1951440	1955820	So where I'd get more points for creating a field over that, that's where the Pokemon
1955820	1956820	are.
1956820	1957820	Makes sense, makes sense.
1957820	1962540	Alright, well let's move on and talk about Ubisoft with a comment that they've made on
1962540	1963820	Nintendo NX.
1963820	1967100	Oh, we couldn't go a week without an NX story even though Nintendo's-
1967100	1968100	Oh wait, wait, wait.
1968100	1969100	Wait.
1969100	1970100	What?
1970100	1971100	Since we were just talking about Pokemon, I got a text from my wife.
1971100	1973740	I wanted to make sure that I mentioned this real quick.
1973740	1974740	We all hear this.
1974740	1975740	Okay.
1975740	1980820	She said, I put down an Incense, I, one got away, I caught one, then the game glitched
1980820	1983580	out while I was catching one, restarted it, it wouldn't let me back in.
1983580	1986900	By the time I did, 10 seconds were left on the Incense.
1986900	1993380	Poopy emoji.
1993380	1998340	It's really the poopy emoji that made that story.
1998340	2002820	Same thing happened to me the first day the game launched, so yeah, it's just, hopefully
2002820	2006300	Niantic gets those server issues worked out, but it seems like it's gotten a lot better.
2006300	2011120	Well she has like an iPhone 5 and for some reason that thing takes forever to log in.
2011120	2012120	I bet.
2012120	2013120	I don't know what the problem is.
2013120	2014120	I bet.
2014120	2015120	Alright, let's see.
2015120	2022520	So, the CEO of Ubisoft has talked about Nintendo NX and he's actually saying it's really great,
2022520	2027200	saying quote, on the NX, what we have seen is really great, so we think having a new
2027200	2031960	machine coming is going to help the industry to continue to grow and take lots more casual
2031960	2034200	players back in the industry.
2034200	2039040	Of course, we have no idea what the specs are or anything, but this is noteworthy because
2039040	2045680	of course Ubisoft kind of went all in on the Wii U in the beginning, creating one of
2045680	2051720	the best third party games that was on the Wii U, or probably even the best, Zombie U,
2051720	2057360	which was great, and then they promptly abandoned the Wii U when that game didn't sell up to
2057360	2061800	expectations because the Wii U wasn't selling, except for Just Dance, but we don't count
2061800	2062800	that.
2062800	2067000	I just don't know if I can trust Ubisoft with telling me what's good and what's not.
2067000	2072520	After all, Ubisoft decided, hey, you know that Wii Fit volatility sensor that you guys
2072520	2075400	want to push to never getting them out with, we're going to come and release something
2075400	2079640	like that as well for meditation or something.
2079640	2085820	Hey, you guys are really into video games and stuff, how about we release a laser tag
2085820	2086820	set instead?
2086820	2092200	So, they don't necessarily have a good judge of hardware, it seems like.
2092200	2096040	So, I'll wait and see.
2096040	2097040	Fair enough.
2097040	2100880	Alright, why don't you do this next, because you feel passionate about this story that
2100880	2104080	Jamie was going to tell us about, so I think you should do this.
2104080	2109640	Ah yes, so Sonic Mania, this is kind of cool, they had some stuff, well aside from the really
2109640	2114400	fucking terrible livestream that they did, they did have some announcements, so one of
2114400	2116440	those is being Sonic Mania.
2116440	2122680	It is a throwback to the classic Sonic games, so they've got the Sonic, the Hedgehog 1,
2122680	2127360	2, 3, I think Knuckles and all that stuff is there.
2127360	2134380	And then, this brand new fan-made game that's being endorsed as well, and it's got the three
2134380	2138880	main characters, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.
2138880	2144540	And they're going to have new twists and new stages and that kind of stuff.
2144540	2148200	And that's supposed to be coming out on all major platforms in the spring of 2017.
2148200	2154840	Okay, but you had some pretty strong thoughts on this when you saw the trailer, right?
2154840	2155840	The trailer for this?
2155840	2157320	I thought the trailer for this looked okay.
2157320	2159760	Oh no, this is something else, the livestream or something.
2159760	2163000	The livestream was fucking terrible.
2163000	2166760	They had like, buzzing the entire time in the audio, and it's just really awkward.
2166760	2172080	If you want like a good summary of it, because, I mean, just to explain, it would, it doesn't
2172080	2173080	do it justice.
2173080	2179200	Go check out Jim Sterling, he's got a kind of a shit show compilation of what they did
2179200	2182320	during the livestream, and it's just, it's very awkward.
2182320	2183320	It's very awkward.
2183320	2187640	Like, they were trying to show footage of, or show the trailer for Sonic Mania, and it
2187640	2191560	wasn't fucking working, just as their audio wasn't working, and they're like, we've got
2191560	2196720	some great news for you, you know, you guys watching at home, and you know, the fans of
2196720	2201420	the Sonic series, and the great news is, and the audio cut out during the whole fucking
2201420	2205220	news that they were talking about, it was hilarious.
2205220	2216180	So yeah, show, not great, trailer for this looked pretty cool, so I'm down with that.
2216180	2221340	The also, I was gonna say, I don't remember if this was on our show rollout, no.
2221340	2227780	So they also did have, aside from Sonic Mania, there's, I wanna say projects, was it Sonic
2227780	2232000	Project 2017 or something like that, I don't remember what it's called, but basically they're
2232000	2239280	doing a new Sonic Generations game, and they showed Sonic, you know, the classic Sonic,
2239280	2242980	and then there's a third Sonic, which may be a Sonic Boom Sonic, which no one really
2242980	2247340	wants him, but he wasn't in the trailer, I just know there's three of them, and they're
2247340	2251200	basically fighting off against some giant robots or something, and it was just, it was
2251200	2255860	completely CG animated, it wasn't like an actual gameplay thing or anything, but that's
2255860	2261740	coming as well, and that'll be Holiday 2017, so there is another game coming, so two games
2261740	2262740	next year.
2262740	2263740	They don't look bad.
2263740	2267420	Yeah, the Sonic Mania especially, it looked like what Sonic Episode 4 should have been,
2267420	2268420	or Sonic Part 4.
2268420	2273100	Yeah, and Sonic Mania basically is like saying, hey, this is, you know, made by the people
2273100	2279340	that made Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors, you know, the two good games, so that's hopeful.
2279340	2283880	Going to the chat for some comments over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, Sonic
2283920	2287720	Mania looks legit, I'm down for it, but I'm cautious.
2287720	2293880	Bob Coffee says, the live stream only reached 6 out of 10 on the Konami E3 2010 scale.
2293880	2294880	I don't know.
2294880	2297480	I think it was probably worse than Konami.
2297480	2302640	Lizzie Dartitsuya says, I did like the Studiopolis level, had a ton of neat Sega Easter eggs
2302640	2306480	hidden throughout the level, and one thing I didn't know, Studiopolis is the name of
2306480	2311480	the recording studio where they do the dialogue for all the modern Sonic games and the Sonic
2311480	2312480	Boom cartoon.
2313040	2314040	Well, I don't know.
2314040	2315440	Is that a good thing, though?
2315440	2316440	I'm just kidding.
2316440	2317440	I'm kidding.
2317440	2318440	Maybe.
2318440	2319440	I guess.
2319440	2320440	Maybe.
2320440	2321440	All right, what else is in the news, Logie?
2321440	2327480	All right, so we can talk a little bit about, oh God, in it, about, we talked about Sonic,
2327480	2331160	and you know, Sonic Boom, really terrible.
2331160	2333960	I mean, it's just not a great series.
2333960	2336360	The games aren't that great either.
2336360	2340360	But this is like, this is kind of confusing, because now we have Mega Man, which is a great
2340360	2345800	game series, which is getting an animated cartoon which looks like absolute shit.
2345800	2347720	At least I don't agree with the art style.
2347720	2348720	It just, no.
2348720	2349720	No.
2349720	2351360	And why is there a tiny Mega Man on his head?
2351360	2353320	It makes no fucking sense.
2353320	2360600	But they're doing a new Mega Man game, which, you know, they chose to make it based on the
2360600	2367880	upcoming Mega Man, Man of Action cartoon, rumored that to be, they're saying that they're
2367880	2370760	going to be developing two different versions of the game.
2370760	2374080	One's going to be like the main version of the game, which is for, you know, the consoles
2374080	2376080	and everything, more powerful stuff.
2376080	2379600	Then the other one's going to be for 3DS and mobile, and that's going to be Outsource.
2379600	2383160	The 3DS and mobile one's going to be obviously the weaker of the two.
2383160	2390200	They're saying one thing about the game that they did notice that the naming, the way they
2390200	2394120	named the characters isn't necessarily going to be like, you know, Fireman, you know, that
2394120	2395120	type of stuff.
2395120	2397720	It's going to be based off of like musical names.
2397720	2402200	So like they're given examples of Flare Symphony, Frostbite, Sonata, Saber, Waltz.
2402200	2404600	What are these Castlevania titles?
2404600	2408120	So it sounds like, is there going to be a boss named Nocturne of the Moonlight?
2408120	2409120	Is that?
2409120	2413240	But basically they said that the game is going to look like, you know, like a Mega Man game,
2413240	2420320	just, you know, with, you know, better graphics, which makes me worry that, oh God, it's going
2420320	2424000	to be a Capcom version of fucking Mighty No. 9.
2424000	2427320	I mean, cause like, that's what happens when you make a copy of a copy.
2427320	2429960	The quality really starts to degrade.
2429960	2431360	Didn't anyone watch Multiplicity?
2431360	2435440	I mean, don't we know what happens when you keep cloning?
2435440	2443680	It's just, it's not, I just like, oh God, the cartoon does not look good.
2443680	2444960	It just does not look good.
2444960	2450260	It looks like, yeah, you know, we were totally respected franchise.
2450260	2452300	We want to go in a different direction with it.
2452300	2454040	It's like, no.
2454040	2455920	And then, hey, you know what?
2455920	2457120	Fans want a new Mega Man game.
2457120	2461820	So we really want to push this new cartoon that we have.
2461820	2463880	So we're going to make it based off that.
2463880	2464880	Why?
2464880	2469520	Uh, JD does have a good point in our chat over at live.vognetware.com.
2469520	2473880	Mega Man's always had music references, rock and roll, et cetera.
2473880	2475480	So they're always, you know, rock man.
2475480	2476480	That's true.
2476480	2483520	But no, I, I don't even think it really matters what we call them.
2483520	2484820	You literally just did this.
2484820	2488660	You make a very good point and I'm going to choose to ignore it.
2488660	2489660	I'm sorry.
2489660	2495300	It's just like, I have, I have the artwork of Mega Man staring at me and it's just like,
2495300	2499620	no, it does not work for me.
2499620	2500620	It doesn't.
2500620	2501620	I mean, it's fine.
2501620	2507940	Let's, let's give it the benefit that maybe it's good.
2507940	2510180	You really don't know till you play it.
2510180	2511220	You don't know, Loki.
2511220	2512860	I don't know until I watch the reviews for it.
2512860	2514900	I ain't fucking touching that thing.
2514900	2515900	Uh, let's see.
2515900	2517660	And dark Tetsuya says rush.
2517660	2518940	Don't forget rush.
2518940	2522780	Well, what truly one of the greatest bands of all time, right?
2522780	2524740	We need a new robot dog named journey.
2524740	2526900	That's what we need.
2526900	2527900	Mark my words.
2527900	2528900	I'd be fine with that.
2528900	2529900	Me too.
2529900	2530900	All right.
2530900	2532420	Anyhow, uh, let's move on now.
2532420	2536500	Let's talk about a re-imagining of a franchise that I think looks great.
2536500	2540340	I'm really excited about this based on the trailer, uh, kind of a follow up to something
2540340	2543900	we had talked about, um, a few weeks ago on the show, because this had leaked through
2543900	2547940	a ratings board or something like that, but it was officially announced with a trailer
2547940	2553180	this week that Pac-Man championship edition two is happening.
2553180	2555180	So I'm playing a little bit of the trailer here in the background.
2555180	2560980	Uh, so you can hear some of the music, which the music is almost some of the best part
2560980	2564420	of any of these Pac-Man games, but I'm very excited about this.
2564420	2566500	Uh, it just, it just looks different.
2566500	2570660	Like now the board tilts in different directions, which looks weird.
2570660	2575700	And the ghost trails will kind of like pop up and it does this weird like tempest thing
2575700	2578860	where it zooms through the middle of the board, jump onto a new board.
2578860	2579860	I think so.
2579860	2582340	But that isn't completely out of character for Pac-Man because that was Pac-Mania.
2582340	2587900	I think the ghosts are jumping jumping over walls and stuff because that's kind of cool.
2587900	2588900	Yeah.
2588900	2589900	I don't know.
2589900	2590900	And see like the board like tilts and shifts and stuff.
2590900	2594660	And then there's that when he flies through the air and he eats the trail of ghosts.
2594660	2598740	So I'm really, I mean, obviously trailers are meant to show you all the best parts of
2598740	2599740	the game.
2599740	2603240	I'm really curious what this is going to look like actually in motion there.
2603240	2606620	So, uh, yeah, and boss battles are in this too.
2606620	2611320	So, uh, God, I, I want this to be out now, but, uh, apparently I'm going to have to wait
2611320	2612320	a little bit longer.
2612320	2617100	I think they say at the end of the trailer, it is going to be September of 2016.
2617100	2621060	It's going to be out on the Xbox one, the PlayStation four and steam of course.
2621060	2624120	And they are saying it is a digital only release.
2624120	2629920	And sorry, I do not see Wii U on the list or any handheld, but then again, I don't know.
2629920	2632960	I guess Pac-Man championship edition never did release on those consoles, but I guess
2632960	2635120	anything's possible with the NX, right?
2635120	2636120	Who knows?
2636120	2639680	You can't handle the power of Pac-Man.
2639680	2641720	It's so much to render.
2641720	2642720	Yeah.
2642720	2646520	I'm very, very, very excited about that.
2646520	2648880	So let's see, I'll talk about this one as well.
2648880	2651380	Dar Sakura was going to bring this to the table tonight, but as I mentioned earlier
2651380	2657140	in the show, she had to bow out at the last minute due to some pain related to the surgery
2657140	2658140	she had.
2658140	2663900	Um, anyhow, Overwatch, uh, got an update, uh, this week and actually this, uh, specifically
2663900	2666380	the console's got updated with this as well.
2666380	2670060	The PC got this, I think very early in the week, like Monday, and then the console's
2670060	2674180	got it a little later in the week, but that new character, Anna is now available in the
2674180	2680220	game and the console patch actually nerfs two of the characters, Torbjorn and Symmetra,
2680260	2682180	which they said they were going to do.
2682180	2684260	And, uh, it is not the same on PC.
2684260	2689740	I mean, obviously both platforms got Anna, but the nerves for Torbjorn and Symmetra and
2689740	2694460	their turret damage, uh, being reduced by 30%, that's only on consoles.
2694460	2696020	That is not on PC.
2696020	2703140	And this is apparently because it is harder to have the precision aiming on a controller
2703140	2705020	as opposed to keyboard and mouse.
2705020	2710700	And since the turrets are auto attack, people are winning every time with Torbjorn and Symmetra
2710700	2715780	because it's basically like a smart attack where you don't have to aim at all with those.
2715780	2719460	So it was too overpowering, so they've nerfed it by 30%.
2719460	2725460	Also in this patch for PC and console, buffs for Zenyatta, who probably one of the least
2725460	2729380	used support classes, I think people don't realize that Zenyatta can actually attack
2729380	2730380	pretty well.
2730780	2734780	So, you know, if you want to heal and do damage, he's a good choice.
2734780	2737660	But they've buffed him a little bit, which is great.
2737660	2739660	And then they also did D.Va.
2739660	2741140	They've changed a lot.
2741140	2744140	She was already pretty popular, but that's probably just because it's a character.
2744140	2745340	People really like her.
2745340	2750540	But now, um, the defense matrix move is an alternate fire and there's a recharge meter
2750540	2754060	for it and self-destruct is faster as well.
2754060	2760080	But they are saying Anna is causing crashes on Xbox One and Mei's ice walls are not breaking
2760080	2761400	when they normally should.
2761400	2764840	Blizzard did confirm this pretty quickly and that they're working on fixes.
2764840	2769640	For all I know, this has already been fixed, but since I don't play the game on Xbox One,
2769640	2771040	I'm not sure.
2771040	2773040	So, awesome.
2773040	2777280	Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com has been following over.
2777280	2779440	He plays a lot more Overwatch than I do.
2779440	2784740	He says, the Symmetra nerf was a surprise to everyone and everyone on the console forums
2784740	2787560	thinks it's totally ridiculous and not needed.
2787560	2791240	But the Torbjorn nerf they knew was coming and everyone was welcome.
2791240	2795520	But he says, Blizzard leaked it out like a fart so when people saw it in the patch notes
2795520	2797100	they were like, what?
2797100	2801840	And he says, going into the game mechanics a little bit, her turrets are so easy to kill
2801840	2806800	and if you run into a room with her turrets and don't run out, that's your problem.
2806800	2812520	So a little confusion there on why Symmetra got the nerf just like Torbjorn did, but having
2812520	2817160	played both those characters, even on PC, I love Torbjorn's turret.
2817160	2821320	I mean, okay, yeah, it's pretty cool that it automatically does damage, but if you can
2821320	2825000	place that thing in just the right place, you can really piss the opposing team off
2825000	2828800	and it's a lot of fun and it makes it super, a lot of fun as well.
2828800	2832080	So there you go, some Overwatch changes.
2832080	2835320	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some upcoming video
2835320	2836320	games.
2836320	2837320	We'll start in the US with Loki.
2837320	2845420	Alright, so this week we've got Phantom Brave on PC, Quadrilateral Cowboy also on PC, Fairy
2845420	2854380	Fencer F, Advent, Dark Force on Playstation 4, Headlander on PC and Playstation 4, Minecraft
2854380	2861260	Story Mode Episode 7, Access Denied coming out on PC, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Xbox
2861260	2867380	360, Xbox One, and mobile, and then Hyper Light Drifter coming out on Playstation 4 and
2867380	2868900	Xbox One.
2868900	2874580	We're getting the HD remasters of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1 and 2 this week on PC, Playstation
2874580	2882020	4 and Xbox One, Mutant Mud Super Challenge on PC, Playstation 4, and Playstation Vita,
2882020	2893580	and then, let's see, it looks like Blade Arcus from Shining EX on PC, and Tokidin 2 on Playstation
2893580	2896900	3, Playstation 4, and Vita.
2896900	2899160	Sounds like a busier week than we've had recently.
2899160	2902500	And apparently a little bit of a delay, but Stardew Valley on Mac and Linux.
2902660	2906300	Oh, I did not know they were even getting a port, that's great.
2906300	2910380	Maybe you want to work on getting the UK dates up while I read the Japanese ones here.
2910380	2915700	So while we go over to Japan, we're going to look at a new Idolmaster game is out in
2915700	2917860	Japan this week on the 28th.
2917860	2919820	How many of y'all are Idolmaster fans out there?
2919820	2923580	Well, Idolmaster Platinum Stars is coming out on the Playstation 4.
2923580	2927580	This is actually the first Idolmaster game on the Playstation 4.
2927580	2932820	They're saying in this game, new character models, new facial expressions, dynamic camera
2932820	2938240	work during concert scenes, and you can even get crowds of up to 50,000 people.
2938240	2942900	You pick one of 13 idols to produce and focus your training efforts on.
2942900	2946700	I don't know why Idolmaster never really showed up over here, or did it?
2946700	2947700	Did they ever try Idolmaster over here?
2947700	2948700	I don't think they did.
2948700	2950540	No, the closest thing you had to it was Hatsune Miku.
2950540	2954540	Yeah, I know Hatsune Miku, and that's kind of a very, I don't want to say cult game,
2954540	2958180	but it's kind of, you know, it's got its following, but it's not a triple-A title by
2958180	2959180	any means.
2959180	2960180	Well, who knows?
2960180	2963660	Maybe, I wish they just would try releasing it digitally or something, you know?
2963660	2965100	I don't know, anyway.
2965100	2968740	But Idolmaster is out in Japan on the Playstation 4 this week on July 28th.
2968740	2975940	You can also look forward to, in Japan this week, Tokaiden 2 comes out in regular and
2975940	2978180	Treasure Box editions.
2978180	2980420	That's from Koei Tecmo this week.
2980420	2982860	Look forward to that on the Playstation 4.
2982860	2992580	Also, a price reduction on Dragon Ball Xenoverse and Guilty Gear Revelator gets, I guess, some
2992580	2995140	type of re-release there with new subtitles this week.
2995140	2999900	Also, Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force this week.
2999900	3007780	Going to some of the other consoles, the Vita this week has Sekaiichi Nagai 5 Funkan comes
3007780	3015080	out this week, Mega Tagmension Blanc plus Neptune vs. Zombies, that's a mouthful.
3015080	3016860	That is out this week as well.
3016860	3023500	Tokaiden 2 is out on Vita as well, and Strawberry Knots in regular and limited edition.
3023500	3028660	I do not know what Strawberry Knots is, but it is not actually about strawberry.
3028660	3035060	I think this anime girl wearing a very short skirt who's about to show you her knots, her
3035060	3039580	name is probably Strawberry, or at least that's how that goes in my mind.
3039580	3044020	Let me lastly quick look at the 3DS to see if there's anything this week.
3044020	3047500	Oh, Puzzle and Dragons has two new releases this week.
3047500	3052800	There's Ryu no Shu and Kami no Shu both come out this week on the 3DS in Japan, so if you
3052800	3055980	are into Puzzle and Dragons, you have that to look forward to.
3055980	3057700	So how about the UK, Loki?
3057700	3060920	I'm not sure how accurate this list is, but I'm going to read it anyway.
3060920	3067040	So we have AW Phoenix Festa on, looks like Vita.
3067040	3073640	Help the game on PC, is that like, no, I don't know what that is, anyways, and then they
3073640	3078080	are saying that the Batman, the remasters are coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
3078080	3081440	which I believe those are deleted at the end of the year, but whatever.
3081440	3086680	So yeah, they're saying Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City on PlayStation 4 and Xbox
3086680	3087680	One.
3087680	3093280	I won't buy that though, so I'm not sure if that's accurate, however, I do have a second
3093280	3095560	list I was going to take a look at here real fast.
3095560	3102440	Furry Fencer F Advent Dark Force on PlayStation 4, they're saying We Have a Few coming out
3102440	3108520	as well digitally on Xbox One and PC, and Olli Olli Epic Combo Edition on PlayStation
3108520	3110520	4.
3110520	3116160	Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, AkumaJP says, Idle Master died with Xbox 360.
3116160	3119640	I didn't realize that, but then why are they bothering with PlayStation 4?
3119640	3121560	Maybe it was cheap to put together, who knows.
3121560	3125880	Orange Right says, I thought it was released as a very expensive iOS game.
3125880	3126880	Really?
3126880	3127880	I did not know.
3127880	3128880	If that's the case, I did not know that.
3128880	3129880	Huh.
3129880	3130880	I'll have to look that up.
3130880	3134600	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week,
3134600	3139920	which I'm going to take over tonight, since I had to think of something last minute here.
3139920	3143740	I'm going to let Dark Soccer, Dark Soccer had picked a pretty big one for this week,
3143740	3145960	so I think she'd rather talk about it in a future week.
3145960	3150080	So I picked another one that I bet a lot of you haven't heard of, but it's timely.
3150080	3152640	We'll get into that after a couple more news stories here.
3152640	3153640	Loki.
3153640	3158860	So Google has announced that they're going to be hosting a brand new independent games
3158860	3160240	festival in San Francisco.
3160240	3165200	It's going to take place at the Terra Gallery on September 24th.
3165200	3171640	It's going to be dubbed the Google Play Indie Games Festival, and they're taking submissions
3171640	3179520	right now for Android developers for different, you know, games that are both fun and innovative.
3179520	3185200	And yeah, so they're really only interested in games from development teams, or smaller
3185200	3190240	development teams, so like 15 or less, or fewer, I guess, employees.
3190240	3195280	And then, yeah, so that's kind of cool that they're going to be doing that.
3195280	3199640	I'm going to be curious to see what the turnout is on that, especially, you know, there's
3199640	3202440	a lot of Android games out there.
3202440	3205800	I mean, it'd be nice to see if some of these submissions are getting a little bit of a
3205800	3208120	highlight on the Google Play Store or something like that.
3208120	3212000	I mean, it'd be interesting to see what they've got planned here.
3212000	3216400	Yeah, and let's not forget, you know, Pokemon Go from Niantic.
3216400	3220720	Niantic used to be a part of Google, so one could say that Niantic was once one of these
3220720	3222320	little indie studios.
3222320	3225600	You know, I guess it's hard to call something indie that's an offshoot of Google, but still,
3225600	3227120	you know, Google's got their eye on that stuff.
3227120	3228120	Right.
3228120	3229120	Yeah.
3229600	3232000	Does this mean they're going to be getting more gaming stuff?
3232000	3237880	I mean, because I know for a while there they were talking about maybe like, maybe the rumors
3237880	3241360	were like they were going to be doing like a set-top box like Ouya or something, but
3241360	3243880	I don't know if that's going to ever happen anymore.
3243880	3245760	It could be partially because of the phones.
3245760	3249040	It could be like an Android thing, but I think what I think it really is, you know, Google
3249040	3254040	is kind of interested in society's next big thing, whatever that may be.
3254040	3256840	You know, and you can credit a lot of what's happening with Pokemon Go.
3256840	3260320	You can kind of trace that back to Google, but you know, when you look at some of these
3260320	3265120	indie games that have been downright phenomenons, and I'm talking things like Minecraft, indie
3265120	3270000	game, Five Nights at Freddy's, indie game, Stardew Valley, I think is kind of coming
3270000	3271660	up on one of these, indie game.
3271660	3277560	You know, I think Google would want to have a piece of that, even if they aren't normally
3277560	3278640	a gaming company.
3278640	3282180	I think they would love to, you know, if they can kind of find and nurture that next big
3282180	3288900	thing, which you know, again, some would argue they did with Pokemon Go, I think they
3288900	3294980	would, I would very much like to have a part of that, so this could be part of it.
3294980	3298060	Some would like to also think it's just good guy Google, you know?
3298060	3299060	Maybe.
3299060	3300060	Maybe.
3300060	3305420	Let's see, going to chat over at live.fognetwork.com, Stoppy says, I'm always interested in what
3305420	3306460	games get featured.
3306460	3308980	It seems these guys can never get enough coverage.
3308980	3311500	Pretty sad because some games are really great.
3311540	3314740	And JD reminding us that Ouya got bought by Razer.
3314740	3316500	So Ouya's long gone at this point, right?
3316500	3320460	Because they just merged it into the Razer thing, right?
3320460	3321460	What's the Razer thing?
3321460	3324140	Didn't Razer have their own set-top box at some point?
3324140	3325140	Oh god, everybody does.
3325140	3326140	They still have, what is it?
3326140	3327140	The Nvidia Shield.
3327140	3331340	The only reason I know that's even a thing is because when I was looking for my, you
3331340	3333060	know, Bluetooth controller.
3333060	3339020	Brad says, I bought the, Brad from Pod Culture in chat says, I bought the Razer Forge, aka
3339020	3340020	Ouya 2.
3340020	3341020	It was the Razer Forge.
3341020	3344500	How are you liking your Forge?
3344500	3346740	Have you forged some new gaming experiences with it?
3346740	3351180	Does it make you go, ooh yeah, or uhh, no.
3351180	3356020	I can't imagine it's that much different from owning like a Steam box in some way, or not
3356020	3358140	the Steam TV thing.
3358140	3359140	I don't know.
3359140	3360580	Except that's not Steam coming out.
3360580	3365060	Brad from Pod Culture says, it isn't bad actually.
3365060	3366060	Okay.
3366060	3367060	Alright.
3367060	3368060	Anyhow, let's see.
3368100	3371180	I want to talk about Rock Band Rivals.
3371180	3372180	Rock Band Rivals.
3372180	3375240	Some details on this, they talked about it at E3, but now we know some more details on
3375240	3376240	Rock Band Rivals.
3376240	3381340	It's going to be a $30 expansion that will bring new features to Rock Band 4.
3381340	3387140	A story-based career mode and a series first, they're saying, a synchronous multiplayer
3387140	3391740	mode with both cooperative and competitive options.
3391740	3394860	So this is the first time I think that Rock Band's getting competitive play.
3394860	3400500	They are saying that regular online multiplayer will hit Rock Band 4 for a free update, but
3400500	3404740	they're saying that Rock Band Rivals is supposed to be like a counterpart for online play.
3404740	3407380	I guess it kind of expands on this.
3407380	3411780	You can team up with other players to create crews, which are in-game groups, and then
3411780	3416200	you compete in challenges each week, which will, you know, contribute to the group's
3416200	3419780	success as a whole if you pass, you fail, or what have you.
3419780	3423940	And so it's trying to get people back on to check with Rock Band 4 and play it pretty
3423940	3424940	regularly.
3424940	3429900	There's also what's called a Rock You Drama mode that's supposed to be like VH1's
3429900	3436260	Behind the Music that takes live-action footage and Rock Band gameplay, and it will make a
3436260	3438980	documentary about your rise to stardom.
3438980	3443220	See, the only way I could see you, you know, crashing and burning in this, you know, at
3443220	3449460	the end of that documentary thing is, you remember the Rock Band's intros, you know,
3449460	3453140	where they're just playing, you know, music on top of cars in front of trains and like
3453140	3454820	crazy stuff like that.
3454820	3455820	That's how you die.
3455820	3462740	You play your final show on top of a car, train, and you die.
3462740	3466400	This is interesting because it sounds to me kind of like, you know, like Guitar Hero,
3466400	3470300	the new Guitar Hero, kind of had the live-action footage with it, and it was actually pretty
3470300	3471300	well received.
3471300	3474220	So it's interesting that Rock Band, they aren't copying it, they're doing their own
3474220	3476540	take on it, which is kind of interesting.
3476540	3482200	I don't know, this is something I might want to check out, and I wasn't feeling so
3482260	3487080	great about Rock Band 4, but now it sounds like this might be the Rock Band 4 that I
3487080	3488080	wanted to play.
3488080	3493360	I'm not sure how I feel about 30 extra dollars to play it, but at least it sounds like some
3493360	3497680	of that is coming over into the regular game, so you can maybe like test it out before you
3497680	3498680	buy.
3498680	3499680	I don't know.
3499680	3504800	You also do get 10 tracks for your time for what it's worth, including Semisonic's closing
3504800	3505800	time.
3505800	3507240	You get some pre-order bonuses too.
3507240	3513720	One More Time from Maroon 5, 3 AM by Matchbox 20, and one of the other 10 tracks worth pointing
3513720	3515920	out, Sia's Chandelier.
3515920	3520040	And if you can do the dance that the girl does in the video while you play the song,
3520040	3522280	I think you should be able to get bonus points.
3522280	3526600	So that's some talented dancing going on there.
3526600	3530860	Or if you can play like Sia does, with the hair completely covering your eyes so you
3530860	3532840	can't actually see the notes on the screen.
3532840	3534240	That might be pretty cool as well.
3534240	3540800	Anyhow, 30 bucks for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, or you can get a bundle of everything
3540800	3544960	together for $60 if you don't yet own Rock Band 4.
3544960	3549560	So in other words, if you waited to buy Rock Band 4, then for the price of Rock Band 4,
3549560	3550560	you're going to get both.
3550560	3554600	Doesn't that make you feel good early adopters?
3554600	3556760	I'm trying to be hopeful.
3556760	3557760	All two of you.
3557760	3560480	I'm very much trying to be hopeful.
3560480	3561960	We'll see.
3561960	3563920	Comments and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3563920	3566360	Stoppie says, a $30 expansion?
3566360	3567360	Ouch.
3567360	3570880	JD says, I didn't realize they were still making Rock Band games.
3570880	3574160	Yeah, Harmonics is kind of having a problem with that.
3574160	3575160	Exactly that.
3575160	3576160	Let's see.
3576160	3579360	Brad from Pod Culture says, where is all my previous Rock Band content?
3579360	3580680	God damn it.
3580680	3583480	And I kind of agree with that.
3583480	3584480	And let's see.
3584480	3589000	Stoppie says, you can make your own band and play for beer like the good old days.
3589000	3590000	Hopefully that will be in the docudrama.
3590000	3591000	We'll see.
3591040	3592040	I don't know.
3592040	3596640	Anyway, let's go back to a more classic time, shall we?
3599640	3603280	Back when games, you know, if they were broken on the first release, then that's it.
3603280	3604280	No patch.
3604280	3605280	Nothing to do.
3605280	3609040	I'm going way back this week with my pick because Dark Soccer, she will usually step
3609040	3613360	into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be playing this this
3613360	3614360	week.
3614360	3615360	But she's not here.
3615360	3616360	So I'm taking over.
3616360	3620920	And the criteria is that the game does need to be 10 years old or more.
3620920	3626680	And I think tonight's game, if I'm not mistaken, is over 30 years old, which I'm going to date
3626680	3627920	myself a little bit.
3627920	3632760	Yeah, this game was released in 1984, so it's over 30 years old.
3632760	3634780	But maybe some of you will recognize it.
3634780	3636400	This is a timely choice.
3636400	3638600	Some of you may recognize it from this theme.
3643600	3644600	That's right.
3644600	3648880	The classic game of the week is Summer Games by Epyx on the Commodore 64.
3648880	3650360	Of course I picked the Commodore 64.
3650800	3654880	And by the way, this is one of the only parts of the game where music actually plays.
3654880	3657000	Otherwise it's a lot of ambient noise in the background.
3657000	3660640	So don't be surprised if the music in the background kind of cuts in and out.
3660640	3664920	So anyway, yes, the pick this week is Summer Games, which was one of the Epyx games.
3664920	3670880	That's E-P-Y-X games that was released on the Commodore 64 in 1984, but it was also
3670880	3677760	ported to the Apple II, the Atari 2600, believe it or not, the 7800, the XL and XE.
3677760	3681160	And it was on the Sega Master System, which I didn't realize that, and I never played
3681160	3682440	that version.
3682440	3690020	There was also an Amiga version, a Spectrum version, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST versions.
3690020	3696000	And then it actually came out on the Commodore 64 Direct-to-TV that was released in 2004.
3696000	3699520	I don't know if you guys remember that, but like how we're getting a mini NES this year.
3699520	3704360	There was a Commodore 64, one of those in 2004, which I never bought, and I really should
3704360	3706440	have as a single tear rolls down my face.
3706600	3709240	Maybe I could find one on eBay.
3709240	3710240	I don't know.
3710240	3716280	Anyhow, interesting thing about this, this really was basically the Olympics on the Commodore
3716280	3717280	64.
3717280	3718920	Without getting the Olympics license.
3718920	3719920	That's right.
3719920	3724360	This game never uses the word Olympics, and you aren't playing in the Olympics, you were
3724360	3729080	playing in the Epyx games, and you can represent one of several countries.
3729080	3733720	I think there was like, I don't know, maybe like 18 or maybe 27 countries, but one of
3733720	3737680	the countries, and I'm using my quotey fingers, was Epyx.
3737680	3741200	You could actually play, you could represent the US, you could represent Canada, you could
3741200	3744920	represent, you know, Mexico, you could represent all these different companies, or you could
3744920	3748240	represent Epyx, which would play the Jumpman Jr. theme.
3748240	3752000	If you represented, because like you're, when you won a medal in the game, it would actually
3752000	3755340	play the theme for whatever, you know, country you were.
3755340	3760000	And so as a kid, this was a way that I got to learn national anthems besides just the
3760000	3761000	US.
3761000	3762000	Who knew?
3762000	3763200	Did you ever play this as a kid, Logie?
3763200	3764960	I don't think I ever did.
3764960	3769640	But no, it's funny though, like, so that would totally make like some of the track and field
3769640	3775040	events, you know, more unique if that bullet was chasing after you.
3775040	3779200	Let's see, so there are eight events in the game, I'm sorry, seven events I think in the
3779200	3780200	game.
3780200	3787500	Pole vault, platform diving, sprinting, gymnastics, freestyle swimming, skeet shooting, and rowing.
3787500	3792900	And I can tell you like three of those four events was just how fast can you wiggle the
3792900	3794540	joystick back and forth.
3794540	3797540	That's how you ran in the game was just, it was like track and field, you remember Konami's
3797540	3799420	old arcade game track and field?
3799420	3802240	Some of the events were a lot like that, and I would say summer games almost had more in
3802240	3805920	common with track and field than some other stuff.
3805920	3809620	You could save your world records to the disc, which you know, was kind of a big deal in
3809620	3812040	the 1984.
3812040	3816100	But what I also think was really cool about this, let's talk about the sequel because
3816100	3820460	who knows if they'll ever make, or if we'll ever talk about this game again.
3820460	3825500	But the sequel to the game was summer games two, and summer games two had some new events,
3825500	3829300	and actually summer games two was the one I happened to play first.
3829300	3834420	And that had, it also had rowing in it, it had equestrian, it had fencing and cycling,
3834420	3836140	like it had some different events.
3836140	3840380	But what was really cool is that if you had summer games two, you could actually link
3840380	3845780	to summer games one, and you could do all the events in one giant Olympics, and it would
3845780	3849620	just tell you to put in the disc for summer games one when those events came up.
3849620	3853300	So that's really cool, like that makes me think like, come on, you DDR fans remember
3853300	3856940	append mode in DDR third mix, right, where you'd switch out the disc and put in second
3856940	3857940	mix?
3857940	3858940	It's like that.
3858940	3859940	But in the 80s.
3859940	3862280	So that's really cool, I think.
3862280	3865780	And of course, there was a winter games as well that many of you are talking about in
3865780	3867540	chat over at live.vog network.com.
3867540	3873300	And yeah, that was another kind of sequel-ish, I don't know, I always played California games.
3873300	3876180	I don't see the interesting thing about California games.
3876180	3877280	Was that an epics game?
3877280	3878280	It was an epics game.
3878280	3879280	What is?
3879320	3883040	So maybe, you know, this was a huge game, you know, the reason why I bring this up,
3883040	3886680	it's not just the timeliness of the Olympics being around the corner and all that.
3886680	3890760	But this was a very successful game for the Commodore 64.
3890760	3896440	And I guess some historians actually refer to it as the most sustainably popular in the
3896440	3901740	long life of the Commodore 64, which of course, was one of the most popular home computing
3901740	3903480	devices in the 1980s.
3903480	3908480	So yeah, I mean, summer games is really a legend on this system.
3908520	3912120	And so yeah, I guess I'm not, I always thought California games had more in common with skate
3912120	3913120	or die.
3913120	3915040	I don't know why I'm thinking of that as an EA game.
3915040	3920520	Not really mean, I mean, it had like, it had a half pipe, well, what did it have?
3920520	3927000	It had like, it had BMX, I'm thinking of the Atari Lynx version, so, had BMX, Hacky Sack,
3927000	3929920	Surfing, and...
3929920	3934120	You're right, California games was a derivative of summer games and winter games, I never
3934120	3935120	realized it.
3935160	3940360	It was half pipe, roller skating, surfing, BMX, foot bag, and flying disc.
3940360	3943200	Did you know there was a California games too?
3943200	3944640	I never realized that.
3944640	3949520	That was hang gliding, jet ski, snowboarding, body surfing, and skateboarding.
3949520	3950520	That's pretty cool.
3950520	3952080	Maybe that's why I associated it more with the skater die.
3952080	3953800	Skater die really needs to come back.
3953800	3957560	Well, and then they had, there was skier die, was the direct-
3957560	3958560	Skater die.
3958560	3959560	Yeah.
3959560	3960560	Skater die too, though.
3960560	3961560	Yeah, that's right.
3961560	3962560	There was.
3962560	3964760	But yeah, seriously, skater die needs to come.
3964760	3968400	That's a game that like this year made, modern skater die.
3968400	3969400	Absolutely.
3969400	3975040	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says, I have VCR California
3975040	3976240	games from Epyx.
3976240	3978240	I never realized that they did one of those.
3978240	3979560	How'd you do that?
3979560	3984680	Well, you know, VCR games were like huge for like a year.
3984680	3986200	Yeah, I know.
3986200	3988960	I owned the Action Max at one time.
3988960	3991480	So that was like, that was an awkward time.
3991480	3996480	Let's see, this is, this is from my dad who said he was never a gamer yet had a Coleco
3996480	4001280	vision with like 80 games, bought the Action Max and like a Nintendo and all these other
4001280	4003080	obscure things.
4003080	4004080	Interesting.
4004080	4007800	And Bobby Blackwolf says it was a traditional board game, but some spaces would say play
4007800	4011160	the next clip and the clip would show if you succeeded or failed.
4011160	4012400	So it sounds super basic.
4012400	4013400	Okay.
4013400	4014400	Yeah.
4014400	4015400	Interesting.
4015400	4018240	Bobby Blackwolf also saying summer games two is my favorite game back in the day.
4018240	4019240	Yeah.
4019240	4023480	I like summer games too, because the events weren't just the wiggling of the joystick
4023480	4024480	and all that.
4024480	4026720	You had some other stuff, like, especially like fencing and stuff.
4026720	4030560	And especially in winter games, like when you did the ice skating events and stuff,
4030560	4033080	you really had to think about, okay, I want to do a jump here.
4033080	4037000	I want to do a, you know, and actually had a little soundtrack that would play during
4037000	4038000	the event.
4038000	4039600	So those games were a lot of fun.
4039600	4043360	So I wanted to acknowledge as we head into the Olympics this year, I thought this was
4043360	4047000	a good week to acknowledge summer games, your classic game of the week on the Commodore
4047000	4050040	64 and a variety of other systems.
4050040	4051040	I'm sorry.
4051040	4057160	It wasn't halo when Jamie isn't here, but she did put out a, um, a decree on Twitter
4057160	4059840	that she had the right to veto it if it was ever halo.
4059840	4065680	So she's thinking ahead to, to the inevitable week when, when Loki tries to, uh, your decrees
4065680	4070480	have no power here, she, she might have an issue with that.
4070480	4071480	Loki.
4071480	4072480	She might have an issue with that.
4072480	4073480	All right.
4073480	4075320	Uh, when we take a break, we're going to come back with plenty more show.
4075320	4077400	We've got some rapid fire news coming at you.
4077400	4082440	We also have some more, um, news stories to get into and, um, Hey, we forgot to talk about
4082440	4083440	our gaming weeks.
4083440	4087440	I just realized we never got into your, we talked about your wife's gaming week.
4087440	4089960	We didn't talk about ours, speaking of living in Bizarro world.
4089960	4091640	So we'll get into our gaming weeks as well.
4091640	4092840	We'll get into that a little late.
4092840	4098520	Uh, we may have some guests joining us in studio, supposedly heading back from where
4098520	4099520	they were at.
4099520	4104640	So we'll see who knows what awaits us when we come back with more of orange lounge radio,
4104640	4112760	right after this.
4112760	4118200	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on July the 24th, 2016 with episode
4118200	4124360	number 651 of our show already in progress, myself and Loki here in studio.
4124360	4127560	And I already know what Loki's playing on his phone over there because I see his fingers
4127560	4129080	going tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
4129080	4133040	I haven't played it most of the, well, I have played it most of the week, but I didn't play
4133040	4134040	it this weekend.
4134440	4137800	And of course we're talking about tap Mike Katamari if you have no idea what, what we're
4137800	4138800	talking about there.
4138800	4143520	Uh, which, um, I've been playing a little bit of that, but not a ton.
4143520	4144520	I like you.
4144520	4145600	I kind of went a few days without playing it.
4145600	4149080	I think because like, you know, between Pokemon go and ingress, it's boring after a while.
4149080	4151000	It's like, it's, it's, I don't know.
4151000	4154800	It's just something to do while I'm sitting here because, well, I'm sorry that this show
4154800	4155800	is boring.
4155800	4156800	It's not boring me.
4156800	4158320	It's just like, it doesn't require me to pay attention to it at all.
4158320	4159320	It is.
4159320	4160320	It is.
4160320	4161320	It's kind of a Zen thing to do.
4161320	4163680	It's like, uh, you know, like when you are sitting in like a classroom or something,
4163680	4168000	you're playing with like slinky Rubik's cube or something that kind of, you know, something
4168000	4169760	keeps you, you're tactile or whatever.
4169760	4170760	All right.
4170760	4174600	Anyhow, uh, we're into some rapid fire news, uh, quickly here and then we'll get into our
4174600	4175600	gaming weeks.
4175600	4177120	So, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?
4177120	4178120	All right.
4178120	4182480	So, um, as I mentioned, you know, during our release dates, Marvel ultimate Alliance is
4182480	4187880	going to be coming out of the agency remastered, they announced it at San Diego comic con.
4187880	4192440	And um, not only will he be able to purchase those separately, um, individually they're
4192440	4196000	going to be sold for $39.99, but you can also get a bundle that saves you a little
4196000	4200760	bit of money for $60 and get one and two.
4200760	4206920	And it'll be Marvel ultimate Alliance's first time on PC as well.
4206920	4207920	I will have to wait.
4207920	4208920	I don't know.
4208920	4209920	Those are supposed to be pretty good games.
4209920	4214760	I haven't actually played them yet, so I may have to check those out when they're on sale.
4214760	4218100	I might check it out, but I feel like if I can hold off till black Friday, they'll be
4218100	4221800	even cheaper.
4221840	4229360	So this is unfortunate, but apparently, um, uh, Shuhei Yoshida's Twitter has been hacked
4229360	4233800	as you know, a lot of different people have been, especially celebrities that are on the
4233800	4235200	internet have been hacked.
4235200	4242600	Um, you know, he, uh, as unfortunately, I'm not sure if it's the same kind of the same
4242600	4248520	method as how they were, um, getting into other celebrities out there using two factor
4248520	4251440	authentication and cloning their phones.
4251440	4258580	But in this case, a hacking group called our mine, um, had taken it over for a little bit
4258580	4265320	and they're also the same ones claiming that they were hacking Pokemon Go servers.
4265320	4270240	To be honest, I don't think Pokemon Go servers needed any help.
4270240	4271760	No one would even know.
4271760	4272760	Yeah.
4272760	4275160	I think Pokemon Go kind of went down on its own.
4275160	4276160	Yeah.
4276160	4281960	So, uh, well, yeah, so they just basically, you know, they posted a few tweets and that
4281960	4282960	was about it.
4282960	4288360	You know, basically saying it's our mind and X-Box forever, ha ha funny.
4288360	4290360	No one cares.
4290360	4291360	All right.
4291360	4295520	Uh, well, let's, uh, go to some other stories here, including, uh, and by the way, maybe
4295520	4299600	you want to pull up what Jamie was going to talk about already.
4299600	4300600	So this is interesting.
4300600	4305360	So they're going to be making a Pokemon movie, but it might not be what you think, uh, and
4305360	4307160	maybe Pokemon Go is to thank for this.
4307160	4312640	I don't know, but deadline, which is usually a, a, a website or a blog that reports a little
4312640	4315880	more on a movie news than they do on gaming news.
4315880	4321600	Uh, apparently the studio legendary pictures who made the recent Warcraft movie, but they've
4321600	4322760	done a lot of big, big movies.
4322760	4325200	Like the Batman BN series is all them.
4325200	4327600	And you know, uh, they, they do a lot of big stuff.
4327600	4329800	Uh, Jurassic world was them too, right?
4329800	4334020	I think it was maybe anyway, uh, legendary has gotten Nintendo and the Pokemon company
4334020	4338140	to sign off on a live action Pokemon movie.
4338140	4343460	Uh, apparently legendary is going to make a movie specifically about detective Pikachu,
4343460	4346260	Danny DeVito for Pikachu's voice.
4346260	4347260	I know, right?
4347260	4350540	Somebody get Danny DeVito on this immediately.
4350540	4353900	Like this is where now fans dreams can come true.
4353900	4356020	And Danny DeVito can be the voice.
4356020	4360120	I feel like Nintendo would never sign off on it, but we can dream.
4360120	4364200	So yeah, uh, it's going to be a mystery tale in the Pokemon universe starring detective
4364200	4368200	Pikachu production expected to begin in 2017.
4368200	4373740	But I would not get too excited until we know a voice, a director, you could do with, it's
4373740	4374740	always sunny in Philadelphia.
4374740	4382800	You can just be like there that, you know, the gang collects Pokemon or, uh, Alan alchemy
4382800	4388120	and chat over at live.vogmentwork.com suggests a Pokemon movie directed by Lars Von Trier
4388120	4391560	rated NC 17.
4391560	4392560	That shot that.
4392560	4395560	So what's his style called where it's like you just, you basically are shooting something
4395560	4397620	on a fucking home cam quarter.
4397620	4404080	You're doing your whole movie natural, like dog dogmo was a Kevin Smith film, but it's
4404080	4408560	something he has like this certain method of shooting movies that's just basically like
4408560	4409560	cheap.
4409560	4410980	No, not found footage either.
4410980	4411980	I don't know.
4411980	4412980	It's yeah, I don't know.
4412980	4416740	Speaking of found footage, do you see there's another trailer or new trailer for a Blair
4416740	4417740	witch movie?
4417780	4423060	Apparently the woods is in fact a Blair witch sequel and everybody's losing their fucking
4423060	4426120	mind about it because this is a proper sequel.
4426120	4430980	Unlike the big studio one they did a couple of years after the first movie, I guess they're
4430980	4432540	kind of, I thought it was like a reboot or something.
4432540	4436280	I didn't actually know this is a set in the same universe.
4436280	4439100	It's the girl's brother from the first movie.
4439100	4440100	Yeah.
4440100	4444660	So I guess there is, are they doing all found footage like, or still, you know, it didn't
4444660	4445660	seem like it.
4445660	4450700	It was a trailer cause it didn't look like it kind of, it didn't look like found footage,
4450700	4455940	but they shot it like a shaky movie kind of like, I think they're, so I think they wanted
4455940	4459920	to get away from found footage cause a lot of movies do that now, the horror movies,
4459920	4463800	but they still kind of wanted to keep that cause remember the big thing with the original
4463800	4467660	was that like the camera shakes so much you're going to barf cause it's just like on the
4467660	4468660	big screen in the theater.
4468660	4470400	It was a big problem when it first came out.
4470400	4475740	So I think they still want to kind of keep that style of like violent, you know, movie,
4475740	4476740	but violent nausea.
4476740	4477740	Yeah.
4477740	4482160	Anyway, I don't know what that has to do with games, but maybe, maybe there'll be a video
4482160	4483160	game tie in.
4483160	4484640	They had a Blair Witch video game.
4484640	4485640	Did they have a Blair Witch video game?
4485640	4486640	I think it was a PC game.
4486640	4488400	I think you're on PlayStation one.
4488400	4491680	I feel like there was something maybe, maybe, I don't know, maybe not.
4491680	4494000	I could have made that up anyway.
4494000	4495000	This is kind of cute.
4495000	4504120	A Twitter account for Xbox in the UK posted re-imagined Xbox games as Pokemon Go.
4504120	4505120	That's right.
4505120	4509200	You can check this out on their Twitter from Xbox UK that says we've caught the Pokemon
4509200	4512520	Go fever and couldn't help but wonder what some of our games might look like.
4512520	4518340	And there's some doctored screens of Forza Go, Crackdown Go, and Halo Go.
4518340	4521320	And obviously it's just a little tongue in cheek thing, you know, making a joke about
4521320	4523840	Pokemon Go like a lot of companies are doing.
4523880	4527380	But what was funny about it is that they're all showing that they're running on Windows
4527380	4530640	phones, which Pokemon Go, they don't have Windows phone support.
4530640	4531640	That's why they have to.
4531640	4534040	So they have to come up with their own thing.
4534040	4539820	But then it also kind of made me think like I would totally play Forza Go, but they have
4539820	4544440	to think of a way to keep it safe because obviously it can't be about racing and the
4544440	4546000	things that you do in Forza.
4546000	4549400	It's all the opposite stuff that like Ingress and Pokemon Go, it's like it only counts your
4549400	4553820	distance if you're moving, you know, below, you know, 20 some miles an hour.
4553820	4556560	It's like it only counts your distance if you're moving over that.
4556560	4559680	Over the speed limit is what would count the speed limit.
4559680	4560880	They have to do something safe.
4560880	4561880	I don't know.
4561880	4567440	Yyr in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Crackdown Go sounds awesome.
4567440	4570320	Skills for kills agents, skills for kills.
4570320	4574080	I think wasn't there supposed to be some game somebody was talking about in one of the Ingress
4574080	4577040	Hangouts I think where like you actually use your phone to like kill people.
4577040	4578040	Yes, actually.
4578040	4579040	No, it is a thing.
4579520	4581960	It's an Indiegogo project right now.
4581960	4583720	I don't remember the fuck it's called.
4583720	4584880	It's like laser tag.
4584880	4590560	So you you get a case that goes on your phone and you use your phone like you hold your
4590560	4594440	phone out in front of you to basically shoot the other players.
4594440	4595440	Huh.
4595440	4596440	So it is a thing.
4596440	4601480	DarkTetsuya in chat suggests a future list list on Go game we want to see.
4601480	4603760	We might have to schedule that for a future week.
4603760	4607200	Also Tigerclaw wanted to link us to this before we get to your news.
4607200	4613480	There was a Blair Witch trilogy of video games, in fact, on Windows based PCs.
4613480	4619240	There was Blair Witch Volume 1, Rust and Par, Volume 2, The Legend of Coffin Rock, and Volume
4619240	4620240	3.
4620240	4621240	Oh, that's what it was called.
4621240	4622240	It was called Father I.O.
4622240	4624280	The Ellie Kedward tale.
4624280	4632400	Yeah, Father I.O. is the laser tag game that's on Indiegogo and they're saying or it's the
4632400	4633880	I'm sorry, Father I.O.
4633880	4635160	It's what is it called here?
4635160	4639120	It's I don't think it's actually called Father I.O.
4639120	4645000	It's the god load you stupid page.
4645000	4646000	Internet difficulties.
4646000	4649360	No, they're just like, it's garbage.
4649360	4657080	Basically, no, no, we're just not going to do this fucking have to log in to see your
4657080	4658080	stupid page.
4658080	4660680	No, that's not going to happen.
4660680	4665760	They have like, yeah, the interceptor is what they're calling the actual like gun thing.
4665760	4671280	And it looks like it's basically they're calling it the first real life, massively multiplayer
4671280	4673120	laser tag game.
4673120	4675700	So let me see if I can spin this around here.
4675700	4680720	So this is basically what it looks like, which is great radio for you to be a visual right
4680720	4681720	now.
4681720	4687560	Go search the Googles for father that I.O. or OK, Indiegogo laser tag.
4687560	4688560	Looks very Tron.
4688560	4689560	Yeah.
4689560	4694920	So you get that thing and then you basically slap it on your phone and it has, you know,
4694920	4696480	they're saying it's Bluetooth.
4696480	4701760	It's got some infrared receivers, emitters and a built in battery so that you can play
4701760	4702760	a little bit longer.
4702760	4706360	But yeah, that's the game is basically we're running around shooting each other.
4706360	4707360	All right.
4707360	4712400	I don't know how we got on that topic from Pokemon Go clones, but that's all right.
4712400	4713920	Let's move on.
4713920	4716400	What what what what would have dark soccer talk to us about tonight?
4716400	4718780	Should we talk about grandiose three?
4718780	4723980	It's now going to be available on the PlayStation store.
4723980	4728160	And yeah, it's under the PlayStation two classics banner.
4728160	4730100	You can check it out.
4730100	4734500	Also, I think, yeah, it's going to be ten dollars.
4734500	4737460	I will wait until a sale or something.
4737460	4741300	Yeah, again, one of those games to wait for Black Friday.
4741300	4742700	Yeah, exactly.
4742700	4743700	Or the flash sale.
4743700	4744700	Not necessarily.
4745700	4752220	Animal Crossing New Leaf is getting some amiibo based updates later this year.
4752220	4756940	So they're going to be adding content, of course, before the Amiibos only worked with
4756940	4761780	that happy home designer, which, I'll be honest, is kind of a waste of a Pokemon game animal
4761780	4763240	crossing game.
4763240	4766060	But they're going to be adding compatibility later this year.
4766060	4770940	And it's going to basically be supporting both the Amiibos and the Amiibo cards.
4770940	4774180	And what exactly is it going to do?
4774340	4775340	I don't know.
4775340	4779300	Basically, they're saying that they have new animals as well.
4779300	4782900	They're going to be showing off them, including some that look like Callie and Marie from
4782900	4789540	Splatoon, as well as a squid themed house, or, you know, I don't know.
4789540	4791300	That'd be kind of neat.
4791300	4794900	And new figures, I guess, are going to be released as well.
4794900	4799660	So it looks neat.
4799660	4800660	I don't know.
4800660	4803820	I didn't play this really on the 3DS, but I mean, it's kind of cool that they're adding
4803860	4808740	this, especially for a game that came out back in 2012, I mean, it's kind of amazing
4808740	4810820	to even see updates for that.
4810820	4816380	But I guess if you can do that and sell some more Amiibos in the process, why not?
4816380	4820300	I never really understood the point of happy home designer, but I think, you know, full
4820300	4822220	fledged animal crossing game is pretty cool.
4822220	4825060	Does this mean we're going to see some more updates for older games as well?
4825060	4828820	I mean, other older games, that'd be kind of cool.
4828820	4833780	I love that they're going back and like updating a really old title, even if it's, you know,
4833780	4836420	Amiibo stuff, but still, I think that's pretty cool.
4836420	4837420	Yeah.
4837420	4841860	And like they're showing that, like I said, you know, they have the Amiibo stuff for like,
4841860	4843940	they have Splatoon themed stuff in there.
4843940	4846620	So that's kind of neat that you'll be able to use your Amiibos for something.
4846620	4852140	I'm always about, you know, having more, you know, make those things have a purpose, you
4852140	4855580	know, have some more support in these games and there should be more of them that support
4855580	4857340	them if you're going to push this platform.
4857340	4862700	YYR in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Nintendo has announced that the primary function
4862700	4866460	of Animal Crossing New Leaf's Amiibo support is to incite a Loki rant.
4866460	4867460	I know this is true.
4867460	4868460	I read it on the internet.
4868460	4873740	And they have also got, was it, they're showing off, let's see, what else do they have here?
4873740	4874740	Oh, that's about it.
4874740	4875740	Yeah.
4875740	4876740	So neat.
4876740	4877740	Okay.
4877740	4878740	Yeah.
4878740	4882180	I mean, I don't really care too much about Pokemon on 3DS.
4882180	4888180	I mean, it's, I don't know Pokemon, Animal Crossing.
4888180	4889180	It's cool.
4889180	4891460	I mean, might as well support these older titles.
4891460	4896100	I mean, I'm just surprised that we haven't heard of a new Animal Crossing game yet, but
4896100	4897100	I guess that's for the NX.
4897100	4902660	If the NX really is a console slash handheld hybrid, Animal Crossing seems like a perfect
4902660	4905660	fit for that, but we'll see.
4905660	4906660	Time will tell.
4906660	4907660	Yeah.
4907660	4908660	All right.
4908660	4911460	Let's, let's go to, how was your gaming week?
4911460	4912900	Cause we never did that at the beginning of the show.
4912900	4916980	So I think now's a good opportunity for us to take a trip and talk about what we've been
4916980	4918660	playing this week.
4918660	4922220	I think I probably forgot cause I don't have a lot of new stuff in my gaming week, but
4922220	4923540	maybe you, you had a different experience.
4923540	4924540	Loki, I don't know.
4924540	4925540	No, I did not.
4925540	4928820	And I didn't get to play any console games this week because once again, my wife has
4928820	4930420	been monopolizing the TV.
4930420	4933540	Thankfully we've taken a break or as I used to say, she's taking a break from watching
4933540	4939260	Grazing Anatomy so that we can watch, um, Stranger Things, but, and you know, eventually
4939260	4945980	that's going to end and it's just going to be the Grazing Anatomy repeat of all 10 seasons
4945980	4946980	again.
4946980	4947980	God.
4947980	4950100	I hate that show.
4950100	4955900	Uh, so no, this week I've been playing Pokemon Go a little bit.
4955900	4959180	Um, a lot of it's been mainly just to and from work.
4959180	4962580	I've never really been playing, you know, the only time I actually went out and played
4962580	4967580	was like, uh, you know, this weekend I took my son to the mall to play it.
4967580	4972220	Um, we wanted to go downtown or somewhere outdoors, but it just didn't work out.
4972220	4977700	Like you know, the weather that we have right now, it's like 90 like at 10 o'clock.
4977700	4982380	It's just, it's not good unless you get out there like super early, which we just didn't
4982380	4983940	cause I had to get my car as long.
4983940	4989620	Um, so I played that, I played Ingress just enough to, um, you know, keep all my streaks
4989620	4990620	going and everything.
4990620	4994660	And I actually did do some fielding stuff because I was in the areas to do that and
4994660	4998780	it's been a lot easier now that with the local drama and everything to be able to take over
4998780	4999780	certain areas.
4999780	5004260	Um, so been doing that and then of course, you know, tap my katamari, been playing that
5004260	5005260	a little bit.
5005260	5008740	Um, this game really has no point, so eventually I'll get bored with it.
5008740	5015100	Um, but for now I just, you know, playing for really no reason cause there's no point
5015100	5016100	to the game.
5016100	5019940	Uh, I have to admit my gaming week has not been that exciting.
5019940	5024460	I was still playing Final Fantasy 14, which got the deep dungeon patch this week, which
5024460	5029220	was, it was okay, but I was just, I was hoping it would be a little more solo friendly and
5029220	5034420	it definitely seems like the deep dungeon is, and, and you know, if you don't know or
5034420	5038220	following Final Fantasy 14 news, it's basically like a randomly generated dungeon that you
5038220	5043540	can run, um, over and over again as a, it's kind of like a different, like little side
5043540	5047180	thing, like an exploration side thing that they've put in the game basically.
5047180	5051620	Um, but it's not tuned very well for solo play.
5051620	5056380	Uh, I mean if you want to do like super hard mode and I guess that's the point of it, you
5056380	5059540	can do solo play, but then if you're playing with like four people, you can practically
5059540	5060700	steamroll through it.
5060700	5064300	So I don't know, I feel like I would have liked the balance to have been a little different
5064300	5068300	or even maybe customizable with different rewards and that would have been very cool.
5068300	5069300	But uh, yeah, I don't know.
5069300	5074820	It just, I like it more than the last exploration thing they tried to do, which was the Diadem.
5074820	5078060	Um, but uh, it's, I was kind of hoping for more.
5078060	5082700	Um, I also checked out on the PlayStation 4 this week and I did a quick live stream earlier.
5082700	5087420	Uh, I did a live stream for Gradius 2, which they released on the PlayStation 4 as part
5087420	5089040	of the Arcade Archives.
5089040	5094020	And one thing I learned during the live stream is that boy, am I fucking terrible at Gradius
5094020	5098700	2, which is the song that, or which is the game that Burning Heat came from, uh, in the
5098700	5099700	first stage.
5099700	5102060	Remember that old, uh, DDR 2DX song?
5102060	5103060	Yeah.
5103060	5106860	So, uh, you could watch me play that game for a little while and be very, very, very
5106860	5110340	terrible at it on the archives on my Twitch channel at Rob Rogers.
5110340	5111540	So like all games you play.
5111540	5112540	Oh, hi Shane.
5112540	5113540	How are you?
5113540	5114540	Hello.
5114540	5115540	Fine.
5115540	5116540	I'm tired.
5116540	5117540	Thank you for randomly dropping in the show and blessing us with your presence.
5117540	5118540	How are you?
5118540	5119540	You're welcome.
5119540	5120540	I'm so sleepy.
5120540	5121540	Why are you late?
5121540	5123060	You could have been here to fill in for Dark Sakura.
5123100	5124100	Okay.
5124100	5127460	So I've been moving all day, so I'm exhausted.
5127460	5133460	And me and my friend, we went and saw Spirited Away in the theaters on 35.
5133460	5135740	I thought your friend was going to stay and be on the show.
5135740	5137180	No, he's got stuff he needs to do.
5137180	5139300	He'd probably be more interesting than you, but.
5139300	5140300	Wow.
5140300	5144220	Well, I guess we're going to turn off this mic a whole bunch tonight just to annoy you.
5144220	5148100	Oh, and I've got all these things I can rustle too, because I haven't finished my food.
5148100	5152420	He knows that's my pet peeve when he rustles the fricking paper on the microphone.
5152780	5153780	Okay.
5153780	5154780	No, all kidding aside.
5154780	5155780	So you went in some movies.
5155780	5156780	Yeah.
5156780	5157780	Yeah.
5157780	5158780	We saw Spirited Away at a local theater.
5158780	5160940	They had it on 35 millimeter film.
5160940	5162860	I've never even seen that movie.
5162860	5166460	So it was my first time seeing it and it was subbed, not dubbed.
5166460	5167460	Oh, interesting.
5167460	5168460	What'd you think?
5168460	5170460	It was good.
5170460	5175820	It, like, I don't know, the way they kind of wrapped everything up really quick at the
5175820	5180060	end was annoying, but I also didn't want to sit there for another two hours just so they
5180060	5181740	could wrap everything up.
5181740	5185500	But it was still a good movie, despite it sounding like I'm complaining about it.
5185500	5186500	I'd see it again.
5186500	5188060	And that theater was cool.
5188060	5189060	I really liked that theater.
5189060	5190060	Oh, yeah.
5190060	5191060	It's a gorgeous theater.
5191060	5192060	Yeah.
5192060	5193060	Akuma JP in chat asks, why?
5193060	5196660	And I'm not sure if that's a question about Gradius 2 or if that's a question about Spirited
5196660	5199700	Away, because this is kind of a random thing to just show on the big screen out of nowhere,
5199700	5200700	but.
5200700	5201700	Yeah.
5201700	5202700	They're doing another one.
5202700	5203700	They're doing Howl's Moving Castle on August 14th.
5203700	5204700	Oh, that's a really good one.
5204700	5207340	I'll be at Power Morphicon, so I'll be able to see it.
5207340	5208340	I'll go without you.
5208340	5209340	All right.
5209340	5210340	Sounds like a plan.
5210340	5211340	Yeah.
5211940	5212940	And it says, OK, why now?
5212940	5213940	Spirited Away.
5213940	5214940	I don't know.
5214940	5216420	I just they I don't know.
5216420	5220420	Apparently, they showed it yesterday and the demand was so great that they decided to do
5220420	5221420	it again today.
5221420	5224780	And it was like packed that entire theater was full.
5224780	5228740	This is also like one of the art house cinemas downtown.
5228740	5231660	It's not one that usually plays a lot of mainstream movies.
5231660	5235500	So I think once in a while they do special screenings to play all the Pokemon movies
5235500	5236860	out of there.
5236860	5239540	I'm using my quotey fingers, cult movies.
5239540	5240820	They seem to do that once in a while.
5240820	5241820	Yeah.
5241820	5244060	They also like it's the theater that will play A Wonderful Life.
5244060	5245380	It's a Wonderful Life at Christmas.
5245380	5246380	Yeah.
5246380	5247380	On their marquee.
5247380	5249980	They had like they're going to have weird science there and Lethal Weapon.
5249980	5250980	Awesome.
5250980	5254220	So, yeah, they do that, I guess.
5254220	5255860	But not Rocky Horror Picture Show.
5255860	5256860	Thank goodness.
5256860	5257860	Shut up.
5257860	5259460	We've been trying to do that at that theater for years.
5259460	5261540	I can see why it has a stage and everything.
5261540	5264540	Well, so does the one we do it at now has all that, too.
5264540	5267420	But the location for that one is great.
5267420	5268420	Anyway.
5268420	5269420	All right.
5269420	5270420	So we were talking about How Was Your Gaming Week?
5271020	5272020	So I was talking about Gradius 2.
5272020	5278380	And then I wanted to mention real quick, I also this week may have spent a little money
5278380	5280900	to reactivate World of Warcraft.
5280900	5286300	And yeah, I've been playing with the guys from gamebuoy.org in their guild.
5286300	5287580	I don't know.
5287580	5289580	They had a big patch this week.
5289580	5291460	I was curious.
5291460	5293580	Fourteen has kind of slowed down a lot.
5293580	5297080	I mean, yeah, they had the deep dungeon patch, but I don't know, I'm kind of just waiting
5297080	5298940	on the expansion for Fourteen.
5298980	5303540	So now seemed like a good time to check out WoW and see what's kind of changed and different.
5303540	5307500	And you know, it's inevitable that as somebody who did play WoW for years and years and even
5307500	5312020	had a podcast on it at one time, I have to at least check out the expansion.
5312020	5316900	I think as a player that played so long, you are required to like even I'm required to.
5316900	5317900	Yeah.
5317900	5320740	And so as much as you might want to roll your eyes, you know, I am rolling my eyes because
5320740	5323340	you pay like I wanted to see the changes.
5323340	5325620	And so I just made a trial character.
5326500	5331860	It's not a great way to see the changes, but I'm not paying Blizzard yet.
5331860	5333020	Yet is the key word there.
5333020	5334020	Just saying.
5334020	5335020	Yeah.
5335020	5336020	All right.
5336020	5338260	Um, let's see.
5338260	5339620	That's really it for my gaming week.
5339620	5341380	Isn't that enough between all the standard stuff?
5341380	5343020	I mean, I dipped into Diablo three.
5343020	5346680	I didn't even realize season six ended at some point and they're starting season seven
5346680	5347680	in a couple of weeks.
5347680	5350620	I had to dip into Diablo three, but not a lot, a lot of L's.
5350620	5351980	Shane, how about you?
5351980	5352980	So she just joined us.
5352980	5353980	How was your gaming week?
5353980	5354980	What kind of video games you played this week?
5355340	5357340	Um, I played Pokemon.
5357340	5358540	That's that's how I play.
5358540	5365140	Like for real, I can't not Pokemon go cause I'm like, as I talked about on the podcast
5365140	5372460	that we have for Pokemon, um, which I forget the name of it right now, um, just things
5372460	5373460	slipped my mind.
5373460	5374460	The pokey.
5374460	5375460	Stop podcast.
5375460	5376460	There you go.
5376460	5377460	Stop for all the Pokemon chat.
5377460	5382500	Anyway, that three foot bug or whatever is just really, really terrible.
5382500	5384580	But that's why you use pokey vision.
5384580	5389900	But I don't want to have to use something extra just to be able to hunt them down because
5389900	5391620	I like going saves you.
5391620	5395060	It saves you time for having to hunt them down because you can go, okay, I need this
5395060	5396060	one.
5396060	5397060	Oh, it's right there.
5397060	5398060	But that's not the fun of Pokemon.
5398060	5399060	Go for me.
5399060	5402940	The fun of Pokemon go is getting with friends and then just like looking at the radar and
5402940	5406220	seeing what's near and then if something pops up, we start to hunt it.
5406220	5410300	It's not like I'm, I do want to go to like the Dratini farm that's in Sacramento.
5410300	5416440	But beyond that, I just like driving around and oh look, there's a freaking something
5416440	5417440	or other.
5417440	5421740	I don't even know why I'm missing at this point, but I like that aspect and that bug
5421740	5422940	is ruining it for me.
5422940	5427860	But I'm talking about Pokemon X, Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire.
5427860	5433700	I just play that constantly shiny hunting and I redid or I'm still in the process of
5433700	5437460	redoing my info chart thing.
5437460	5441180	Just so you know, Pokevision says there's a Vulpix down the street.
5441180	5442180	Don't even care.
5442180	5443520	Four minutes left on it.
5443520	5448660	That's cool for that Vulpix who's going to go get murdered by people.
5448660	5453900	But I redid my little spreadsheet and I, you know, I was on our podcast, I was like, oh,
5453900	5455900	I'm just like above 60 barely maybe.
5455900	5459660	No, I'm pushing 70 now apparently after doing all my updates.
5459660	5463300	So I am over 10% of the way done.
5463300	5466140	So that makes me happy.
5466140	5467140	And that's it.
5467140	5468140	Cause I don't play any other games.
5468140	5469140	All right.
5469140	5470620	Well, Pokemon is a big investment.
5470620	5471620	Yeah.
5471620	5473620	Let's yeah.
5473620	5480140	Between all the copies I'm getting for Sun and Moon at this point, I'm at eight copies
5480140	5486300	of that game total when it comes out between the games I'm going to keep and the ones I'm
5486300	5487500	gifting.
5487500	5494180	So Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, remember he lives in Japan and says my Yo-kai
5494180	5499340	Watch 3 is like collecting dust now ever since Pokemon Go released here.
5499340	5501820	Interesting timing how that worked.
5501820	5507980	I wonder if they did that on purpose because what didn't Yo-kai Watch 3 have like no competition
5507980	5508980	right when it came out.
5508980	5509980	Like no other games released.
5509980	5513860	Yeah, we did the, we went over the releases the other week and yeah, nothing else was
5513860	5514860	out that week.
5514860	5520340	So that is some clever timing because a lot of people are like that.
5520340	5522220	Whether it was intentional or not.
5522220	5523220	That's gotta be intentional.
5523260	5527420	I gotta say though, I think the Yo-kai event that's coming to Final Fantasy 14 looks really
5527420	5528420	cute.
5528420	5529420	I really want that ghost mount.
5529420	5537100	Yeah, it is a, it's a cute event that's coming, but still, that's crazy that that had to be
5537100	5538100	planned.
5538100	5539940	You know what, you can actually get that Vulpix right now because it's within distance from
5539940	5540940	us.
5540940	5543580	I should turn on Pokemon Go.
5543580	5544580	I haven't done it all today.
5544580	5546420	Well, now that's a different story, right Shane?
5546420	5548700	Yeah, cause I don't have to get up.
5548700	5549700	Just sit right here.
5549700	5554340	I think I should bring up my phone as well and make Loki do another story here at Orange
5554340	5555340	Lounge Radio.
5555340	5558060	I would assume by now you caught the Vulpix anyway.
5558060	5560220	No, I don't know.
5560220	5564200	I know I did in the beta, but like, you know, a lot of these Pokemon that were in the beta
5564200	5567380	that were just all over the place, you know, like, oh, hey, cool.
5567380	5570220	It's doing the fucking curveball glitch again.
5570220	5571220	That's awesome.
5571220	5572220	Curveball glitch?
5572220	5574500	I fucking like just throwing my balls in nowhere.
5574500	5579260	Out of context, that's an amazing, even Shane's laughing.
5579260	5582100	Okay, seriously, fuck this bullshit.
5582100	5587900	Well, we'll just put you on hold for a while.
5587900	5591420	Anyways, seriously, fix your shit.
5591420	5597220	This is kind of tragic, you know, because it was a promo for like a video game that
5597220	5598620	is kind of okay.
5598620	5604100	I mean, I don't know, but they were doing a promo shoot for that brand new Ubisoft extreme
5604100	5611260	sports game called Steep, and there was a pro skier, Matilda Rapinport, who got caught
5611260	5615060	in an avalanche during the shoot and died.
5615060	5616620	So absolutely tragic.
5616620	5621140	That's got to be a terrible way to go, but of course, you know, they're deeply saddened
5621140	5627940	to learn that she's died, and, you know, she's a remarkable free-skiing athlete.
5627940	5630620	And yeah, that was pretty terrible.
5630620	5633860	That's, yeah, that's tragic that that happened.
5633860	5638700	I mean, I guess it's not totally about video games, but it just also goes to show that
5638700	5644100	these commercials and stuff, you know, sometimes they do some really extreme stuff to show
5644100	5645100	on the television.
5645100	5649100	I wonder if they'll memorialize certain games somehow.
5649100	5650380	I think they would have to.
5650380	5651380	I really hope they do.
5651380	5652380	I really hope they do.
5652380	5656460	Well, to try and lighten the mood a little bit, let's talk about LEGO Dimensions and
5656460	5659060	some new expansion packs that are coming out for LEGO Dimensions.
5659060	5661540	Now, we already knew about this because of E3.
5661540	5666500	They've already talked about these new packs, but we got some of the details about when
5666500	5667940	and what we're getting.
5667940	5673460	So, first off, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which will be, I guess, six
5673460	5677380	new levels and new bricks for the LEGO Gateway.
5677380	5680180	It's, yeah, that's pretty cool.
5680180	5682460	I guess there's two packs that actually come with this.
5682460	5686300	There's a story pack and a second pack that's like a fun pack.
5686300	5688780	So they're doing a lot for this, but they're expecting this movie to be...
5688780	5692340	So is the story pack not fun because they had to make a fun pack also?
5692340	5696820	No, I think the fun pack is just a different figure and I don't think it actually has the
5696820	5699980	levels in it, so there are probably different prices is what it is.
5699980	5704020	The Sonic the Hedgehog pack will have a new level with locations from Sonic games, including
5704020	5707020	Green Hill, Emerald Coast, Labyrinth, and more.
5707020	5711060	They'll have a Sonic mini figure and a three-in-one Sonic speedster.
5711060	5715720	Wait, real quick, speaking of Sonic, did we already cover the Sonic stuff from this week?
5715720	5717420	We did, but I'm sure you have something to say.
5717460	5721340	I just want to talk about the music from the trailer, how I kept that on loop like crazy
5721340	5723260	because it was so good.
5723260	5725780	And I also want to talk about for Loki right now that I caught that Vulpix.
5725780	5726780	Yeah, I did too.
5726780	5727780	That was like an hour ago.
5727780	5732020	Yes, let me describe the series of events that happened with Vulpix.
5732020	5736940	So first we had the stupid, you know, curveball glitch thing, which didn't fucking work.
5736940	5738060	What is the curveball glitch?
5738060	5741700	The curveball glitch is basically where when you're throwing, normally to do a curveball
5741700	5744300	you have to make little circles and then you throw.
5744300	5748060	A curveball glitch means it just fucking does it when it fucking feels like it.
5748060	5749060	Oh, well that...
5749060	5751940	And it will keep doing it just because it fucking feels like it.
5751940	5752940	And then on top of that...
5752940	5754020	I think it's Logi's phone.
5754020	5761460	And then on top of that, so I, you know, I closed the app down, put it back up, and then,
5761460	5768140	or no, I'm sorry, I, you know, put it to sleep, brought it back up again, that was fixed.
5768140	5772300	I threw the thing and then it started doing it again.
5772300	5775980	Close it, put it back up again, or, you know, put it to sleep, put it back.
5775980	5779900	GPS lost, the whole thing fucking froze.
5779900	5784420	Closed the whole app down, brought it back, Vulpix spawned again, and immediately disappeared.
5784420	5787660	So fuck this fucking game.
5787660	5789580	Can I, can I go back to talking about Legos, please?
5789580	5793620	Because the next one is Gremlins, and I kind of think Shane wants to know the details about
5793620	5794620	the Gremlins pack.
5794620	5795620	Yes, please, because I do love Gremlins.
5795620	5801420	Okay, so the Gremlins team pack will have rivals Gizmo and Stripe Lego minifigures.
5801420	5807660	You can rebuild the 3-in-1 RC Racer vehicle into the Gadget, Omatic, and Scarlet Scorpion,
5807660	5812100	and the 3-in-1 Flash and Finish into Rampage, Record Player, and Stripe's Throne.
5812100	5817300	I wish they were doing Gremlins 2 instead, because I think that would lend itself better
5817300	5822380	to Lego Dimensions because it's so goofy, whereas Gremlins 1, while kind of goofy, was
5822380	5824060	also pretty dark.
5824060	5827840	ET, the Extra Terrestrial, is out also.
5827840	5833260	It will have an ET Lego minifigure, and you can build the Phone Home device and rebuild
5833260	5836320	it into Mobile Uplink and Supercharged Satellite.
5836320	5838520	And then lastly, Adventure Time.
5838520	5843760	The Adventure Time fun pack will have Marceline the Vampire Queen as a Lego minifigure, and
5843760	5847980	then you can build the Lunatic Amp to make some noise and rebuild it into the Shadow
5847980	5852120	Scorpion and Heavy Metal Monster for extra in-game powers.
5852120	5853120	So there you go.
5853120	5857080	That is some details on the upcoming Lego packs.
5857480	5858480	Cool.
5858480	5861680	They're all coming out in November, by the way.
5861680	5866320	Let's move on with, I guess I'll do this one, unless you have it up, Loki.
5866320	5867320	Jamie's next story.
5867320	5868680	I have them all up.
5868680	5870040	Okay, you want to talk about this then?
5870040	5871400	Yeah, we can talk about it.
5871400	5873760	So this is kind of different.
5873760	5878400	I'm not sure how wide of an audience this is going to be for, but Square Enix is developing
5878400	5886720	a game specifically for the Apple Watch, and it's a game called Chaos Rings.
5887360	5893480	Or it's from a series, Chaos Rings, but now it's a spinoff called Cosmos Rings, which
5893480	5895160	you can only play on an Apple Watch.
5897160	5900640	And they don't really have any other details other than it's going to release later this
5900640	5901640	summer.
5901640	5906400	I'm very curious to know how with that tiny screen, but I'm sure that's what a lot of
5906400	5909400	people are thinking right now, is how's that going to work with such a tiny screen, but
5909400	5910400	we'll see.
5910400	5912960	You have some screenshots.
5912960	5915680	It doesn't really look like much.
5915720	5923680	Is it something that maybe teams up with your phone or with a Mac or something that would
5923680	5924680	maybe elaborate?
5924680	5925680	I don't know.
5925680	5926680	Maybe.
5926680	5927680	I don't know.
5927680	5928680	It just doesn't look like much.
5928680	5929680	I would not be interested to play this.
5929680	5930680	It almost looks like...
5930680	5937480	It reminds me of a higher definition version of those PocketStation games.
5937480	5943800	They're very limited, lower resolution, they kind of played in conjunction with other things,
5943800	5947320	but it just doesn't look that great at all.
5947320	5949480	I don't really know what the point of it is.
5949480	5951200	All right.
5951200	5953240	So you also have some Pokemon Go news for us.
5953240	5954560	Boy, we can't stop talking about this game.
5954560	5957480	Make this quick, because some people in chat are like, oh God, they're talking about Go
5957480	5958480	again.
5958480	5959480	It's the biggest thing in gaming right now.
5959480	5962460	Yeah, so Pokemon Go, it's launched in Japan.
5962460	5963720	That's a pretty big deal.
5963720	5965640	So they did that.
5965640	5968120	And also France, actually.
5968120	5970520	So it launched in France as well.
5970520	5976040	And then, this is a little bit more regional, but Zipcar, which is I guess like an Uber
5976040	5981080	or something like that, they're doing free chauffeured rides for Pokemon Go players in
5981080	5982080	Boston.
5982080	5987960	So you can, you know, normally you would rent those cars, I guess.
5987960	5993640	So Zalenny reserved the cars to go play around the city.
5993640	5998120	Neat, I guess.
5998120	5999120	I guess, yeah.
6000120	6002000	How did you make money off that, though?
6002000	6003400	Maybe it's a brand awareness thing.
6003400	6010880	Yeah, they're also supplying snacks, water, and phone chargers for those playing Pokemon
6010880	6011880	Go.
6011880	6013800	All right.
6013800	6016440	Let's talk about something that might be too little, too late.
6016440	6017440	I don't know.
6017440	6022280	But Nintendo this week released a demo to Star Fox Zero.
6022280	6023280	That's right.
6023280	6026440	If you want to check out Star Fox Zero, you can actually check out a free downloadable
6026440	6027440	demo.
6027440	6031440	There's pretty much the game's tutorial mode, and there's also the Battle Begins animated
6031440	6033240	short tacked on there.
6033240	6036640	So it should give you a good feel if you're going to actually enjoy the game or not, which
6036640	6038720	a lot of critics didn't.
6038720	6041600	But a lot of people seem to like it well enough.
6041600	6045960	I don't think I was hearing a lot of bad feedback, but I don't think the game sold very well
6045960	6046960	either.
6046960	6051280	So I'm really surprised that Nintendo didn't try to push this demo a lot sooner.
6051280	6055660	I mean, I understand if maybe they didn't want it out there week one, but I'm really
6055660	6060340	surprised they didn't get it out there within the first month because Star Fox Zero came
6060340	6062300	out what, like three months ago?
6062300	6063300	I don't know.
6063300	6067980	Anyway, Nintendo may be changing things up because a free version of Metroid Prime Blast
6067980	6074220	Ball also came out, and this is before Federation Force, which is supposed to include this as
6074220	6075220	a part of it.
6075220	6080140	So interesting that they are putting that out a little early to try to raise awareness
6080140	6083820	for Federation Force, which I didn't realize is only a month away.
6083820	6085220	Holy moly.
6086220	6091300	Maybe I'll check out the Star Fox Zero demo just to see if, kind of what I think.
6091300	6095020	How many times do they get to play the demo because of this bullshit that they have these
6095020	6098460	stupid play limited demos?
6098460	6101180	I don't know if it has a play limit or if it does, they're not talking about it.
6101180	6102620	It probably does.
6102620	6103900	Like all their demos do.
6103900	6107540	Yeah, but have you ever hit or even gotten close to the limit?
6107540	6108540	Even Bravely Default?
6108540	6109720	But why even have a limit?
6109720	6110720	It's a fucking demo.
6110720	6112260	I don't understand that.
6112300	6115940	Oh well, if they could play the demo a bunch of times, then you're just not gonna buy the
6115940	6116940	game.
6116940	6121780	If your game is that fucking lame that a demo can suffice for you, the gameplay in it, then
6121780	6124980	your game is not good enough.
6124980	6125980	I don't know.
6125980	6130420	I don't know the logic behind it either, but I'm assuming it's so that it can't exist years
6130420	6132220	and years and years from now or something.
6132220	6133220	I don't know.
6133220	6134220	That's dumb.
6134220	6141060	Or it's like everybody learned their lesson after Konami with P.T., like that overshadowed
6141060	6143820	anything that they're ever gonna do for the rest of their history.
6143820	6145260	Good point.
6145260	6153900	All right, let's go to our mailbag.
6153900	6159340	Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and usually Dark
6159340	6163700	Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read her favorite emails for you.
6163700	6169340	However, since she is out unexpectedly tonight, I will be taking on that role bravely in her
6169340	6170340	behalf.
6170340	6175260	Maybe you can still, of course, always send us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6175260	6180500	Let's get to our first email tonight from Andy R., who's emailing us about, guess what?
6180500	6181500	Pokemon Go.
6181500	6182500	That's right, Pokemon Go.
6182500	6186220	Hey, some more Pokemon Go for you, because why not?
6186220	6189340	It's almost like he knew what tonight's show is gonna turn into.
6189340	6192180	First, I do wanna say that I agree with Loki.
6192180	6194620	The game's mechanics really aren't that good.
6194620	6198300	The gym fighting is especially boring and exacerbated by the server troubles that make
6198300	6201460	it near impossible for me to even fight gyms.
6201460	6205760	Somehow the game has its hooks in me, though, and I've been taking a lot of midnight walks
6205760	6210020	to catch Pokemon when I would otherwise be avoiding this Phoenix heat.
6210020	6214120	Side note, my FU of the week goes to Niantic for releasing this during the time of year
6214120	6217100	when it's 110 degrees almost every day.
6217100	6218100	You poor soul.
6218100	6222900	Anyway, uh, second, and what I really wanna get to, but why is this game bringing out
6222900	6224880	the assholes so much?
6224880	6229000	Maybe it's just my Twitter or Facebook, but recently the number of Pogo posts is starting
6229000	6234240	to be outweighed by the I'm not playing Pokemon Go because I'm not 10 years old posts.
6234240	6238020	On a base level I can get it, the pushback against something that's popular or getting
6238020	6239020	a lot of hype.
6239020	6244400	I feel the same every Superb Owl season, or when people are going nuts for a new Call
6244400	6246840	of Duty game, a series I've never been into.
6246840	6251480	But I feel like what sets the Pogo hate apart is how much it seems to be targeting the players
6251480	6253420	more than the game itself.
6253460	6257660	The cultural zeitgeist that preceded the Star Wars movie last year was certainly accompanied
6257660	6262660	by a ton of the the Star Wars movies really aren't that good counterculture, but I didn't
6262660	6265940	see anyone calling Star Wars fans fat or lazy.
6265940	6270740	Meanwhile, every other anti-Pogo post insinuates that players are basement-dwelling neonates
6270740	6275780	with a severe lack of social skills or talking about how the poster doesn't need a stupid
6275780	6277780	app to get them to exercise.
6277780	6282060	Andy, when they say those things, they're only talking about team instinct.
6282580	6284980	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm not...
6284980	6290460	Don't take that seriously, I'm not getting into the team war hype, but sometimes it's
6290460	6292740	a little fun to throw a little shade, a little shade.
6292740	6297380	Andy R. concludes, what do you think of the reactions to this game, or is this just the
6297380	6298860	internet being the internet?
6298860	6302260	Thanks, Andy R. What do you think?
6302260	6306980	Shane, what do you think of all the anti-Pogo stuff that's out there?
6306980	6308540	I don't really see it, to be honest.
6308540	6310580	Well, you don't even log into Facebook, really, right?
6310580	6311580	Is that why?
6312100	6315700	It's on Twitter, and what did I see today after I got out of the movie?
6315700	6324060	Everybody going crazy over actual artwork of the leaders from Pokemon Go, and it's like
6324060	6330700	everybody's still having a good time, and I see an occasional celebrity or faux celebrity
6330700	6335420	have to say something like, oh, this is worthless, go do something better.
6335420	6341020	But that's it, normal, genuine people on Twitter seem to be like, this is so much fun, and
6341020	6344300	I love socializing with everybody and getting out and doing this.
6344300	6350500	I think it is a large part the internet being the internet, and because on social media,
6350500	6356860	a lot of people crave attention, because it's very easy to get on social media.
6356860	6362780	And sometimes the quickest way to get attention is to run counterculture against whatever
6362780	6365060	is the big thing right now.
6365060	6366660	And I think this happens with a lot of stuff.
6366660	6369220	I don't think it's necessarily limited to video games.
6369220	6374420	Like you illustrated in your email, it's about movies.
6374420	6381860	I think it's a huge part of why politics is so fucking gross this year, even compared
6381860	6385140	to eight years ago, four years ago.
6385140	6390260	I think just more of the whole me, me, me, listen to me, and if you disagree with me,
6390260	6397220	block unfriend and all that type of stuff, I think a lot of that plays into it, in my
6397220	6398220	opinion.
6398220	6399220	I don't know.
6399220	6402620	Loki, what do you think about the whole, why do people feel the need to shout from the
6402620	6404860	rooftops that Pokemon Go is stupid?
6404860	6406860	Because people want attention.
6406860	6407860	Yeah.
6407860	6408860	That's pretty much it.
6408860	6411860	Is it getting them attention, though?
6411860	6415020	Besides an eye roll, are they getting attention from these posts?
6415020	6416020	Well, I think sometimes-
6416020	6417020	I don't know.
6417020	6418020	It depends who's saying it.
6418780	6422380	Especially when these celebrities are like, I don't get this stuff, and then they'll be
6422380	6425540	the ones that denounce it, and then they'll try it, and they'll be the ones that are like,
6425540	6426540	oh, this is so awesome.
6426540	6428780	Why aren't you doing this?
6428780	6433100	And they'll completely, it's like, well, hey, but didn't a couple weeks ago you say that?
6433100	6435420	And it's just like, no, they're not going to acknowledge that.
6435420	6437640	So quick little story about that.
6437640	6443380	There is a former Power Ranger actor on Instagram decided to post something trying to rally
6443380	6446180	support about how stupid this all was.
6446180	6449380	He got no support and took that post down.
6449380	6450380	I thought that was hilarious.
6450380	6454140	It's like, nope, nobody's going to bite for your attention right there.
6454140	6455140	Interesting.
6455140	6456140	Yes.
6456140	6458900	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6458900	6462780	Vid Power says, we need some Team Harmony up in here.
6462780	6467780	Every time somebody says Team Harmony, this is my brain, I immediately think of the Harmony
6467780	6469860	Hut from Addams Family Values.
6469860	6470860	Do you remember this?
6470860	6471860	No.
6471860	6472860	What is that?
6472860	6473860	Oh, come on.
6473860	6474860	Somebody.
6474860	6477580	They had to go to the Harmony Hut.
6477580	6481820	It was kind of like the punishment where they had to watch Disney movies and it would force
6481820	6482820	them to turn happy.
6482820	6484200	I saw that movie so long ago.
6484200	6485200	Somebody out there.
6485200	6486200	I've never seen that movie.
6486200	6487200	Somebody has to fucking know what I'm talking about.
6487200	6488940	Cause it's exactly what I think of when you talk about Team Harmony.
6488940	6489940	Oh, thank you.
6489940	6491780	Akuma JB says, yes.
6491780	6492780	Okay.
6492780	6498160	JD says in chat, a lot of the hate comes from Facebook, the same kind of people who post
6498160	6500820	minions images.
6500820	6501940	It's honest to God.
6501940	6505540	It's really time for Facebook to die.
6505540	6509480	And on a side note, some people have been asking me lately, like, where's the Fugu question
6509480	6510780	of the week?
6510780	6514740	And here I'm torn because did you not do in this week?
6514740	6515740	I forgot.
6515740	6516740	I forgot.
6516740	6519060	And I've been forgetting a lot recently, honestly.
6519060	6520420	And you know, that's my bad.
6520420	6525800	I find that I've been logging into Facebook less and less and once in a while I'll go
6525800	6531020	post something, but I'm almost like, then there's things like, I'll try to reply to
6531020	6532020	someone's post.
6532020	6535820	Like I replied to someone's post the other day with something like very well intentioned.
6535820	6542780	And I got this, like, I kid you not six paragraph reply on how what I said was not taken the
6542780	6544540	way that I meant to say it.
6544540	6547420	And that I was like, you know what, fuck Facebook.
6547420	6548420	Fuck you.
6548420	6549420	Fuck Facebook.
6549420	6550420	Fuck all this.
6550420	6551420	Fuck your high horses.
6551420	6552420	I'm out.
6552420	6553420	It's not Facebook.
6553420	6555660	It's just dumb people and dumb people are everywhere.
6555660	6556660	But no way.
6556660	6558280	Here's the problem I have with Facebook.
6558280	6560100	People are not inherently dumb.
6560100	6562500	I really don't believe I'm not that cynical.
6562500	6568280	That's not me, but Facebook really gives everybody a platform to fucking be dumb.
6568280	6569280	That's what it is.
6569280	6570700	It extracts the dumbness out of people.
6570700	6571740	That's what Facebook does.
6571740	6575460	So there's a part of me, honest to God, even though I love that you guys participated in
6575460	6579460	it, it's probably with one of our, one of our most like interactive segments.
6579460	6583900	There's a part of me that just wants to not contribute to Facebook culture.
6583900	6585820	Is that so wrong?
6585820	6588900	That's my honest to God answer for where did the Facebook question of the week go?
6588900	6591260	I don't want to help Facebook anymore.
6591260	6592260	It sucks.
6592260	6597580	That's why I just took my email, post the question at the end of the show, send in your
6597580	6598580	emails.
6598580	6601340	That's what we do on, on ranger pride.
6601340	6602340	Kind of.
6602340	6608060	We do put it on Facebook sometimes when either of us remembers, but Facebook to me lends
6608060	6614160	itself to giving people a really long winded platform to explain all of their thoughts
6614160	6615820	and stupid rationale.
6615820	6619160	Sometimes like Twitter, you got this much room to try to type it in.
6619160	6621920	So you only have this much room to be stupid.
6621920	6623900	And so it just works out better in my opinion.
6623900	6627800	Now, what I was going to say about Facebook though, is their fucking notifications are
6627800	6629980	still fucking pissing me off.
6629980	6631380	And I do everything in my power.
6631380	6634480	Like I've made sure that I dialed those notifications back.
6634480	6640820	Why am I getting fucking notified when a friend is commenting on his own picture or made it
6640820	6643860	a, you know, posted that picture and made a comment on it.
6643860	6645540	I didn't fucking like that picture.
6645540	6647400	I didn't even see that picture.
6647400	6651380	I should not be getting fucking notifications on that shit.
6651380	6657120	And I thought I turned that off and I know I've turned that off several times or in why
6657120	6661040	like even comment on anybody's posts anymore because as soon as you do get fucking chain
6661040	6665100	of all the different people that have commented on it because Facebook needs to let you know,
6665100	6669400	you need to know, uh, JD and chat says, I missed the live journal days.
6669400	6670400	I do too.
6670400	6671400	And you know what?
6671400	6674500	The one big difference between live journal and Facebook was, was that I could disable
6674500	6677980	the fucking comments anytime I wanted to on, on live journal.
6677980	6678980	And I can't do that on Facebook.
6678980	6682260	And I swear to God, it's the one thing that really, really, really holds Facebook back
6682260	6683260	sometimes.
6683260	6684260	I don't know.
6684260	6685940	I'm just, I'm just kind of over it.
6685940	6691440	So I didn't mean for that to be a tangent and ER, but I guess, I guess the answer to
6691440	6694320	this question hit a fucking nerve somewhere along the line.
6694320	6697940	And I, I, I, I guess that's the, my answer to your question.
6697940	6701860	Why do people feel the need to shout from the rooftops that they're anti something because
6701860	6704160	social media fucking sucks sometimes.
6704160	6706180	That's that's, that's my answer.
6706180	6708180	So why, why should I continue to support it?
6708180	6709180	I don't know.
6709180	6710180	Anyway.
6710180	6711180	Uh, let's see.
6711180	6715120	I'm looking at some other comments, uh, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
6715120	6719360	Fifth dream says, Twitter is worse for that now I turned off show tweets I might like,
6719360	6721600	Oh, I think he's talking about more of the reordering thing.
6721600	6722600	The thing I do kind of like,
6722600	6725520	Yeah, no Twitter with it's all here's stuff he missed.
6725520	6726520	I'm like, I don't care.
6726520	6727520	I can scroll down.
6727520	6728520	Here's people who should follow.
6728520	6729520	Nope.
6729520	6730520	I would have followed them by now.
6730520	6731920	Here's a like top tweets.
6731920	6733700	No, I don't care about that at all.
6733700	6734700	That stuff is annoying.
6734700	6739240	I just really like on Twitter that it forces people to keep it brief and it is very easy
6739240	6742060	for me to filter out stuff I don't want to see.
6742060	6745700	I also don't like it how the Twitter app starts me off where I was last time.
6745700	6749460	So I have to scroll up through three days or two days, however long it's been since
6749460	6752180	I logged in to see the top tweets again.
6752180	6756600	Um, but of course, Twitter, I mean not, I'm not praising Twitter cause Twitter has its
6756600	6761940	own issues and we Lord knows we saw a ton of those this past week, but whatever.
6761940	6768460	Anyway, um, where else am I, uh, looking at more comments now the chat room is lighting
6768460	6770340	up over at live.vognetwork.com.
6770340	6775780	Uh, let's see, Dar Tetsuya says, okay, stuff I missed is nice just so I don't have to spend
6775780	6779020	all day on Twitter, but yeah, tweets you might like is dumb usually.
6779020	6780020	I don't like that either.
6780020	6781020	Um, okay.
6781020	6782020	Anyway, sorry.
6782020	6786660	Sorry for the tangent Andy R, but I hope you, I hope you're satisfied with the answer to
6786660	6789020	the question.
6789020	6794980	One more email tonight at participate at orangesontrader.com from Y Y R who says, hello L R I'm following
6794980	6797780	up my email from last week with an update.
6797780	6801620	Following customer feedback, Dave and busters has decided to change course on their pricing
6801620	6807500	for premium play on DDRA and now cost one credit as opposed to two and by now the setting
6807500	6809580	should have been adjusted at all locations.
6809580	6813140	So as of now, normal and premium play both cost one credit.
6813140	6817820	In other words, there's no reason not to choose premium as you get extra insurance against
6817820	6822580	failing out before your third song, the ability to earn extra stages and more for no extra
6822580	6823580	charge.
6823580	6826700	Note that this feature does require an E amusement card.
6826700	6830780	Well, that would be the extra charge, but that's okay.
6830780	6832940	It's a little bit, it's much less than what it was before.
6832940	6836260	Uh, if you don't use a card, the option will not be available.
6836260	6840940	Rob to answer your question, yes, all United States round one locations should also have
6840940	6843860	the new North American version of DDRA as well.
6843860	6848740	I will end my email by saying this, Rob, your game request from last week's episode has
6848740	6849740	been heard.
6849740	6850740	Oh joy.
6850740	6851740	I don't even remember.
6851740	6852740	What are you talking?
6852740	6854540	I don't remember which game it was last week.
6854540	6855540	I have a short term memory.
6855540	6856740	Was it the grandma on the gun thing?
6856740	6857740	I don't know.
6857740	6860540	Look, YYR will deliver it and I will be happy.
6860540	6861540	I know that.
6861540	6865680	But um, I just, you know, one game at a time, YYR, you gotta, you gotta make sure multitasking
6865680	6866860	gets out first.
6866860	6869860	You know, I heard he submitted snake party today though.
6869860	6870860	That's exciting.
6870860	6876620	I'm going to hit up round one on my trip back up to here in August and I will go look at
6876620	6881660	their DDR ace or whatever it's called machine and I'm not going to play it, but I just want
6881660	6883500	to see if my songs are still on it.
6883500	6886740	Like, do I still have songs I made on there?
6886740	6888140	Can't you just go up to Roseville?
6888140	6890140	I mean, yeah, it's a Dave and Busters.
6890140	6894220	I have to go to Dave and Busters.
6894220	6896980	What's some of the step art that you did in DDR games recently?
6897300	6902860	I thought, yeah, because it still had Hottest Party stuff and I think that's kind of what's
6902860	6905460	keeping my stuff alive is the Hottest Party stuff.
6905460	6910140	What are some of the songs you did the step art for that people might not know?
6910140	6917340	Beautiful Inside from Hottest Party and what else did I do?
6917340	6921420	There were two songs in the next Hottest Party that I did.
6921420	6925540	I don't remember the names, but I don't even know if they ever made it to the arcade, but
6925940	6929220	I still have MP3s of them somewhere.
6929220	6931020	Would your name still be in the credits of the game?
6931020	6932420	I'm sure it's not anymore.
6932420	6935220	I was going to say, if they used your step art from all those years ago, is your name?
6935220	6936220	Sue.
6936220	6941140	That's kind of awesome though.
6941140	6944740	You hypothetically might be able to play one of Shane's step charts.
6944740	6950780	When we went to Sunnydale Golf Land two years ago, because it was the same day as PT coming
6950780	6954900	out for everybody, they had a DDR machine there, whatever DDR that was, which was the
6954900	6959580	most recent at the time, it still had stuff I did on it because I made Jim and Annie play
6959580	6960580	it.
6960580	6964940	I was like, I just want to feed my ego, play these songs.
6964940	6966100	That's awesome.
6966100	6972500	Orange Right in chat says, can confirm Beautiful Inside Cube Hard Mix is in DDR-A still.
6972500	6973500	There you go.
6973500	6976500	So I'm still in it.
6976500	6981620	And his ego, literally his head just swelled by a few inches here in the room while we
6981620	6982620	read that.
6982620	6983620	That was a fun song to make.
6983620	6984620	Memories.
6984620	6986740	Oh, is memories hidden in the game?
6986740	6990300	That would be terrible because that's a garbage sound of a song.
6990300	6991300	All right.
6991300	6992300	That's it for emails.
6992300	6993300	You guys should email us as well.
6993300	6998420	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.
6998420	7000700	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
7000700	7004380	Just because Dark Sakura isn't here doesn't mean we don't get angsty once in a while.
7004380	7007420	So let's get to it.
7007420	7022660	Loki, why don't you start us off?
7022660	7031300	I guess just FU2 and FU2 Pokemon Go for being so fucking glitchy.
7031300	7032300	I don't know.
7033220	7034620	That's mainly it.
7034620	7036620	It's just...
7036620	7037620	Come on.
7037620	7042580	I understand that the game is, you know, it's early and stuff, but dude, this shit should
7042580	7044260	not be this fucking buggy.
7044260	7049260	I mean, come on, Niantic, seriously, fix this shit.
7049260	7056420	Um, let's see, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I have a car payment again because
7056420	7062140	I bought a new car yesterday and actually I'm really excited.
7062180	7063180	It's a nice car.
7063180	7064180	Yeah, I like it a lot.
7064180	7065180	It's pretty too.
7065180	7069100	So, um, yeah, I, um, I like my new car a lot.
7069100	7074460	I guess I can say on it, is it bad if I say I have a 2016 Prius and, um, I, yeah, I wanted
7074460	7077740	to go hybrid and I love, yeah, I like driving it.
7077740	7078740	It's fun.
7078740	7082940	Um, so looking forward to driving it more, but I'm not looking forward to the car payment.
7082940	7087180	So FU2, um, not just being able to pay it all off in one big payment, but that would
7087180	7089180	be something if I could do that.
7089180	7091020	Last but not least, Shane, do you have any FUs of the week?
7091020	7096420	FU2 moving, I'm so exhausted, like so exhausted.
7096420	7097420	Moving does suck.
7097420	7105500	And FU2 having to go to work tomorrow because today was not a day off because of the moving.
7105500	7106500	All right.
7106500	7111860	Uh, you know, I was thinking, um, since, uh, that song that you did is still in DDR, beautiful
7111860	7118400	inside, you know, to, to, to feed your ego even more, should we request that people take
7118400	7123800	a picture of them playing DDR, playing your song in DDR and tweet it to you?
7123800	7128120	Can someone in the chat room, cause I don't have access to the chat cause I don't know
7128120	7129120	how to do it.
7129120	7132760	Um, can someone linked an entire song list for ACE so I can look at it.
7132760	7134280	I just want to see what else is on there.
7134280	7135280	Just go to Wikipedia.
7135280	7138160	No, cause when I went there last time, it just showed their new stuff and the things
7138160	7139160	they removed.
7139160	7140560	But if you're not in chat, how are you going to see the list?
7140560	7142720	Cause you can tell me and then you can text it to me.
7142720	7144720	I'm not going to read 700 song names here on air.
7144720	7145720	No, no, no, no, no, no.
7145720	7147200	But just, you can, you can read me a link.
7147600	7148920	You just got a Bomani style.
7148920	7150720	I'm sure they've got a Bomani style.
7150720	7151920	I just said Wikipedia.
7151920	7152920	Okay.
7152920	7153920	Orange, right?
7153920	7154920	Remy Wiki.
7154920	7155920	Remember that?
7155920	7156920	No, I don't.
7156920	7157920	I'll find it though.
7157920	7160920	Go to Remy Wiki.com and there's a dance, dance revolution, a full song list article.
7160920	7162640	Is that good enough?
7162640	7163960	All right.
7163960	7164960	We'll see.
7164960	7165960	Probably.
7165960	7166960	Yes.
7166960	7167960	Thank you.
7167960	7168960	Orange, right?
7168960	7169960	I'm trying.
7169960	7170960	I'm trying to help him out.
7170960	7171960	All right.
7171960	7172960	Thank you for the suggestion.
7172960	7173960	I forgot about Remy Wiki.
7173960	7174960	How do I search this?
7174960	7175960	Look at the upper, right?
7175960	7176960	Where Wikis usually have a search bar.
7177720	7178720	Okay.
7178720	7179720	Lord.
7179720	7180720	All right.
7180720	7181720	Let's move on.
7181720	7183000	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
7183000	7186360	And then we're going to get to your phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
7186360	7188880	on Skype.
7188880	7191280	Actually though, Shane, pay attention because this may be of interest to you.
7191280	7192960	Loki, what do you have?
7192960	7200040	So there's been like social economy, social media rep on Reddit who's been just responding
7200040	7204080	to some questions and comments and that type of thing.
7204080	7206440	I guess his name is Ben.
7206920	7210480	And he's of course, you know, criticism I should add to that as well.
7210480	7221640	Basically saying that, you know, they want, Konami wants to earn you back.
7221640	7225160	Are they giving us like two for one plays on their pachinko machines or something?
7225160	7228920	No, they're basically saying that, you know, they're not, you know, totally doing away
7228920	7230980	with console games.
7230980	7235120	Saying that they may have, or, well, I wouldn't say it's constantly, yeah, Metal Gear Solid
7235160	7240400	is going to possibly have an announcement to come next year in celebration of the 30th
7240400	7241400	anniversary.
7241400	7242400	Yeah.
7242400	7251040	And then basically, you know, saying if they find, you know, they're reviewing their IP
7251040	7260600	and they're trying to see if they have a good fit for Silent Hill because I just can't take
7260600	7261600	this seriously.
7261600	7262600	I'm sorry.
7262600	7263600	I just like, sorry.
7263600	7264600	Yeah.
7265080	7266080	Well, I hope to have you back.
7266080	7267480	Well, you know what?
7267480	7270680	I hope to have a million dollars and that ain't going to fucking happen.
7270680	7273480	Your hope is worth fucking nothing.
7273480	7275300	You know who says that a lot, actually?
7275300	7277160	I hope to have stuff.
7277160	7282680	My son, he's all, man, he's all, I really wish I could have that ice cream right there,
7282680	7289720	or I really wish I could have, you know, a new video game, or I really wish I could have,
7289720	7292640	you know, that pizza that you're eating.
7292680	7296120	This is just like the Konami version of this.
7296120	7298560	I really wish we could earn our fan base back.
7298560	7302560	Well, I really wish you weren't fucking stupid in fucking alienating your entire fan base,
7302560	7306360	canceled one of the most anticipated games that your company was producing and decided
7306360	7309720	to go to the pachinkos and said, fuck you to everybody else.
7309720	7313040	That's kind of how I wish you, oh, and then how you treated your developers, you know,
7313040	7314040	like shit.
7314040	7318440	Look, I don't blame this social media guy though, because I feel like he kind of knows
7318440	7322580	what has to be done that like somebody has to apologize for what the fuck is happening.
7322580	7326460	So I kind of give this guy massive kudos for literally putting himself in the line
7326460	7327460	of fire.
7327460	7328940	But it's also giving us false hope.
7328940	7329940	Yeah.
7329940	7333180	And I think, I think honestly, you know, it speaks more than anything else is results.
7333180	7336260	And I'm kind of with JD in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7336260	7342180	JD says, Konami, if you want me back, release home versions of 2DX and Poppin and DDR.
7342180	7344260	Well, I mean, I don't know.
7344260	7348380	I think some of those games aren't necessarily going to sell well, but I, I would really
7348380	7350500	love BeatMania 2DX to make a comeback.
7350500	7354260	There's a user, it's on Reddit, he goes by Konami US social.
7354260	7358380	So that people are in the assumption that's the social media rep for Konami.
7358380	7361660	Although it could be a complete troll account, so who knows, but it doesn't seem like he's
7361660	7363660	trolling too much.
7363660	7365360	I don't know.
7365360	7368660	I just going to say it's going to take a lot to fucking get us back.
7368660	7374340	And even if you announce a fucking new game for consoles for Metal Gear Solid, at most
7374340	7378220	it's probably going to be a remake and good luck.
7378220	7382660	I mean, I'd be curious though, what kind of talent they might try to bring into these
7382660	7385820	games to try to woo people over to them.
7385820	7388980	I mean, they could recruit some really big name out there.
7388980	7392140	We just don't know about it because we don't, haven't heard of it, but Metal Gear could
7392140	7397540	land a really big name or, um, you know, Silent Hill might get a scary movie director or something
7397540	7399860	that's going to surprise us behind it.
7399860	7403420	Like, I don't know, the people that made Saw, although I hate Saw, I really hope that doesn't
7403420	7404420	happen.
7404420	7405420	Why did I say that?
7405420	7406420	That's a horrible thing to suggest.
7406580	7409580	Maybe he gets like, like John Carpenter from Halloween or something.
7409580	7411540	No, that is not the spirit of Silent Hill.
7411540	7418100	That's the spirit of the garbage Western Silent Hills, which are garbage and they're garbage.
7418100	7419100	Are they garbage?
7419100	7420100	Yes.
7420100	7421100	I don't.
7421100	7422100	What about a Japanese horror movie director?
7422100	7423740	No, you have to have.
7423740	7424740	Okay.
7424740	7425740	So I was on board for PT.
7425740	7427300	How about David Lynch with Twin Peaks?
7427300	7428300	No.
7428300	7429300	Well, that could work.
7429300	7430300	Aha.
7430300	7431660	That could, that could possibly be okay.
7431660	7432660	All right.
7432660	7434460	Now we're onto something.
7434460	7438220	But no, you can't, you can't do Silent Hill anymore, Konami.
7438220	7441260	You just need to give it up to somebody that cares, because you guys don't.
7441260	7443300	Several people in chat are yelling Guillermo del Toro.
7443300	7445340	Well, they've already, they've already burned the bridge.
7445340	7447540	Oh yeah, they super burned that bridge.
7447540	7448540	Yeah, I don't.
7448540	7453260	Well, and it's kind of sad because he's not in Kojima's latest game.
7453260	7455540	No, he's not.
7457540	7462020	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Alliance Radio at vognetwork.com,
7462020	7463780	use the pass phrase, ground.
7463780	7464780	All right.
7464780	7465780	All right.
7465780	7470660	So let's move on with one more story here about Uno going to be making a comeback.
7470660	7474100	You remember Uno on the Xbox 360?
7474100	7477820	Those of you that weren't really gaming a lot 10 years ago may forget that Uno on the
7477820	7480540	360 was actually kind of a big deal.
7480540	7484740	Like it was one of those Xbox live arcade games that did very, very, very well in the
7484740	7486300	early days of the Xbox 360.
7486300	7488580	And Uno is going to be making a comeback.
7488580	7492900	It was announced that Uno is going to be getting a game adaptation for the PC, PlayStation
7492900	7497500	4 and Xbox One, and it even has a release date, August 9th, 2016.
7497500	7499420	But does it have camera support?
7499420	7502540	Yes, it has camera support.
7502540	7509340	Most importantly, we will have camera support, which, you know, just means it's only a matter
7509340	7513960	of time before someone exposes themselves while playing Uno, which I never really understood
7513960	7515140	camera support in Uno.
7515140	7519580	I think it was really a novelty on the Xbox 360, because remember, that was before Kinect.
7519580	7522780	Xbox 360 had those little cameras things, right?
7522780	7523780	So anyway.
7523780	7529700	No, dude, I don't know why I said dude, but breaking news, I have tons of songs in this
7529700	7532620	DDR game still.
7532620	7536420	Let me finish the story and then you can tell us while we wait for some calls what songs.
7536420	7540420	We don't know exactly what Uno will have in it, like if it's going to have Uno Rush and
7540420	7544220	all that stuff too, but it's Ubisoft that is doing it.
7544220	7546960	And yes, voice and video chat will be a part of it.
7546960	7552020	So I'm sure some Twitch streams are going to be a hoot and a holler by the time this
7552020	7553020	release is there.
7553020	7554020	So yeah.
7554020	7555020	Let's see.
7555020	7557500	I'm looking at some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
7557500	7561640	Vidpower in chat says, Uno was such an important Xbox Live arcade game.
7561640	7564500	It really was, despite all the fact that we kind of make jokes about it.
7564500	7569660	Like it was a really, I mean, people bought that camera for Uno of all things.
7569660	7571460	It was a crazy thing.
7571460	7573160	Let's see.
7573160	7578440	Other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com fifth dream says Uno VR please.
7578440	7579440	That might be a bit much.
7579440	7580440	Let's let's be real.
7580440	7581440	It's a bit much.
7581440	7582440	Okay.
7582440	7584160	Um, that is it for the stories we have.
7584160	7588840	We're going to open up our Skype line over at a one eight seven seven game OLR or username
7588840	7591360	on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word.
7591360	7592360	The Skype line is open.
7592360	7595080	If you want to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight or maybe something
7595080	7596080	that we missed.
7596080	7597080	Shane.
7597080	7602300	So your, your games or your steps charts that remain in DDR or what?
7602340	7603820	So I future list is still there.
7603820	7604820	That's awesome.
7604820	7605820	Oh, that's awesome.
7605820	7606820	I love that.
7606820	7607820	I didn't know you did the art for that.
7607820	7608820	Or step step or whatever.
7608820	7609820	Yeah, I did that.
7609820	7615140	Um, I'm starting at the bottom now and going up, uh, uh, Bilela Samba still there.
7615140	7616140	Wow.
7616140	7619020	Uh, yeah, I know that's, that should have been gone by now.
7619020	7625900	Um, soul crash is there, uh, freeway shuffle is there.
7625900	7629620	The flyaway remix is there, fires there every day.
7629620	7630620	Every night is there.
7630620	7631620	All right, that's enough.
7631620	7634380	Good for you that you still have a lot of songs in the game.
7634380	7636660	So should people tweet you pictures of themselves playing it?
7636660	7637660	Sure.
7637660	7639780	And they can say how garbage some of them are because some of them are really garbage.
7639780	7640780	All right.
7640780	7641780	We got a phone call coming in.
7641780	7642780	Let's get to it.
7642780	7643780	Hi.
7643780	7644780	You're on orange lounge radio.
7644780	7645780	Who's this?
7645780	7646780	Uh, this is a YYR.
7646780	7647780	Hey, YYR.
7647780	7648780	How you doing, buddy?
7648780	7649780	Uh, not too bad.
7649780	7650780	Actually pretty good.
7650780	7656220	Considering, uh, finally after probably a good six, seven years, snake party is in peer
7656220	7657220	review.
7657220	7658220	Congratulations on that.
7658220	7662260	How long does the game usually take from a peer review to actually release on the console?
7662260	7667180	Well, uh, now is probably not the best time to really judge.
7667180	7672380	Um, simply because we're at the very tail end of Xbox live indie games, like six weeks
7672380	7674180	from now, it's all over.
7674180	7681820	Um, so there aren't that many reviewers now, so I'm hoping less than six weeks, but generally
7681820	7687540	when it was more populated anywhere from, uh, one to three weeks, depending on volume
7687580	7693500	and also if you had any problems that people could fail you on, that would obviously make
7693500	7694500	it take longer.
7694500	7697500	Cause then you had to wait a week, uh, they call it jail.
7697500	7698660	You're in jail for a week.
7698660	7701740	You can't resubmit for at least another week.
7701740	7706340	And then, you know, you fix your problems, you resubmit and then you start over.
7706340	7713620	Um, so, uh, you said in six weeks everything is gone, but that's just the new submissions
7713620	7714620	part, right?
7714620	7715620	Not like the store and all this stuff.
7715700	7718340	The new submissions, peer review, all of that goes away.
7718340	7722820	Um, the games that are on there, the, you know, 3000 plus games that are on there will
7722820	7725060	remain on sale for another one year.
7725060	7726060	Okay.
7726060	7730060	So at least it's not like when you released, um, pixel poops on the PlayStation Vita where
7730060	7732900	it was like up for four weeks and that was it.
7732900	7733900	Yeah.
7733900	7738860	But, uh, I, I really send my thanks to the 60 or so people who, uh, who bought it.
7738860	7740620	Hey, it's not a bad number.
7740620	7742620	Listen to this show.
7742620	7743620	That's not bad.
7743620	7744620	I was one of those people.
7744620	7746500	You have 60 people that listen to the show.
7746500	7747500	What the hell?
7747500	7748500	That's great.
7748500	7749500	That's awesome.
7749500	7753460	Hey, by the way, did you know we have a celebrity here in studio?
7753460	7756060	We have the, uh, world renowned step chart artist.
7756060	7757540	Shane is here.
7757540	7764660	I was really psyched when he showed up because it's just, Oh my God, I have played some of
7764660	7766660	those songs.
7766660	7770100	So apparently some of my favorite ones are not on here.
7770100	7771780	I'm looking at you in chat.
7771780	7774820	Some of the chat is responding to some of these songs that, and again, if you're just
7774820	7779700	joining us, uh, if you've played dance, dance revolution, ACE or a, which is the new one
7779700	7784020	that's a Dave and busters and round one, Ooh, saberwing stayed on apparently songs that
7784020	7785900	Shane worked on when he was at Konami.
7785900	7786900	What?
7786900	7787900	That was 10 years ago at this point.
7787900	7790380	Yeah, I actually are still in the game.
7790380	7792980	So, uh, some, some folks in chat, orange, right?
7792980	7795540	Here's, here's ready for this ego inflation.
7795540	7797140	Fire was a good chart.
7797140	7798140	You're welcome.
7798140	7799140	And orange.
7799140	7800140	Right.
7800140	7802220	Notice it's like anytime I remotely reference anything, Bamani orange, right.
7802220	7803500	Is right there to save my ass.
7803500	7808100	If I stay at state something incorrect, uh, let's see, uh, dark Tetsuya says, Oh, Shane
7808100	7809100	did freeway shuffle.
7809100	7810100	Yep.
7810100	7811100	I did.
7811100	7812100	Oh, those are good steps.
7812100	7813100	I played the double chart.
7813100	7814100	Did you write the double chart?
7814100	7815100	Yeah.
7815100	7816100	I did all of those.
7816100	7820700	Uh, JD says, Shane should make a list and put it on the OLR Wiki or something.
7820700	7825780	Uh, and dark Tetsuya is offering to help you if you can like send him a list from this
7825780	7826780	game, at least I could.
7826780	7827780	Yeah.
7828420	7829420	I don't know if I can remember.
7829420	7831340	Like that's a decade ago.
7831340	7836060	Well, and our pal, what we have other friends of all our pal Mel B would have done a lot
7836060	7837260	of step charts too.
7837260	7838260	Right.
7838260	7839260	I thought so.
7839260	7840260	Huh?
7840260	7841820	Interesting.
7841820	7845060	Some other folks that were affiliated with the show, I can get the credits to roll.
7845060	7849020	And if, uh, if your name's not still in there, I'll, uh, I'll send the lawyers after.
7849020	7850020	Thank you.
7850020	7854340	I want rights to sweet code and in silent Hills and I won't, that that'll be enough
7854340	7855340	for me.
7855340	7856340	Here's the thing though.
7856340	7857340	Did they put you as Shane?
7857900	7858900	Yeah.
7858900	7859900	Oh, okay.
7859900	7860900	Yeah.
7860900	7861900	Shane uses, Shane uses his middle name.
7861900	7862900	Like I do.
7862900	7863900	So I was just curious.
7863900	7864900	Anyway.
7864900	7865900	Uh, let's see.
7865900	7866900	So I'm sorry.
7866900	7870460	Sorry to derail, but you know, when you have a celebrity in studio, they, their ego takes
7870460	7871460	priority.
7871460	7872460	It does.
7872460	7874940	Uh, what else did you want to share with us tonight?
7874940	7875940	Why?
7875940	7876940	Why?
7876940	7881500	Well, actually the reason I called, I don't usually do this, but, um, because this concept
7881500	7886140	is so early and I'm honestly not sure if it would be worth buying, I'm going to remind
7886140	7889500	you of what you said last week and I'm going to share what I have here.
7889500	7890500	Oh God.
7890500	7891500	I'm so excited.
7891500	7892500	Okay.
7892500	7899020	So this started when Loki was complaining about his wife watching Grey's Anatomy's 8,000
7899020	7902380	episodes back to back for the second time, by the way, because we've already gone through
7902380	7906340	all the episodes and that she's like, there's nothing else on, we're just going to watch
7906340	7907340	it again.
7907340	7910580	I'm like, why doesn't she watch the other Shonda shows?
7910580	7911580	Like scandal?
7911580	7915460	Like even I like scandal, she was in the scandal and she tried to watch it again, but like,
7915460	7916460	I don't know.
7916460	7917460	She just stopped again.
7917460	7921100	So she didn't remember what happened when she left off and God, I don't want to watch
7921100	7922100	all that again.
7922100	7923100	All right.
7923100	7927060	So yes, Loki was ranting about the wife monopolizing the television with the Shonda verse, which
7927060	7933180	left him with his PC with his, you know, 500 steam games on it and therefore he has nothing
7933180	7934180	to play.
7934180	7935180	Exactly.
7935180	7936180	Oh yes.
7936180	7937180	Okay.
7937180	7938180	Yes.
7938180	7939180	I remember.
7939180	7940180	Go ahead.
7940180	7941180	Go ahead.
7941180	7942180	I remember now though.
7942180	7943180	So you suggested there should be a game called I have nothing to play.
7943180	7944180	Yes.
7944180	7945180	Okay.
7945900	7946900	All right.
7946900	7947900	I'm with you.
7947900	7948900	I do remember this.
7948900	7952340	So, so basically what you have is you have this game where you're essentially sitting
7952340	7958020	in a web browser and there are three storefronts available that you can visit at any time.
7958020	7960700	The gray station store.
7960700	7968900	I think a smog and a also mumble bundle.com and I love it.
7968900	7969900	I approve.
7969900	7974620	And of course there's always something on sale, like ridiculous sales.
7974620	7979980	They'll, um, they'll be, uh, running, give me an, uh, uh, early August sale sale for
7979980	7980980	no reason.
7980980	7987620	Genre sale, sale, sale, like, um, and basically this game is, uh, a Christmas sale in July.
7987620	7988940	Can you put that in there for me?
7988940	7994100	A Christmas sale in July, because I swear to God, I was at the mall the earlier this
7994100	7997900	week and I had to text Shane, there was five nights at Freddy's dolls and I was looking
7997900	8001160	at the mall like, Oh, and I texted Shane pictures of the dolls.
8001160	8005980	And as I'm sitting there looking at these five nights at Freddy's dolls, the first Noel,
8005980	8011820	the Christmas Carol starts playing on the radio and I was like, it is fucking July.
8011820	8013140	Why is it Christmas Carol?
8013140	8017220	Um, Best Buy just did like a black Friday in July sale.
8017220	8019500	Yeah, I guess it's your Amazon did their thing too.
8019500	8020500	So okay.
8020500	8021500	So anyway, yes.
8021500	8022500	Uh, that, that's my other request.
8022500	8025140	A Christmas in July sale.
8025140	8027420	So basically, and I don't know if this is fun.
8027460	8031140	I don't know if anyone would actually buy this, but the point of this game is to buy
8031140	8038040	games and add them to your library, your smoke library and your, your, um, your gray station
8038040	8041200	for library and to not actually play anything.
8041200	8045340	And it'll track like how much money you've saved, how much money you actually spent.
8045340	8049680	Um, the ratio of spent to save the number of games purchased and there'll be leaderboards
8049680	8050940	for all that crap.
8050940	8055620	I don't know if I know the online multiplayer stuff is really hard and it might complicate
8055620	8059540	things too much, but I almost feel like why, why are, what you're describing to me would
8059540	8063660	be a brilliant card game card game.
8063660	8064660	Huh?
8064660	8065660	Yeah.
8065660	8066660	Right.
8066660	8070740	Because then that way it's kind of like, that's how the sales are controlled and you buy the
8070740	8073380	games in your hand that are like cards.
8073380	8075380	But maybe if somebody could get a better deal, I don't know.
8075380	8078820	I haven't really thought this out, but as you're describing it to me and maybe it's
8078820	8083300	the fact that we just talked about Uno and what a big game that was, I'm like, this almost
8083300	8086780	sounds like a card game because it's like you're trying to kind of like, like, like
8086780	8090580	monopoly or something like you're buying and selling and exchanging properties and stuff.
8090580	8091580	So it's like you're trying to hoard.
8091580	8096220	You have to have the biggest hoard of games that you bought at the cheapest possible.
8096220	8100780	That fixes the biggest problem with this concept, which is it's funny, but there really isn't
8100780	8102140	much of a game there.
8102140	8106420	I mean, basically I put a whole bunch of, of work into this.
8106420	8110060	Um, there are several different possible types of developers.
8110060	8114300	You've got your triple A developer, your middle tier, your indie, you're just straight
8114300	8120100	up awful developer with poorly translated descriptions and cobbled together graphics.
8120100	8125060	Um, and then, you know, it would randomly choose one of those and then randomly generate
8125060	8129920	a game, um, based on a genre, which is also randomly chosen.
8129920	8136380	You have your simulator games like grandma simulator, pushup simulator, 2017, uh, you
8136380	8141380	have slice of life narrative games like my sister's anxiety or before showering.
8141380	8147380	I mean, this is just, uh, you know, randomly generated games with randomly generated descriptions
8147380	8150620	and you know, cobbled together screens and things like that.
8150620	8151940	I love this so much.
8151940	8152940	I love this so much.
8152940	8156620	You, you, you, you make dreams a reality while I are, you're the person that makes dreams
8156620	8157620	come true.
8157620	8160500	And I gotta say, I have to read some of these comments in chat because they're so amazing.
8160500	8163980	Uh, dark Tetsuya says, okay, this sounds hilariously meta.
8163980	8165420	Uh, let's see.
8165420	8168540	Fifth dream says, the best part is when you click anything in the game, it just opens
8168540	8171780	your steam client and starts a random game and tells you to fuck off.
8171780	8173020	I don't know if it should do that.
8173020	8174020	I don't know if it should do that.
8174020	8177740	Uh, Rama says, rage nator would be the first person to buy this game.
8177740	8178740	Okay.
8178740	8179780	Real talk, real talk.
8179780	8184060	You have to have the little mascot that teaches you how to play the game that pops up in the
8184060	8188300	corner that says, and his name is going to be sale inator.
8188300	8189300	Okay.
8189300	8193460	After our favorite caller here at OLR and he's going to pop and he always has to start
8193460	8200780	off by saying, hi, this is sale inator here and I have a tip or like, did you know that
8200780	8203740	this is on sale or there's a hot sale or something like this.
8203740	8207580	And so like sale inator would actually advise you to where all the good sales are at.
8207580	8210580	So I want you to, I want you to think about that.
8210580	8211580	Okay.
8211580	8212580	Is he even listening tonight?
8212580	8215900	I haven't seen him in chat.
8215900	8221140	If this actually becomes a thing that comes out on steam, it would, it would be at a list
8221140	8226180	price of like $30 and would always be 90% off.
8226180	8227180	I love it.
8227180	8228180	Yes.
8228180	8229180	Always.
8229180	8230180	Just perpetually a 90% off game.
8230180	8231180	Uh, let's see.
8231180	8234380	JD says, uh, Oh, Hey, yeah, that would work.
8234380	8235940	A drafting style game.
8235940	8236940	Like dominion.
8236940	8237940	Yes.
8237940	8238940	Card.
8238940	8239940	Card building games are huge white right now.
8239940	8240940	Oh my God.
8240940	8245660	You're building, you're building your library of steam games that you're getting on sale.
8245660	8248420	This is, this is genius right there.
8248420	8250420	That's patent pending idea.
8250420	8251420	Patent pending.
8251420	8252820	I get, I get half the proceeds.
8252820	8253820	No, I'm kidding.
8253820	8254820	I don't.
8254820	8255820	You, you, you do all the work.
8255820	8256820	Why?
8256820	8257820	Why?
8257820	8258820	I know.
8258820	8259820	I know you will be kind and put in some OLR jokes and plugs for indie podcasting and I'll
8259820	8260820	be happy.
8260820	8261820	Oh my God.
8261820	8262820	This is, wow.
8262820	8263820	All right.
8263820	8266220	Well I'm still, honestly, I still have to work on multitasking.
8266220	8267220	You do.
8267220	8268220	Yeah.
8268220	8269220	Um, put it on the list.
8269220	8270220	This is actually something to think about.
8270220	8271220	And you know what?
8271220	8277020	Amy, Amy was, Amy always tells me how she feels and she's like, this sounds stupid, you know,
8277020	8278020	as a game.
8278020	8279020	Period.
8279020	8283060	I mean, maybe it's funny, but this sounds stupid because all you'd be doing is buying
8283060	8285740	games and adding them to your library.
8285740	8289340	So to actually put a card game in there that actually, wow.
8289340	8290340	Okay.
8290340	8291340	All right.
8291340	8292340	Something to think about now.
8292340	8295740	I, I, I, it's why we are, I'm like your consultant.
8295740	8301420	By the way, if you posted ideas in chat, um, message me your names so I can get you in
8301420	8302420	there.
8302420	8303420	Um, let's see.
8303980	8306580	Raginator in chat says, I'm here and listening.
8306580	8307580	Oops.
8307580	8308580	All right.
8308580	8313860	Um, Hey, Raginator, the whole thing is a compliment and you know it, you know, we're, we are about
8313860	8320180	to immortalize you in a video game, uh, on steam nonetheless, uh, SSG100 Matt says, wow,
8320180	8324580	this is something, hopefully nobody steals the idea and makes it before YYR does.
8324580	8325840	Patent pending.
8325840	8327560	You listening, Bobby Black Wolf?
8327560	8335320	I know people, I know celebrities here in studio that have lawyers.
8335320	8336320	Don't you dare.
8336320	8337400	All right.
8337400	8341200	I have homework clearly, and I've already taken almost 12 minutes of your time.
8341200	8344640	No, it was worth every goddamn minute and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
8344640	8345640	All right.
8345640	8348300	All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go for now though so we can get some other calls.
8348300	8349300	Good luck.
8349300	8350300	Good luck with multitasking.
8350300	8351300	Good luck.
8351300	8352300	Start, get your notepad.
8352300	8354680	And every time you think of a good idea for this, uh, and if you want to talk further,
8354680	8355680	we totally can.
8355680	8356680	I love this brainstorming.
8356800	8358240	Thanks for the feedback and suggestions.
8358240	8359240	Thank you everybody.
8359240	8360240	You're welcome.
8360240	8361240	Anytime my friend.
8361240	8362620	Hey, have a great week guys.
8362620	8363620	You too.
8363620	8364620	Bye buddy.
8364620	8365620	Yep.
8365620	8366620	Bye bye.
8366620	8369600	I think, you know what, the beautiful thing about that phone call is I really feel like
8369600	8370600	he's going to do it.
8370600	8375840	Like I just, it may not be this year, it may not be next year, but I feel like that is
8375840	8379960	going to be a game at some point that I will play at magfest and I'm going to be like,
8379960	8382280	Salinator was my idea.
8382880	8388560	All right, uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on skype if you want to, uh, give us
8388560	8394800	a call, uh, and Akuma JP says, we must always have a game or excuse me, we must have a game
8394800	8397880	that is always coming soon by Loki.
8397880	8403760	Hey, yeah, there has to be like a, you can't call it green light, but maybe there's like
8403760	8408920	smog has like a yield division or something and uh, you know, yield to the new games that
8408920	8412280	are coming and Loki just has one there that never seems to get made.
8412280	8413280	I don't know.
8413280	8414280	We'll see.
8414280	8416480	And it'll be called half life three.
8416480	8420320	All right.
8420320	8422460	No games of the number three, you're not allowed.
8422460	8423460	That could be okay.
8423460	8426560	There's a little rule twist for your card thing.
8426560	8430760	Games with the number three in them are not allowed on the smog store.
8430760	8431760	Things like that.
8431760	8432760	All right.
8432760	8436200	Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on skype.
8436200	8438880	Really just the problem is we've been asking the wrong questions.
8438880	8442600	They're going to pull a Microsoft and it's just going to jump the half flight for everyone.
8442600	8443600	Yay.
8443600	8447800	Gabe's like, Hey, listen, you guys have been just asking about half life three all the
8447800	8450960	time when that's coming out and I'm just saying, I don't know when it's coming.
8450960	8457160	If only you'd asked about half life four, I could have said, yeah.
8457160	8458160	All right.
8458160	8461160	Uh, now the chats are a lighting up there.
8461160	8464800	Bobby Black Wolf suggests half life for the search for half life three.
8464800	8468480	Uh, dark to see you says, isn't that what the developer of leisure suit Larry did?
8468480	8469480	Wow.
8469480	8470480	Way to throw it back.
8470480	8471480	But I think you're actually right.
8471480	8472480	I think that did happen.
8472480	8473480	Anyway.
8473480	8474480	Um, one more shout out for calls.
8474480	8477120	Orange launch radio, all one word on skype.
8477120	8478900	Are you, are you still looking at the Wiki, Shane?
8478900	8479900	Like stroking your ego?
8479900	8481440	No, I'm reading big brother stuff.
8481440	8482440	Oh no.
8482440	8484200	I saw the songs I've done.
8484200	8485960	Uh, they stop at a certain point.
8485960	8487360	So I stopped watching big brother.
8487360	8488360	I've been bad.
8488360	8491160	I watched the first week or so and then I just kind of fell out.
8491160	8493400	It's hard because the show is on Sunday night, right?
8493400	8497640	It's on like Sundays and Wednesdays and Thursdays, all the nights I have podcasts.
8497640	8498640	Yeah.
8498640	8500520	So I just read about it.
8500520	8502360	I don't think I've seen an episode in forever.
8502360	8503360	That's okay.
8503360	8508040	You just finished editing the show and then you go and watch stranger things and then
8508040	8509040	you're done.
8509040	8510600	I have another FU of the week.
8510600	8511840	Oh, well go ahead.
8511840	8519680	Since we, um, FU to the fact that not all of the Danganronpa anime is out because I
8519680	8525000	need to know what happens and I literally did a free trial to Funimation just so I could
8525000	8526360	watch it.
8526360	8530840	So what the hell is a bullet hell game anime like?
8530840	8532200	Is it just like, what was it?
8532200	8533920	The game's not a bullet hell game.
8533920	8537320	I mean it's a, it's like a Phoenix Wright style.
8537320	8538320	That's right.
8538320	8539320	I'm sorry.
8539320	8540320	But they use bullets.
8540320	8545640	They use like truth bullets and stuff during the trials, but it's just two episodes in.
8545640	8547200	They have two different versions going on.
8547200	8550720	They have one that takes place after three and one that takes place before one with the
8550720	8552800	cast of two.
8552800	8557120	And I'm just like so engrossed already is so good.
8557120	8561840	And it makes me annoyed that I don't have all my episodes yet, but we get them same
8561840	8563040	day as Japan does.
8563040	8565520	So it's not like I'm even behind.
8565520	8567480	I just have to wait.
8567480	8569040	It's frustrating.
8569040	8570480	All right.
8570480	8573360	Well unfortunately there's no more calls coming in, so I'm going to go ahead and close up
8573360	8575360	the Skype line for tonight.
8575360	8578800	But Hey, if you want to, it's probably because a lot of our regular callers called into Bobby
8578800	8580720	tonight because he had his 11th anniversary.
8580720	8583120	So I understand it's no big deal.
8583120	8586360	But if you want to email us your thoughts, you can always send us an email, participate
8586360	8587360	at orangesonsradio.com.
8587360	8591720	Of course you can always tweet us as well, twitter.com slash O L R, but we are going
8591720	8593480	to go ahead and start to wrap up for tonight.
8593480	8598120	I want to thank you guys for downloading our show and checking it out or listening to us
8598120	8599120	live.
8599120	8600560	However you consumed orange on radio this week.

8601860	8604840	If you like what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or five about
8604840	8605840	the show.
8605840	8609720	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only
8609720	8612160	if the gamers are here to listen to it.
8612160	8615860	So, um, uh, you know, again, help us spread the word.
8615860	8616860	That's all we ask.
8616860	8617960	Uh, that's going to do it.
8617960	8621720	We're done a little early tonight, but I guess that gives us time to go hunt Pokemon or something.
8621720	8622720	I don't know.
8622720	8623720	We'll see.
8623720	8624720	It's all common shit around here.
8624720	8625720	Oh, excuse me.
8625720	8626720	Oh, I'm sorry.
8626720	8634000	Oh, since after I caught like the 120th Pidgey, it's like, we're going to start saying it.
8634000	8635000	I could use a different.
8635160	8636720	Oh, that's a lot of XP for evolving them over.
8636720	8637720	It is.
8637720	8638720	That's I got the 17.
8638720	8639720	All right.
8639720	8640720	Anyway.
8640720	8641720	Uh, any final thoughts for us tonight?
8641720	8642720	Loki.
8642720	8644840	I guess I should get on working on a game.
8644840	8645840	Yeah.
8645840	8650040	I want to have, you know, have a reputation for not releasing anything.
8650040	8651040	Yeah.
8651040	8653040	Uh, Shane, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
8653040	8655040	Thank you for filling in for a little bit of the show here.
8655040	8656040	You're welcome.
8656040	8657040	No, I just want to sleep.
8657040	8658040	All right.
8658040	8661720	Well, don't sleep there on the chair cause that'll be awkward in the morning.
8661720	8664760	Um, Alan stepped into studio randomly wanting to say something.
8664760	8665760	Yes, Alan.
8665760	8672000	I have an emergency F you of the week F you to the fact that I was, I had like three or
8672000	8675720	four dollars in loose change in my hand and then I was picking up little bits of trash
8675720	8676720	off my desk.
8676720	8681280	And when I went to the garbage whole handful went in and I'm not rooting through the trash
8681280	8683960	for like a bunch of dimes and nickels.
8683960	8688400	So F you to throwing away $4 and change for $4 for $4.
8688400	8689400	I dig through the trash.
8689400	8690400	Well, it depends.
8690400	8691400	What's in there.
8691400	8692400	Do you have like day old food?
8692400	8693400	Cause I don't know about that.
8693400	8696840	But I think if it's just papers, it's all you work.
8696840	8698800	Anything at your work is just papers.
8698800	8701640	I dig through that for $4 being lazy.
8701640	8702640	All right.
8702640	8705480	Thank you for interrupting the show to share your tragedy with us.
8705480	8708920	Uh, my final thought is a feel better dark Sakura.
8708920	8712960	And uh, if you're listening, I hope you are here next week.
8712960	8715480	That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.
