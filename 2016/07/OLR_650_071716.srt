00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This week Valve releases a statement about its role in the CSGO gambling controversy denying any benefit of describing its impending involvement. This is just one of many reveals in this week's gaming news. Join us for all the details of your comments and more right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, July the 17th of 2016 with episode number 650 of our show. A nice round number there.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Welcome. Thank you for your support whether it's been for 650 weeks or if this is your very first week listening to Orange Lounge Radio. All about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, the place where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And joining you in studio are three of those voices. Myself, Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter as Skie and joining me as she does just about every week on this program. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hi. How are you? I'm a little high. You had surgery this week, right? Yeah, I just took my Norco. I'm actually kind of surprised you're here to be honest. I kind of figured you wouldn't be here after having that surgery.

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She didn't have her organs taken out or anything. I had something taken out. It was on your hand so it wasn't totally invasive. I had a ganglion sister move from my right hand. I'm not going to tell you what it is. Go look it the fuck up. That's what Google's for. If you can spell it, good luck.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ganglion. G-A-N-G-L-I-O-N. Push the Siri button and then rewind the episode. Right, or whatever. But the thing is that since I'm right handed, I keep forgetting about a lot of stuff and reaching for stuff with my right hand or doing things. So I'm like, fuck that hurts.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Not very good for gaming either, I bet. I've actually been playing a lot of Sims, but we'll go into that later. Sure, sure. I'm just worried about what it's going to be like when I have to use a regular mouse.

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, I remember when there was a good six month period where you were having some serious wrist problems and when we would go to your gaming week you'd be like, shrug, too hard to play anything because of my wrist.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, it has to do the same thing, the ganglion cyst. Right around about 2006 it got so bad I would do everything on keyboard commands. I wouldn't hold a controller. And finally, they changed my mouse at work to a thumb trackball, which they don't make that mouse anymore.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's just like my Microsoft thumb trackball. And like, seriously, if you find people selling it, I bought mine for 14 bucks. People are selling them for like 100, 200 bucks because you can't get them anymore.

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm surprised if people still have a need for them. They don't make them.

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Logitech had one similar, but I don't think they make theirs anymore. So it's really annoying. And of course, work won't let me bring mine. Weird. I guess some liability.

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But anyway, so now having used a regular mouse for two years, the cyst has started to grow again. So finally, I'm like, just screw it, cut it out. And the doctor's like, well, it's not cancerous if you've had it for this long. So let's just get rid of it.

15
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So now I'm like, ow. So Norco. I love Norco. It makes me not give a fuck.

16
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So Dark Soccer Tonight will not be giving any fucks. But I mean, you usually don't.

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No, I might give a fuck here or there. But today, like, I'm not giving fucks. I'm taking them.

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Once in a while, I might say Mass Effect and you might be like, oh, I have a fuck for that. Yes, I do. I have one fuck to spend on Mass Effect news.

19
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And you know what I have, though, that makes life wonderful? Cinnabon Delights.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Which I've never had one. I want to try one.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Girl, eat one right now.

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I got to introduce our chat room. And of course, our third host here is due. But our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

23
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And some comments on Dark Soccer being on pain meds. Breakman is starting to sing that song because Dark Soccer got high. I guess changing lyrics here a little bit.

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was gonna play Pokemon Go, but then I got high. Actually, you probably would play Pokemon. Anyway.

25
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Raginator says, how high Dark Soccer? Like listening to Cypress Hill high?

26
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No.

27
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you insane in the membrane?

28
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know what's funny is I'm allergic to pot.

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm allergic to the smoke. I've eaten it before, but I'm allergic to the smoke.

31
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Dark Soccer was gonna host the show.

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But then I took Norco.

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brad from Pod Culture suggests you are on Fuck It All. Perhaps, perhaps. Anyway.

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Not drugged tonight. Say hello to our third host here in studio. It's Techmaster Loki.

35
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hi.

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How are you?

37
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm fine.

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah. You are not powered by Norco. You are powered by hamburgers.

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Fair statement.

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How are you doing?

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm doing okay. I feel that I should have either suffered Slurpee or Milkshake, being that I wasn't in and out, so I should have got Milkshake.

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, let's talk about Slurpees for a minute. Because last night, okay, so we were in Old Sack playing Pokemon Go until 1 AM. Don't you fucking judge me.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We were out playing Pokemon Go until like 1 AM in Old Sack. There's tons of people around because there's bars down there that are open until 2. So, I mean, it's pretty safe.

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, we left, and I was like, you know what, I kind of like, like, Fatty wants a McFlurry, right? I wanted to go get a...

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But McDonald's conveniently closes at 1 AM. So, I was like, damn it. Now I have like, you have that taste for sugar. It's like, I got to get something.

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And then I remembered, oh, aha, 7-Eleven will have Slurpees. So, and imagine my surprise and excitement when I saw that they have a new special flavor right now.

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Birthday Cake Slurpee.

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, my son got that. And I'm like, no.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's kind of like, it is kind of a train wreck of a flavor.

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's basically like Birthday Cake Soda, but frozen. And it's just, it just sounds terrible.

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But that's like my favorite yogurt, is like Birthday Cake Yogurt, which is so weird.

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll just stick to like the Cherry or the Blue Raspberry.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're a traditional kind of guy.

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Exactly. Or Cola.

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Speaking of your son, I saw your wife posting photos on Facebook that I guess you are teaching your son how to play Pokemon Go or something.

57
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You got your son on the tablet.

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He's interested. And my coworker, she gave me like an old prepaid phone that she had that she's not using anymore because she got a nicer Samsung phone.

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So, it doesn't run Pokemon Go, or at least it's not supposed to, but then I rooted it and got it to run.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, it is running on there and he's able to play it and he's enjoying it, but she hates the idea of him playing it because she thinks he's in front of the screen too much as it is.

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Which, I mean, yeah, he plays video games for like three hours on the weekends because that's when we're really tired and my other son goes to sleep and we're just like, we don't want to fucking deal with you right now.

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Just go in your room and just play the Wii U until that battery runs dead.

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And that's what he does. He plays it until the battery runs dead and then he brings the tablet back and starts bothering me again.

64
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You know, that's kind of how I started when I was five years old. It was just like, I'll just go play on the Commodore 64 until I'm tired. I'm ready to go to bed.

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, so he'll start off with Minecraft today and then I think he played probably some Smash Brothers and then he watched YouTube videos.

66
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So, he'll watch the Diamond Heart and stuff like that.

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Interesting. Alright, well that's cool. But yeah, at least Pokemon Go kind of gets you out in the real world.

68
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, he liked it. I mean, he had fun with it. He got very excited about it. I told him, like, this is not an everyday thing.

69
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is sometimes. We're not bringing it to the park every single time because you don't play on the playground when you have this.

70
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You just stare at the screen. So, you're not going to do this all the time, but this will be like a treat.

71
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, this is when you get an A. I guess he's not old enough to get A's yet because in kindergarten everybody gets good grades, right?

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They don't really grade you. Yeah, alright. Let's see, going to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I did not realize what a freaking response Birthday Cake Slurpee was. I got like a full page of Birthday Cake Slurpee comments in our chat.

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
JD is like, Birthday Cake Slurpee, I need this. I'm assuming, since it's some type of, look at this, they didn't pay me to even pitch this.

75
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They had their free Slurpee day, but I totally avoided that place, you know, on the day.

76
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm pretty sure every 7-Eleven has it right now. And 7-Eleven's on the west coast.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They also have, what is that, they have like a sour one too. Like Sour Patch Kids.

78
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I found something I like better than Slurpees. What's that?

79
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Again at Taco Bell. They have the orange crush cream slushy thing.

80
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
When are they going to get horchata at Taco Bell? Actually, I shouldn't ask that because if you're going to get horchata, you gotta go to one of those hole-in-the-wall joints.

81
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Taco Bell is not Mexican food. Taco Bell is Taco Bell.

82
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This makes me, it makes me happy, but it's like immediate brain freeze. So eat one of these things.

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I hear you. Let's see. Also, Stoppy says, don't get birthday cake pop tarts. They suck. I didn't realize that was a thing.

84
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I had red velvet cupcake pop tarts. They were pretty good. I even sent some to Sil, who is occasionally on the Geek Card show.

85
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I sent her in a box of treats last year or the year before. I sent her some red velvet pop tarts and I think she enjoyed those.

86
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's see. SSG100Matt says, birthday cake flavoring so people can have a birthday every day.

87
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And Breakman says, lol the Wii U is parenting Loki's kids. But follows that up with, woah woah woah, Loki tells his kids no. How dare he be a good parent.

88
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Those comments again in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

89
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Because he requests shit way too much. He doesn't know how to save up for that thing that he really wants.

90
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can tell when he's looking to bother me about something. It's like, you know what, I wish I had a blah blah blah. No thank you.

91
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I wish I had like a Slurpee. Can we go get a Slurpee? We should have a Slurpee. I told my friends that I'm getting a Slurpee today.

92
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And if we don't get a Slurpee, I'm lying to them. He uses that on me a lot. I'm like, that's too bad. That's not my fault.

93
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's clever.

94
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And he gets really upset about it too. I'm like, sorry, no.

95
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Here's the lesson I learned. You need to tell him this little saying. Tell him this comes from Uncle Rob. You ready? Don't write checks your ass can't cash.

96
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh my God. You should have seen it like earlier today or something. Like he was just pissing off everybody.

97
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And like, I'm just sitting there like, you know, they're watching TV or something. And my wife's like, shut up.

98
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And she's like, oh wait, that wasn't in my head. And I said that. Oh crap.

99
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He's like, you shut up.

100
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm like, look what you did.

101
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
William murder face and chat says your child is trying to guilt trip already. Lol.

102
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Right. He learns that from his mom.

103
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, I do. I guess we could tease this a little bit, but this is going to be coming at some point in the next couple months.

104
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We don't know when, but I, this, I almost think this is too big to tease, but we're going to, here it is. We're gonna drop the bomb.

105
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Loki's kid will be on OLR in the next couple months. We're making plans to make that happen.

106
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I would love it even more if it could be both Julian and Loki's son. Maybe we can talk to Julian's mom and make that happen.

107
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Maybe we'll just let them have the show for the day. We'll see what that is coming.

108
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We'll see. Maybe we can have the podcast for kids by kids.

109
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
When I think of orange zones radio, I don't think of four kids, dark soccer. We have real potty mouth problems on the show.

110
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I know I meant their own podcast for kids by kids.

111
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why not everybody starting a podcast? And if you already have a podcast, podcast, start another one.

112
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We still need to discuss intervention.

113
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Project number five. All right. Anyway, um, some other comments here. Uh, Loki's kid is learning to be sneaky. This from brave man.

114
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Loki's kid is learning to be sneaky. It's like he's learning from one of the best or something.

115
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Uh, as Joanna and Matt says, seriously hit record and give the kids the show.

116
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like, yeah, I had no problem, you know, letting him play Pokemon go. My wife's the one that has the problem with it and whatever, you know,

117
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I understand wanting to limit it to because he gets cranky and annoying if, you know, you give in to him too much.

118
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But like, I don't know. I don't have a problem with him playing it sometimes. So I think it'd be fun.

119
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
All right. Let's get into some kickoff topics tonight. I have two things I want to talk about.

120
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
First off, since we're already kind of talking about it, I want to do something a little bit rare for Ensemble Radio.

121
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't think we do this a lot ever since we started the kickoff topic as a way to not start every show with talking about the video games that you've been playing this week.

122
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Which, by the way, is why we do a kickoff topic. But I want to do a kickoff topic that is essentially the exact same thing we talked about last week.

123
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But I think it is merited for once in the show's history, and that is to talk more about Pokemon Go and the cultural revolution that this game is becoming.

124
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You know, this is a really good, cheap opportunity for me to plug my brand new podcast, Wink, Nudge, Smile, available on iTunes.

125
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The PokeStop podcast is a brand new podcast, I'm hoping, with Shane.

126
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Even though you might think so from the name, it is not only about Pokemon Go because, you know, Shane loves the handheld games.

127
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So he talks a lot about his shiny hunting adventures continue on there. He caught one during the show we taped last night.

128
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And then we talk about the handheld games as well. We talk about Poke, and it's really something for everything Pokemon, although obviously Go is the huge thing right now.

129
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So, cheap plug, Wink, Nudge. It's available exclusively at vognetwork.com, and you can go right to the landing page for it.

130
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
PokeStopPodcast.com, but available on iTunes, Google Play Store, and soon everywhere else that I can think of to submit it. But those are the big two.

131
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But anyway, obviously the impact of Pokemon is still huge. In fact, looking at the news this week, I gotta be honest, you guys.

132
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
There's not a lot of gaming news right now. I mean, we're kind of at a low point in the cycle anyway.

133
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Because, you know, in the about six weeks following E3, you kind of get in that summer slump where a lot of people go on vacation because E3 is such a huge thing to prep for.

134
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So we're kind of in a little bit of a slump anyway in gaming news. But like seriously, go to your favorite gaming website. Half of the news articles this week are about Pokemon Go.

135
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm not even joking. Like some of the ones I read, what, like VG247, you go to their front page, like half Pokemon Go stories, which I get it.

136
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm not accusing or criticizing at all. Like that's just where everybody's at right now because the impact this game is having is huge.

137
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
For example, I'm sure you all have seen the videos on Facebook by now. Have you seen the video from Central Park where the Vaporeon spawns?

138
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And all these people like stampeding. It's almost a wonder that nobody got hurt.

139
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's like E3 in the Wii or something.

140
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And it's dark outside, so you know it's after 9, 10 o'clock at night, you know, just all running to Central Park to catch this Vaporeon. It's like, what the hell? This is nuts.

141
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There was an article that just came up and I wasn't going to do it as like an after show thing. I wanted to mention it because when we were talking to Bob, you were talking about going to graveyards.

142
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sure.

143
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And as a thing for you from folks in Ohio that said that they were hearing about a gem being in a particular graveyard and they had lost a family member a few years ago, 20 year old buried there.

144
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And they said, wouldn't it be funny if the gem was on top of his grave? And it was. So they actually left a sign there that said all are welcome to play on this grave. He would have liked it.

145
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So I just thought that would have been...

146
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It just gets you in the feels too. Like it's such like little things like that. And especially, you know, and we were talking a little bit about this with Bobby, but I think you guys are also seeing these stories all over social media, Facebook, Twitter, wherever.

147
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is that people that have had anywhere from mild to serious mental health issues, whether that be social anxiety, which I'm learning is way more common than I originally thought it was.

148
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Or just, you know, I don't want to necessarily say a fear of the outdoors, but there's certainly a lot of fucked up shit in the world right now. Like there's a lot of fucked up shit happening in the world.

149
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And this game is causing people to be able to mentally put that aside and go outside, you know, and go on a walk, which for many people is something they maybe wouldn't have otherwise done.

150
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And to hear things like that, especially when video games get such a bad rap in our culture sometimes, right? When some of those fucked up things do happen in the world.

151
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
A lot of people want to look at, it was the movies, it was the games, it was, you know, the violence and the games so forth, you know, games often take a lot of that blame.

152
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But here's a great example of, okay, well, wait a minute, if you're going to report on all the bad, you should report on some of the good too, because there's a lot of good that's coming from this particular game.

153
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But no, the media continues to focus on the bad about, oh, these people fell off a cliff while they were playing Pokemon Go because they weren't paying attention to signs or in general paying attention whatsoever.

154
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But it's just amazing. And to expand on one other thought that I was talking a little bit about on PokeStop that I wanted to kind of expand on here.

155
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You know, we've done this show for 14 years, and we were born of an arcade gaming community. This show was born of an arcade gaming community that doesn't exist in the way it used to anymore.

156
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's more of a niche thing, I would say these days. But you know, Dark Soccer, myself, Loki, I've told this story a million times, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution, which was like, that was the game, that was our Pokemon Go.

157
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We would meet up at Roseville Golf Land once a week, usually a lot more, three times a week, to play this game and related music games like BeatMania, Guitar Freaks and all that stuff.

158
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We would play all these games. But somewhere along the way, because of the internet, probably, because of Xbox Live, because of the rise of these things that allowed us to stay indoors.

159
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So those of us that did have a little more social anxiety and those sorts of things, we had a way to play video games without going out into the real world now.

160
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And so arcade culture kind of has died a lot. Now, believe me, I fully realize, and I've talked about on this show, there are places like Round 1, Dave and Busters, you know, there are still some places that are starting to gain a little steam.

161
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But, and you may disagree with me on this, but I would still say a lot of that is very niche. A lot of that is still a little bit more in that cult department.

162
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's growing, but it's not mainstream like arcades were in the 80s and 90s just yet.

163
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But now, with Pokemon Go, it's almost flipped things on its head, because we all came back home to play games, and now Pokemon Go is saying, you need to leave home again to play games.

164
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And so it's almost like it's bringing arcade culture back, but not to an arcade. It's bringing arcade culture to your parks. It's bringing arcade culture to downtown.

165
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's bringing arcade culture to wherever these Pokestops and Gyms are, which is basically everywhere.

166
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And it's quite something to behold, but I mean, you know, if it wasn't for arcade culture, would I have ever walked up to Dark Soccer and said, you know,

167
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
oh, you play this video game, I play this video game too, although that's not how the conversation went, I just don't remember, it was a long time ago.

168
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But would Loki and I have ever had something to talk about? Would we have ever talked about insane edits that he was making on DDR? Would we have had those things to talk about?

169
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Who knows? Arcade culture is what made this show. And now, it's happening again because of Pokemon.

170
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Strangers are talking to each other, you know, about, oh, did you see there's a Rapidash over there at that Pokestop, you gotta go over there and get it.

171
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And people have these things to talk about again, and friendships are being formed. Rivalries too, and some people take that shit a little too far,

172
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
but, you know, there's always an ugly side of every culture, and arcades sometimes had toxic people as well.

173
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And looking at all that aside, I think there's been a lot more good stuff than there's been bad stuff. I don't know, do you guys have any thoughts on that?

174
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The arcade culture coming back again because of Pokemon Go?

175
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't know, it's just people going to the park.

176
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And it doesn't matter what park, it's every park.

177
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Right.

178
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I wouldn't necessarily call that arcade culture. I would actually say it would be, because the arcades for us were more of a, it was like bars when you're dating.

179
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I mean, if you think about it, traditionally, I don't know, my dates were never really at bars.

180
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, I think of Cheers, when Norm would walk into the bar and everybody went,

181
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Norm! I remember when I used to go to DDR and walk through the big castle doors at Roseville Golf Land. Rob!

182
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's where, it's your pub. It really is. So, when you find other people that are doing the same thing that you are, it's an immediate bonding.

183
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry, I am not as articulate as I would like to be tonight. So, I hope that my words are making some sense.

184
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They are, don't worry. Push through that Norco.

185
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You use words, they're the best words.

186
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm really good at words.

187
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You are wording all the things very well tonight, Darzagra.

188
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh, girl.

189
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But at any rate, I wouldn't, because the arcade culture, I think, is dependent on having an arcade.

190
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And having, being in that type of environment. What this is doing is it's just more facilitating the same type of, of social interaction.

191
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It is a catalyst for people to actually, as I'll tell you, this is a big, probably a California thing, I don't know.

192
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But when I moved out here, and it's still like this, people, for example, if you've got someone standing in the middle of the aisle and you're trying to get around them,

193
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
people will try to squeeze past without saying, excuse me, or, sorry, would you mind stepping aside so I can get past you?

194
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No one will talk to another person. You won't have chatter in the line at the grocery store.

195
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You won't randomly say hi to a stranger.

196
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Now, this is sort of removing that barrier to participating in society.

197
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Instead of, it's me and there's all these other people, it's, it's us and we are.

198
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And that is the big thing. Am I, by the way, am I wrong about that observation about California?

199
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:50,000
No, but I would say that's almost more small town versus large town. Not that I'm necessarily calling Mobile a small town, but I do think there's kind of that and the southern culture in a way, you know, I think does play into that.

200
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So I don't know if that's necessarily specifically California, because I think if you went to New York City, you'd probably find something similar. You know what I mean?

201
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I think that's just large town versus small town. But you, you're not wrong in your observation.

202
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'll say that.

203
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And, and people get so surprised when you actually, oh, excuse me, you know, but this, the same thing, instead of us having this barrier between people where no one wants to speak to another person or no one wants to interact, either for this perceived notion of convenience or inconvenience or for...

204
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Maybe, maybe, I don't know.

205
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Well, let me, I just want to say, you know, because I want to get to some comments here in the chat room as well. But I think, I think you're right. And when I talk about arcade culture, I don't, I don't think I literally mean the cult like that, that arcade magic is just unfortunately, it's never coming back.

206
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That's just something folks our age will remember forever. And I just don't, well, never say never, I suppose. But that's just something that is is not what it used to be.

207
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But you're right when you say there's that, that particular magic where you and I have something in common now. And it's this game. We have, the door is open for us to talk. And it's not weird if I like come up to you and just be like, you know, because sometimes people walk up to you like, hey, how you doing? How's your day?

208
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And maybe that's why that that tends to happen in bars, because alcohol loosens you up a little bit. But usually, especially in big cities, like that story you're telling about the grocery store, people tend to clam up a little bit. And it's like, why is this person talking to me?

209
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But when it's about Pokemon, like, hey, did you see the Clefairy that just spawned over there? Now? That's not weird at all. It's not weird at all to ask somebody, have you seen my Jigglypuff?

210
00:25:36,000 --> 00:26:03,000
When I was in line at Taco Bell, because when I can't get out and walk, if I'm in a place where I'll be driving slowly or, you know, like in a parking lot, I'll turn on the game so that it counts my distance when I'm moving slowly. And so she just happened to see it in my car. And just like, if you go like a couple of blocks down, we saw this over there, which I didn't stop. I was like, Oh, thank you. You know, just random.

211
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh, yeah. And I heard a girl, we were walking through the park, we were walking to get to this Thai restaurant, we want to eat too. And there's tons of people at this park playing, right? And this girl's like, I got to find the Pikachu I got. Where's the Pikachu Pikachu? And I looked, I yelled Pikachu in the parking lot, diagonal from the park. And she goes, Thank you so much and runs off, you know, and it's, you know, and Alan and I were talking over dinner. I hope that girl got her Pikachu. She really wanted it. I got one right here. Yeah, apparently that park is like a Pikachu. Stop it.

212
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I need to catch a Raichu. But I'm starting to find more evolved ones around too. But I mean, this is why I was even thinking of like, trying to get friends for like a, you know, a weekly pokey walk. Just, you know, pick a neighborhood, have people together and do a night walk.

213
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Which is funny, because and I don't mean to like be an ass, but this is just the reality of the situation. You've talked about doing a weekly walk before like, oh, we're gonna go do on a walk just for our health and for our sanity. We're gonna go walking. And I don't think that idea really ever got off the ground more than one or two weeks. But Dark Sakura, now the Pokemon are involved. It'll happen.

214
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Let's do it.

215
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It'll happen. Absolutely.

216
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You know,

217
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
isn't that interesting?

218
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You know, I think, you know, even like, you know, like, maybe if we want to do like a club night or something, go walk downtown, you know, power numbers safe, safe enough.

219
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That's right. Stop in. That's why I'll go to Old Sack because I don't go alone.

220
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Stop in, go, you know, go to a couple clubs, have drink. Keep walking. Stop for dessert. Keep walking.

221
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
ActDeft in chat says, Dark Sakura, my friends and I are doing that. We chose Thursday nights.

222
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,000
SHA100Matt says, I'm just surprised by the huge response and the amount of people playing it. My small hometown tracks in a local park has been getting 50 people a night.

223
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They don't get that many people a day with regular events.

224
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Some other comments about the whole like arcade culture thing I wanted to get to in chat.

225
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
JD in our chat at live.vognetware.com says, I feel like arcade culture went away largely for financial reasons.

226
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I don't really see Pokemon Go changing the financial picture there, even with its popularity.

227
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You know, that's, that's an interesting point. I, because Pokemon Go, it's making money.

228
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You know, I realize they do give out free lures and free, you know, some of these.

229
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But you know, people are buying them. Look, guilty. I dropped $20 on it.

230
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You know why? Because I wanted to support the game's development.

231
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I've been a Niantic fan for years because of Ingress.

232
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I knew day one I was going to drop 20 bucks just because I wanted to show a little love to the game.

233
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And you know, some more XP eggs are nice too.

234
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But I bought some incubators.

235
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And it adds up, people. All those people in Central Park running to get the Vaporeon.

236
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
If they all spend $5, you know, Niantic's making money.

237
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Apple's making money because they get, what is it, 30%? Google's making money because they get 30%.

238
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The amount of money that they're receiving per user is higher than like even, well it's, it's double what most games are.

239
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It's slightly higher than like Candy Crush Saga though.

240
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I mean, they're, they're estimating, I mean, it's like a quarter per person per day.

241
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But a quarter times, you know, a billion, quite a few million people, then that's still quite a bit of money.

242
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
More people than were playing Candy Crush at its peak, which officially happened in the last week.

243
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Eat another one of these because I don't want to eat them all.

244
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Those Cinnabon things are amazing. And I don't feel guilty because I'll walk it off.

245
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'll work off this Jigglypuff a little later. I'm just going to put the box here for a moment while I finish a couple other thoughts.

246
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But the precious.

247
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So I have a couple other thoughts and then I want to move on.

248
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So one, the inevitable knockoff games. It's coming.

249
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Because if you're a gaming company and you're not, you know, they're all thinking, they're everybody's seeing Pokemon go.

250
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Employees at game companies are all playing Pokemon Go. I mean, that's a given.

251
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't have to tell you that I know people that work in the gaming industry and fuck yeah, they're all playing Pokemon Go just like the rest of us are.

252
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The problem is, though, it's going to be, you know, coming up with the infrastructure for all that because they've had this being built by the community for years now with Ingress.

253
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And now you can't just jump into that.

254
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah, no.

255
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So if somebody is going to, quote unquote, knock off Pokemon Go, they're going to have to figure out where are they going to get that network from.

256
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But then again, there's other location based games. I just haven't played any of them. So I don't know how those work.

257
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You know, and some would argue, Rob, did you ever play a Vita game called Invisimals?

258
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Because that is a lot of, you know, what you see in Pokemon Go is in this Invisimals game.

259
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No, I did not play that game.

260
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And I'm going to give you my honest reason that you don't want to hear.

261
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I didn't play that game because it wasn't Pokemon.

262
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And I didn't play that game because, you know, on the Vita, you're kind of constricted to your house.

263
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So it was just, and I mean, in the way, I kind of felt that, oh, well, isn't that similar to just the face Raider game or whatever that is that's built into the 3DS?

264
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I mean, it's, you know, so there's a lot more that I think Pokemon Go does.

265
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But I'm sure other companies are going to try to rip it off.

266
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm sure, in fact, I think I even read a story out there.

267
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
There's already Chinese games being made that, you know.

268
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Although just straight up rip Pokemon Go and call it something else and it will be Pokemon Go.

269
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You know what, when Flappy Bird came out, there was a million clones, including Flappy Vog, playable at vognetwork.com, wink.

270
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But what's going to be the first real challenger that steps up?

271
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And I'm curious what gaming company is looking at it.

272
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And if you follow me on Twitter, I've been saying a lot that I fully predict it's going to be Disney.

273
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And because who's got the characters that can compete with Pokemon? Disney.

274
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Monster Hunter?

275
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't, this is not going to be popular, what I'm about to say. This is a hard truth.

276
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Not nearly as popular as Pokemon. It's kind of a niche thing.

277
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And Digimon already had it ages ago.

278
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And Digimon, not as well known as Pokemon. I know you don't want to hear that.

279
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Already had it ages ago.

280
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah, well it's kind of, Digimon, have they done anything recent with it?

281
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Well there's Digimon Adventure Try, is the series that's out right now.

282
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Which basically is a continuation of the first two series.

283
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But keep in mind, Digimon existed before Pokemon as little items that you would carry around on these little things that you could put them together and battle against each other.

284
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Wasn't it kind of a derivative, not directly, but a derivative of Tamagotchi?

285
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Actually the same company, Tamagotchi was the precursor to Digimon.

286
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You know who's really big into mobile gaming? They have a franchise called Elibits. That's as close as I can get.

287
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Konami, that would be funny.

288
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
ActDeaf says Disney Infinity rebranding, Disney Infinity and beyond. You know what, you should trademark that title because it's pretty good.

289
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Too bad they should have just done what they were planning on doing Disney Infinity and I think that would have been great as it was.

290
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But sure, if they want to try doing this, that's cool. It won't make any sense, but you know, neat.

291
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I do feel like there are other public source, open source geocaching websites. There are other databases that a competitor could choose to pull from.

292
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Or they could just be really generic and just split the world into tiny little squares and do something with that.

293
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm not saying whatever the ripoff game is going to be literally the same thing as Pokemon Go with different characters.

294
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
In fact, I would be very disappointed if that was the game.

295
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But I think you will see somebody try to push the get out in the real world and look for our characters type of game before the holidays.

296
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So we'll see what happens with that.

297
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And I had something else I wanted to talk about. Oh yeah, one other thing. Let me ask you guys about this.

298
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And I'm curious what chat thinks about this too.

299
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
How long is this going to go on?

300
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Like, I kind of don't believe that six months from now I'm still going to go to old sack and there's going to be hundreds of people on the pier trying to catch a horsey.

301
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
How long? What's the endgame here with Pokemon Go? What's this going to look like a week from now?

302
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
There is no endgame right now. There's no game.

303
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So there can't be an endgame. It's just catching Pokemon and then you fill up your Pokedex and then you're done.

304
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Then by the time most people are getting close to doing that, they'll release more Pokemon and it'll be never anything.

305
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Trying to answer the question why people are attached to certain brands, it makes no fucking sense.

306
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I mean, why do people play Candy Crush Saga? Who the fuck knows? Who the hell cares?

307
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But they're making money off of it. This is the fad that's going to be popular right now.

308
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And eventually another fad will come along and it'll be that.

309
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
JD in chat theorizes a competitor could use the Foursquare or Facebook databases. LOL.

310
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Mega Man X 400 says it will die down but there will be people always playing the game.

311
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That's how I kind of feel too. Is that you might not have 500 people in Old Town but you might have five.

312
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Right, just like with Ingress.

313
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We're dozens strong.

314
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
That's true. It'll become a cult thing like Ingress.

315
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Let's see. Dungeon Buster says it will eventually plateau but in the meantime everyone's enjoying the ride.

316
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That's for sure.

317
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
William Murface says I think it depends. If you keep updating mechanics and adding Pokemon and having events, maybe years.

318
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You know, to be fair to Niantic and Ingress, and we've mentioned this on the show before,

319
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Niantic has not shied away from changing the game as it's going and putting new things out there and new items and changes to basic game mechanics.

320
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
When they introduced the pay store in Ingress, it really changed the way that people farmed for gear.

321
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Because it used to be like you'd have to have a bunch of portals that you could just either drive through or walk through really quick and hack repeatedly.

322
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But then they added, I want to say they added glyph hacking for one. I don't think that was in the game in the very beginning.

323
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So where you could do a longer hack and you drew pictures, a Simon Says type game, and you got more gear.

324
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And then when they opened the pay store there was frackers which would double the gear output and it changed the way that people get their gear.

325
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Because Niantic split from Google and when they split from Google that's when they opened the cash shop because they had to substantiate themselves.

326
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
They didn't have unlimited Google money anymore.

327
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But those of you that are worried that the game is never going to get changed or upgraded, I think to be fair to Niantic,

328
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
now granted they have a lot of server issues and all that stuff to work out right now.

329
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But once they work that stuff out, I really do think Niantic will change and upgrade the game and all that stuff.

330
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So I think that is coming.

331
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Anyhow, that's I guess all I want to say on Pokemon Go.

332
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let me get a couple more comments in chat over at live.vognetware.com.

333
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Kaijuto in chat says it won't be Disney, they're kind of over video games.

334
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's probably going to be something like the Smurfs or Treasurer trolls.

335
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Kaijuto, I see your point with Disney but I kind of don't think it's accurate when it comes to mobile.

336
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Look on the mobile store right now because there's still a lot of Disney games on mobile.

337
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I get what you're saying with consoles, especially what we saw with Infinity, but I feel like in the mobile space Disney ain't done.

338
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You know what, I was actually just thinking that I like what some of those like Pounds are doing,

339
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
where you walk their dogs and you can do it while you're playing Pokemon.

340
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And I sort of see like having charity walk apps and things like that become more popular as a result,

341
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
especially things that you can run in conjunction with Pokemon Go or other apps like that.

342
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And Dutch blockbuster says it's interesting to think that Pokemon Go is probably their bare bones foundation for much larger changes later.

343
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,000
They've really only started out with a relatively small pick of Pokemon and there's the entire history of the series to draw on for special events, mechanics and so forth.

344
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And you know, you bring up a good point because we're talking about will this thing be dead next week, next month?

345
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Niantic hasn't even announced a live event for Pokemon Go yet. It's coming.

346
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You saw the trailer with Mewtwo in Central Park and we know damn well there's about five Pokemon in the game right now you can't catch.

347
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
If you see pictures of people with Mew or Mewtwo, they are fake. Niantic is saving those for these live events.

348
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And so that whole piece of the puzzle has yet to unveil itself on what that's going to look like.

349
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Is that going to involve battling for gyms and only one team will be able to get the Pokemon?

350
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I actually think that would be really shitty because there's a lot of kids playing this game so they're going to need to open it up to everybody somehow.

351
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I realize it's very hippy dippy but it's the honest to god truth.

352
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We'll see how that's going to work in the coming weeks.

353
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So I expect we're going to have regular Pokemon updates on this show because the game will continue to evolve.

354
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It'll just be interesting how many people are still with it when the live events and those things start to come out.

355
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Anyway, I do want to get to our gaming weeks but before we do, I want to ask DarkSakura about this because you got to the show just in the nick of time tonight because you were at another event right up until five o'clock.

356
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You want to tell us about where you were at today?

357
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I was at a game developer jam done by IDGA Sacramento, the independent game developer association.

358
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I can't make my brain work right now.

359
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
What was the other one? I totally can't think of it.

360
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think it's like Girls Do Code, something like that.

361
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'll have to look it back up again because like I said, I'm not thinking very clearly.

362
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I was a judge on the panel with two other brilliant ladies.

363
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And basically they had two days to put a working game demo or at least enough of the game that would give you a minimal amount to get it working and fine.

364
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So they had some great games there and there's actually another one that I really wanted to bring up too.

365
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But I'll go through the recap.

366
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
There was one that was called Battle Arena and they they went our runner up.

367
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That's basically a combination of having like a PvP arena matches and real time strategy on the overworld maps.

368
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And it wasn't it was neat concept.

369
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
There was our winner, which was Overtime, which was sort of like Silent Hill in an office.

370
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And they just, you know, had enough to show us practical gameplay, but it's definitely going to be more of a psychological type of scare as opposed to, you know, jump scary.

371
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Well, I know I find the office place to be very scary, so a lot of people can relate.

372
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Well, this really it really you know, there's another one then that was called Wybrick, which is Kirby backwards, where instead of you eating things, you're a piece of pizza that gets eaten by people.

373
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And then you have to go through like different worlds inside of these people and you till you're vomited or excreted or something.

374
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That's interesting, but I like that.

375
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It's an interesting concept.

376
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's pretty creative. It's clever, though.

377
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And then there was another one.

378
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I don't remember that it had a name, but it was done with the what's it called the pulse band.

379
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's used for meditation that, you know, you have to get your your alpha waves into a particular line.

380
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And but they were going to do like an infinite runner type.

381
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But when you get your mind into this certain set, then you can fire because it'll read the alpha waves.

382
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And they're supposed to work with like different waves that you get different buffs for powers as you go through the game.

383
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It was a neat concept. But the thing to me is that it's also, I think, generally requires one to be neurotypical.

384
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You know, I think that people who are who are atypical would definitely have some trouble with that because mindsets are much harder to control based on other things.

385
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I don't know how I feel about reading people's minds and stuff, although I think it's a cool concept not to not to.

386
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But I'm just like, oh, the mind control gaming is a really scary kind of exciting thing.

387
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I got to mention this. You're getting a shout out in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

388
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
An anonymous chatter says, hey, that's us over time. Thanks again for coming out.

389
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You must have left an impression.

390
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Well, I did hang out and talk with those guys and I was just I was super, super impressed with what they had there.

391
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I think, you know, definitely, you know, more it was it was, I think, pretty bare bones as far as the the renders.

392
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
They definitely, you know, needed some some texturing and some work going in it.

393
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
But it was two days.

394
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It was, I would say, impressively polished for what it was.

395
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
You know, everything worked. Sound effects were there were music.

396
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It was I was really impressed with the the the other thing that really impressed me about them was how cohesive they were.

397
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Everyone in their group was on the same page.

398
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:46,000
There was another thing and they won our honorable mention is a concept for a game.

399
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Now, they didn't have the demo or anything like that because they're actually looking for for people to help them develop it.

400
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
They've just got mock ups and writing done.

401
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So I said I would give a shout out, you know, but the game is called Daddy's Tiny Girl, where through a series of misfortunes, a six year old girl is adopted by a giant.

402
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And so the game is her exploring a giant's world.

403
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And she has like giant magic that gives her more strength and the ability to eat like a giant and all kinds of things.

404
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But you play through a little girl's eyes, trapped in giant's world.

405
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And I thought that the concept was in the story that what I heard of it so far was really good.

406
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
They just need people to help them design and code.

407
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So if anyone is out there who would love to help these girls out, send me a line.

408
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
You can email me through the show, participate at Twitter is a good way to.

409
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah, you can get me a Twitter at at Dark Sakura.

410
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But you can also email our our line here.

411
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But I said I would put the word out there, see if anyone might be able to help them with with coding or different things that they need, because the concept is really solid.

412
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Well, and those folks that do overtime that are listening, you know, first, I want to check out the game.

413
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
How come Dark Soccer got to see all these games?

414
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Because I have boobs.

415
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That's not fair.

416
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And they're amazing.

417
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Well, I guess I should have just hauled my ass to the event.

418
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm a lady in gaming.

419
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But B, when you guys get something together that you might put out there for public consumption or something, by all means, our couch is open.

420
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So we'll get you guys on the show to talk about it.

421
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Well, I definitely will.

422
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And as I brought up to the guys behind overtime, I would love to have them on the show for sure to talk about it, because I really think that, you know.

423
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I really want to see the finished product.

424
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah.

425
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I would play the shit out of it.

426
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Sometimes developers just need a little motivation.

427
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You guys all remember, do we all remember when YYR came on this show?

428
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And I read him up and down saying, if you do not make this game, I will sell it for millions of dollars because you were too lazy to do it.

429
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And now, and he just got on Steam Greenlight.

430
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Not to say I told you so, but.

431
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You told him so.

432
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Girl.

433
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:24,000
There's enough jaded BS that's happened gaming commentating for the past 14 years that we tend to know a pretty good idea when we see one that, you know, you just got to sometimes really apply yourself.

434
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Also, since Dark Sakura has been taking Norco, I decided I would drink some wine that I started on the Pokestop podcast last night.

435
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
So now my thoughts are being in it a little bit.

436
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'm going to have wine coke.

437
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But I'm serious on what I said.

438
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But these, by the way, completely unintentional endorsement.

439
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Fuck you Taco Bell for making the cinema and delights absolutely amazing.

440
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah.

441
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I think Rob and I finished the box together.

442
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
There's still a couple more left, so you might want to have one.

443
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
They're going to go in my mouth.

444
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
All right.

445
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Anyway.

446
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
OK, so that's great.

447
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It sounds like that was a lot of fun.

448
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And we love SAKI GDA and Bri and Gabe and everybody involved with them.

449
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So I'm really glad we were able to do something outside just the one event a year.

450
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So I'm really ecstatic that you went to that.

451
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So that's great.

452
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I was glad to be invited.

453
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I was super happy.

454
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yeah, that's awesome.

455
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So.

456
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
All right.

457
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Well, let's move on to how was our gaming week and what types of video games have we been playing this week?

458
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I guess since Dark Sakura tends to go first, she'll go first again.

459
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
What have you been playing?

460
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Cinema Bond Delight to the game.

461
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
How was your gaming week outside of the fine game jam developed things?

462
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I have been playing some Pokemon Go and I can get out of the house to walk.

463
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I've hatched a few eggs.

464
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
They've had shit in them.

465
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I also have been playing a lot of Sims 4 because I have to ice my hand a lot.

466
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So I will just put an ice pack on and leave it over my little immobile mouse.

467
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And I've just been going nuts building tree houses and building things.

468
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I really super love The Sims 4.

469
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And I think that's really it.

470
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Oh, yeah.

471
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And I'm still on Miitomo because I like Miitomo.

472
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Although I curse loudly playing the stupid Miitomo drop.

473
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Do you still get enough of a supply of tickets and things where you're not really having to pay for that?

474
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You're given a lot more tickets now.

475
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Oh, that's good.

476
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Like in the last month, I've gotten like a ticket like practically every day.

477
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I would imagine that's because a lot of that has slowed down maybe.

478
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yeah.

479
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And you can get tickets as redemption prizes for your mission points.

480
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But, you know, me, I mean, the other thing I like about The Sims is dressing people up and designing my characters.

481
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So sort of had the same thing in Miitomo.

482
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And right now I have my little me in an all vinyl bodysuit.

483
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So I have to admit, I kind of finally fell off the Miitomo bandwagon, but I do need to fire it up.

484
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And I partially blame Pokémon Go for that, but I also blame that fucking Tap My Katamari game that Loki got me into to do.

485
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Which, by the way, he's playing right now.

486
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And I know it because I keep seeing his finger going tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

487
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Exactly.

488
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
There's nothing you tap on your phone that much.

489
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I am totally not.

490
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm very impatient.

491
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm just tapping.

492
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Hurry up and finish your gaming week.

493
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
No, he's playing Tap My Katamari.

494
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm totally not going to play that.

495
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Yes, please don't.

496
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
That is a good life choice.

497
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Oh, I did play something else because I found out I can use it in dual monitor mode.

498
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It was, um, cat lateral damage.

499
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Oh, really?

500
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I fucking love cat lateral damage.

501
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I mean, it's not easy and the controls are kind of not responsive in the way that I'd like for them to.

502
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And also it's really hard to play when you're on Norco.

503
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Um, but, uh, I, I've, it's cute.

504
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I had fun with it.

505
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And basically you were literally playing an asshole cat.

506
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Not sweet happy cat or mischievous cat.

507
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
You were destroying things because you hate the family.

508
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It says it in the game.

509
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You're doing this because you hate everyone.

510
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I was like, okay, I'm going to do that.

511
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Well, that's just a cat.

512
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I mean.

513
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, no, Midna doesn't.

514
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Midna doesn't.

515
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
She's just luring you into a false sense of security.

516
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Midna is a good cat.

517
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Of course she strikes for the kill.

518
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
No, Midna loves me.

519
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Um, so that's pretty much been my, my week.

520
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Is just building houses in the Sims.

521
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And then wrecking them with a cat.

522
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
No, I did tear down a house that I just made and started a new one.

523
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Cause I was like, I'm going to tell you something.

524
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Big houses are great in the Sims and they'll look nice and everything,

525
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
but they are a fucking pain in the ass to play through.

526
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Make yourself a small house with a big yard and you will be very happy.

527
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's a good, it's a good life lesson.

528
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Just keep it, keep it, keep it small.

529
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
The stuff you own, owns you.

530
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
All right.

531
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

532
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Um, honestly, it's pretty much the same as last week.

533
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Um, you know, I played Pokemon Go a bit, uh, when it was working and then, um,

534
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Ingress just a bit, just to keep my daily stuff going on.

535
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I think I may have captured a portal through here or there.

536
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Um, and then tap my Katamari.

537
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I've been playing way too much of that just because, I don't know,

538
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
that's about all of the brain activity I have in the evening is just for that.

539
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I mean, like, I was trying to research voxel engines and stuff like that

540
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
and just reading through the code, my eyes just get so blurry and stuff

541
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
just because I'm so tired.

542
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But tapping my Katamari requires no brain power whatsoever.

543
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's pretty much just tapping the screen, so I'm able to play that just fine.

544
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And then, of course, just so that I could say I played a game,

545
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
aside from the crap that I played last week,

546
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I did fire up a little bit of Burnout Paradise on Steam

547
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
and played through a little bit of that, uh, today, but it's all right.

548
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I didn't get a chance to play anything on the PlayStation 4

549
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
because my fucking wife is still watching Grey's Anatomy

550
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and I'm still very unhappy about this.

551
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I need some sort of external mod.

552
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah, and that's the other thing, too.

553
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's like, none of the fucking streaming options work.

554
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's like, oh, hey, yeah, you can stream your PlayStation 4 to your laptop.

555
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
No, I can't.

556
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It doesn't fucking work.

557
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
At all.

558
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Which makes no fucking sense because I'm on, like, wireless AC.

559
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
My laptop should be able to run that shit,

560
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and the router is literally fucking six feet away from me,

561
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
so there's no reason that that shouldn't work.

562
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I want to say I even tried a wired connection as well,

563
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and I don't think it's working either.

564
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I don't know why.

565
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
It could be because fucking Netflix is going,

566
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
and that shit's a network hog, so that could be it.

567
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But I would think that, you know, it does have Wi-Fi Direct for the PlayStation.

568
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I wish it could just connect directly to the PlayStation,

569
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
you know, cut out the whole middleman of the router and everything,

570
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
but whatever, I guess it's just not going to work,

571
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and I'm going to be stuck with my computer full of, like,

572
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
oh, by the way, I did surpass 500 games in my Steam library now,

573
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
so I have nothing to play.

574
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I literally have nothing to play.

575
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
There should be a video game called I Have Nothing to Play.

576
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It's on Steam for 99%

577
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah, it's like I was looking through my Steam library,

578
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
like, I don't know what any of this is,

579
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
but I'm going to buy some more.

580
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Because it's cheap.

581
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I got, like, there was a bundle with Skullgirls in it for, like, $3.99,

582
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and then something else that was, like, on the same page for $2.99.

583
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm like, oh, Surya Being Hunted was in another one that was, like, $2.99.

584
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I'm like, eh, six bucks for, like, 20 games?

585
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I can't beat that.

586
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
That's pretty good.

587
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So I bought it and probably won't play them ever.

588
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
All right.

589
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Fair enough.

590
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And I keep going through these stupid, like, PlayStation sales.

591
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's getting as bad as, like, Steam now, and it's like, ooh, that's $5.99.

592
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Maybe I will just pick up a copy of Knack.

593
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
No.

594
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
MegaManX400 in our chat says, Loki is a digital hoarder.

595
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yes.

596
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I am a digital hoarder, yes.

597
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
At least you admit it.

598
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I am.

599
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
All right, anything else for your gaming week?

600
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
That's it.

601
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
My gaming week.

602
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Honestly, a lot of the same types of stuff.

603
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I mean, I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Go,

604
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
and because of that, my interest in the main Pokemon games is kind of back.

605
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'm still playing Pokemon Alpha Sapphire,

606
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
making my way through that.

607
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And so I played a little more of that this week.

608
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And I've been playing Overwatch, which has been fun.

609
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm challenging myself to try new characters,

610
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and I actually have found that I love playing Pharah.

611
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And that was something, like, when the game first came out,

612
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I couldn't really get into, and all I could play was support characters,

613
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
like Lucio and Symmetra.

614
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
But I love playing Pharah, because she flies, and she has a rocket launcher,

615
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
and who doesn't love a rocket launcher?

616
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
So I'm having a lot of fun playing her.

617
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Even though her ultimate leaves her so vulnerable,

618
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
it is so frustrating sometimes.

619
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
But that's been fun.

620
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I've been playing a little bit with Allen.

621
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I've been playing with one of our listeners,

622
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
who has done some of the artwork for some of the other shows,

623
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Codeman.

624
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
He's a pretty good Junkrat.

625
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
He got to play the game with Junkrat, and he plays D.Va.

626
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I mean, it's easy to get to play the game as Junkrat, though.

627
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But he plays a good D.Va.

628
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So when we team up, we actually tend to win a lot of games.

629
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So I do Pharah, or I might heal.

630
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So I've been playing a little bit of that.

631
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That's been a lot of fun.

632
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
There's only really been one new game that I've played this week,

633
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and it is a free game with gold game that came out on Xbox One,

634
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
because those games flip out, what, on the 1st and the 15th, right?

635
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So the new games came out on, I think, July 16th is when it came out.

636
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
The game is called Tumblestone that's out on the Xbox One,

637
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and I think regularly this game would cost you $20,

638
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
but now it is free with games with gold.

639
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And if I had paid $20 for this game, I would have been so fucking mad,

640
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
because it's something that's like an iPhone game

641
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
that's kind of put on the Xbox One.

642
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It's a puzzle game.

643
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Basically, you have a well of falling bricks,

644
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and you want to just move back and forth to catch.

645
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I guess it's kind of like magical drop.

646
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You want to catch, like, three in a row,

647
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
but you don't necessarily have to throw them back up.

648
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It's just that you pull them down in three in a row.

649
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But the way the well is designed, sometimes you may screw yourself over

650
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
so that if you pull the wrong three bricks down,

651
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
you can't pull three more bricks down at the same color,

652
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
and you're going to instantly lose.

653
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So, okay, from a puzzle game aspect, I guess that's a decent concept,

654
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
but all you get in the games with gold is the story mode.

655
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And I kind of have an issue with this,

656
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
because I think it's a little shady for Microsoft to release this under games with gold,

657
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
because all you get is the story mode of the game,

658
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
which, okay, fine, it's competent for a puzzle game, little story mode.

659
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I mean, the graphics are what you would see on an iPad or iPhone or Google game.

660
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
But, all right.

661
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But if you want to do the marathon or arcade mode or whatever,

662
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
you have to buy the arcade DLC expansion, which is $4.99.

663
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay, look, that's not really a...

664
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I'm sorry, it's not really much of a free game,

665
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
it kind of is more like a really enhanced demo.

666
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Granted, there is a multiplayer mode.

667
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I have not been able to explore much of that.

668
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
That is included in the game, so I should mention that.

669
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I don't know if you will find anyone else to play this game with.

670
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Maybe Rando's on Xbox Live, but I just don't think the game is that compelling.

671
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I've played far better puzzler games in my life,

672
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
one of them being Magical Drop, which is on Steam.

673
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
What, Magical Drop 5 or something is on Steam.

674
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I would rather be playing that. Sorry.

675
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I'm sure people worked hard on this game, but it's not...

676
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I guess it might work better as a Go game.

677
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I might play this on my iPhone or my iPad.

678
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I mean, it is a competent enough puzzler in that regard,

679
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
but I was just a little irritated with the fact that

680
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
you don't really get the full game with the games with gold.

681
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So I'm calling you out, Microsoft.

682
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That is a shady release on games with gold.

683
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I kind of don't think enough people are actually going to bother

684
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
to check out that game to realize what is happening,

685
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
because Tron also came out, and there's probably more people

686
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
that are curious on picking that game up and seeing what they missed.

687
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But I don't think it's really worth your time.

688
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Brad from Paw Culture says,

689
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Sky, it's a free game. No reason to complain.

690
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Is it, though? Because I do have to be a paying gold subscriber

691
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
and maintain that subscription to play it.

692
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
To play Devil's Advocate, though,

693
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
maybe that's just how they have their normal game set up.

694
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It's not like that they did this just because it's going free and,

695
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
hey, we need to get some more money out of you.

696
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It's just the developer is just stupid,

697
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and they decided that this is what they want to cordon off

698
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
with another piece of DLC, which I think for that type of game,

699
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
20 bucks being the entry point, that's kind of dumb.

700
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I see your point, Brad. I acknowledge your point.

701
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But at the same time, I just look at this and I go,

702
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
this is just a poor release.

703
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Yeah, it's free, but when you are competing against the PlayStation Plus games,

704
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
you still have to make sure that the games are of a quality level

705
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
to make it worth it because not a lot of people are necessarily

706
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
going to subscribe to both.

707
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Breakman in Chat says,

708
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I downloaded this game. Should I just delete it, Sky?

709
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I guess play it once to see for yourself if you already downloaded it,

710
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
but you will probably end up deleting it.

711
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So, there it is.

712
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
All right.

713
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm scrolling back up in chat.

714
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
AkumaJP says, Sky is rubbing it into us Japanese

715
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
because we don't have Pokemon Go yet.

716
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I'm sorry, AkumaJP, but the reality is,

717
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
every time they launch a game in a new country, it crashes.

718
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
They released in Canada today, it crashed.

719
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Canada apologized for that. I'm just kidding.

720
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But in all seriousness, every time they release a game,

721
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Did you see the tweet from the guy that's like the head of Amazon,

722
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
the web services or whatever?

723
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah, who's like offered to help.

724
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
You might want to take advantage of that, but here's the thing.

725
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
They know it's going to be, look, Ingress was already big in Japan.

726
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So, Pokemon Go really, it's going to be, let me put it this way,

727
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
it will be really weird if Pokemon Go isn't successful in Japan.

728
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I mean, I suppose that could always happen,

729
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
but I fully anticipate Pokemon Go is going to be fucking huge in Japan

730
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
just like it is everywhere else.

731
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So, they kind of need the servers to stabilize everywhere else

732
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
before they give it to Japan because Japan will break the game.

733
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Love you guys, and I do think you should be able to play,

734
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
and I know it's got to be super frustrating to see all these other people playing.

735
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I mean, even for those 12 hours when Australia was in and we weren't in,

736
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
it was very frustrating, and for Japan, it's been going on for weeks.

737
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But, it will break when it's released in Japan,

738
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and it's just going to be frustrating for everybody.

739
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So, there is that. Anyhow.

740
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Alright, that's all I wanted to say about my gaming week.

741
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So, let's move on. Just some quick housekeeping.

742
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Please follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

743
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
We are also on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,

744
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
and we will not be here Labor Day weekend because I will be at Dragon Con.

745
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
That is, as far as the calendar for conventions and things for the rest of the year,

746
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I will be at Dragon Con, I will be at Gamer X4,

747
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
and I will be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest.

748
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
That's my plans for the rest of the year.

749
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I'm not thinking I will show up at any other cons,

750
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
but you never say never.

751
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I am starting to think, do I want to go to one day of Twitch Con again,

752
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
even though it's in San Diego?

753
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I am toying with that idea. We'll see.

754
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
And then there's the PlayStation experience, especially if they do it in San Diego.

755
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Sorry, not San Diego. If they do it in San Francisco again,

756
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I kind of think I have to go.

757
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And Shane is also talking about Pokemon Worlds,

758
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
which I may drop in for a day, so we'll see.

759
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Which one was in San Diego?

760
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Twitch Con.

761
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
If Twitch Con is not in San Diego, I meant San Francisco. That's what I meant.

762
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yeah, maybe PlayStation Experience again.

763
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I don't know, because last time they had it in Vegas,

764
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
but the year before they had it in San Francisco, so we'll see.

765
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
If it's in San Francisco, I might go to that, so just let me know.

766
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Yeah, we'll see.

767
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Anyway, let's see.

768
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And JD says, I mean, there is a RuPaul's Drag Con in response to what Stoppy said.

769
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
When Sky says Drag and Con, I hear Drag and Con.

770
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I do want to go to Drag Con next year.

771
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Drag Con would be fun, but it's one of those things where it's like,

772
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I have to pick and choose the cons at some point.

773
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I can't go to everything. I don't have that type of limited budget.

774
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
He has to weigh the pros and cons, if you will.

775
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Get out.

776
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
If I were a Twitch celebrity and could have conventions throwing money at me to attend,

777
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
this wouldn't be a pick and choose situation.

778
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I was at Disneyland the weekend before Drag Con, so I could just make that my birthday present.

779
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
There you go.

780
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

781
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It's been a bit of a slower week, but we do have some things to discuss.

782
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
We'll get to your calls later as well.

783
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Loki, what do you have for us?

784
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Alright, so there's some Neo rumors that are coming out.

785
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
These are actually stuff that's been out for a while now,

786
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
because I want to say that the original specs rumors and everything came from this document,

787
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
but the document actually hadn't been released or leaked out there.

788
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It was just somebody relaying the information that was on it before.

789
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It's just basically a lot of the same information we've heard so far,

790
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
that what they've said is basically the device is going to be coexisting with the PlayStation 4.

791
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It's going to have the same application, same online community, stores, etc.

792
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
They're seeing the output, the 4K is going to be included to it.

793
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Spec-wise, it's 2.1 gigahertz or 1.3 times faster.

794
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:53,000
36 CU's at 911 megahertz for the GPU, so that's about 2.3 times faster.

795
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And then a little bit higher memory bandwidth, 218 gigabytes per second,

796
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
which is about a one and a quarter improvement.

797
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And it's going to share the same hard drive and that type of stuff.

798
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Also, they're basically saying that the games are going to have this Neo mode available to them,

799
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:18,000
so the games that are supporting that will run a little bit better on the Neo versus the actual PlayStation 4.

800
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:25,000
And basically talking about some of the software development kit upgrades and stuff that are going to be coming down the pipeline as well.

801
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,000
There's not really a whole lot to gain from this.

802
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Basically just a lot of the same information we've heard already.

803
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It's supposed to be out around the same time as the PlayStation VR, possibly, so we'll see.

804
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I know it's a rumor, but everything in that presentation certainly seems plausible.

805
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
They really are stressing that the games have to run on the PlayStation 4 as well,

806
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
and this is just something to get improved frame rate, upscaling the games to look a little better,

807
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
but it's not like it's going to have this drastic look and feel or anything like that, which is expected.

808
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
If I don't have a 4K TV, then why would I want this?

809
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I just don't understand.

810
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
And don't get me wrong, there are people that want high-end systems and stuff,

811
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:25,000
but what's exactly going to be the price point of this, and is there really a wide saturation of 4K TVs out right now?

812
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I mean, granted, maybe in the future, in a couple of years, it might be a little bit more widespread,

813
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,000
but I think with 4K, it seems like maybe not so much on the PC side because people want higher resolutions,

814
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
but I don't even think graphics cards can use 4K right now and keep a decent frame rate.

815
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I think it just seems like a repeat of the whole 3D thing again, where they're pushing the 3D TVs.

816
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I just don't know if it's going to be a thing.

817
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I mean, eventually we'll get there, but there's not a lot of content for it, the price point's really high,

818
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and there's not a lot of software that's going to utilize it,

819
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
and I really have a hard time believing that these systems are going to pump out games

820
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
with frame rates that are comparable to their PlayStation 4 counterparts with 4K.

821
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Even if the high-end video cards now can't do that, this ain't going to do that.

822
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
My only concern is the PlayStation VR thing, because we've talked about it before,

823
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
where it's like, oh, maybe the PlayStation VR will be even better with this,

824
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and I really hope the experience on the PlayStation 4 VR as it is is fine.

825
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Is that what they're demoing at Best Buy is the current PlayStation?

826
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Do we see a current PlayStation out?

827
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I think it's either that or a dev kit.

828
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
See, if it's a dev kit, could it be a Neo? I guess they wouldn't put those out in the wild.

829
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
No, I don't think so.

830
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
They'd be fools to do that.

831
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I think it's probably the actual system.

832
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I have the pre-order in for the VR, but I'm kind of going back on the fence again with them.

833
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You know, Res sounds cool and everything, but is it $400 cool? That's the thing.

834
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Well, yeah.

835
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:16,000
But with that, though, $400, would it be more advantageous for me to just upgrade,

836
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
buy a new computer system and get an actual VR, like a Vive or something like that?

837
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
That might be a better experience overall.

838
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Yeah, I'll miss out on Res, but come on.

839
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I've played Res already, so it's not like it's going to be a huge improvement.

840
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But you've never played Res like this.

841
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You know, I just, I don't know.

842
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
They're going to have it in non-VR too, so you'll be able to play, I don't know, a slightly updated version of it.

843
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But it's like, maybe give it some more time.

844
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Well, we'll see. I mean, you know, they're going to unveil this at some point,

845
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
and they're really going to have to sell the reasons why we're going to spend money on it.

846
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
It's going to have to be soon, like I think at Gamescom or something.

847
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Yeah, you think we'll see.

848
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Well, many folks in chat are talking about how Star Trek, I see that in chat, but that's about something else.

849
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Many people in chat are talking about Street Fighter V and how that is actually showing on EVO right now on ESPN2.

850
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
But there's, you know, and that's a great thing for the, you know, exposure of the game and so forth.

851
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But not all the news about Street Fighter V this week has necessarily been well received.

852
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,000
There is a new PlayStation Store listing that is offering up a new Street Fighter V bundle.

853
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:37,000
It's a DLC bundle called the CPT Premier Package, or the Capcom Pro Tour Premier Package.

854
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It will include costumes for Chun-Li and Cammy, a mystery CPT costume.

855
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
There will be a new color pack for all of the 2016 characters.

856
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And there will be new titles, including Capcom Cup 2016 and Capcom Pro Tour 2016.

857
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And a new stage called the Ring of Destiny for $25 is how much that DLC is going to cost, $24.99.

858
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Going back to the old, like, $5 a character nonsense.

859
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Now, apparently, some of this money is to fund, I guess, the prize pool for the Capcom Pro Tour.

860
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I guess it's the whole thing that's some of the defense I've been reading about it.

861
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But, uh...

862
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
No, that's not a defense.

863
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Yeah, I'm kind of like, you kind of need to pony up your own damn money and not ask me for that.

864
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
No one asks you to do this fucking tour.

865
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And actually, it's also been called out, it's just a portion of the proceeds is going to that.

866
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Not necessarily, I'm sorry, $25.

867
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And it's not part of the season pass or whatever that they've sold for this before.

868
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I don't know a nice way to say this, but Capcom is fucking this game with the horrible DLC stuff.

869
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And, you know, the fact that the story mode wasn't in the game when it launched was really a screw up.

870
01:09:51,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And yes, look, I've heard all the defense about, well, you know, they wanted to get it out so that it was available for the fighting game circuit and all that stuff.

871
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And I'm telling you, to catch on with a wider audience, which it needs to do in order to be successful,

872
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
that was a bad decision. It was a very bad decision.

873
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
The fighting tour thing could have waited another year, in my opinion.

874
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Maybe people who follow that scene more closely or participate in that scene would strongly disagree.

875
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
But I kind of think Street Fighter V has shot itself in the foot as a result.

876
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And this really doesn't help the situation.

877
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Are the Street Fighter odd number games just cursed?

878
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Is this a Star Trek? Maybe that was a Freudian slip at the beginning there.

879
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Is this like a Star Trek thing where the even numbered ones are good and the odd numbered ones...

880
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Who knows?

881
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Because that's what I'm starting to think.

882
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Anyhow, next story.

883
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Well, I'm sure everyone has seen this thing going around.

884
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I've been calling it the Chibi Nintendo.

885
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:09,000
They're putting out a Nintendo Entertainment System that is small enough to fit easily in the palm of your hand.

886
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
It has a controller.

887
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And it comes with 30 games loaded on it.

888
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Dan and I both thought that the game list was kind of odd.

889
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Just because there are some definite licenses on there.

890
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:34,000
That I don't know if it's maybe that they still have distribution licenses for those particular titles or what.

891
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But it's supposed to be out on November 11th for a suggested retail of $59.99.

892
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I'm totally going to have like five of them.

893
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Well no, I actually just want one to put on my desk to be a cute Nintendo to be on my desk.

894
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Oh, you're going to buy a $60 paperweight.

895
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Yeah, why not?

896
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I love it.

897
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I have a whole room full of expensive paperweights.

898
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
They're called all of my other consoles.

899
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Yeah, I guess I can't talk.

900
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I have a Mega Yarn Yoshi and it's not much cheaper than $60.

901
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
What does it do?

902
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It just sits there and looks pretty.

903
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
It has the functionality of a paperweight.

904
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Shut up.

905
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Well, some of the games that are going to be on the list.

906
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Of course, we have The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, and Kirby's Adventure.

907
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Of course, Super Mario Brothers.

908
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Some of the other ones that struck me as a bit odd.

909
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
You've got some Capcom licenses.

910
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
You have Mega Man 2 and you have Ghosts and Goblins.

911
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You've also got some Konami licenses like Castlevania and Castlevania 2.

912
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
You've also got Super C.

913
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Actually, Zelda 2 is on there as well.

914
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Tecmo Bowl.

915
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
We also have Star Tropics, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber.

916
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So, Galaga is on the list too.

917
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
This is the thing that I also think is cool.

918
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
You get the NES Classic Controller.

919
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You can buy a second one for $10.

920
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
You can also connect it to a Wii Remote.

921
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
You can use it to play Virtual Console NES games on a Wii U or Wii.

922
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
That's a little bit of extra incentive just to get the controllers.

923
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
So, take it what you will, but I think that's pretty cool news.

924
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
That is pretty cool.

925
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I did not realize that whole controller functionality.

926
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
That's pretty cool.

927
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I do like that.

928
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I don't know.

929
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I'm on the fence with this.

930
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
When I first heard about it, I admit I wrote a tweet that was like,

931
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
why do I want this?

932
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I have a Wii U and I bought half these games already on Virtual Console.

933
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I don't understand why I would want this.

934
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
But the more I'm thinking about it, there's a couple things with it.

935
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
A, it is a pretty solid lineup of games.

936
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I find it really weird that Nintendo has pretty much come out and even said

937
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
they're not going to expand on it, which seems like a lost opportunity.

938
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Exactly.

939
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Why is there no store interface to purchase NES Virtual Console games?

940
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
With storage on there, I mean.

941
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
But, here's the other thing that is starting to sway me a little bit.

942
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Loki, what's one of the biggest sayings we always say on this show?

943
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Hackers gonna hack.

944
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Right.

945
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Right.

946
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So this thing is not going to be limited to just 30 games.

947
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Nope.

948
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Let me tell you.

949
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Not in the least.

950
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Well, the other thing I do want to point out is that the games that are on it

951
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
are going to have multiple suspend points, so you don't need to use your passwords.

952
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
You can just save your game and walk off.

953
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Which Virtual Console will do, to be fair.

954
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Now, I will tell you this.

955
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You know what I would like?

956
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Is the ability. I mean, actually, not just the ability.

957
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I would like for all of the games that had been disc-based to have the disc emulation in it.

958
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Yes.

959
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
So that we get, like, the...

960
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
The extra soundtrack and everything.

961
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Exactly.

962
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Heck yeah.

963
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I mean, I don't know.

964
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
There's a comparison out there.

965
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Like, the difference in The Legend of Zelda music, for example.

966
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It's pretty night and day.

967
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
For people who haven't...

968
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yeah, if you don't mind looking for it real quick.

969
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:16,000
For people who haven't heard the Famicom disc versus the cartridge versions,

970
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
it really is pretty different.

971
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It's sort of like what the Master System music sounded like with the FM chip.

972
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Okay, I think this is one...

973
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Again, I'm going into these videos blind, which I don't like to do here on OLR, but...

974
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Oh, you appreciate your running the risk for it.

975
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Let's see what happens.

976
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I don't know if this is just somebody talking about it.

977
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Let me see.

978
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Oh, no, that's the opening on the Famicom.

979
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Yeah, you can definitely hear subtle differences in that, right?

980
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
It sounds more harpsichord-y.

981
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Let me see if I can find some other examples there from Zelda.

982
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Let's see, there's Final Dungeon.

983
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Metroid was also...

984
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Let me see if I can find the Metroid one, because Metroid is pretty cool, too.

985
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yeah, but that would be my hope.

986
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I mean, probably not going to do it that way, but it's absolutely what I would want.

987
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Let's see, here's Metroid on...

988
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Familiar.

989
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You can hear subtle differences.

990
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
When you get into the actual melody after this.

991
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Let me turn this down a little bit. Sorry, guys, a little loud.

992
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Let me see, I'm going to skip ahead a little bit.

993
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I mean, but there's not a lot of instruments in this.

994
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It's subtle.

995
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Let me... I can definitely hear subtleties.

996
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Let me go to a different song here.

997
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Honestly, this one sounds very similar.

998
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
That one sounds exactly the same, I gotta be honest.

999
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
But the biggest one, though, that I knew off the top of my head was Zelda.

1000
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Yeah, Zelda definitely had the...

1001
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Fifth Dream says play Kraid. Let me look.

1002
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Yeah, Kraid I know was different.

1003
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
343, let's try this.

1004
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Let me just skip ahead a little bit.

1005
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
It sounds very familiar.

1006
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I don't know if Metroid's the best example.

1007
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
But Zelda definitely is.

1008
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Yeah.

1009
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
So, um, but anyway.

1010
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Yeah, definitely the Zelda one, I definitely, definitely heard it.

1011
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
But I would love if it had the Famicon disc music.

1012
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I know, didn't Castlevania or...

1013
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah, Castlevania 3, I think, had some...

1014
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Definitely had some different music to it.

1015
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Let me see if I can quickly find, um...

1016
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Oh, you can even hear just, like, the subtle and the triangulation.

1017
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It doesn't sound exactly the same.

1018
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Yeah.

1019
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah, you can definitely hear it in the...

1020
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
This one.

1021
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Anyway.

1022
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
A little bit of Famicon disc history there, if you didn't know that.

1023
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It had the extra sound on it.

1024
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Cool.

1025
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Totally worth it.

1026
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah, that would be cool if we could get some of that emulation.

1027
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Even if it's just a little Easter egg or something like that.

1028
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
But I'm guessing that's not going to be part of it.

1029
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Anyway.

1030
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
But I think I probably will end up getting one.

1031
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com

1032
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Brad from Pop Culture says...

1033
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I was thinking of Castlevania 2, by the way.

1034
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I thought that... I know one of them was on, um, disc.

1035
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Uh, Brad from Pop Culture says,

1036
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Sky, because it's cute!

1037
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yeah, probably it would have to be part of the reason I would have to get it.

1038
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Darktusuya is pointing out, with Virtual Console, they give you one restore point.

1039
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
This one sounds like it will have more than one.

1040
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
So that's pretty cool.

1041
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Stoppy said they tease that there could be filter options and that sort of stuff.

1042
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
So maybe there is the chance they'll include extra sound effects.

1043
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
So, who knows. We'll see.

1044
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Anyway, let's move on with some more news. Loki.

1045
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It would be kind of cool if they did it with a Game Boy one.

1046
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Kind of like a portable system that's a Game Boy with 30 games built in.

1047
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Well, if this does well, I'm sure it's just a matter of time before the Super Nintendo one comes out.

1048
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Or a Game Boy one comes out.

1049
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:42,000
And I gotta say, it is a pretty clever way for Nintendo to still bring in some money this holiday season when the NX ain't happening.

1050
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So, you know, props to Nintendo for figuring out how to make a quick buck when the NX didn't happen this year.

1051
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I mean, it's not going to be as much money as the NX, but she said she'd buy five.

1052
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It's going to be funny when this outsells the NX.

1053
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Shut up.

1054
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
At least it'll outsell the Wii U or something.

1055
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So speaking of the little system, you know, there's a lot of people that are interested in it.

1056
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Including, you know, some people that may have worked out of their game companies.

1057
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Like, for example, Phil Spencer of Xbox thinks it's absolutely a great idea to have this system and, you know, retro hardware is a cool way to do it.

1058
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And that's his opinion on it. That's all I've got.

1059
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Well, you know what's interesting about that whole thing, though, is that Microsoft not that long ago put out the Rare Replay, which was 30 classic games, for 60 bucks.

1060
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So, and when I, it's funny enough, because kind of reading that and putting it into perspective actually kind of made me go, okay, maybe, maybe this is something I could just carelessly drop the money on.

1061
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Because I did buy that Rare Replay thing, and it isn't even a cute little thing.

1062
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
At the very least, you get the classic controller that you can go and play your, you know, NES games in.

1063
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
That's true. I didn't realize that at first. I didn't realize that.

1064
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And if you want an additional one, it's only 10 bucks, so.

1065
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I'll probably end up getting one, because I'm a consumer whore. So, there it is, going back on my tweet.

1066
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I kind of want one, but then again, I can't have access to the TV, so I don't know how well that's going to end up working.

1067
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Well, with an HDMI cable, you can hook it up to a computer monitor.

1068
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Yeah, I really wish that my laptop, and pretty much any laptop that are out there, had the ability to switch to an external video source.

1069
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Because that'd be so goddamn convenient. Like, hey, I want to run a video in from my Playstation to my laptop screen. Boom, there, it's done.

1070
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
That'd be awesome. But, no, they don't have that.

1071
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Well, I'm thinking I'll probably end up getting one, and I think even the perspective on Microsoft and Rear Replay maybe even sold me on that. Who knows?

1072
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Switching gears here a little bit, World of Warcraft, back in the news again, all these years later. You know, that game's been out quite a while.

1073
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
There's a new expansion for World of Warcraft on the horizon. Legion is out, what, the end of August? Right, Darcyn? Or you can play more?

1074
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Yeah, I need to, I've actually kind of slacked off on my World of Warcraft, but I need to put in my order.

1075
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I think I will be coming back to WoW in anticipation of Legion, just because I have to check it out. But, here's where I'm torn.

1076
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:15,000
You know I'm still playing Final Fantasy XIV, and they have a mini patch this week, but it's something I've really been looking forward to, and it's called the Deep Dungeon.

1077
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:26,000
And I'm really looking forward to that. So, I think it really just depends how much I enjoy that feature will dictate when I come back to WoW, sooner rather than later or later. So, we'll see.

1078
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Anyway, but speaking of World of Warcraft, they are going to be testing a new silence penalty, which honestly sounds like something they could have used about ten years ago, but better late than never, I suppose.

1079
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:48,000
So, here's the deal. Blizzard's going to implement a new silence penalty that will punish users with multiple reports of chat abuse or posting spam.

1080
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:57,000
If an investigation by the team finds that the complaints are valid, there's going to be an account-wide silence penalty. They can't just roll into the character and get around it.

1081
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:11,000
You will get a notification when you try to send a message in a channel where you're restricted. The silenced player will have limited chat functionality with others in WoW, but you will not be able to talk in instant chat, including Battlegrounds.

1082
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:27,000
You can't coordinate with people in Battlegrounds anymore if you get silenced. You can't talk in global channels. You can't create calendar invites, send in-game mail, party invitations, war game invitations, duel invitations, and you can't update a premade group listing or create a new one.

1083
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So, it sounds like you can join others, but you can't create your own. If you get a silence penalty, you can still whisper your friends and receive whispers from people not on your friends list, but that is that.

1084
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:49,000
That is going to be included in the pre-expansion patch for Legion. I think what I heard is that the silence penalty starts at 24 hours, the first defense, and doubles each time you get a new one.

1085
01:23:49,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So, it will double to 48, then it doubles to 96, then it doubles to 190. It keeps doubling and doubling and doubling, so if you don't shut the fuck up, you're going to be silenced for a very long time.

1086
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And again, this game needed that about 10 years ago, but better late than never. I'll be curious to see if they can actually police a lot of that silence stuff, or if it's going to be a very automated thing. We'll know.

1087
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:38,000
SSG100Matt asking in chat, do we know if this expansion will be the last one? Probably not. They released, what, like 20 expansions for EverQuest, and EverQuest never had an audience as big as World of Warcraft, so I don't see why they won't continue to keep releasing expansions for World of Warcraft.

1088
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:48,000
They probably even need to be doing them a little faster, but we'll see. Alright, moving on. Let's get to another story here from Dark Soccer, and then we'll get to release dates.

1089
01:24:49,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Well, kind of not yet classic, but a good game, is Dead Rising. You know, basically Night of the Living Dead, the game, pretty much.

1090
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So anyway, the game is being re-released on PS4. They found it by finding the trophy list available, so it was confirmed that Dead Rising 4 is going to be for Playstation 4.

1091
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Which is also notable that the original was an exclusive to Xbox 360, so this is the first time you're going to see this game on that system. So, pretty cool stuff right there.

1092
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:51,000
And of course, we're going to have another Dead Rising game that's going to be coming out later for a limited exclusive on Xbox One, with the PS4 release coming afterwards. So, good stuff.

1093
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:00,000
That's kind of fun to have this be good all over again. It also reminds us that the first game was the best game in the series, in my opinion.

1094
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:09,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase KISS.

1095
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, and some things that are coming a little sooner than this Dead Rising release, or even Dead Rising 4. What's coming out this week in the US, Logie?

1096
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Not a whole lot, to be honest. This week we've got 10 Second Ninja X on PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Vita.

1097
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:39,000
We have I Am Setsuna on PC and Playstation 4. The Assembly on PC, and then also VR platforms, the Rift and the Vive.

1098
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:52,000
And that's about it. Oh, actually, no, I am sorry. There's also the Friday releases. Human Fall Flat on PC, and Starbound is coming to PC, Mac, and Linux.

1099
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Alright, traveling to Japan. In Japan, from Compile Heart on the Playstation 4, Kurobara no Valkyrie is coming out in a regular and limited edition on July 21st.

1100
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So, I'm sure there will be some folks that are into that. Also, on the Wii U, no release. Actually, Wii U is really a tumbleweed. I don't think there's anything to report in Japan on that system for a while.

1101
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:29,000
But on the Playstation Vita, you have Ys VIII. Lacrimosa of Dana comes out this week in regular and premium. Who knew that this game was still fucking going, but it is.

1102
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Ys VIII is out on the Playstation Vita this week, as well as Gendai Daisenryaku 2016 comes out this week.

1103
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And Shinshaku Suryugi no Machi no Ihujin Kuro no Kayuden comes out. It's some type of novel bundle set, so I think you get the game and a visual novel with this.

1104
01:27:50,000 --> 01:28:01,000
So that's, I guess, kind of cool. And then lastly, on the 3DS this week, just one game. Sumiko Gurashimura wo Sukurun desu comes out this week.

1105
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And I'm not sure what that is. It kind of looks like a cute little animal farm sim type game, but all the art is in the same style as the cat butt game on iPhone.

1106
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
What the hell is that game called? Neko Atsume? Cat butt game?

1107
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Neko Atsume. Cat collector. This looks like that, but a farming game. It looks really adorable. Look at this box art. Doesn't that look cute?

1108
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Kitties! Well they're not all kitties, that one's a penguin. I don't care, kitties. It's a fat penguin eating a pickle. It's me.

1109
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Oh my god, Rob. Are you a fat penguin eating a pickle? I think that is, when somebody asks you what is your spirit animal, I'm just going to point to this box art and be like, it's me.

1110
01:28:46,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Aww. So there it is. How about the UK? In the UK, just stuff on the 20th, which is Zombie Knight Terror. And that's pretty much it.

1111
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Guess it's a slow week. Just a couple more stories for you guys. Yep. And then the classic. Sorry, we've got Pokemon to play.

1112
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,000
They're a little busy with that right now. Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

1113
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:34,000
So, Valve has finally responded to the whole controversy with this Counter-Strike GO gambling nonsense. And so there's actually a response from Eric Johnson of Valve, basically saying, you know, in 2011 they added the feature that now enabled people to be able to train in-game items.

1114
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Since a number of gambling sites are using this Steam trading system, and there's been some false assumptions about our involvement with these sites, we'd like to clarify we have no business relationships with any of these sites.

1115
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:53,000
We have never received any revenue from them, and Steam does not have a system for turning in-game items into real world currency.

1116
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:13,000
And basically saying that these sites have basically pieced together the operations in a two-part fashion. First, they're using the OpenID API, and then second, you're basically creating automated Steam accounts that make web calls as individual Steam users.

1117
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And then, along with that, basically saying that, you know, they're going to start striking down on these. They're going to send, you know, basically cease and desist to these sites to kind of curve this thing.

1118
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Basically, you know, saying that, you know, using this system for that purpose is not going to be tolerated.

1119
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
So, neat. We'll see some sort of response from them, I'm thinking.

1120
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah, I think Valve was under a lot of pressure to give her an official response to the situation. I'm kind of glad they're really kind of putting out their low tolerance. I don't say zero tolerance, but very low tolerance for this.

1121
01:30:51,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Stoppy in chat says, I wish YouTube would respond to the CSGO controversy now. That's funny. A human at YouTube. That's good.

1122
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:10,000
No, look, I get your frustration. I really do. I'm not laughing at you. It's just that I echo the frustration of YouTube doesn't seem to have live human beings that work at it.

1123
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
That's the perception I have, anyway.

1124
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Hey, let's talk about Final Fantasy XV, because I know I'm looking forward to Final Fantasy XV. It's not that far away at this point. It's really what? It's less than three months at this point? Getting there?

1125
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Yeah, it's on the 19th of September, I think.

1126
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:46,000
September, so yeah, wow. We're getting there. Anyhow, apparently there were rumors circulating in the past that Final Fantasy XV would be coming out for the NX. However, the director of Final Fantasy XV, Hajime Tabata, has said that they are not considering an NX version of the game.

1127
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Not surprised.

1128
01:31:48,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Yeah, but they're not hating on NX. They did say they have high expectations for NX, and they're looking forward to the upcoming Zelda game and all that good stuff, but they did not indicate that Final Fantasy XV would come out for NX.

1129
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Which, honestly, if the NX is going to be months after XV comes out, I honestly think that's a good thing. What was the Wii U's biggest problem? All the launch games were things that had fucking come out like six months prior.

1130
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:32,000
On top of that, though, I have a suspicion that the specs of the NX are still kind of up in the air. I don't think that they know what the specs are on this thing, so how do you develop for a platform that you're not really sure what the specs are going to be?

1131
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I mean, I guess that's kind of how you do that for new platforms, but at least they have some sort of target. With Nintendo and some of the comments that I'm hearing, how they're like, oh, we're now considering VR and stuff. Do they really have an idea of what this is going to be? Is that why it hasn't been revealed yet? Because it's like, fuck, we don't have, we don't know what, I don't know, it could be an SNES mini inside that thing.

1132
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And an interesting, speaking of games coming out for the NX, just a very interesting tweet. Somebody had tweeted at Dennis Dyack, who, you know, he's kind of out there commenting on things sometimes, but he's the CCO at Quantum Entanglement Entertainment, and somebody had actually asked him, like, hey, I loved that game, it was awesome. Speaking of Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes HD, could it get remade for Nintendo NX because the GameCube was in HD?

1133
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And Dennis Dyack responded, thanks for the kind words. If the demand is high enough, I'm sure something could be done, which I'm sure a change.org petition has probably already been made, thanks to that tweet. But to be fair, and you know, no disrespect to Dennis, but that is really the canned answer you give a fan who's asking if X game will end up on Y platform. Well, if there's enough demand for it, I suppose anything's possible. That is, that is the very generic canned, polite response.

1134
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Fuck, no, you're not getting shit.

1135
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I don't care if you like it, I don't fucking like you.

1136
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
You get fucking nothing.

1137
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I think we need a new segment on this show in the near future where Loki translates politically correct tweets.

1138
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
No comment.

1139
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Shit.

1140
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
We don't comment, we don't comment about our business, our rumors and speculation. Ah, fuck, they found out.

1141
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Please look forward to it. Buy our games, really.

1142
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I think, I think on a future episode that's going to be a segment, Loki translates politically correct tweets. What do you guys think?

1143
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Loki speaks PR.

1144
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Yeah, Loki speaks PR.

1145
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Loki speaks PR.

1146
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I vote for it.

1147
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Alright.

1148
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Breakman in chat says Loki is the most politically correct person ever.

1149
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Dark Tetsuya says fund it. Does that mean we get to launch a Kickstarter for it?

1150
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Are you, are you saying Dark Tetsuya that we should start a Patreon and only if we get 20 a month will Loki translate the tweets?

1151
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
We should do a Patreon anyway.

1152
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
It's just going to be the Slurpee fund.

1153
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
It all is.

1154
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Your money will go to fund birthday cake Slurpees.

1155
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
God no.

1156
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
We're gonna, we're gonna have actual Slurpees that are delicious and not this birthday cake abomination guy.

1157
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Because if the people are like, you know, latching on the birth-

1158
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
If they give like $50 a month, Loki will be forced to like the birthday cake Slurpee.

1159
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
No, I won't. Thank God it's just for limited time. For their stupid anniversary.

1160
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I just like that stuff I got from Taco Bell.

1161
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Alright, anyhow.

1162
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
SSG100Matt says we're gonna make Slurpees great again.

1163
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
It's impossible. They're already great.

1164
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I mean, they're a little less great with the birthday cake flavor, but hey, you have options, so that's fine.

1165
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
You know what's great? It was banana Slurpees.

1166
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Okay, wait. Okay. Yes, I agree with you and that was the flavor I full on intended getting at 7-Eleven until I saw it had been replaced with a birthday cake.

1167
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Here's, okay Loki, here's the choice you have to make. You have to drink one. Will you drink the birthday cake Slurpee or the Diet Coke Slurpee?

1168
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
No, I don't think so. I don't even identify that as a Slurpee option.

1169
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
So, the birthday cake Slurpee in that scenario.

1170
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I guess. I don't know. That's tough.

1171
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
It's like, why Diet Coke Slurpee? That's just stupid.

1172
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I'm on a diet! I mean, come on. Come on.

1173
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Let's travel to a time when things were much simpler.

1174
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:35,000
You had Coke and Cherry. If you didn't like it, go fuck yourself. Those were your Slurpee options.

1175
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
If you were lucky, you could combine them.

1176
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:49,000
It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find the game that she thinks, hey, stop drinking your Slurpee, you're going to get the controller sticky.

1177
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Which invariably happened with this particular machine at my college.

1178
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Alright, so what is the classic game of the week?

1179
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Cyber Sled.

1180
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,000
No, not Cyber Slut. Rob. Geez, Rob, get your head out of the gutter.

1181
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Cyber Sled.

1182
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Cyber Sled. It came out in 1993, done by Numcle, and it was a two-player third-person shooter vehicle game where you played in hovering tanks.

1183
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:35,000
And basically, I'd even like to consider this as one of the big inspirations for one of my favorite series, which was Virtual On, where it's just a big arena two-player deathmatch.

1184
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,000
And you've got all kinds of obstacles to block your path and protect you from other people.

1185
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:54,000
And it is a pretty wide, expansive arena that you have as well, but you're also equipped with guns and missiles, and each of the different tanks have different strengths and weaknesses.

1186
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:08,000
You of course have one that's very heavily armed and armored, but slow. You have one that's got high armor, high firepower, but might be lacking in another thing.

1187
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:15,000
You've got the ones that are really fast, but weak armor and weak, you know, guns, that type of thing.

1188
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:30,000
So, this game, okay. When I started at the University of South Alabama in college, this was in our little dinky game room, and we played the shit out of this.

1189
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
This was the game of choice when someone else was on killer instinct.

1190
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:41,000
So, you also, the thing I liked is that you do have the twin stick controller.

1191
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:50,000
So, you also had a finger and thumb trigger on each of them for your bullets or for your missiles.

1192
01:38:51,000 --> 01:39:02,000
And the twin analog stick, I think, is a really good method of control for that, because it's really an instinctive type of play.

1193
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:11,000
But, you know, other things that you can do is you can get power ups in the game, like an improved radar, extra missiles, shield recharges.

1194
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:26,000
You can also, like I said, you can actually get certain obstacles and different things destroyed as well through other things in the game.

1195
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:35,000
The cabinet was, for the arcade version, was a dedicated sit down cabinet with a red side and a blue side.

1196
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:49,000
It had a seat for each player, and then you had just your view, which you could either change from cockpit to behind the machine.

1197
01:39:49,000 --> 01:40:07,000
It got, I wouldn't say very great ratings for not being very original, and definitely not being very impressive graphically, but it was a lot of fun to play.

1198
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:24,000
It was fast paced, and something that was really good for, I'd say, versus play. So, it definitely took a lot of my cash when I was in college, and cyber slut it is.

1199
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
And that's your game.

1200
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1201
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Before I forget, PlayStation release came out in Japan on January 27th, 1995, and in North America October 18th, 1995.

1202
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Cyber slut it is for the PlayStation 1.

1203
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1204
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Although, honestly, not as many news stories left, so we're going to get to things like the mailbag a little bit faster, and your calls, which hopefully there will be plenty of tonight.

1205
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:01,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

1206
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
We are going to take a quick break, however, we will be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1207
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 650 for this July the 17th of 2016, already in progress.

1208
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Episode 650, my gosh, and it looks like episode 666 may be a real possibility, and it's probably going to be around the holidays.

1209
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I think it might be around Thanksgiving, it's in November from what I can tell you.

1210
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Alright, well don't forget it gets bumped back, because I won't be here Dragon Con week, and inevitably we'll miss another week somewhere, you know, things happen.

1211
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:51,000
So I wouldn't doubt that we will have the Orange Lounge Radio Satanic Holiday Spectacular.

1212
01:41:53,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I'm not sure what happens during that, and I've got to be careful that we don't get too crazy and make people think we actually worship Satan, but we can have a lot of fun with it nonetheless.

1213
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
So we'll figure out what we're going to do, because I have no idea yet.

1214
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Again, I really just want Travis Donovan to record something for the show as DJ Satan, that is my one, that's my Christmas miracle, is what I'm requesting.

1215
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
So we'll see if I actually get that or not.

1216
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:32,000
But in all seriousness, 650, I don't know if there is a weekly podcast, I mean there's certainly daily or multi-weekly podcasts, even Critical Myth here on the VOG Network three times a week is way past that at this point.

1217
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:48,000
But I'm not sure if there is a weekly podcast out there that is as high as 650 episodes, and just, you know, it's really you guys to thank for that and all the support over the years and giving us that incentive to just keep us going.

1218
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And I'd also like to thank the wine that's powering my ramblings tonight. Thank you very much. And the Norco that's powering Jamie's thoughts.

1219
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
And the Patreon can go towards the wine account too, you know.

1220
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,000
That's true. The Norco is making my ass sleepy, so I'm sorry.

1221
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Try not to do a cat nap during the show.

1222
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Alright, well we actually have a little less news than usual in this segment just because it's a bit of a slower news week, honestly.

1223
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
So we will get to your calls probably sooner rather than later as well as your emails.

1224
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I participate at Orange Lounge Radio. Am I really that real housewife of whatever city, state, USA right now that just drinking wine and slurring words? I guess I am.

1225
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Alright, let's get to some rapid fire news. Loki.

1226
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So why not? I mean, I guess Twitch has played everything else and they even played Pokemon, so it's only fitting that they play Pokemon Go.

1227
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:54,000
And how he made Twitch play Pokemon Go, you might ask, since Twitch is not a human being and we haven't really developed some sort of Android to walk around.

1228
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:03,000
But they're doing that with an emulated version of Android and basically, or I'm sorry, it's actually an iPhone.

1229
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
So it's on a real iPhone and it's simulating the touch events based off of the screen.

1230
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So the screen, they have it broken up into like a grid, kind of like an Excel or something like that.

1231
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And you would type, you know, tap the coordinates for that or move in a certain direction.

1232
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:28,000
And then of course the GPS is being spoofed. They started off in Central Park in New York and it's just kind of going around and doing all that.

1233
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I do have to criticize something I'm seeing on Twitch though, and that is that Shane was over here last night.

1234
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:43,000
We were doing the Pokestop podcast and then we were watching some Twitch streams and I was kind of surprised like, wow, Pokemon Go is like a really popular thing that's being streamed right now.

1235
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Although I noticed that a lot of the streams, not all, because some people were doing fancy things to their tablets to make it work so that they were out in the real world playing this game and streaming and I think that's really cool.

1236
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:03,000
But there were people out there with lots of viewers that were spoofing location, playing on an emulator, fake, and I think Twitch should ban their asses.

1237
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:13,000
And I think Niantic should really be banning their asses. And I understand Niantic has server problems to worry about, but these guys are being really fucking bold.

1238
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Okay, so here's the thing. I love certain YouTube series and everything like that. There's one that I watch frequently called Lion's Tech Tips.

1239
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I want to say they're Canadians and they're pretty cool guys. They have a lot of cool tech news stuff.

1240
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:39,000
But with that, they had a tip section about how to cheat in Pokemon Go and it's talking about spoofing your location.

1241
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And their thing right now is, yeah, you could get banned, but right now they're trying to put out all the server fires that they're not really paying attention to that right now, so go hog wild while you can.

1242
01:45:50,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Just so you know, Niantic recently banned a bunch of people from Ingress and even some false flags, unfortunately, for cheating, for spoofing.

1243
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:10,000
So if you think you're getting away with it now, I think you're being really fucking bold doing it on Twitch TV and asking for fucking donations while you're doing it.

1244
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:18,000
And just because they're not banning you now doesn't mean they're not flagging your account for a ban later on once they do put out all these server fires.

1245
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Sorry, but I'm sorry. I find that shit to be really disingenuous and it's just really irritating that people are watching it, supporting it, and giving these people money.

1246
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Right, they have apps on iOS and stuff like that that basically you don't even have to move. It's just like you push a direction on the thing and it'll walk and you can walk around like that.

1247
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:52,000
But now people that are out in the real world, I want to make this clear, people that are out in the real world doing a complicated setup with their tablets so they can stream and all that stuff, that's awesome and those are the people that should be watched on Pokemon Go.

1248
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,000
That's cool. You guys keep doing what you're doing. The fakers, the cheaters, the spoofers, get fucked.

1249
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I just don't know how, like, I don't get it why that would be entertaining, watching people play Pokemon Go, because I've watched people try to play Ingress like in a YouTube video and stuff that shows people going on, like, we're going on an op or something like that, and it was the most boring shit ever.

1250
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
It's just fucking people sitting in a car playing Ingress and it's just, no, no.

1251
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I only like the really awkward I'm gonna die of secondhand embarrassment parking lot fight videos from Ingress of the people fighting in parking lots over portals where I'm like, I am fucking embarrassed for both of you right now. It's bad. I'll send you some links if you want to see, it's pretty bad.

1252
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Yeah, it's just, it's weird.

1253
01:47:38,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Brakeman says, Sky is an angry drunk loljk. Well, sometimes, sometimes. VxjasonXV, our awesome voiceover guy here at the show says, all the people that played Fallout 4 before Street Date come to mind. That is true. Unless you had permission, and some reviewers and sometimes some high traffic streamers and stuff do get permission to break street from companies, but obviously that was not what it was.

1254
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:22,000
That's not one of the cases, and that's a very good correlation, but I do have to point out, sometimes people do get special permission, and if they have that permission, then cool. If any of these Pokemon Go people do have permission to be doing what they're doing, then I'm sorry, I stand corrected, but I really don't think you do.

1255
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:41,000
And then let's see, ImmortalKing says, wow, dumb enough to broadcast your cheating. Yeah, right? And I believe it is in the Twitch thing that you can't use, and you're not supposed to use emulators or stream things that you don't legally own. I understand that Pokemon Go is a free game, and so, you know.

1256
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Yeah, but that's the thing. Granted, yeah, you shouldn't be doing it, but there's not really anything stopping you from doing it. It's a free to play game that you cost no money, the instructions are online to run it on Bluestacks, create a brand new Google account, done.

1257
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I have a problem when people spoof their location. I realize that there's not a lot you can do with that, but you are going to Pokestops you're not at, and getting gear you're not supposed to be getting, you are fighting gyms that you're not supposed to be fighting, that real people are at trying to win.

1258
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And that's where I draw the fucking line. Like, if you want to sit in your house and not move from your spot, then I guess I have less of a problem, but I just think that stream's gonna be a little bit boring, so I'm not sure that's what people are doing,

1259
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:37,000
cause sitting on your couch. You know what, I will say this, I did see a guy who was, I'm doing a stream where I am just gonna power evolve like all my characters tonight, and I'm gonna show you how I'm doing that and all that.

1260
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:51,000
That's fine, I guess. I didn't find it to be the most riveting thing in the world, but okay, cause they're not cheating, so I'm okay with that, but it's the spoofing location. I realize it's not as big a crime in Pokemon Go as it is in Ingress, but I'm sorry.

1261
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Or even-

1262
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
People that are at the location should not have to fight people that aren't there.

1263
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Isn't that funny? Like, someone that's sitting in a building outside of Central Park, or like a park area, I'm gonna spoof this account or whatever to drop blures on all of these locations, and then I'm gonna film the people rushing towards me.

1264
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I don't know about that. Alright, anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to turn a rapid-fire news story into something longer, but I had a thing or two to say on that.

1265
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Alright, so the next big thing in Virtuality is coming, and that is, yes, it's a Rick and Morty game, Rick and Morty Virtual Rick-ality, and it's being developed in partnership with Adult Swim Games and Alchemy Lab, that's Owl as in the other bird, for the HTC Vive, and it looks awesome.

1266
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I guess it's sort of like a job simulator type game, and actually that makes sense because their last game that the company did was job simulator, so.

1267
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I guess they're a good fit for it. I guess so, yeah.

1268
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Alright, well, if you're enjoying Overwatch as much as I am, you're probably very excited to know that Anna has been announced as a playable character in the game.

1269
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:06,000
That is gonna be the first free additional kit, because they're not doing DLC, it's a new Overwatch hero that they're gonna add to the game.

1270
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It is Pharah's mother, so what makes this really awesome is that she's like an old lady of Arab descent without an eye.

1271
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:28,000
So, now if you remember the OLR Dream Games, if you were to go back and visit the OLR Dream Games, one of the OLR Dream Games we had suggested a long time ago was a game called Grandma's Got a Gun.

1272
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:35,000
And I would think that Overwatch introducing Anna like half meets that qualification.

1273
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Grandma's Got a Gun was just supposed to be the license free version of like a shooter based on Golden Girls.

1274
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:58,000
So this is only halfway there, because I don't know if Anna likes cheesecake or not, but I still think this is really awesome that, you know, it's especially as I'm getting a little bit older, and you know, we all are here at Orange Lounge Radio as we've been doing this for 14 years.

1275
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,000
So, it's nicer to see older people represented in video games, so I think that is kind of awesome.

1276
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:12,000
And it's cool that she's just a sniper healer, she has a sniper rifle and she can use that to heal or damage folks, and I think that's pretty awesome.

1277
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:25,000
So, Blizzard does the character design thing very, very, very well, and so it's really cool to see that Anna's just another well designed character that brings some new stuff to the table for the game.

1278
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I want to mention Evolve. Last week we mentioned that Evolve was going free to play, and apparently the free to play thing working out pretty well for developer Turtle Rock.

1279
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Apparently the peak concurrent users in June for Evolve, before the game went free to play, the peak concurrent users totaled 234 at its peak.

1280
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Yeesh. Well, Turtle Rock has picked up over a million new players on PC, thanks to the free to play transition of Evolve.

1281
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:07,000
So, you know what? That's pretty awesome, so congrats to the team there, and even I think I have to check that out at some point. We'll see.

1282
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

1283
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Well, for fans of Killer Instinct, they have announced the final DLC character for season 3, and that is going to be Eidol, which I was watching the trailer for that today.

1284
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:32,000
It was pretty, pretty crazy. So, it will be, of course, Killer Instinct is available on Xbox One and Windows 10.

1285
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:45,000
And there will also be the Killer Instinct Definitive Edition that will have all 26 players. I found a typo in this article. From the past, and not pass-ed, 3 seasons. I'm going to email them.

1286
01:53:46,000 --> 01:54:02,000
And then, in other news, there is a big download coming up for the Wii U. We have some more TurboGrafx-16 stuff.

1287
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:18,000
We have Chroma Blast, Jackpot777, Reptilian Rebellion, and Tumblestone on Wii U for Virtual Console. There's Bunk's Adventure, New Adventure Island, and R-Type. Yes! Freaking love R-Type.

1288
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
That's the first time they're getting TurboGrafx games too, huh? That's cool.

1289
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:42,000
3DS is getting 7th Dragon 3 code VFD, Monster Hunter Generations. There's also, for download, Journey to Kresia. Final Fight is coming out to 3DS on Virtual Console. And then a bunch of Monster Hunter themes. So, lots of other sales coming up, but I won't go into all of them.

1290
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Alright. Very cool. Well, this is the part of the show where we would get into the frugal question of the week. However, once again, I failed, and I forgot to post a stupid frugal question of the week, because I'm an idiot.

1291
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I'm thinking, and I don't know, and I'm going to pitch this live on air, which I didn't warn my co-hosts about, maybe we ought to invite somebody else who might be really wanting to do this type of thing for our show, a long-time listener supporter, to be like our social media person.

1292
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:30,000
You know what? Doesn't every big company get like a social media manager type of thing? Isn't that a thing now? Maybe OLR needs a long-time fan to run our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and, you know, post funny memes and do things like that.

1293
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,000
What do you guys think? Does OLR need a social media manager because Rob keeps fucking failing at it?

1294
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Sure.

1295
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,000
And that may or may not have something to do with the fact that I have four podcasts right now and maybe a fifth soon.

1296
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
We'll go to Patreon.

1297
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Why a fifth?

1298
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
What?

1299
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I said, why a fifth?

1300
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Because Jamie and I may or may not have been talking about something for a little while.

1301
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
And I might be doing another one too with little Jamie.

1302
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
You know who's not having a podcast? This guy right here.

1303
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
He's not doing a podcast.

1304
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
He's the one and only.

1305
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Thought about doing a podcast because I have to have something to do while my wife is watching Grey's Anatomy, but nah, probably not.

1306
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I only have my garage to record in and it's dirty and has boxes everywhere and there's cat vomit on the floor and...

1307
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Rob's like VOG host podcast now so it's easy to make a new one. I have created a monster.

1308
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:33,000
To be fair, Bobby, if you told me that that thing wasn't ready, I would have just done it the way we've done some of the other shows.

1309
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Because I was really hell bent on making that idea happen. It just would have happened slowly.

1310
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
It probably still wouldn't be out. So Bobby has definitely helped that.

1311
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Help us strike when the iron is hot on Pokemon. That is for sure.

1312
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Immortal King in chat says, Rob is the Walt Disney of podcast.

1313
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I think I take that as a compliment except there were some rumors about Walt Disney that weren't so hot.

1314
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
So as long as I don't have any of those traits, then we're fine.

1315
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
As long as we're sticking with the imagination part of Walt Disney, then I accept.

1316
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
No, we're not going there.

1317
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:14,000
When the show inevitably ends and I inevitably pass away, you are to sever my frozen head and bury it under Studio N7. Sound like a deal?

1318
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,000
No, because he's not going to have a jackhammer and eh, I'm just going to throw it over the fence.

1319
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Throw it over the fence.

1320
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I did always say if I were to pass away before my prime, my request is that you put me into a catapult and you fling me against my place of work building during the lunch hour.

1321
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:42,000
That is my one request. I realize you might need a permit, you might need some clearance, but that would be my request.

1322
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:49,000
That's the funeral I want. That's the burial I want. I want you to fling my corpse from a catapult at the building during the lunch hour.

1323
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
That's my one request. Thank you very much.

1324
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Of course, I would like to live to be 100 years old and healthy as well. That would be great.

1325
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:06,000
JD is asking onto a window or not. Preferably the break room window would be preferred, but if you know...

1326
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Onto? Through a window.

1327
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I realize that the wind and everything might make that complicated, but put Loki in charge. He played enough tank wars in his life. He ought to be able to know the appropriate angle and power to use.

1328
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Through a window and then he'll land on an office chair with the momentum that you'll have laterally. He'll be able to roll across the floor. That should be fine.

1329
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, will someone be blasting in like a wrecking ball or whatever that Miley Cyrus song is?

1330
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Yes, you are to blast that song on a loudspeaker. Again, you might need a permit, but I would love that if right with the chorus, I came in like a wrecking ball.

1331
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:52,000
No, they're gonna be like, listen, you're not allowed to do that here. Turn that music off. Now go ahead and continue with flinging the dead body.

1332
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Alright, this is a place of work. We will not be having that song here.

1333
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Let's get back into some other news now that we had our... See, in light of the Fugu question of the week this week, you got talk about my funeral. It's very morbid. I don't know if I've...

1334
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Again, I'd like to live to be a hundred years old.

1335
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And his podcast hoarding.

1336
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:25,000
And my podcast hoarding. That's right. You know what? I can't help it. But if you ask me what TV shows I watch, nothing.

1337
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I don't... I watch... I watched... I shouldn't admit this, but I'm going to. I watch Chelsea on Netflix before bed the nights that there's a new episode. That is it.

1338
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Email has been submitted with correction.

1339
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I hear Stranger Things is pretty good.

1340
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I have heard that's pretty good too. Isn't that a scary one though? I don't like scary ones.

1341
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Yeah, but it's like 80's scary with like Winona Ryder and stuff.

1342
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Oh, I love Winona Ryder. Okay, that's okay. 80's scary is fine and Winona Ryder's...

1343
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
It's like they say it has a really big Spielberg vibe.

1344
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Okay, Winona Ryder's great. Winona Ryder makes everything better. Winona Ryder was the best thing about the Star Trek movie.

1345
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
How can you not love Winona Ryder? She'll steal your heart.

1346
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Why do people feed bread to ducks? It's so bad for them.

1347
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I don't know, Jamie. Why do people feed bread to ducks?

1348
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Just mad at people. Don't hurt the poor ducks.

1349
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Perhaps those people are mad at ducks.

1350
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
No, don't be mean to ducks. Give them seeds.

1351
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Getting back into some video game news and not catapults and bodies and bread ducks.

1352
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
But bread is what ducks crave.

1353
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Back into news, DarkSagra.

1354
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Well, okay. So Niantic is working on the issue with Pokemon Go on iOS for full access to Google accounts.

1355
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Which, first of all, wasn't worried about that to begin with.

1356
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:52,000
But there is no big reason to be concerned about it.

1357
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Niantic is working on making sure just the only essential data is there.

1358
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:08,000
And to basically put in there for client side fix to detect what information is accessed and be able to prevent certain things.

1359
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:15,000
So it's actually in the wording on there. It's an erroneous request.

1360
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
They're really not bothering with any of it.

1361
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
So only it's gonna request the most very basic information.

1362
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
So like I was telling everyone.

1363
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Now, another little thing about Pokemon Go is making all Americans learn the metric system.

1364
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Because, I'm sorry, we're freaking behind in the world.

1365
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Everywhere the fuck else uses metric.

1366
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
We are the only place left that uses the imperial system.

1367
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I don't even think England uses the imperial system.

1368
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
So it is, to be fair, it is, I mean, for distance is one thing.

1369
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:04,000
But it is really hard when you've gone your whole life knowing like, for example, temperature is the big one for me.

1370
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Like when it comes to temperature, it's like, okay, 104. I know what that feels like.

1371
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I know the difference between 104 and 94 and things like that.

1372
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I think that's like 40 something degrees Celsius.

1373
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
And it's like when you hear it in Celsius, like I can't relate the same way.

1374
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Like it's just it's hard when you've known that your whole life.

1375
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
But I do agree at least with like distance and Pokemon.

1376
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:29,000
It is a little, you know, but again, I don't think I'm going to start necessarily looking at kilometers per hour in my car or anything like that.

1377
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Like it's just it's really hard when you've grown up with it your whole life and that's all you know, you know what I mean?

1378
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I understand, though, why these other systems are better.

1379
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I mean, multiple to ten. It's very easy.

1380
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
104 degrees Fahrenheit is 40 degrees Celsius.

1381
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Well, I'm glad you can calculate that shit on the fly, because I'm not at that.

1382
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I talked to way too many people in Canada.

1383
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:58,000
But at any rate, because that's right, all the distances are measured in kilometers.

1384
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:10,000
So but what's sad is that there's a Google trend searches for how far is two kilometers and how far is five kilometers spiked after July 6th.

1385
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
So here you go, everyone.

1386
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,000
There is 0.62 miles in a kilometer.

1387
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:25,000
So two kilometers is the equivalent to 1.2 miles and five kilometers is 3.1 miles, which I need that from doing 5Ks.

1388
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:31,000
So and don't forget about 10 kilometer eggs, which gives you the best Pokemon would just be what, 6.2, right?

1389
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Yeah, so do the math.

1390
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
There it is.

1391
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
So this is your math lesson of the day, the more you know.

1392
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I think 5K kilometers is the length of a 5K race.

1393
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
IR smart. Yes.

1394
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Good. You did it. You did my nap now.

1395
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Now, to be fair, charities have been pushing the metric system or have been pushing the system on us for years.

1396
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
With 5K races, right?

1397
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1398
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:05,000
JD in chat says, now, if only the footsteps distance thingy were fixed, then we'd actually learn it.

1399
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Yes.

1400
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Here's the thing that's funny about that.

1401
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Actually, they're in apparently the iPad version of the game.

1402
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
It shows footsteps.

1403
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:18,000
But when you tap on it, it shows the actual fucking distances and meters like it did during the beta.

1404
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
And why does it now is beyond me.

1405
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Yeah, it's weird that they changed that from the beta.

1406
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I don't know why.

1407
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Yeah, in the beta, you guys, it actually showed the real number.

1408
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,000
It wasn't exact, so you couldn't totally triangulate.

1409
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,000
But what? In the original beta, it was rounded to multiples of 50.

1410
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,000
And then in the second beta, like they didn't update, it was rounded to multiples of 20.

1411
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Yeah.

1412
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:47,000
And then they changed it to this nebulous foot thing, which I believe is just the multiples of 50 again.

1413
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I think one foot is 50, two feet is 100.

1414
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:58,000
It's not. It's actually one, if I remember correctly, it's 100 meters, 500 meters, 1,000 meters.

1415
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Oh, wow.

1416
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
That's pretty tough to find.

1417
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Maybe. I could be wrong on that, but I thought that's what it was.

1418
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Yeah, but Alan's right in chat.

1419
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Live.vognetware.com.

1420
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,000
It's bugged right now anyway, which I think is what JD was referring to.

1421
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
It's showing three paws for everything, no matter what it is.

1422
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
So they need to fix that, just so you know.

1423
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Have you ever noticed like when you have like a lure, or not lure, incense on and you do capture one, you can kind of see it running away.

1424
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Like it takes like a piece of the cloud with it.

1425
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I thought that was kind of neat.

1426
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Yeah, there are funky little things with that.

1427
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I'm a little angry at Niantic for this, but I guess it's, you know, to be expected because it's so popular.

1428
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
And now like a lot of retail locations are wanting to get in on it.

1429
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
But they are taking requests to add new Pokéstops and Gyms to Pokémon GO.

1430
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
And they have their requests open.

1431
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Also they're taking requests for removals.

1432
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:02,000
So if you don't want your front yard to be a spot for teenagers to hang out in, you can remove it.

1433
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
But then again, you probably did that for Ingress, so it's your own fucking fall in the first place.

1434
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
But why not Ingress?

1435
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Well, something interesting along with that, and I just got this in one of my Ingress hangouts eight minutes ago.

1436
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:27,000
And this is something that came out of Japan because they had the last Aegis Nova anomaly in Tokyo, the Mega anomaly this weekend, right?

1437
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:35,000
So there was an interview with Kawashima, who is with NIA, and actually said some of these things about the game.

1438
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Talking about level cap, and saying that level cap changes may collapse the game balance.

1439
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
So they're going to be deliberate in doing that, but they are considering new metals or functions.

1440
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:51,000
We are developing some functions exclusively for level 16, which would contribute to the whole Ingress community.

1441
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
And I wonder if that's portals, but we'll see.

1442
02:06:54,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Our developing resources were largely occupied by Pokémon GO, so the pace of improving Ingress was rather slow recently.

1443
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Now engineers are coming back to Ingress, and the pace of adding new features would be Brisker.

1444
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,000
We have a long list of coming tasks and features, so we steadily implement them.

1445
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
And here's the one you want to hear about.

1446
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:18,000
New portal submission is temporarily down because of the lack of our resources, but we want to resume it.

1447
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:23,000
At least they're just fixing stuff, because there's like several portals around here that are like,

1448
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Oh, this is a mural. No, it's not there anymore. Oh, this is a church. It's been taken down.

1449
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
You know, there's like stuff that's just not there anymore that they have portals for still.

1450
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:39,000
We have been discussing about adding a third faction in gameplay, but we cannot promise that for now.

1451
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I think that would really disrupt the game if they did that.

1452
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I know it's kind of the fan wank thing in Ingress, but if you want three factions, play Pokémon GO.

1453
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
But we'll see.

1454
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Yeah, that'd be weird.

1455
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,000
It would be very weird because of the transition for these players that have been playing for so long.

1456
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Like, how's that even going to work?

1457
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Just new players, I guess. They'll be a little low level.

1458
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:09,000
And then, of course, with any popular game, we saw this with Overwatch, Pokémon porn searches are up.

1459
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
And I guess it makes sense.

1460
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
It's not as high as Overwatch, because Overwatch is like 1,500.

1461
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:27,000
But this is actually 800%. This is actually 336% up between males of 18 and 24.

1462
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
This is, of course, coming from Pornhub.

1463
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:39,000
On top of that, there is a whole new subreddit now, thanks to people and just wanting to be naked on camera.

1464
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:48,000
That's right, Pokémon GO NSFW, where the people are using the AR mode to take selfies and dick pics and post them online.

1465
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Oh yeah, somebody was kind enough to point me to a Tumblr of this.

1466
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:59,000
It was nothing but... I'm going to sound like such trash, but this is just what's on the internet, people, and especially Tumblr.

1467
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
It was dick pics done in Pokémon GO.

1468
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And so it would just be like, hey, there's a little Pidgey hanging out here, and it's some naked dude right next to that.

1469
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I kind of laughed because it's really funny, but it's one of those jokes where it's like, okay, now how long is that going to be funny for?

1470
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Right, and unfortunately, it's this type of shit that's going to get media coverage versus all the positive stuff.

1471
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:28,000
It's going to be like, oh, there's people shooting porn dick pics in my game.

1472
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
You mean you gave somebody a camera and somebody made porn with it?

1473
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:36,000
There's dick pics in that Pokémon GO. It's terrible for your children. Don't let them play it.

1474
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:43,000
They'll get hit by cars and fall off cliffs, and robbed, and see titties.

1475
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
That was a bad time for me to hiccup.

1476
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
This is bad. I hate hiccups.

1477
02:09:48,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Alright, through these hiccups, I'm going to try to tell you about, maybe this can be my talent, is hiccuping on demand for an internet-wide talent show that Twitch is apparently putting together.

1478
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:10,000
That's because, of course, Twitch's creative banner has been expanded, and some folks do comedy, music, theater, voice acting, and magic tricks.

1479
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I had no idea you could do magic tricks on Twitch now.

1480
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I almost want to start a crappy little magic tricks channel where I do magic tricks really badly.

1481
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
I'm sure somebody's already doing it. I don't know.

1482
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
But anyway, there was a post on the Twitch blog that said,

1483
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:34,000
One of the things we heard loud and clear is that there are many other ways streamers would like to share their passion,

1484
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:40,000
which is why we're expanding the Twitch creative category to allow streamers to not only create, but perform their art.

1485
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:45,000
So now creative is basically the world's biggest open mic night.

1486
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:50,000
You might be able to land a gig performing at TwitchCon in San Diego.

1487
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:59,000
So if you've streamed for at least four hours with material related to your act, you can submit an audition video not to exceed five minutes in length.

1488
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
And if you're picked, you will not be given travel to SoCal, but as long as you can get there,

1489
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Twitch will let you in the door for free, get you in a badge, and then I guess you'll get to perform in the Twitch talent show,

1490
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
which will be a part of TwitchCon this year.

1491
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:24,000
How about, can I be one of those people? Can my talent be eating all of the food that's in front of me?

1492
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Because that was the thing we were talking about a couple weeks ago on the show, right?

1493
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Where the girls that like binge eat, I guess, and dudes too, but that just binge eat all the things in front of them.

1494
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Can that be my talent?

1495
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
The binge eating and projectile vomit onto Pokémon.

1496
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Just bring me more of those Cinnabon things from Taco Bell.

1497
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I was just saying we should just go get some more.

1498
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:50,000
That will be my talent. Watch them just disappear in front of your very eyes.

1499
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Alright, wow, I have the hiccups really bad, so I need to pass things over to DarkSakura, who's going to open up the mailbag.

1500
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Participate at orangehomesradio.com and read the emails we have this week.

1501
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Well, before I do that, William Murderface was asking if there's any way that my old comic book podcast could come back.

1502
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:15,000
And that was Monday Comics Mania that I used to do with Tiara.

1503
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Oh, it was Comics Insanity.

1504
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I did do Comics Insanity as well, but I was like, I would love to do a comic podcast, but I don't have a co-host who would do it with me.

1505
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I tried to see if Captain Spike would do it, but I know he's busy with Game Buoy and other stuff, so...

1506
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,000
He's trying to out podcast whore me, just so you guys know.

1507
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Oh, then maybe I should talk to him.

1508
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
So, emails, we have all of one.

1509
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,000
And I will read it to you now, in my drugged up voice.

1510
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Ready?

1511
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
You wanna hear it? Here it go!

1512
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Hello, LR.

1513
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I just wanted to provide some information for folks interested in playing DDR Ace at Dave and Buster's in North America.

1514
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:03,000
By the time this email is read, all 30 locations scheduled to get the game will have received and installed it.

1515
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Hopefully.

1516
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
A recent post on BimaniStyle lists all 30 locations.

1517
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:21,000
If your local D&B didn't get it, but you're able to reach one that did, know that if the game is successful in its initial locations, they have announced plans to add it to more locations next year.

1518
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,000
So if you're able to get to one of them, please try to make the trip.

1519
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:30,000
D&B requires underage guests to be accompanied by someone over the age of 25.

1520
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Underage is defined as 18 or 21, depending on the location.

1521
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Check their website for more details.

1522
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:44,000
The game is presented in brand new cabinets of the latest model with large, gorgeous HD widescreens.

1523
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,000
The marquee is unique to this North American release.

1524
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:56,000
All of the text in this version of the game has been translated into English, except for Japanese song titles, which from what I've heard have been left untranslated.

1525
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:03,000
The game will cost 6.8 chips per credit, or between 91 cents and $1.42, depending on the quantity you purchase.

1526
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Note that all games at D&B are half-priced on Wednesdays.

1527
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:14,000
At every location, DDR Ace is connected to the EMU Summit service.

1528
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,000
EMU's cards will be on sale at the front desk in each location for $5.

1529
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I already have one.

1530
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:27,000
If you plan to play this game more than once, you'll want a card, as your scores and clear status will be saved automatically.

1531
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:34,000
You'll be able to unlock more songs, and you'll also have access to options and features that are unavailable without one.

1532
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:42,000
When you start the game with an EMU's card, you'll be prompted to select either Normal or Premium Play.

1533
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Premium Play will prevent your game from ending if you fail a song. You'll simply go on to the next stage.

1534
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Also, several modifiers, as well as the ability to earn an extra stage, are exclusive to Premium Play.

1535
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:04,000
In Japan, Premium Play costs about 20% more pastel-y than a normal play, but D&B doesn't use pastel-y or anything like it,

1536
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:10,000
so unfortunately at this moment, the default setting is for Premium Play to require two credits instead of one. Blugh.

1537
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:18,000
That's about everything you need to know to get started. DDR Ace contains 700 songs spanning the series' history,

1538
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:24,000
and you will receive additional songs in the coming months via network updates.

1539
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I hope you enjoy it. I certainly plan to keep on stepping. Aaron, why?

1540
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Thank you for the update, because I've been too busy catching Pokémon to actually go check out DDR Ace, but 700 songs? Good golly.

1541
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Do I detect a road trip to D&B? I think we need to make that happen, and... Because I know our local closet doesn't have one.

1542
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,000
And the fountains has a shitload of Pokéstops, just so you know.

1543
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:57,000
So, yeah, the machine is really pretty too, although honestly, you and I just need to go to round one, I think is the real place we need to go to.

1544
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I haven't been, so as soon as I get the All Clear on my wrist, we need to go. Do they have DDR Ace yet, the round ones?

1545
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Do you chatters know? I know Dave and Buster's, I get that, and I guess that is a lot closer.

1546
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:16,000
But at some point, I gotta get Dark Soccer out there, and that would be fun. So, we'll see.

1547
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Let's see, over at our chat, live.vognetwork.com, sg100matt says,

1548
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:26,000
700 songs, they better turn off the song select timer.

1549
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:32,000
And Orangewrite says, yeah, all the round ones do, at least Lakewood and San Jose does. Well, there you go.

1550
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,000
That's the one I want to know about, so, awesome.

1551
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Yeah, and Brakeman says, make sure the wrist is 100% before you risk it. Yes, doctor's orders.

1552
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Yeah, see, I'll tell you this, I actually tested to see if I was gonna be a...

1553
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Because California Extreme was this weekend as well.

1554
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I really wanted to go.

1555
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Dan went, but I tried to play pinball the day before to see if my wrist was gonna be up to it, and uh-uh.

1556
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I just, I couldn't have played. It was very sad, because apparently the Beymani section was pretty epic this year.

1557
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
That's sad.

1558
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Yeah, that was a part of part of second.

1559
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
That's awesome.

1560
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I like to wiggle my butt.

1561
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Do you?

1562
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I play Deluxe.

1563
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Of course, of course.

1564
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Alright, you guys should email us as well. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1565
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Now it's time to get to the FUs of the week.

1566
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:52,000
FU to, um, my wrist being really slow to heal, and I don't know how I'm gonna do at work next week or tomorrow.

1567
02:17:52,000 --> 02:18:03,000
So, we'll have to see. Um, but yeah, FU to that, and um, that's really it.

1568
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
FU did not have any more Cinnabon Delights.

1569
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
So, stuff is good.

1570
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Uh, Loki.

1571
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Um, F, speaking of Cinnabon, FU to the Cinnabon, um, frozen Cinnabon thing that I bought from the store that had the dough.

1572
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:24,000
The Cinnabon cinnamon and the, uh, I guess the icing that goes on it.

1573
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Except it didn't fucking have one of the three things that are required for a Cinnabon, and that would be the cinnamon.

1574
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
That portion of it was fucking missing from the packaging.

1575
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
It was just a bond.

1576
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:41,000
It was just the fucking dough, and I don't even know if the frosting was there. It's like two of the three things.

1577
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

1578
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I'm like, I don't even know. I'm like, I fucking want Cinnabon there, and it's like, yeah, you got lucky that it's just missing.

1579
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
It's fucking gone. So, fuck them.

1580
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:02,000
My FU of the Week goes to these fucking hiccups. This is the worst thing ever during live radio.

1581
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I shouldn't have drank all that wine that fast.

1582
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,000
There's a trick. All you have to do is figure out how to change the air pressure in your lungs.

1583
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,000
And there's a trick they taught us in massage school, but it's kind of complex.

1584
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,000
But it works.

1585
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Yeah, I don't have time for complex issues right now. I'm trying to force myself to burp. That's what usually does it for me.

1586
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Like that?

1587
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Yeah, like that, basically. Isn't that classy for radio to be doing right now?

1588
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Well, I was just proving it's possible.

1589
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Yes, I know. All right. Just a couple more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line.

1590
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. But first, Logie.

1591
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:44,000
So this is pretty exciting. It's taken a long time, but they were getting close to cracking the Sega Saturn.

1592
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And basically, this is a project that was done by James Laird-Waugh.

1593
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:55,000
He's known as Professor of Dr. Abrasive. He's a coder.

1594
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:01,000
And he also has created some other cartridges and stuff that bypasses different things for the Nintendo Game Boy.

1595
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:08,000
And also engineered some flashcards for the Game Boy and some other stuff.

1596
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:13,000
But now he has created a plug-in flashcard for the Sega Saturn.

1597
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:19,000
And originally, he did this as part of a way to get access to the sound chip that's on there.

1598
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Because he wanted to actually use it to kind of, I guess, run a tracker or something like that.

1599
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:38,000
So he's built something that's going to basically replace one of the cards in there and plug it into an expansion port that's going to allow him to have access to the CD drive and all that stuff.

1600
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:51,000
So that's pretty awesome. And he's going to release it public, but right now he's still trying to finish it up to the point where basically someone can easily just plug it in and go and be done.

1601
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,000
So that would be pretty cool thinking of that working.

1602
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,000
What can we crack the Sega Saturn to do?

1603
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Well, he's making it right now. What he's using it for is basically to gain access to the sound chip. So he can do chip tunes and stuff on there.

1604
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Did you watch the whole video?

1605
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
I watched most of it, yeah.

1606
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,000
I watched the whole thing the other day because Ranma linked it to me.

1607
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I thought it was really interesting, though, what he did to be able to finally get into the coding on the chip itself.

1608
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:33,000
That he had to take it through another type of decompiler to be able to get the stuff off of.

1609
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:39,000
And a lot of really neat in-depth stuff as to just exactly how strong the copy protection was.

1610
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,000
The Saturn was a really over-engineered machine.

1611
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Alright, well lastly tonight before we get to the Skype line, I'm not sure how legal this is, but it's certainly fun while it's lasting.

1612
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,000
How many of you guys ever played the DOS versions of Mega Man?

1613
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:06,000
They were not the same as the NES games. They were different. They had different monster bosses and they kind of weren't very good.

1614
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Well, somebody is actually trying to remake them. I actually had the first Mega Man DOS game that had three boss monsters in it.

1615
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
That was it. It was limited to three.

1616
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Well, apparently somebody has taken it upon themselves to actually remake the Mega Man DOS games.

1617
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:30,000
They're packaging them in together to make like one NES-style Mega Man title.

1618
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
And you can actually get it on the Steam Workshop.

1619
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Normally the Steam Workshop is like a mod.

1620
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
It didn't have horrific artwork.

1621
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
What's that?

1622
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Yeah, it did have pretty horrific artwork.

1623
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:50,000
It did have some horrific artwork. It is an add-on for Game Maker Studio, but Game Maker Studio I believe is free.

1624
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Yeah.

1625
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Or at least I had it in my library somehow, whether it was through a bundle or what have you.

1626
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,000
So you download Game Maker Studio and then you can download this as a workshop add-on.

1627
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:08,000
And somebody's made like a full 8-bit NES game style that's basically inspired by the DOS games that weren't that great.

1628
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
But I actually downloaded this. I checked out a little bit of it and played it.

1629
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Even though I could not get it to be any bigger than that tiny, tiny, tiny window that I think is the native NES resolution.

1630
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
So I have to play around with the settings more to see if I can get it to be bigger.

1631
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:27,000
But it was like playing an 8-bit NES game. It was kind of fun.

1632
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,000
So they did a good job with it and I wonder how long until Capcom shuts it down to be honest.

1633
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:35,000
At the very least it's good to check out the engine.

1634
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:41,000
And they made like a custom map editor and boss builder and all this stuff in it too, which is kind of cool.

1635
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
So they basically made Mega Man Maker.

1636
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
That wouldn't be half bad.

1637
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Although they did have that for the PSP.

1638
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I didn't like Darcelle that one. The Mega Man powered up Mega Man or whatever.

1639
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skyline at Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Twitter. On Twitter. On Skype.

1640
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Meanwhile, we're going to go and see if there's any last minute stories from Loki. Although I kind of doubt it. Do we have any last minute stories?

1641
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,000
There's not much. One thing I was going to mention that they're going to be releasing Earth Defense Force 4.1 onto Steam.

1642
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:22,000
For $49.99 is way too fucking overpriced for that game. Way, way, way too overpriced.

1643
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:27,000
So that's not something I'm going to get at launch because I have it on PlayStation 4 and I don't really play it a whole ton.

1644
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:31,000
It's fun. I like that and I would be looking forward to playing it with mods and everything.

1645
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Or playing it with some sort of cheat device or something.

1646
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I don't know. $50 seems like it's an awful expensive game. Just wait for it to come down in price because that is way too expensive for that.

1647
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Alright, let's get to the phones. Take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1648
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Hi, this is Raginator.

1649
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Hey, Raginator. What's on your mind, buddy?

1650
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Not a whole lot, actually.

1651
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Instead of talking about Steam like I normally do. Repeat ad nauseam.

1652
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I think I'll switch it up and talk about good old games for once.

1653
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:16,000
I think I may have mentioned it earlier in the chat, but in case you noticed.

1654
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:27,000
EA has added some new stuff to GOG over the weekend that I think you guys might like.

1655
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,000
In case you don't have it on, God knows what other service.

1656
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:44,000
They have released the original Dead Space to GOG and I believe the ultimate edition of Dragon Age Origins.

1657
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Chances are everyone probably has those games either on console or Steam or Origins or whatever.

1658
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I'd be surprised if you didn't get them in some bundle or an Origin giveaway or something, but who knows?

1659
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,000
There may be some folks who miss the boat. It does happen sometimes.

1660
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Yeah, or maybe there are probably a few people out there that get really bad cases of heebie-jeebies when it comes to anything that has DRM in it.

1661
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:23,000
So hey, if you've been holding it off because of DRM, now's your chance to get them.

1662
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:30,000
I think temporarily they're what? Either 40% off or 60% off? Something like that?

1663
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:38,000
But hey, might as well get them if you don't have them already.

1664
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:55,000
On that note, speaking of GOG, is there any games that you would like to see on GOG that maybe aren't on there?

1665
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:01,000
The Original Civilization. I check once a month to make sure it hasn't been added yet.

1666
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
That's the one I most want to see on GOG.

1667
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:11,000
As far as a classic game goes, I do realize they have Colonization and I think they have Civ IV?

1668
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:19,000
They did bring over one of Sid Meier's other games that is kind of underrated in my opinion.

1669
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Covert Action, which I really liked when I was younger, and I've talked about it on this show before, but I would really like to see The Original Civilization.

1670
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Oh really?

1671
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Yup.

1672
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Yeah, I think I've seen Covert Action and Colonization listed.

1673
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:42,000
In fact, I have Colonization on Steam, but I haven't gotten around to playing it yet.

1674
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,000
It's good, but it's very different from the other Civ games.

1675
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:53,000
But I mean, it's still at its core kind of one of those what they call the 4X type of games.

1676
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:58,000
But there's just some very different mechanics in it where the outcome is very different from a Civ game.

1677
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
But it's fun, I liked it.

1678
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
I enjoyed a Sid Meier game called Railroad Tycoon a little more.

1679
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
That's probably my second favorite.

1680
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Well, actually it would be third favorite because Covert Action is probably my second favorite.

1681
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Then probably Railroad Tycoon, but it's really close because I really like Railroad Tycoon.

1682
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,000
And I would also like to see that on Steam, GOG, anywhere really.

1683
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,000
They did do a version of it that was really souped up.

1684
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I want to say like probably about 10 years ago.

1685
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
That's not the version I'm thinking of.

1686
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Specifically, there was a version around 94, 95 called Railroad Tycoon Deluxe.

1687
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:41,000
That's the one I'd like to be able to play again because I played that when I was younger in high school.

1688
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
And I would like to be able to play that particular version again.

1689
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Ah. Well, I'm probably going to let you go if only because I want cats.

1690
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I have my feet acting up and he had three things going and he's going to end up pulling out of the cord.

1691
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:00,000
That's okay because these hiccups are driving me bonkers.

1692
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
But thank you so much for the call. I really appreciate it, okay?

1693
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Yep, you too. Have a nice night.

1694
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Alright, you too. Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.

1695
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Alright, bye-bye.

1696
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I know this is kind of weird but I'm actually going to close the Skype line and we're going to go ahead and end the show.

1697
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:19,000
I am hurting here with these hiccups and the more I talk, the more I'm pushing and I need to stop.

1698
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
So we are going to end the show.

1699
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
So thank you very much for tuning into the show.

1700
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show and help spread the word.

1701
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Where every gamer has a voice, a nice five-star review on a site where you found this show would go an awfully long way.

1702
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Dark Sakura.

1703
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Um...no. No.

1704
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Yes?

1705
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
No.

1706
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Yes?

1707
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Cinnabon.

1708
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Yes.

1709
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Yes.

1710
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Loki.

1711
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Um...I don't know. I really do need to stop playing Katamari.

1712
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
No you don't.

1713
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
It's not going to happen though.

1714
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
That's the spirit.

1715
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:07,000
And my final thought is I'm going to go lie down. Sorry for the awkward ending to the show.

1716
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,000
But these things happen sometimes on live radio that you can't control.

1717
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
And thankfully it happened at the end of the show.

1718
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
At least you get a nice long show nevertheless.

1719
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:18,000
But we'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

1720
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Have a great night everybody. Bye bye.

1721
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,000
