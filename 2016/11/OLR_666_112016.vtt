00:00.000 --> 00:25.280
DarkSakura's

00:25.280 --> 00:54.160
Hello my fiends out there on the internet.

00:54.160 --> 01:01.840
Welcome to a very dark Studio N7 and another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.160
This is episode number 666.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.760
Say it forward, say it backwards, it's all the same.

01:08.760 --> 01:19.240
Episode number 666 of Orange Lounge Radio Live for this 20 November 2016.

01:19.240 --> 01:26.800
You see, this is what the year 2016 does to nationally recognized nerd holidays such as

01:26.800 --> 01:28.360
20 November.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.880
It flips them to the land of the upside down.

01:31.880 --> 01:40.760
Where myself, Rob Roberts, is sitting right now with my co-hosts, I'm Cersei Nightshade.

01:40.760 --> 01:46.600
Somebody has gotten out the Ouija board and summoned without the use of radio magic live

01:46.600 --> 01:58.680
to the studio DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers.

01:58.680 --> 02:05.480
Welcome back from the land of the working and lost and tired DarkSakura.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.360
And also joining us in studio, I will still meet you for that crap, I don't care what

02:10.360 --> 02:12.160
episode it is.

02:12.160 --> 02:18.000
And also say hello in studio to the one and only Satan Master, Loki.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Hello.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I'm fine.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Welcome back to the show.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yes.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.840
I know you missed our little show mid-week, but I hope everything's better, so.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.640
Yeah, I mean, it's fine.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.640
Awesome.

02:32.640 --> 02:40.360
Alright, so here we are, episode 666 as mentioned of our show, and a number of a show that we

02:40.360 --> 02:42.200
never thought we'd actually get to.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.200
I think.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.200
What was that, Loki?

02:44.200 --> 02:46.800
I was just saying that I'm still disappointed we missed so many shows, because originally

02:46.800 --> 02:51.160
it was supposed to land on my birthday, and that would have been fantastic, but it's just

02:51.160 --> 02:53.720
not meant to be, apparently.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.680
Well, even the devil needs a vacation once in a while, Loki, but.

02:57.680 --> 03:03.240
No, the devil's doing other work right now.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.520
Devil's been busy interviewing people all weekend.

03:06.520 --> 03:12.240
But here's the thing, we never thought we'd get this far, but here we are, the true episode

03:12.240 --> 03:17.800
666, which I think got back on episode 66, I think we joked, the show would have to be

03:17.800 --> 03:23.000
going for like 14 years for us to get to an actual episode 666, and there's been joke

03:23.000 --> 03:25.080
episode 666s.

03:25.080 --> 03:31.080
Our old pal, Travis Donovan, who did the show Understation Live, he filled in for us one

03:31.080 --> 03:35.400
night when we weren't here live on one of our many excursions, like E3 week or something

03:35.400 --> 03:39.680
like that, and he was with his buddy that he used to do Understation Live with, Bresl,

03:39.680 --> 03:45.440
or whatever he goes by now these days, and they did like episode 666, but now, so now

03:45.440 --> 03:51.120
there's two realities of an episode 666, so we've had to take the stranger things approach.

03:51.120 --> 03:57.000
So is this like the true Back to the Future 2 reality, or is this the Biff Tannen reality?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.960
I'm gonna leave that for y'all to decide at the end of the night, that's what I'm gonna

04:00.960 --> 04:02.040
say right there.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.480
But you guys are there in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, where we do tape live

04:06.480 --> 04:12.160
every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, or should I say 666 o'clock Pacific, nine

04:12.160 --> 04:17.440
o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and as we talked about on Bobby

04:17.440 --> 04:22.880
Black Wolf tonight, I do wanna mention here right at the top of the show, a very big congratulation

04:22.880 --> 04:30.840
to Bobby Black Wolf for getting engaged this past week while he was off on a cruise around

04:31.600 --> 04:33.960
wherever they were, the Caribbean I think it was, because you mentioned there was a

04:33.960 --> 04:38.560
show, the Pirates in the Caribbean, because they were actually there, so congratulations

04:38.560 --> 04:46.080
to Bobby and Jennifer on that, very, very, very excited for them.

04:46.080 --> 04:53.000
Looking through chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Ikuma JP in chat says, why 666

04:53.000 --> 05:00.400
always has to be dark, 666 can be lollipop-y, I like that word, lollipop, I wanna lollipop,

05:00.400 --> 05:06.800
our soccer, get me a lollipop, I gave you pineapple soda, that is, that is, it was sweet,

05:06.800 --> 05:14.280
it was sugary, like a lollipop would be, I didn't lick it, but I drank it, anyway, let's

05:14.280 --> 05:21.120
see, also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Maya is in our chat saying episode

05:21.120 --> 05:26.740
666 will be comprised entirely of our host acting out chic tracks, I think you're chic

05:26.740 --> 05:32.860
tracks, I'm not sure exactly what, oh, like the asshole jack chick, oh, that used to write

05:32.860 --> 05:39.020
those, you're going to hell, oh, oh, oh, oh, that was a deep joke, that was good, you're,

05:39.020 --> 05:43.620
you're not Southern Baptist, you're going to hell, that's like the little article in

05:43.620 --> 05:47.220
the newspaper that says, warning, all these people are going to hell, and it's like all

05:47.220 --> 05:55.180
the coolest people you know, yeah, what's that, Darsara, just to let you know, there

05:55.180 --> 06:02.340
is some weird apocrypha, post biblical apocrypha created, that indicates that 666 is some

06:02.340 --> 06:06.460
mystically bad number, that it's apparently going to be tattooed on everyone's head during

06:06.460 --> 06:11.380
the rapture, even though there's no actual reference to it in what is considered the

06:11.380 --> 06:17.300
Christian Bible, and how do we know it's not 999 upside down? Because that would be a sale,

06:17.300 --> 06:23.380
999 are you out of your mind? That's exactly how many NES classics they actually made,

06:23.380 --> 06:30.260
by the way. But I would assume that the number six, anyway, has a similar negative connotation

06:30.260 --> 06:36.040
to the number four in Japan, without the reference to death. So are you saying that we missed

06:36.040 --> 06:41.940
an opportunity to do all this cheesy, over the top, scary shit way back on episode four?

06:41.940 --> 06:46.340
We could have, if we had been a little more culturally sensitive. I see. Well, everybody,

06:46.340 --> 06:51.700
from here on out now, you'll just have to look forward to episode number 4444, because

06:51.700 --> 06:56.540
that will be the next landmark evil episode. How about that? Four fours. And so what year

06:56.540 --> 07:01.700
would that be in? We'll be dead. We will be about 70 years old when that episode happens.

07:01.700 --> 07:08.740
No, that would be even more than that. You have to go, like, daily. And for Ikuma, that

07:08.740 --> 07:14.460
is the closest parallel I could think of to illustrate kind of how unlucky the number

07:14.460 --> 07:20.420
is. If it's the closest thing I could think of. Alright, I do want to get into video games,

07:20.420 --> 07:26.140
but since tonight is a little bit of a quote unquote special episode, I actually thought,

07:26.140 --> 07:31.180
you know, it's funny that there was the comment earlier about why can't 666 be lollipop-y?

07:31.180 --> 07:35.980
I thought, actually, we could start maybe with something a little bit more positive,

07:35.980 --> 07:42.140
just because I think everybody expects something negative and scary. And Loki brings us plenty

07:42.140 --> 07:46.300
of that when we get into Nintendo news later. But I thought we'd take a minute to talk about,

07:46.300 --> 07:50.900
especially because considering today is 20 November. And I know a lot of listeners might

07:50.900 --> 07:54.220
not understand the significance of that and why we were trying to make such a landmark

07:54.220 --> 07:58.660
show happen on 20 November. But remember that Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Dark Soccer,

07:58.660 --> 08:03.420
and Loki, we all met playing a little video game known as Dance Dance Revolution at the

08:03.420 --> 08:07.460
arcade, you know, when people still hung out at arcades regularly. Well, that's coming

08:07.460 --> 08:11.420
back a little bit, depending on where you are. But anyway, we all met, you know, playing

08:11.420 --> 08:15.760
DDR and getting into that community and established friendships there. And in the early days

08:15.760 --> 08:21.280
of Orange Lounge Radio, Orange Lounge, by the way, one of the bands actually in DDR

08:21.280 --> 08:25.960
that does songs for, and when I say DDR, I really mean the whole Bomani family, Beatmania.

08:25.960 --> 08:31.080
I'm simplifying things for people who might not have been around back then. But where

08:31.080 --> 08:36.320
was I going with that? DDR was back in the day, we were all playing together. Oh, and

08:36.320 --> 08:39.360
Orange Lounge Radio was one of the bands in, or excuse me, Orange Lounge was one of the

08:39.360 --> 08:45.560
bands in DDR. So we took the name as a Beatles tribute band might call themselves

08:45.560 --> 08:50.680
Yellow Submarine, or an ABBA tribute band might call themselves Bjorn Again or Mamma

08:50.680 --> 08:55.840
Mia or something. But anyway, so we took a name of one of the bands and, you know, Lounge

08:55.840 --> 09:01.140
was to give that talk radio atmosphere. So really, I mean, this show happened because

09:01.140 --> 09:05.760
of DDR. So it's kind of funny that today being 20 November, that's kind of recognized as

09:05.760 --> 09:13.000
a music gaming holiday, because one of the first songs you play in DDR or Beatmania,

09:13.000 --> 09:20.200
because it's a beginner level song, is 20 November. And that was a song by DJ, what

09:20.200 --> 09:26.080
was his name, DJ Nagureyo? Nagureyo. Nagureyo was his name, and that actually was his birthday.

09:26.080 --> 09:31.240
So that's funny as that we turned the dude's birthday into a Bomani holiday, but you know,

09:31.240 --> 09:37.040
a lot of the people who really nerded out on music games 15 years ago, if you can believe

09:37.040 --> 09:41.120
that's how long it's been, kind of adopted that as the unofficial holiday. So here we

09:41.120 --> 09:46.600
are. So now we get a landmark episode and that. But the reason I state all of that is,

09:46.600 --> 09:51.320
you know, we've come a long way here at Orange Tons Radio. Not a lot of podcasts have hit

09:51.320 --> 09:58.260
666 episodes. I don't know of any weekly show that has. I certainly know of multi-week shows

09:58.260 --> 10:01.560
and daily shows that have hit that type of number, but I don't know of any weekly shows

10:01.560 --> 10:06.040
that have hit 666. So you know, we've been doing this for a while. And I thought it's

10:06.040 --> 10:11.600
kind of like a nice thing to start the show off tonight. I thought I'd ask you guys, what is the

10:11.600 --> 10:16.200
positive influence that doing this show has had on your life? Like, what is the, what are the good

10:16.200 --> 10:21.320
things that have come of doing Orange Tons Radio? And I would even, you know, for a change, turn

10:21.320 --> 10:25.480
that over to our listeners as well in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Like, I'm not looking

10:25.480 --> 10:29.860
to inflate our egos too much, but it is a special landmark episode. I'm very curious, you know,

10:29.860 --> 10:35.840
what is, what has the show done for you out there? So, Jamie, ladies first, you're back after a

10:35.840 --> 10:39.840
break. What has Orange Tons Radio done for you? What is, what does the show meant to you over the

10:39.840 --> 10:46.920
years? I have something to do on Sunday. It's a thing to do. I made a lot of good friends. That's

10:46.920 --> 10:53.760
a big one. I certainly got a lot more confidence for speaking out. And even with a few negative

10:53.760 --> 11:00.840
experiences, it's taught me how to let a few things go like water off a deck's back and, and

11:00.960 --> 11:06.320
how to get my revenge. I mean, how to, how to properly mitigate damage on social media. How

11:06.320 --> 11:14.680
exactly have you gotten your revenge? I'm a little concerned now. Maybe it's coming. What? I'm trying

11:14.680 --> 11:22.240
to remember exactly how the quote goes, but, uh, always fear, always fear the patience of an angry

11:22.240 --> 11:29.960
man. Or, and, and fear it double when it's a woman. Fear the, fear the anger of a patient, of a

11:29.960 --> 11:35.360
patient person. That's it. Fear the anger of a patient person. Okay. All right. Loki, what about

11:35.360 --> 11:40.560
you? What is, what is OLR meant for you? I know you're not usually a feelsy person, but try me

11:40.560 --> 11:49.360
here. Um, I get to vent. Or at least I get to talk about video games. Cause like, if I tried to do

11:49.360 --> 11:55.080
that outside of the show, except, you know, when I'm hanging out with, you know, friends that are

11:55.080 --> 12:02.400
also gamers, which is very rare. Um, most people are just like, kinda, it's goes over the head.

12:02.400 --> 12:07.480
Like you even try to explain like the basic stuff to them. Like, Oh yeah, I got PlayStation VR. Yeah.

12:07.480 --> 12:14.840
That's trying this stuff out. Then it's like, I don't care. What's a VR? Is that a car? What's

12:14.840 --> 12:21.280
a VR? Sony made a car, PlayStation car. It's like my, my dad called me yesterday. Cause they're

12:21.280 --> 12:29.400
thinking of getting, um, the other grand child, a VR headset for his phone. And I'm like, well,

12:29.400 --> 12:33.360
what kind of phone does he have? Cause that makes a difference. You can buy a headset. It won't

12:33.360 --> 12:39.800
fucking work if your phone is old as shit. And apparently his phone is, might be old as shit. So

12:39.800 --> 12:46.000
I was like, maybe you find out what phone he has first and then go buy it. So, cause they're, Oh,

12:46.000 --> 12:55.520
$15 VR is just everywhere. It's $15. It's not $50. So OLR is basically giving you a place to talk

12:55.520 --> 13:01.160
about video games when, when the quote unquote real world won't let you do that. Yeah. Especially

13:01.160 --> 13:05.240
the wife, the wife doesn't like hearing about video games. Like I say anything to her and she's

13:05.240 --> 13:12.800
just like kinda, I don't know. The mark of the beast shows up. It's hard enough. Like my God,

13:12.800 --> 13:18.160
like we, like I've been using like the stupid streaming box, the boxy, it's like super old as

13:18.160 --> 13:23.360
shit. And it's for Netflix and it stopped working because it's old as shit and it doesn't, it's not

13:23.360 --> 13:28.760
supported anymore. It's all web based and their shit's all broken. So we have to use the PlayStation

13:28.760 --> 13:35.480
4 now. And that was such a fucking just bitch fest because it's just like, my God, I have to

13:35.480 --> 13:40.400
use the controller. I don't know how to turn the console on. I'm like, push the button, push the

13:40.440 --> 13:46.520
button, just hold it down. It will turn the fuck on. And then like, and then seriously, it's like

13:46.520 --> 13:51.400
she keeps leaving it on and I'm like, turn the console off when you're done with it. Don't just

13:51.400 --> 13:55.200
leave it on because she leaves the controller there to drain all the battery out. So when I want

13:55.200 --> 14:00.440
to go play a game, I can't fucking do that without tethering myself to the console. And so finally

14:00.440 --> 14:06.840
she's like, I learned how to turn the console off today. I'm like, good for you. I mean, like, I've

14:06.880 --> 14:13.960
been only showing you like 80 times how to do that and fine. Thanks for actually doing it now. I

14:13.960 --> 14:18.920
mean, I don't know. So that's how, that's, that's what speaking, like we went out with other, other

14:18.920 --> 14:23.680
parents last night and they're gamers. So like for her, she likes talking to them about other stuff,

14:23.680 --> 14:29.280
but like I was talking to them about games. Funny, actually the guy, you know, this is totally local

14:29.280 --> 14:37.440
bullshit, but like the guy actually played Ingress a bit. Um, not so much, but his home portal also

14:37.440 --> 14:42.440
happens to be Marty's home portal. And he told me some stories about like, Oh yeah, there's this guy

14:42.440 --> 14:46.320
like kept on like, I stopped playing it because there's this guy that kept on like seeing that,

14:46.320 --> 14:51.520
you know, I was, you know, stalking him and like he kept threatening about stuff. I'm like, well,

14:51.520 --> 14:56.520
where were you at? Oh, it's in Folsom. There's this, this trail behind my house. Don't be too

14:56.520 --> 15:00.880
specific, but yeah, it's like, you know, this trail behind my house and I'm like, Oh, was it

15:00.880 --> 15:06.480
this guy? And he's like, yeah, that's who it was. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I mean, it's,

15:06.480 --> 15:11.320
it, I don't really get to talk to a lot of people about games outside of the show. So, so orange

15:11.320 --> 15:15.920
lawns radio in a way is a safe space for gamers. Is that, is that what we're going to complain

15:15.920 --> 15:20.320
about on the internet? And that's still the same audience, but you know, it's hard to complain in

15:20.320 --> 15:27.200
140 characters, you know? I, I think my, my answer is, is kind of a combination between you

15:27.200 --> 15:32.600
guys is like, certainly this has allowed me to have a platform for something that I started in

15:32.600 --> 15:36.440
college, but didn't really see through to the end. Cause you know, in college, I had a college radio

15:36.440 --> 15:41.380
show and I was doing that weekly and you know, that's at one point what I was studying to do in

15:41.380 --> 15:44.480
college. I'm sure I mentioned this on the show before, but originally I wanted to be a weather

15:44.520 --> 15:51.720
man, believe it or not. And I, after interning at a local station, I kind of decided it actually

15:51.720 --> 15:55.560
wasn't like broadcast journalism and all that stuff actually wasn't what I wanted to do at all,

15:55.560 --> 16:00.160
because I just didn't really, I don't think I had the competitive personality for it. And you know,

16:00.160 --> 16:03.080
trying to get into radio and that too, it's like the same thing. It's like, it's just,

16:03.080 --> 16:07.400
it's just too competitive. And now, you know, in a way, thank gosh, I didn't really get into that

16:07.400 --> 16:11.520
because radio has kind of been hurting a little bit, at least the traditional model because of

16:11.560 --> 16:15.960
satellite, because of internet, because of, you know, the fact that people get their music in

16:15.960 --> 16:21.200
other places at this point. So in a way, I'm kind of thankful that I have this to have a platform

16:21.200 --> 16:27.600
for that, which I was interested in, but I wasn't interested in the industry. So this has kind of

16:27.600 --> 16:33.560
allowed me to have a place to feel that out on my own terms in a way. I mean, obviously this is a

16:33.560 --> 16:38.800
collaborative effort with my co-host, but you know what I mean? Still, I feel like I'm in a driver's

16:38.840 --> 16:43.000
seat, if nothing else, when it comes to this show and the other podcasts that have spun off of,

16:43.000 --> 16:48.720
of doing this show. So I think for me, big time, like this has been a great platform and, you know,

16:48.720 --> 16:53.000
also it's kind of Dark Sakura says, even though you kind of joke like, oh, it's something to do

16:53.000 --> 16:59.680
on Sunday in a weird way, every Sunday, there's not OLR. I'm kind of sitting there going, I should

16:59.680 --> 17:03.000
be doing OLR right now. Like it doesn't matter. Like it's like something in my biological clock.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.160
Like even if I'm in the East coast or, or like a couple of weeks ago, I was in Chicago, sure enough,

17:07.600 --> 17:11.880
eight o'clock comes around Chicago time. I'm looking at it going, I should be doing OLR right

17:11.880 --> 17:13.560
now. But I'm not.

17:13.680 --> 17:14.960
I sit at work going.

17:17.480 --> 17:22.120
I know, but your thing is temporary. And we already have a return date for you, right? December

17:22.120 --> 17:22.600
18th?

17:23.400 --> 17:31.480
Right. Although there is a chance that I may be here next Sunday. Because I am doing a day trade

17:31.480 --> 17:35.200
with somebody at work, but it's for an earlier event with the sisters.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.920
We'll take whatever Jamie we can get.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.760
Well, and I will explain that reference to people later anyway.

17:42.560 --> 17:47.880
Stoppy in chat wants to know, a weatherman, is that how the name Sky was born? No, funny, but no.

17:48.160 --> 17:53.440
That's just a name I had online forever back in DDR Freak. I'll give you the short spiel.

17:54.200 --> 18:00.440
Originally, a name I had picked online was Green Sky, because A, I like the color green. B, it was

18:00.440 --> 18:03.560
one of those things where like, if the sky was green, that would be different but cool. And that's

18:03.560 --> 18:07.160
kind of what I think I am, different but cool. That's like 18 year old me talking, okay, so it

18:07.160 --> 18:10.400
was a little different back then. But that was, you know, so that was kind of the name I picked

18:10.400 --> 18:15.080
for myself. And so that's actually where my like, my gamertag comes from, and where all that comes

18:15.080 --> 18:20.280
from, except the fact that Green Sky with SKY was usually taken on all these websites. So I had to

18:20.280 --> 18:25.920
spell it S-K-I-E. And then at one point, I just dropped the green and it was just Sky. So that's

18:25.940 --> 18:31.120
what it was. But now, it's funny, because now all these years later, I don't like it. I kind of

18:31.120 --> 18:34.560
stuck with it. But I think I mentioned this before, if I could get the Twitter account Rob

18:34.560 --> 18:39.200
Roberts, I'd be on that. I would give up my four letter Twitter name, if I could get that one. But

18:39.200 --> 18:43.560
since I can't, because some spammer has it, no matter how many people reported it to Twitter, I

18:43.560 --> 18:49.400
can't get that to get freed up. I just keeping Sky because it's four letters and it's, it's somewhat

18:49.400 --> 18:53.600
easy to remember, even if people think it's ski all the time, which is, which is fine, whatever.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.460
Going to chat, I want to see what the chatters have to say, because you guys have some really

18:58.460 --> 19:01.660
awesome things to say. And then we'll get into our gaming weeks. I know some people are like,

19:01.660 --> 19:06.980
isn't this a video game show? Yes, we've done 665 episodes of video game talk. We can take a moment

19:07.220 --> 19:13.100
to talk about other things. Let's see. Sturlock in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, in all

19:13.100 --> 19:17.100
seriousness, I'm really glad you guys made it this far. I haven't been listening as much as I used

19:17.100 --> 19:19.660
to, but I'm still a huge fan and always will be.

19:19.660 --> 19:21.780
That's okay. I haven't been listening as much as I used to either.

19:21.780 --> 19:28.300
That's fine. Yeah, we're only, we're only listening about half the time. No, I, and I understand

19:28.300 --> 19:34.340
that's the way it is. You know, people, people make this a thing that they do every week, but then

19:34.340 --> 19:38.940
something else comes up and they fall out of the habit. It's fine. Like, we have guests. They used

19:38.940 --> 19:44.220
to be here like every week in the early weeks of the show that I haven't heard from in years, or

19:44.220 --> 19:49.100
I'll hear from once in a while. Like, I'm thinking people like DDR Angel. I know she's still out

19:49.100 --> 19:54.060
there and I see her on Twitter and stuff. She's been doing a lot of YouTube stuff lately. Like

19:54.060 --> 19:59.340
Anita I see on Facebook once in a while. She used to come here all the time. I miss Janae. She used

19:59.340 --> 20:02.940
to be here a lot in the early episodes. But Janae has littles.

20:03.500 --> 20:09.340
Yeah. Well, she married and I can't remember what his username was, but he used to come to the show

20:09.340 --> 20:16.460
all the time too. She married him. Dark child? Dark cloud? That sounds right. Yeah. They got,

20:16.460 --> 20:21.660
by the way, y'all, they got married like years ago, but you know, that's just, that's just neat

20:21.660 --> 20:26.060
how that kind of all works out. I wonder, I don't think they met because of OLR, but you know,

20:26.060 --> 20:31.980
you got to wonder what kind of people maybe met because of this show. Let's see. William Murderface

20:31.980 --> 20:36.700
says, I've been listening for over 10 years at this point and y'all have always been a point of

20:36.700 --> 20:42.140
funny and insightful normalcy. Did somebody really use the word normalcy to describe this show?

20:42.700 --> 20:43.500
Climate, I guess.

20:46.380 --> 20:52.620
I guess so. I guess that's a very good point that I can return to during tough times. So thank you.

20:53.260 --> 20:58.540
You're welcome. Thank you for being here. SSJ100Matt says, the show gave me a great sense

20:58.540 --> 21:02.300
of community early on when I started listening. I have met and made friends with a lot of good

21:02.300 --> 21:07.180
people. It's kind of like coming home to family once a week for dinner, drinks, and laughs.

21:07.180 --> 21:10.700
I love that because that's exactly what I envisioned the show would be all these years

21:10.700 --> 21:15.820
ago is that, you know, after playing DDR, we would all go to the cafe that was right in front

21:15.820 --> 21:20.620
of golf land and talk shit about video games. And so now it's just a, it's a virtual cafe.

21:21.660 --> 21:27.980
Cafe, cafe, cafe. Immortal King says, has been a show that's kept me informed and entertained.

21:27.980 --> 21:32.940
It has broke the news of FNG live, has put out its own website. Oh, is it talking about this

21:32.940 --> 21:37.500
show? We're talking about all games maybe. And introduced me to Bobby Black Wolf, Travis and

21:37.500 --> 21:42.220
Jessica and Pod Culture. Oh, maybe because that's the point of a network is when all these shows

21:42.220 --> 21:47.500
are networked together, you start to meet other, other people, you know, and, and through, through

21:47.500 --> 21:52.380
these types of things. And, you know, obviously not just VOG network where we are now, but certainly

21:52.380 --> 21:56.620
we spent a good chunk of time at the all games network and they were fabulous and are fabulous.

21:56.620 --> 22:01.580
And, uh, Orange Launch Radio was its own network for a brief period of time in the early days. So,

22:01.580 --> 22:08.620
you know, and we tried to be pretty fabulous there too. So anyhow. Whew. All right. Um,

22:10.140 --> 22:15.260
let's see. Dark Tetsuya says, oh, sorry. Rama says, didn't Dark Tetsuya meet his now wife through

22:15.260 --> 22:20.780
OLR? Uh, Dark Tetsuya says she was a friend of Angel's, but yeah. And, uh, we're still working

22:20.780 --> 22:24.860
on it, but yeah, I don't, I don't think they, are they married? If they were married yet, I would,

22:24.860 --> 22:31.180
I actually somehow missed that. So congratulations if that's the case, if not, oops. Anyway,

22:31.340 --> 22:35.500
but I know they, they have a relationship if nothing else. So, um, that's fantastic.

22:36.140 --> 22:43.660
Anyway. Um, golly golly. Uh, okay. Dark Tetsuya says working on it. Okay. That's great. Uh,

22:44.540 --> 22:50.380
Rageinator says, OLR switching from live 365 to all games got me into listening to the live

22:50.380 --> 22:56.700
internet radio and started me on listening to Black Wolf. Um, that's, that's awesome. Uh,

22:56.700 --> 22:59.820
you know, that's the part, that's part of networking is being able to, uh,

22:59.820 --> 23:06.540
inner, inner work with other shows. Uh, let's see. This is a very random question, but I'll

23:06.540 --> 23:12.300
entertain it in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, uh, Barb in chat says, which is appropriate

23:12.300 --> 23:17.100
considering we're in the upside down tonight, uh, says, please give us some behind the scenes tea

23:17.100 --> 23:23.900
from GamerX. Who got the most tail? Um, well, I can tell you that I touched a few butts.

23:24.700 --> 23:30.620
I can tell you that Xtafer was the only one that went to GamerX East. So y'all draw your

23:30.620 --> 23:34.300
own conclusions. Cause I know he went out there for the East coast one, which sadly,

23:34.300 --> 23:38.140
you know, I really wanted to go and I wanted to support it, but it just, it wasn't enough notice

23:38.140 --> 23:43.980
for me. And hopefully we'll get a good six monthly time next time. Um, let's see, uh,

23:43.980 --> 23:48.220
one more here and then we'll get into gamer chat. Uh, Akuma JP says, I listened quite early

23:48.220 --> 23:53.500
originally to survey what gamers want, but now it's become kind of like listening to my friends

23:53.500 --> 23:57.260
talking about their weekends. Well, that's, that's awesome. We're glad you guys have stuck

23:57.260 --> 24:02.300
around as long as you have. Thank you so much. Even recent listeners or longtime listeners

24:02.300 --> 24:08.220
really, really, really appreciate it. So anyhow, let's get into some actual gaming talk, video

24:08.220 --> 24:13.180
games, and how was your gaming week? Dark soccer. I know we just checked in with you a few days ago

24:13.180 --> 24:17.260
during our special episode, which by the way, a lot of positive feedback on the taped episode

24:17.260 --> 24:21.020
midweek. A lot of people were very surprised to get an OLR on Wednesday, even though I thought

24:21.020 --> 24:24.700
we said we were going to do that, but still a lot of people very pleasantly surprised.

24:26.140 --> 24:30.300
We'll have to do it more often. What do you guys say? Three shows a week from here on out.

24:31.020 --> 24:35.260
Just kidding. Just kidding. I don't want to lose my goals. All right. Uh, dark soccer,

24:35.260 --> 24:38.860
how is your gaming week? What video games you've been playing this week? Um, well, I did my

24:38.860 --> 24:43.740
Overwatch, although I haven't played it yet. I just bought it cause I'm tired of being left out.

24:43.740 --> 24:48.700
I was crying in my blanket fort that I've been hiding in since the last Tuesday. Um,

24:48.700 --> 24:53.980
and I ran out of my box of wine, so I had to find something to play. Um, I've been playing well.

24:54.620 --> 25:01.500
Um, and also, um, after you told me about the animal crossing update that I totally didn't

25:01.500 --> 25:10.700
fucking know about, I am charging my DS. I've removed a happy home designer finally from my DS

25:10.700 --> 25:16.380
and I'm not fucking playing Pokemon. Well, that's unfortunate. Yeah. Cause I'll be getting,

25:16.620 --> 25:19.660
yeah, there you go. Thank you. I was like, cause I'll be getting into that in a minute.

25:20.860 --> 25:27.180
That's okay. I've got new animal crossing to do and bless you, Isabel. Bless you, Isabel for

25:27.180 --> 25:31.500
president. Cause the bitch hired somebody to clean all my weeds. That alone. Where can I get

25:31.500 --> 25:36.540
an Isabel in real life? Right? Where can I just get my own village in real life? Like fuck all

25:36.540 --> 25:41.820
y'all. This is Jamie country. Y'all can't come here. It's Jamie country. Remember in the early

25:41.820 --> 25:46.380
days of OLR, we were going to have a Fort and I believe there was, I think it started because

25:47.660 --> 25:52.060
I actually think ironically enough, that was a DDR angel thing because I remember on some of the

25:52.060 --> 25:57.180
road trips we took, cause she lived out in North Bay. You had to drive by this place cause it was

25:57.180 --> 26:00.780
kind of out in the, out in the country somewhere. You had to drive by this place that looked very

26:00.780 --> 26:05.580
scary. And like this guy had it all boarded out and it was like, keep out. We always used to joke

26:05.580 --> 26:09.500
that it was somebody's Fort that had basically seeded from the rest of the union. And I think

26:09.500 --> 26:15.100
that's where the talk of the OLR Fort started. We could though do like what the, what was it

26:15.100 --> 26:21.260
called? The dominion of sea land or something out, out off the coast of somewhere off England.

26:22.220 --> 26:29.260
Where they took just like an old abandoned water structure and made it a country. We should do

26:29.260 --> 26:34.940
that. If the Pope can do it, I can do it. If the Pope can do it, you can do it. All right.

26:35.500 --> 26:40.300
Uh, I'm assuming that's it for her gaming week. So Loki, Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:40.300 --> 26:45.100
Um, I did play a few things. I, I picked up watchdogs too. So I've been playing that a

26:45.100 --> 26:49.100
little bit. Um, can't say if I like it more than watchdogs one because I purchased watchdogs one

26:49.100 --> 26:54.700
when I first got my plays before still haven't played it. So that's fine. And then the watchdogs

26:54.700 --> 27:00.380
too is okay. I like it. Um, the story's interesting. The, you basically like a group of

27:00.460 --> 27:06.780
hackers. It's more of like, I don't know. It, the, some of the, like the parody stuff that

27:06.780 --> 27:10.780
they're doing, like that, the steel, like the first few missions, I had to steal a car. It

27:10.780 --> 27:15.500
was like kind of a Knight Rider kit type cars. So we had to steal that and that was pretty funny.

27:15.500 --> 27:20.060
Um, there's one he had to take down almost like a Scientology type thing. That was kind of cool.

27:20.060 --> 27:24.460
Um, I don't know. I'm enjoying it. I think it's somewhat interesting, I guess. Um,

27:25.420 --> 27:30.220
play more cluster trucks still really hard. Um, I've been playing that a bit more. I downloaded

27:30.940 --> 27:35.740
the demo for, um, track mania again because I want to try out the VR on that, but I still haven't

27:35.740 --> 27:41.020
gotten a chance to do that yet. Um, I did play some more ingress this week a little bit. Um,

27:42.700 --> 27:52.460
and let's see what else. Um, I think that's honestly it. I mean, I, I don't know.

27:52.460 --> 27:59.260
I went back to working on it's time of the car again just because, and ironically enough,

27:59.260 --> 28:05.900
as I mentioned before, you know, sitting on toilet, you know, you come up with ideas about

28:05.900 --> 28:10.380
like how to fix things. And like one of the problems I didn't like about the original game

28:10.380 --> 28:16.460
that I made, like I had this, this whole shooting stuff and just didn't driving and shooting and

28:16.460 --> 28:21.340
aiming. It's just, it was too hard to do all at once and it wasn't very fun. But then I came up

28:21.340 --> 28:26.380
with a control scheme that would work for that and I liked that a lot. So I'm going to kind of

28:26.380 --> 28:32.220
go that route and go back to what I originally wanted to do is kind of like a more of a bigger

28:32.220 --> 28:38.300
scope on that. The problem is, you know, once again being motivated, but I'm kind of getting

28:38.300 --> 28:42.940
started and just kind of writing down some ideas right now and just, you know, fleshing out what

28:42.940 --> 28:46.860
I want to do as far as engine wise goes and everything and rebuilding basically the whole

28:46.940 --> 28:53.260
thing. So hopefully something because of that. So speaking of building and all that, I saw a game

28:53.260 --> 28:59.500
that made me think of you, that would be a game that's totally up your alley. And actually I think

28:59.500 --> 29:03.180
Dark Sakura to some extent would really get a kick out of this too. I haven't played this game yet,

29:03.180 --> 29:07.740
but I just noticed it was on Twitch's like top games. I was on the Twitch like top games thing

29:07.740 --> 29:11.340
and I saw this game and I was like, what the hell is this? It's a game called Planet Coaster.

29:11.340 --> 29:15.340
Yeah. Have you heard of this? Yes I have. I've heard of it but haven't played it. Yeah. It just

29:15.340 --> 29:19.660
seemed like when I looked at it, I was like, this shit's too complicated. Like the menus,

29:19.660 --> 29:22.460
there's like a million things to do, but this looked like something that would be like right

29:22.460 --> 29:29.180
up your alley, Loki. Yeah. I mean, it's like a theme park type game. Way better than, you know,

29:29.180 --> 29:34.060
Roller Coaster Tycoon World or whatever than the last one is now. But yeah, it looks really cool.

29:34.060 --> 29:39.420
I was watching some stuff from Ollie43 today. They were showing off some different maps that

29:39.420 --> 29:44.060
people have made and stuff and it looks really cool. It's just, I don't know if I'd want to pick

29:44.060 --> 29:47.660
it up right away. I mean, cause you know, I'm trying to stay away from games that are big time

29:47.660 --> 29:52.780
sinks. Like I've been really wanting to pick up Skyrim, but I know how much of a time sink that's

29:52.780 --> 29:56.620
going to be. And I really am trying to focus on actually working on stuff and even Watch Dogs.

29:56.620 --> 30:00.300
I'm like, as a person, I'm like, damn it. Like, why did I pick this up? Cause now I'm not going

30:00.300 --> 30:04.780
to be able to work on my like game stuff as often. I'm like, I got to play this since I did pick it

30:04.780 --> 30:10.620
up. I am enjoying it a bit. I don't know. It's just, that's why I'm trying to stay away from

30:10.620 --> 30:19.420
stuff. And then the final fantasy, you know, 15, I mean, I'm trying, I know there's going to be

30:19.420 --> 30:23.820
somewhat of a drought after this. So, you know, I'm hoping that after these games come out, then

30:23.820 --> 30:27.100
there'll be a while before I purchase anything else. Jamie, did you have something you were

30:27.100 --> 30:31.020
trying to add there on Planet Coaster? No, it just was making me think about how people take

30:31.020 --> 30:35.340
those games and like do like the death coaster. Well, my favorite. Yeah. Go on YouTube. And

30:35.340 --> 30:39.260
there's some YouTubes where they'll yeah, they'll do the roller coaster tycoon where like the thing

30:39.260 --> 30:46.060
goes off the tracks and then it goes in slow motion and plays Adele. And I haven't laughed

30:46.060 --> 30:50.300
as hard in a very long time as like when I saw one of those videos. No, I mean like the actual

30:50.300 --> 30:58.380
suicide coaster that was invented as a form of, um, what's the word I'm thinking of? Assisted

30:58.380 --> 31:03.660
suicide. Euthanasia. Euthanasia. Thank you. It was meant to be a fun way for someone to die.

31:04.620 --> 31:10.540
Because I'm not, I just like the way it's phrased. It's for real. It's for real because

31:10.540 --> 31:14.940
when you hit like the first loop, you hit it at such a velocity that it makes you pass out.

31:15.660 --> 31:19.660
And then like the next loop breaks your neck or something. Yes, but does it play Adele?

31:20.540 --> 31:27.180
It can. If we can have Red Hot Chili Peppers on California Screamin', we can have Adele on

31:27.180 --> 31:31.340
the death coaster. Okay. Fair enough. I'm going to find this now. You have to see this thing.

31:31.580 --> 31:35.420
I don't want to see it. Not if somebody's writing it. That's creepy. They haven't built it. It's

31:35.420 --> 31:39.820
all theoretical. Oh, okay. But it's supposed to be. But they built it in Planet Coaster.

31:39.820 --> 31:44.620
People have built it in those games. Okay. I think that sounds like a whole bunch of fan wank.

31:44.620 --> 31:47.500
Honestly, like anyone's going to build a death coaster like that. I mean,

31:48.300 --> 31:52.460
you never know. You never know. I mean, that's what like Big Mountain Thunder was for.

31:53.340 --> 31:57.740
Stoppy and Chad says assisted suicide coaster. I think that would be just strapping yourself to a

31:57.740 --> 32:01.980
chair and throwing yourself off a building. It has a wiki. It's the euthanasia coaster.

32:01.980 --> 32:05.580
Oh my God. This is too much. All right. Look, I want to talk about my week. Look,

32:05.580 --> 32:09.180
you guys are getting way too sadistic. So I'm going to change the topic.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.500
Let's just put America on the euthanasia coaster.

32:12.700 --> 32:18.540
I'm changing the topic to Pokemon. Yay. Yay. Pokemon. Cute. Happy. Fuzzy wuzzy.

32:19.340 --> 32:24.380
I have been playing the shit out of Pokemon Moon. Probably not as much as some people. In fact,

32:24.380 --> 32:31.180
I know not as much as some people, Shane. But I'm a good like six hours in on Pokemon Moon.

32:31.180 --> 32:36.540
I just got to the second island. I've cleared the first trial and then the first because they don't

32:36.540 --> 32:41.740
have badges anymore. But I think it's measured. I think the equivalent is Z crystals because after

32:41.740 --> 32:46.940
the trial and the Kahuna battle fights you do, you get like Z crystals. So I have two Z crystals

32:46.940 --> 32:52.380
and I just went to the second island and that's where I'm at right now. And that took me a good

32:52.380 --> 32:57.740
like six, six and a half hours of gameplay to get to. I'm also very slow. And I also spent a lot of

32:57.740 --> 33:03.260
time because I was like, okay, this dude told me I could catch a fucking rock rough at this

33:03.260 --> 33:07.740
particular location. Why isn't a rock rough fucking coming up? And just for some reason,

33:07.740 --> 33:11.660
it took me that long. And A, I didn't know if it was in the cave or it was out back behind the

33:11.660 --> 33:17.740
cave. And spoiler alert, it's out back behind the cave. So don't spend your time in the cave

33:17.740 --> 33:23.340
looking for rock rough. But anyway, so yeah, I spent time on things like that. But I've been

33:23.340 --> 33:28.300
having a good time with Pokemon Moon. I gotta say this. It's definitely one of the, it's had one of

33:28.300 --> 33:34.540
the strongest impressions of most Pokemon games because I really feel like they've made so many

33:34.540 --> 33:40.060
quality of life improvements. Like for example, the fact that the moves will tell you what they

33:40.060 --> 33:45.260
do on the bottom screen when you hit the L and the A button, that's huge because I don't have to

33:45.260 --> 33:49.820
remember anymore. What the fuck did this thing do? Or I have to look it up online. It turns out

33:49.820 --> 33:53.100
it's the exact same thing as another move somewhere else. It's just a different type.

33:53.100 --> 33:58.540
Like that is huge. The fact that you will get told what moves are effective and super effective and

33:58.540 --> 34:04.460
not effective against a monster, as long as you've fought that Pokemon at least once,

34:04.460 --> 34:08.780
then the second time and beyond, it'll tell you like it'll have the built-in strength and

34:08.780 --> 34:13.180
weakness chart, which I know some of you might think is cheating, but at the same time, how many

34:13.180 --> 34:18.460
people either A, had that chart committed to memory, or B, would bring it up when they needed

34:18.460 --> 34:24.540
it, like me. So I think it's just a convenience that's built into the game finally. I love that

34:24.540 --> 34:28.940
they replaced the bikes with rideable Pokemon because the bike thing, especially when there's

34:28.940 --> 34:32.940
multiple bikes, just it was a pain in the ass. You had to go back to trade your bike, blah, blah, blah.

34:33.500 --> 34:38.780
I like the ride rideable Pokemon thing instead. So the only thing I don't like so far, here's the

34:38.780 --> 34:44.460
thing I don't like. I do not like how the little shits can call for help. That is a really annoying

34:44.460 --> 34:48.940
mechanic because it feels like there's nothing you can do to prevent it. Granted, maybe I'm not far

34:48.940 --> 34:53.820
enough in the game yet. Maybe there's a move where one of your Pokemon can like sprinkle the

34:53.820 --> 34:58.700
battlefield in fog or something so that that Pokemon cannot call for help. But it seems a

34:58.700 --> 35:03.260
little unfair because when the Pokemon calls for help, it does not take up that Pokemon's move for

35:03.260 --> 35:08.620
the turn. It's something that they can do at the very, very, very end of the turn. And then so it

35:09.500 --> 35:14.300
another Pokemon might show up. So suddenly you're in a two on one battle. Now, granted, I know the

35:14.300 --> 35:19.660
Pokemon X and Y had those five on one battles, but at least you kind of knew that from the start.

35:19.660 --> 35:23.820
And generally the levels were like way lower and that whole sort of thing. So I'm, I got to say,

35:23.820 --> 35:27.980
I'm not a big fan of the call for help thing right now, because it just seems a little bit like

35:27.980 --> 35:31.740
the deck is stacked against you in those situations. I just don't like being able to be

35:31.740 --> 35:40.220
better prepared for that. And I wish, or I should just say, I feel like this kind of encourages the

35:40.220 --> 35:45.740
use of items more than in prior Pokemon games, which maybe isn't such a bad thing. Like maybe

35:45.740 --> 35:50.780
that's the way the game kind of forces you to up it up, up it up a little bit. But I don't know,

35:50.780 --> 35:55.660
I just, I just not a big fan of that because again, I just feel like it's so hit and miss

35:55.660 --> 35:59.340
when the Pokemon is going to do it, if it's successful and then there's nothing you really

35:59.340 --> 36:05.340
do to stop it. So that's when you need to start packing some heat, like a gun. Exactly. It's like,

36:05.340 --> 36:10.460
fuck you other Pokemon. Yeah. I wish your trainer is in the battle with you now. I wish you could

36:10.460 --> 36:14.940
carry a gun, but you can't or a big stick. Yeah, I know he can't do any of that, but you can use a

36:14.940 --> 36:20.780
Z move. These really ridiculously over the top animation that are super moves. There's really,

36:20.780 --> 36:24.780
it's it's to replace the mega stones and it's right. I'm just going to use the Z stick and

36:24.780 --> 36:32.540
bash that fucking Pokemon in the head. Uh, uh, let's see, uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

36:32.540 --> 36:38.700
William murder face says no more HM slaves. Yay. Yes, that is true. They got rid of all that crap.

36:38.700 --> 36:43.980
Thank God. That was so stupid. How you'd have to have like a zigzag zoom or something that is only

36:43.980 --> 36:50.780
there to know cut and surf and like all the things you need to move around. Now, thanks to the

36:50.780 --> 36:55.980
rideable Pokemon. It's all built into that system, depending on what Pokemon you're writing is what,

36:55.980 --> 37:03.740
uh, like former HM you will have. They still have the TMs where you can teach a move like fault

37:03.740 --> 37:08.700
swipe, you know, which is kind of an essential thing for catching Pokemon. Although hot tip,

37:09.500 --> 37:15.820
if you don't forget, if you just got Pokemon moon, save your gay or son, of course, save your game,

37:15.820 --> 37:20.540
quit out to the title screen, check the internet right now, because there's a Munchlax.

37:20.540 --> 37:26.940
It's the preform of Snorlax. Uh, there's a Munchlax available, uh, right now on the internet that will

37:26.940 --> 37:32.220
get added to your inventory. And the Munchlax has a move that will reduce the hit points to one

37:32.220 --> 37:36.780
without killing it that you can actually get before you even get fault swipe. So just a little pro tip

37:36.780 --> 37:41.500
if you didn't realize that giveaway was going on. So, so yes, I've been spending time with Pokemon

37:41.500 --> 37:46.140
moon. And, uh, I think it's great. I'm sure there's a lot of people that are like, well,

37:46.140 --> 37:51.020
Rob, I've missed, you know, five generations worth of Pokemon games. Am I going to get into

37:51.020 --> 37:55.100
some Pokemon sun and moon? And obviously I would say, yes, you don't have to play the

37:55.100 --> 38:00.060
other adventures. They don't have any real continuity between them. I would say the only

38:00.060 --> 38:06.620
generation that this game has any sort of ties to well, I take that back. I take that back because

38:06.620 --> 38:12.300
a there are Pokemon from all the generations that show up and B there are some references

38:12.300 --> 38:17.420
like Shane was telling me that one of the gym leaders from generation five shows up in this

38:17.420 --> 38:21.180
game. So there are some, but like, they're not things that are going to like change the game.

38:21.180 --> 38:25.740
It's more like fan service-y things, but yes, red and blue, the original Pokemon games,

38:25.740 --> 38:31.420
which are kind of all the rage again because of Pokemon go in a way or were over the summer. Um,

38:31.420 --> 38:36.060
I think are the ones that tie in the most to this game because you've all heard about the Alolan

38:36.060 --> 38:40.940
forms. So it's like you have these generation one Pokemon sort of re-imagined that show up

38:40.940 --> 38:45.900
everywhere. So that's kind of cool. And then yeah, the characters red and blue show up and, uh, yeah.

38:45.900 --> 38:49.580
So there's just, there's some cool little references, but again, like even if you've never

38:49.580 --> 38:54.620
played a Pokemon game in your life, I don't think that you're going to miss anything or, or something

38:54.620 --> 39:02.380
like that by, um, by just jumping right into this. Again, the games don't have that much continuity.

39:02.380 --> 39:06.940
So, so yeah, that's, that's that I've been playing a lot of that. I was playing Overwatch

39:06.940 --> 39:10.780
quite a bit because of the free weekend that was going on on PlayStation four. In fact,

39:10.780 --> 39:14.940
I ended up just buying the damn game on PlayStation four because it's 35 bucks. A lot of

39:14.940 --> 39:20.700
places right now. I think it's online is 35 bucks. Amazon is 35 bucks. Uh, the black Friday sales are

39:20.700 --> 39:25.420
coming up. It's going to be 35 bucks in a lot of those places. So, um, yeah, I just, I bought a

39:25.420 --> 39:29.100
copy of Overwatch on PlayStation four so I can play with my friends there. So yes, now I have

39:29.100 --> 39:35.420
that game in two different places, but whatever. Um, I guess if I bought Mass Effect three on

39:35.420 --> 39:40.620
multiple consoles, I can buy that too, which reminds me one other game I played this week.

39:40.620 --> 39:47.180
I played Mass Effect three on Xbox one, thanks to the backwards compatibility. Just remember,

39:47.180 --> 39:52.460
you have to download the entire game once you put the disc in, and then you're going to have to go

39:52.460 --> 39:58.300
back and download all the DLC, including the online pass, if you want to play multiplayer.

39:58.300 --> 40:02.460
So just be ready for all those downloads. That's why it took me about a week to finally play Mass

40:02.460 --> 40:07.820
Effect three on Xbox one, but I did it and it looks great. And I'm so, so, so ready for

40:07.820 --> 40:14.060
Andromeda and especially the multiplayer. Woo. All right. That's it for my game a week. That's

40:14.060 --> 40:18.380
all I'm going to mention. So let's move on. Uh, special announcements. I don't really have a lot

40:18.380 --> 40:23.900
tonight. We'll be back next Sunday. Uh, we probably, we're, we're going to have something

40:23.900 --> 40:28.700
going on during the holidays. That's the only thing coming up because, uh, Christmas and new

40:28.700 --> 40:35.020
year, both fall on Sundays this year. And then January 8th, I happen to be at magfest, which I'll

40:35.020 --> 40:38.620
see you guys there. If you're going to magfest 2017, I finally bought my flight just this past

40:38.620 --> 40:42.780
week. So, uh, definitely, definitely going to magfest. Very excited to check that out.

40:42.780 --> 40:49.580
Uh, so see you guys there. Um, so there's that, uh, otherwise, um, yeah, we'll be here

40:50.220 --> 40:55.260
next week, week after that dark soccer will be back with us full time sooner rather than later,

40:55.260 --> 41:00.300
which is great. Uh, and of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and Facebook,

41:00.300 --> 41:04.940
facebook.com slash orange launch radio, all the great places to follow us on social media.

41:04.940 --> 41:11.340
Let's discuss some news with our chatters. What's going on on this 666 week of our show Loki?

41:11.340 --> 41:18.300
Well, of course it's gotta be more switch rumors. And so this kind of like obvious duh

41:18.300 --> 41:22.380
is saying basically that the Nintendo switch is going to be supposed to be getting a,

41:22.380 --> 41:28.060
a special version of, uh, Pokemon sun and moon called Pokemon stars. I think of like

41:28.060 --> 41:33.260
kind of one of the combined games that they do. Um, and that's supposed to be in development and

41:33.260 --> 41:38.300
I guess we'll launch in 2017. The other rumor I saw, which I was trying to find links to earlier,

41:38.300 --> 41:45.420
but couldn't find it was, uh, that Zelda's delayed to later in 2017. Oh, wouldn't that be

41:45.420 --> 41:48.940
in that? And here's the other thing that they're going to be launching with two Mario games.

41:48.940 --> 41:52.300
One is going to be a traditional Mario game. One is supposed to be a crossover with

41:52.300 --> 42:00.540
rabbits from Ubisoft. So like Mario RPG with rabbits, which is wait, Mario RPG, Mario RPG.

42:00.540 --> 42:06.780
Oh, samples if that's the case. Well, but Mario RPG would not, I mean the original Mario RPG was

42:06.780 --> 42:11.420
a square game, so there's going to be a lot that changes if suddenly Ubisoft's developing it.

42:11.420 --> 42:16.700
Right. And I thought the rabbit was just kind of done. Like, I don't know. I'm just kind of

42:16.700 --> 42:21.500
tired of them. I'd rather it be another square Enix, Mario RPG. I'd be all over that. But

42:21.500 --> 42:24.860
that's still an interesting partnership if that pans out to be, those are the other two,

42:24.860 --> 42:28.940
but yeah, it's something, I mean, this makes perfect sense. I mean, if you're trying to sell

42:28.940 --> 42:33.500
a console and you're going to launch Pokemon on it, yeah, why not? Well, it's in line with

42:33.500 --> 42:37.900
other rumors. We've heard previously about the fact that there is a Pokemon game on the switch.

42:38.540 --> 42:45.660
And I, although Pokemon stars sounds a little fan-ish, you know, like if...

42:45.660 --> 42:50.540
It'd probably be like Pokemon Dawn or something like weird like that, you know.

42:50.540 --> 42:54.060
I almost thought you said Pokemon DONG is what I thought you said right there.

42:54.060 --> 42:56.940
Pokemon DONG, have to touch them all.

42:58.780 --> 43:02.940
By the way, there is a mode in the new Pokemon games where you pet your Pokemon and you cure

43:02.940 --> 43:07.740
them of your status afflictions. So when you guys say Pokedong, my mind goes there

43:07.740 --> 43:15.340
because I'm sick. I'm a sick person. But anyway, I think that's actually in the

43:15.340 --> 43:20.780
name of the legendary Pokemon that's hidden on the hidden island is DONG and anus.

43:23.020 --> 43:28.540
Anyway, I would love to have a Pokemon game that's playable on the television.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.340
And I'm not talking about the whole like Game Boy Advance on the GameCube and all that stuff.

43:33.340 --> 43:38.220
I'm talking about like the, you know, one thing that really struck me about Pokemon

43:38.220 --> 43:41.820
Moon in the opening was that it's kind of a cinematic style opening.

43:41.820 --> 43:45.500
Well, that is the kind of, I mean, the 3DS one looks pretty nice. You know,

43:45.500 --> 43:49.020
Sun and Moon looks really nice. But like, can you imagine like when it's actually just

43:49.660 --> 43:54.300
strictly the Switch? I mean, they may still do 3DS because the numbers will be out there.

43:54.300 --> 43:58.940
But like, you know, you're going to have a specific Switch version that will be even much

43:58.940 --> 44:05.260
nicer because it's been a long time since they had a console Pokemon game. I mean, God, have they?

44:05.260 --> 44:09.980
I don't think they've ever, not a mainline Pokemon game. There's been plenty of like

44:09.980 --> 44:14.940
Pokemon Stadium and, you know, there's been other like spinoff Pokemon games, Pokemon Snap,

44:15.500 --> 44:22.060
right? But there has not been a true mainline Pokemon game created for a television console.

44:22.060 --> 44:26.860
The only way to do it is with Super Game Boy or one of those types of things. That's really the

44:26.860 --> 44:32.940
only way to do it. Which by that time, you know, the technology is so aged and the handheld by the

44:32.940 --> 44:36.860
time the Super Game Boy is out, like you feel like you're just playing a handheld game on your TV.

44:36.860 --> 44:41.980
You know what I mean? And the graphics were a real step back from where they are now. But I think,

44:41.980 --> 44:46.540
you know, something like Pokemon Sun and Moon is going to look really good on a television.

44:46.540 --> 44:49.660
So that, I think, I think that'd be really cool. I hope, I hope it is true.

44:50.220 --> 44:54.780
Yeah. It would be another way to push that Pokemon bank as well, because you know,

44:54.780 --> 44:57.020
that's the only way you're going to be able to get your Pokemon from the

44:57.580 --> 45:02.060
3DS games is through that Pokemon bank. I don't know. I'm interested to see what

45:02.060 --> 45:10.060
they say in January, I guess. Same, same. Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

45:10.060 --> 45:15.500
DarkTetsuya says, I was hoping it was called Pokemon Eclipse, you know, Sun and Moon.

45:16.380 --> 45:24.620
And JD in chat says, Sun, Moon, star fits with tarot cards. Oh, I didn't. Okay. So maybe.

45:24.620 --> 45:27.260
So when are we going to have the high priestess and the magician?

45:28.380 --> 45:31.740
Maybe, maybe they're gym leaders or excuse me, trial, trial captains.

45:32.460 --> 45:37.260
Since we, we mixed up the formula a little bit and anything is possible though in Pokemon stars,

45:37.260 --> 45:43.340
that's for sure. All right. Loki, would you check out Pokemon stars on the switch?

45:43.340 --> 45:47.020
No, I'm not a Pokemon fan. You wouldn't, you wouldn't give this one a try?

45:47.020 --> 45:51.820
I'm just not that interested, not enough to buy the game. I'd check a demo maybe, but I'm just,

45:51.820 --> 45:55.580
I never got into Pokemon. And unfortunately, I mean, the most I've gotten in the Pokemon

45:55.580 --> 46:00.060
was with Pokemon Go and I'm really not into that anymore. Even with the daily bonuses,

46:00.060 --> 46:04.540
it's just, it's so, there's no game there and it's really boring now. It's, I just,

46:04.540 --> 46:09.740
there's no point to it. Yeah, Niantic hasn't amped that game up as fast as I was really hoping. And

46:09.740 --> 46:13.980
I'm not just talking about like second generations, but like the, the stuff that people really want,

46:13.980 --> 46:19.100
like trading and battling, like that stuff really needs to happen by the end of the year.

46:19.100 --> 46:24.940
There's just like the gym thing is stupid. There's no point to it. And that's, that's kind of the

46:24.940 --> 46:30.700
main aside from like collecting Pokemon. But even then once you have them all, it's kind of nothing

46:30.700 --> 46:36.380
left to do. Yeah. Well, anyhow, of course, now that the news, the Nintendo switch is out there

46:36.380 --> 46:41.660
and it's everywhere, this leads to people trying to take advantage of the hype machine for something

46:41.660 --> 46:46.700
like this for their own personal gain. There's some stuff that's been spreading around the

46:46.700 --> 46:51.900
internet, places like Facebook, cause you know, I've never heard of fake things spreading on

46:51.900 --> 46:59.900
Facebook before. But anyway, apparently there is a fake Nintendo switch beta registration program,

46:59.900 --> 47:04.700
and you put in your email and you get your invitation code. But of course, if it sounds

47:04.700 --> 47:12.300
too good to be true, it probably is. In fact, some investigative sorts went and put in like

47:12.300 --> 47:19.020
a fake email in there and got an email that said, prepare for revolution. Congratulations. That's

47:19.020 --> 47:24.540
not a typo. You are eligible to join the Nintendo switch beta program. You are chosen, which means

47:24.540 --> 47:28.540
you can get into the Nintendo switch beta. You will receive the Nintendo switch beta hardware,

47:28.540 --> 47:34.860
which includes one system, one docking station, two switch controller, left and right, HDMI cable,

47:34.860 --> 47:40.220
one power adapter, as well as instruction booklet. Below you will find a code to redeem. Please note

47:40.220 --> 47:45.100
this code is specific for your account. So don't share this with anyone. And then of course the

47:45.100 --> 47:50.140
code is just a bunch of garbage. And that's as far as people have taken it. We don't know how

47:50.140 --> 47:54.300
far the scam goes, but you've basically given your email to somebody that knows you will fall for

47:54.300 --> 48:00.380
easy things. So just a reminder, and I know most of you guys know this, but just remember

48:00.380 --> 48:06.220
if something is too good to be true, it probably is. If there were to be some weird Nintendo switch

48:06.220 --> 48:12.860
beta program, and let me tell you, there won't be. When has Nintendo ever baited hardware like that?

48:12.860 --> 48:18.940
When have they needed to? They don't need to. You know how Nintendo betas this stuff?

48:18.940 --> 48:25.100
By only releasing five of them per store when it comes out. That's the beta test. The beta test is

48:25.100 --> 48:30.700
will you be lucky enough to pre-order this so you can get one day one. There will not be a beta test

48:30.700 --> 48:35.900
so don't fall for it. Please like at least understand now that Nintendo has been releasing

48:35.900 --> 48:43.340
consoles that have been short have shortages since 2007. By now they would have fucking understood

48:43.340 --> 48:47.740
you know supply and demand for their stupid consoles. They're doing it on purpose now to

48:47.740 --> 48:52.460
drive up demand. It is on purpose. It's not oh we didn't under, we didn't anticipate it.

48:52.460 --> 48:56.700
Bullshit. It is fucking to drive up demand. You can't be that ignorant for that long.

48:56.700 --> 49:05.100
So heads up, the smarter scammer, just an FYI, first off you're a scammer that's listening to

49:05.100 --> 49:09.100
this show. Go fuck yourself and turn it off. The show isn't for you. We do this show for free.

49:09.100 --> 49:15.020
I don't do this show for free for people to be assholes. But if a scammer out there wanted to

49:15.020 --> 49:22.140
be smarter about it they would do a program for a early pre-order or be the first to pre-order

49:22.140 --> 49:27.020
because everybody knows that's the shit that you really need to get in on because of what you just

49:27.020 --> 49:31.740
said. And that's where the massive rush is going to be is who can get their pre-orders in fast

49:31.740 --> 49:36.540
enough for one of these Nintendo switches. Because it's going to be you versus the um

49:37.340 --> 49:41.580
people that resell them for a higher value. Scalpers. It's going to be you versus the scalpers.

49:42.140 --> 49:46.220
Well you know how they could avoid that is releasing an adequate supply of the fucking

49:46.220 --> 49:53.980
system. I know it's such it's such a wild concept but yes that's what you fucking need to do.

49:53.980 --> 49:58.860
If please now if there happens to be gaming journalists that listen to this show I know

49:58.860 --> 50:03.020
there's a couple of you out there if any of you happen to be going to the Nintendo event that

50:03.020 --> 50:09.420
they're going to have in January you need to ask Nintendo what are they going to be doing to ensure

50:09.500 --> 50:15.180
that there's enough stock on launch day. Because I want that question asked sooner rather than later.

50:15.180 --> 50:20.060
I want Nintendo on the hot spot for that because I want to see what their answer is. Are they going

50:20.060 --> 50:24.060
to give a legit answer or are they going to say something like oh well you know we're really

50:24.060 --> 50:29.180
trying to work with our suppliers to ensure that there's enough to meet the demand but you know

50:29.180 --> 50:33.900
if there's some fucking cold water answer they're not going to do it because it's for them all the

50:33.900 --> 50:38.620
like news of people lining up for that console stuff makes it seem like it's you know the got

50:38.620 --> 50:43.020
to have thing if you see it sitting on store shelves and people are like well maybe they don't

50:43.020 --> 50:49.100
want it you know it's stupid but like you know even with the little NES mini I mean there's

50:49.100 --> 50:54.940
hardly any hardware in there and they still couldn't fucking pull that out. Now here's here's

50:54.940 --> 51:00.380
the the most important thing and I want us I want us all to make a pact all right listeners you guys

51:00.380 --> 51:03.820
us here in studio I want everybody to put their hand in the center because they're going to make

51:03.820 --> 51:08.940
a pact and now Jamie is going to slice uh put a slice with her knife and everybody's finger so

51:08.940 --> 51:17.340
this is a blood patch okay this is a blood pact do not under any circumstances buy a switch from

51:17.340 --> 51:23.500
a scalper we all agreed on that do not fucking support scalpers if you don't get the system day

51:23.500 --> 51:27.900
one then you didn't get the system day one and you'll just have to wait until Nintendo decides

51:27.900 --> 51:34.300
to fix the artificial shortages do not support scalpers under any circumstances

51:35.100 --> 51:41.020
or Jamie will not give your back your blood is this understood well I wasn't gonna give it back

51:41.020 --> 51:48.860
anyway uh vid power chat says blood pact how fitting for episode 666 orange right says suicide

51:48.860 --> 51:54.780
coasters blood packs yep it's 666 all right I'm glad we didn't disappoint tonight but don't you

51:54.780 --> 52:02.780
disappoint me by supporting a scalper understand don't you disappoint rob or next time Jamie's

52:02.780 --> 52:06.940
taken off the whole finger and then you're not going to be able to use that switch understand

52:07.660 --> 52:14.380
I'll take off your your little finger yakuza style all right I'll wear them on a chain not really

52:15.020 --> 52:19.020
I'll just probably like feed them to a shark or something because feeding fingers to sharks is

52:19.020 --> 52:24.700
cool uh jd and chat says I didn't realize we were playing trivia murder party oh just you wait

52:24.700 --> 52:31.100
the party's just getting started um let's see uh Maya asks has switch been confirmed to be region

52:31.100 --> 52:36.780
free yet uh nothing has been yes very little that's been confirmed at all pretty much if it

52:36.780 --> 52:41.900
wasn't in that trailer it's not confirmed uh there's rumors and we can bring out our wheel

52:41.900 --> 52:47.980
of plausibility uh however we don't know until January at this point the only rumors I care about

52:47.980 --> 52:54.380
is the album did you happen to see the youtube streamer or twitch streamer I think that was

52:54.380 --> 52:59.820
trolling everybody with oh look I've got a switch prototype and it was 3d printed sure buddy sure

52:59.820 --> 53:04.860
well he three printed one it looked pretty cool oh I saw this stuff on twitter and stuff and

53:04.860 --> 53:09.660
everybody that was calling him out on his bullshit and you know hey guess what that guy probably got

53:09.660 --> 53:16.460
how many more subs through that whole fucking fakity stuff but um so so he did yeah he has a

53:16.460 --> 53:21.100
how-to video on how he did and everything he you know messed up on the font but you know he was

53:21.180 --> 53:26.620
trying to get it out of that in a certain amount of time so and how many people fell for that if

53:26.620 --> 53:31.420
you're subbed to that guy you should go unsubscribe because you're just supporting that stuff just

53:31.420 --> 53:37.180
saying anyway uh let's see uh stop he and chat says the lettering on the buttons look like it

53:37.180 --> 53:45.180
was taken off a cereal box uh and ssj100 matt says don't support scalpers or you will never

53:45.180 --> 53:49.580
get to hear halo be the classic game of the week well you'll never get to hear that anyway

53:50.220 --> 53:56.060
because it's not happening all right what is happening another news story dar sagra

53:56.700 --> 54:02.060

57:22.460 --> 57:29.180
in chat live.com uh yyr says not me stop he says not me uh ray says not me my phone can't play

57:29.180 --> 57:35.820

57:35.820 --> 57:41.180
i don't know i'm just giving you crap uh yyr says i want to try it first and know how many levels

57:41.180 --> 57:45.740
it has well good thing there's that whole you know what it'll be like what the first level

57:45.740 --> 57:50.540
free and then buy the rest that'll be share where i'm not a huge fan of the new super mario brothers

57:50.540 --> 57:54.780
art style that's like my least favorite out of all the like stuff that they have in mario maker

57:55.420 --> 58:01.580
i like the older stuff yeah i kind of like stupid and cartoony i'm sorry i like doing the old stuff

58:01.580 --> 58:07.340
too especially a mario maker but i i certainly don't dislike the new uh supervisor it could be

58:07.340 --> 58:13.260
so much better like look at like wario wears um shake it or whatever or wario uh land shake it

58:13.260 --> 58:17.900
or something like that where it's all hand-drawn cell stuff like that would be fucking fantastic

58:17.900 --> 58:23.180
let's get a hand drawn you know so kind of the look a lot of the paper mario goes for

58:23.980 --> 58:29.820
sort of i mean a little less like papery but like i don't know even super paper mario is pretty

58:29.820 --> 58:35.980
awesome but i just don't like that new super mario brothers art style all right fair enough everybody

58:35.980 --> 58:41.420
has an opinion all right well uh moving on to a different large company and something that's

58:41.420 --> 58:46.860
been developing with them this week uh ea you know ea obviously a big maker of video games lots

58:46.860 --> 58:52.540
of big stuff out there and uh right now they're really trying to um make some rules when it comes

58:52.540 --> 59:00.220
to streaming games and youtube channels uh they want their partner streamers and youtubers to

59:00.220 --> 59:06.620
disclose that they're paid for sponsorships it's a new program that's called supported by ea and

59:06.620 --> 59:13.260
they are requiring that folks use logos that very clearly say supported by ea to make things clear

59:13.260 --> 59:21.260
when something is uh being supported by ea um so uh yeah anytime i guess they get like what travel

59:21.260 --> 59:26.460
just like they get traveled to an event or something that's fantastic yeah no i i think it

59:26.460 --> 59:30.780
is good i'm not like trying to shade or anything like that i do think it's uh it's really good i

59:30.780 --> 59:35.340
think a lot of this like first came out of germany or something like that well also i mean it's it's

59:35.340 --> 59:39.820
just um building on top of what existing laws they have in place already i mean you have to

59:39.900 --> 59:44.540
disclose that by law but normally it's within like the comments and stuff and i think you're supposed

59:44.540 --> 59:49.580
to disclose it also maybe in your video but they have very specific rules and this is you know nice

59:49.580 --> 59:55.900
to see support behind that yeah and uh wb games got in trouble for this a while ago if i'm not

59:55.900 --> 01:00:01.260
mistaken because the whole uh shadow of mordor thing that they had actually paid influencers

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:06.700
money to do positive videos about the game and apparently the federal trade commission got in

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:13.740
and said uh there's not proper disclosure here so this is probably a step for ea to prevent that

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:19.260
same thing happening by basically saying hey if we gave you any perks you need to make that clear

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:27.420
so that the warner brothers thing doesn't end up happening to us as well so uh yeah i i i agree

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:31.740
that that's a good thing and that whole kind of type of transparency thing uh i think it's good

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:36.700
to know i think it would be interesting too um the people that don't have that sponsorship and

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:41.660
that sort of thing like you know what what do they say and what do they end up doing so well in the

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:49.980
case of wb um the ones that didn't basically agree to those terms they got blacklisted from getting

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:55.500
a copy of the game unless they were going to do one of those positive uh wow you know a positive

01:00:55.500 --> 01:01:00.780
spin things they get or they'd get a code later or something like that yeah that's that is shady

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:04.620
and that shit needs to stop like even like bethesda bethesda is guilty of this too where

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:10.620
now they're doing it um where they're not providing review copies until after the product

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:15.340
comes out right right so i mean even though bethesda i'm kind of on the fence with that

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.420
though there's a part of me that's kind of like in a way especially in the environment we live

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:23.020
in now where everybody's a critic because of twitter and facebook and stuff like that

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:29.740
like in a way i kind of i kind of get it like but at the same time i also understand it can

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:34.460
be a little shady because they encourage all these people to pre-order and especially with

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.860
a lot of bethesda games they can be very buggy when they come out and so by not having the copies

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:43.420
out there in advance you don't know what the bugs are or if the game you know is even playable or

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:49.020
some audio issues if you're on like xbox one but i think people kind of have to challenge themselves

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:55.260
do they need to have the game day one if there's honest concern about these sorts of risks

01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:01.660
hmm it's tricky subject i don't know what do you think about the whole fact that bethesda doesn't

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:06.140
doesn't give out the codes anymore are you kind of for that or eh well a lot of offensive games

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.140
i kind of already made a decision if i'm going to purchase it or not beforehand and you know

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.380
them i kind of have an idea of what the quality would be like if it was ubisoft doing that

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:21.260
thing yeah i'd be very concerned by that because they're all over the place so i mean that's

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:27.580
i guess bethesda should be held to the same level of you know scrutiny i don't know with

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.620
skyrim it remastered it wasn't such a big deal because it's basically the the game's already

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:37.420
been out there for a while i mean you know i know their games are buggy in an entertaining way of

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:42.540
course but like if there's something really bad about it like the whole audio issue where they

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:48.140
like you know compressed to hell on you know two of the three platforms that's kind of a bad thing

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:54.540
i guess well but then you have something like doom which a lot of people would assumed would be bad

01:02:54.540 --> 01:03:00.460
because yeah a lot of those remakes aren't so hot the beta and i don't think they really did codes

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:04.780
in advance either for that well it turns out doom's probably one of the better games that's

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:09.660
been released this year well that's an excuse so that's it i know i think that just empowered

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:15.020
bethesda to do this is what that whole thing has taught them oh well there's a lot of companies

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:21.180
that get empowered by things that they think are great ideas ea and their stupid online pass or

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:26.300
all this like crappy dlc like especially in overwatch is equally the blame for this you know

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:33.180
this trend now where these pay to you know these games that have microtransactions in them you know

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:39.340
this loot crate bullshit that is just some terrible game practice right there that it's

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:44.780
like okay i paid sixty dollars or thirty forty whatever paid an amount of money for this and

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:51.820
for what this random lucha oh it's optional but you're it's it's presented to you all the time

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:55.900
it pressures you into a started that to be fair with mass effect of all things is really the

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.860
first place i remember seeing that i'm sure it was in another game it's probably been a

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:05.580
valve let's blame valve counter strike go um there's you know even payday two i know has

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.420
something like that but with as much as i love mass effect and i have it on all those consoles

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:17.100
and everything never once did i buy a box never once it's just i don't know it's even like hall

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:22.540
of duty now is doing it's like come on well activision and blizzard i mean i guess same

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:28.780
company now or same ish companies so i'm not surprised i don't know uh rage nator in chat

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:33.820
says i very rarely get games on day one anymore hell i can count on one hand how many steam games

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:39.100
i've pre-ordered i only pre-ordered due to bonuses free dlc ost's are an extra game well

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:45.100
that's those bonuses are how they get you sometimes i'll tell you all right anyhow uh let's

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:50.060
move on and uh dark soccer what do you have for us before we get to the classic game of the week

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:56.140
well i'm sure everybody knows by now that um we've had a big delay with the new persona game

01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:03.660
boo hoo there's a lot of salty people about that yes boo hoo well are you saying that a triple a

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:13.180
game got delayed in 2016 or now 2017 and no one is surprised get out get out out look i i realize

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:19.420
persona has their fans big time and they're they're salty about this but welcome welcome

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:27.980
to modern gaming i mean is there a triple-a game that hasn't been delayed lately because

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:32.780
i'm not ones that didn't look like shared i have like shitty problems i'm struggling to think of

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:39.020
one in the moment anyway sorry well well here's something to make everybody happy the greatest

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:44.860
monster series of all time digimon is coming out with digimon world next order and it's going to

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:51.820
be released on time so far um basically you there's a big digimon that's released out in

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:57.980
the world and you have to go take care of it you're the only one it's up to us and uh

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:03.500
yeah i mean it's just more digimon world i mean you remember the original digimon world that came

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:10.460
out on playstation one um when they release uh next order it's going to have a soundtrack for it

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:15.740
um for a pre-order and you actually get a soundtrack for the original digimon world for

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:22.860
your pre-order and you get an item that lets you evolve your uh partner digimon into a megamon

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:31.660
who is like badass so it will be out in europe on january 27th and in north america on january 31st

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:37.740
all right uh loki what do you have for us all right so this is kind of cool um

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:43.820
now not only a game that i'm interested in but nba 2k17 they're doing something interesting with

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:51.420
some connectivity with fitbit so there's a part of the nba 2k series where you have this my player

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:55.900
is basically your own you know basketball player that you're kind of taking through these leagues

01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:01.500
and everything and creating you know your own custom player basically um what they're doing

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:07.260
fitbit though is if you register your fitbit in the game you can actually sync the data um from

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:14.860
it and if you've reached 10 000 steps within the last day you get a plus five to all your attributes

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:21.260
for the next five games so it's kind of a bonus for doing exercise which i think is pretty cool

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:28.540
that's neat yeah so that's something that they're going to be starting on november 25th yeah there's

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.940
um you know i kind of like games that will kind of incentivize the whole fitness sort of thing i mean

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:38.940
even the nintendo 3ds kind of has this built in i think it's kind of not super used as well as it

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.780
could be but it gives you the coins you get for walking around i mean you have to have the big

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:47.740
bulky 3ds in your pocket but you still get the coins for walking around and doing stuff and then

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:55.340
you can use those coins in a lot of the like internal games and some of the uh external games

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:59.260
use those as well like i want to say the final fantasy explorers was last game i remember that

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:04.860
actually used those coins for stuff so um yeah i like that i like the whole like incentivizing

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:09.740
fitness sort of thing and it's optional right you don't have to do it you want to be lazy you can

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:17.180
but it's just something to add a little extra which is nice speaking of adding

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:23.500
something a little extra there is a brand new video game out there that contains fully rendered

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:32.300
penises and vaginas that's right not only do we have violence on episode 666 but we have nudity

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:38.140
so grand theft auto 5 nope it's well something that some may say was inspired by the grand

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:46.140
theft auto series it is watch dogs 2 that's right watch dogs 2 contains penises and vaginas now not

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:51.100
that they i don't believe they're like typically on display but they're just they're things that

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:57.500
are rendered there um some there's actually some like naturalists in the game that are fully

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.340
oh of course because it's san francisco of course so of course there's naturalists out there even

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:07.660
though i think at some point the city did finally ban it but like not in certain places or certain

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:13.500
times type of thing like there's a bunch of rules around it so anyway but anyway my point is if you

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:21.180
want to see a really low res low quality not that great penis or vagina you can see it inside uh

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:28.860
watch dogs 2 uh now apparently actually it went so far as to somebody actually uh like a character

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:34.060
i guess you could kind of just see the certain way but you could see you could see her vagine on full

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:40.380
display in the game and uh somebody actually used the share feature to share this to their page

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:44.140
because that's what you do on playstation 4 right you share your accomplishments so somebody was

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:51.900
like hey i found this and posted it to their uh ps4 share wall and they got a temp ban by sony

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:58.220
for posting nudity using the share feature i'm sorry that's in the game yes which left a lot

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:05.180
of people scratching their head but sony this is a game that you approved and is on your platform

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:09.980
and this person did not do any lead hacks or anything it just happened that the you know

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:15.660
it just showed oh hello there so i thought i'd share it with my friends um now after all the

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:20.380
you know twitter and the the noise that went in behind this because a lot of people you know i

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:25.020
can't imagine why a story like this got reported on everywhere but it did and so the guy got the

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:30.860
ban reversed obviously and ubisoft has come out since and said uh yeah we're gonna be patching

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:37.980
that out like oh well they're gonna be patching that one one specific npc to have clothing but

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:45.660
not all of them oh interesting so that one specific npc they said was the issue huh all

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:51.660
right apparently uh let's see uh in chat over at live dot vog network dot com tiger claw says

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:57.980
that's not the only game with penises there's a game on steam called genital jousting i have

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:04.140
yes i haven't seen that game but i heard it got banned from twitch this week because twitch

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:10.220
doesn't like i can imagine twitch does not like the vagine or the oh yeah that's or any of that

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:14.380
so basically general jousting i'm not really sure the whole gameplay part because i did watch

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:18.860
i've seen trailers for it and i watched uh jim sterling play it and he wasn't really sure of

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:23.820
what the actual what you're supposed to do in the game this is basically you've got these dicks

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:29.420
and these dicks have an asshole in between their testicles and so it's all about sticking your dick

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:35.340
into another asshole and yeah and so it's that and you can dress up your dicks and then like

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:42.300
after each round or whatever like it comes and like it's just it's ridiculous like you seriously

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:48.860
should watch the trailer if you haven't watched it yet just to get an idea this is gonna be great

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:53.980
for a podcast jamie are you doing this with me you know watch over here don't blink the consent

01:11:53.980 --> 01:12:04.540
oops i like how you can apparently dress up

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:22.220
no um i'm not looking at it anymore this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen in my entire

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.420
fucking life and i've seen a lot of his own existence

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.140
i've seen a lot in my life

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.940
that's not okay

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:59.740
what the fuck is this called genital jousting this is why we can't have nice things

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:07.980
this is why gamers have a reputation i'm not looking anymore i can't it's too bad that that

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:13.900
hasn't hit the mainstream news outlets you know yet they can't show it on tv so that's not on

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:21.180
console and then they definitely can't show that on tv so pc pc is no man's land so yeah maya and

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:25.580
chat over at live.vongnetwork.com says these noises are vivid yeah you guys didn't even have

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:31.660
to see and be thankful in a way it was full of splorch noise i mean like yes the noises tell you

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:38.860
all you need to know it was it was disgusting i should show that to my mother i don't understand

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.500
where the dash hounds have anything to do with it they're wiener dogs but like do you shove the

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:50.620
wiener dog into someone's eyes no no no not okay not okay shut it red card penalty

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.300
bite the dicks i mean what i don't understand where they play there

01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:00.140
and then they won fuck the planet so that was interesting anyway i don't know how that started

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:07.420
with watchdogs 2 and ended up with that because they're dicks anyway oh by the way uh apparently

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:13.260
uh part of multiplayer in watchdogs 2 also got stripped out the seamless multiplayer currently

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:19.100
inaccessible it was supposed to be fixed by launch but it wasn't so they're working on it

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.660
please look forward to it coming soon the features that we advertised

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:31.820
and i know that we haven't talked about how about that assassin's creed remaster oh my god all i see

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:36.860
were those pictures on twitter and i was like what did they remaster did they get did they get that

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:42.780
woman who retouched the photo of jesus to do the remaster like what in the world that guy looked

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:50.140
like alissa edwards it's like that's not that that's not like someone draw that name as paint

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:55.820
i mean i i don't know i don't even know like if you're gonna remaster the game you're supposed

01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:59.580
to and this this goes for the silent hill remasters that happen a while the what the two

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:04.460
and three uh or is it three and four it was two and three right where they did the whole new voice

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:09.980
cap it wasn't that good no one that could anyway let's take a trip down memory lane shall we

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:16.300
let's go back to a time when there was no patches if your game sucked when it launched then it

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:21.980
sucked forever it's the classic game of the week and dark soccer is back doesn't need radio magic

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:29.260
or anything she's here dark soccer with this being episode 666 i know you picked a good one i did so

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:37.020
what is the classic game of the week i on purpose kind of on purpose i picked it on purpose but i

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:42.060
kind of not on purpose saved it but i figured this is a perfect time good play the music rob

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:53.740
i'm working on it well hello i picked silent hill i've done every other good silent hill game

01:15:53.740 --> 01:16:01.740
except for silent hill so yes so um if you don't know what silent hill is then

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.460
get your head out of somebody else's ass

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:08.540
which was what they were doing in genital jousting

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:17.260
but it is a survival horror game it's not like the i mean it's got jump jumpy scares in it and

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:23.980
things like that but i don't even put it so much as the same category as like resident evil because

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:31.100
this has a lot more of a psychological drama to it i think um but it was developed by team

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:38.460
silent and tokyo um it is the first of course silent hill game it came out in north america

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:47.100
on january 1999 and then um in japan and europe later on in the same year it has a third person

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:55.740
view um real time 3d environment so that's where the fog came from they basically used fog and

01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:03.020
darkness to um uh prevent like the draw in that you normally would get in that first generation

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:10.860
of playstation game if you want a good example of draw and just play daytona on the saturn just

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:19.580
saying anyway um and uh the main character is not anyone with any kind of special training or

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:29.180
anything he's just a guy a guy named harry he's missing his adopted uh daughter and uh he's

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:37.500
looking for her in silent hill where he finds out there's cult shit and so um you get uh five

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:43.580
different possible endings based on how you play the game and what you do and special things that

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:54.380
happen um it was really one of the best games of its genre um it was just really high credits when

01:17:54.380 --> 01:18:03.180
it came out um there have been uh many adaptations of it as well we've even had um a visual novel that

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:11.020
came out in 2001 in 2006 we had the movie silent hill which it was faithful enough i mean

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:18.860
changing the protagonist and everything but um it had the feel of the games very well i should say

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.300
and then of course a reimagining of it called silent hill shattered memories that we don't talk

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:31.020
about um and then of course uh the second game silent hill 2 came out in 2001 so um it has a lot

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:37.340
of you know puzzles in it um you've got you know to survive the things that are trying to stab you

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:43.340
in the legs you know the little evil children and um you get different melee weapons and firearms

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:50.460
and uh you know you've got a health bar you can refill your health um you also have a little

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:55.500
portable radio that it will start playing a lot of static and let you know when enemies are nearby

01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:00.540
and to me the first time i can play in that game and hearing that static and static sounds just

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:06.860
kind of freaked me out anyway but i was like holy shit what's this going on especially because like

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:12.140
the rest of it was really quiet but then again i mean you've also got you know akira yamaoka doing

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:19.260
the music i mean that right there such a unique style he's got and it really very well fits the

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:29.100
game um so as far as um the um design of it now this i didn't know is that uh yamaoka actually

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:34.700
requested to compose the soundtrack the original composer quit and he asked if he could do it

01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:41.660
that's cool um but team silent um was made up of staff members from uh the konami computer

01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:47.740
entertainment tokyo group um and they wanted they actually wanted to make a game that would

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:55.740
be successful in the us so they get used uh uh hollywood-like uh atmosphere in the production so

01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:02.460
um basically without going into um too much more about it because i mean this is a game

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:10.380
that everyone should have played um they basically gave them as much artistic freedom as they could

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:21.660
um and said just do it make it happen so um as far as um there's actually quite a bit about this

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:29.260
one here um the different um uh mythology though that the series created was i mean

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:34.060
people have actually just sat and tried to draw you know where do they get their inspirations

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:42.860
from some of it came from certainly from judeo christian um uh mythos but uh very very

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:49.500
interestingly um you know there's also the characters in the games had their names taken

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:57.420
from um other characters in popular culture um including um alyssa came from the lost world by

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:04.700
um uh sir arthur conan doyle um and uh from uh louis carroll's alice's adventures in wonderland

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:11.900
um there were uh real life people like cheryl mason came from uh the actress cheryl lee

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:19.260
just spelled differently and uh lisa garland came from judy garland michael kaufman is

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:26.460
a combination of um two of the troma studios producers you know what troma did right oh like

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:32.060
tromio and juliette the toxic avenger the killer tomatoes and all that i don't know that troma did

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:36.780
kill tomatoes oh i thought they did no they did their big one was they did they did okay but i

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:44.700
know their biggest one was the toxic avenger um uh but the other the other big thing is um and this

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:49.340
is you know things that came up to me afterwards is that they actually took a lot of symbolism

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:55.900
from kabala so it's kind of interesting it seems kind of a popular place to take stuff from but

01:21:55.900 --> 01:22:05.420
we'll see um but anyway um going back to uh its release um it was really hard for it to pass

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:12.940
sensors outside of japan like the gray child monster um it had to go through uh two different

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:19.500
design changes and for the us and four for europe before it was approved by sensors it was just

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:24.540
supposed to be knife wielding nude children but they said that it was a little too graphic and

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:29.580
might be a bit much well i think what they turned them into is actually a little creepier the

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:36.940
faceless gray larger children with the huge head um in the european version the gray child was

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:43.980
replaced by um the mumblers which were also um later on in the game in north america um

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:49.660
and also in uh the end of the european version the gray child monsters are there as

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:59.180
transparent silhouettes um but yes silent hill came out january 31st um 1999 in japan on march

01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:04.940
4th in europe on august 1st and it was also included in the japanese silent hill complete set

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:11.820
in 2006 um it was available for european playstation network and ps uh sorry playstation

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:19.420
network download for ps3 and psp um on march 19th and that was in europe and then two days later

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:25.900
the game got taken out because of unforeseen circumstances it came out in the u.s um for psn

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:35.580
on september 10th 2009 so there have been adaptations of the story um there was a game

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:42.300
boy advance version that was titled play novel silent hill and it only came out in japan in 2001

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:49.580
and it was a game book style visual novel that told the story through uh text and um you would

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:55.340
every so often you know do puzzles and you know try different things and you also have the an

01:23:55.340 --> 01:24:01.340
option when you beat the game of playing through as sybil the officer from the game um and then

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:07.900
there was a another third mode um that was there too but i don't remember much about it because i

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:12.140
like looked at that game for five seconds and i couldn't play through much of it because i couldn't

01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:20.140
read it very well um there was of course the movie silent hill um which was i loved it and

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:27.580
the the music was still done by yamaoka so it was great and it was faithful to its source material

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:35.020
and then there was silent hill shattered memories which was developed by climax studios um it was

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:43.420
it was special it wasn't bad i don't think it was great it was basically um

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:53.020
having to do with the character being in therapy and reliving the events so um silent hill um

01:24:53.820 --> 01:25:04.540
got an 86 of 100 um by metacritic and uh while it's been um compared to resident evil there really

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:10.700
are kind of night and day this one's to me also a little bit edgier you know it it hits the mind

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:17.180
in a certain way it reaches into the psyche as opposed to just oh big ugly scary dog thing

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:30.940
oh stars that was three um and also it has been listed by ign as the 14th best playstation game

01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:37.260
to ever be released couldn't they have just given it lucky 13. why did they have to do 14 come on

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:47.740
come on so this is also the game that gave us the alien ending fucking weird

01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:55.660
all right is that it on silent hill um no all right well if you haven't checked out this game

01:25:55.660 --> 01:26:05.180

01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:17.340
that we don't want to miss loki so we have some news regarding the minecraft movie which is

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:24.060
supposed to be coming out in a couple years here um apparently there is um he talks with

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:32.220
steve correll as the role of steve in the minecraft movie so um you know that it's possibly

01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:37.980
he may be playing steve or somebody else um but he is in talks you know to be working with the movie

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:46.700
um that'd be fucking hilarious i mean after all it's being directed by um rava mcgalley which

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:53.180
you know it's always sunny in philadelphia and you know writes that and directs as well um so

01:29:54.140 --> 01:30:02.380
just that combination sounds fantastic so i look forward to that 2019 unfortunately is when it's

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:08.460
but our may 2019 is when it's scheduled to be released all right and then if you want to get

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:15.500

01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:27.180

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:59.260
i kind of watch some gameplay of it and you know it's got all the classic characters in there and

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:04.220
everything and just you know the same sound effects i think just instead of making their

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:09.900
own sound effects just straight over them from doom but hey why not so go check it out that sounds

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:16.540
fun uh we've got award season starting and uh yeah it's that time of year where we give out

01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:22.220
awards to all sorts of video games and the golden joystick awards just happened this past week

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:26.220
i don't i know this is overseas this is something they do in the uk but is this

01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:30.620
loki you know what organization puts this on is this a magazine i thought for i was having

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:35.660
confused with you when i saw this i was like thinking game developer awards but i was like

01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:41.660
oh wait you know and then it's like wait jeff kealy show no no that's the game awards that happens

01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:45.420
later on so i don't remember which organization puts us out but

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:49.420
all right well everybody's going to be given out but all i have to say is there's way too

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:55.580
many nominations for no man's sky uh let's see so the bet well actually i don't see no man's sky

01:31:55.580 --> 01:32:01.820
winning any awards on here actually as it should uh the the best original game went to overwatch

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:07.580
uh let's see the best indie game went to fire watch uh let's see and laura croft was inducted

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:13.980
into the hall of fame uh the creator of stardew valley was given a breakthrough award uh pokemon

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:19.660
go the handheld mobile game of the year and the ultimate game of the year was dark souls 3

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:27.500
was the the i which i guess is their best picture oscar there so uh dark souls 3 which uh i'm i'm

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:31.740
surprised but i haven't exactly played that game really either because i get so infuriated very

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:36.700
rapid fans yeah yeah so uh i know that i know that series has its fans so maybe i'm missing something

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:40.780
i would have just assumed overwatch is going to win everything this year but maybe i don't

01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:44.540
know final fantasy 15 maybe i don't know but it's still too early for final fantasy 15 just like

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:49.500
there's no nominations for um the game awards i think for final fantasy 15 i think i'm not

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:54.940
positive but oh really oh really because maybe because nobody's had a chance to play it yet

01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:58.780
because it got released too late but i always thought they still somehow the game awards is

01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:04.780
i know the golden joysticks does not so i don't think those final fantasy wasn't nominated for

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:12.700
anything on that but you know next year will be cool too all right uh let's see and funny in chat

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:17.180
yyr says it's really something to hear loki's complete reversal on no man's sky he was so

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:22.140
gung-ho about it before it released times certainly changed we hit the nail on the head my friend it

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:26.780
released exactly there was there's a lot of people that had issues with with what turned out i don't

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:31.180
i still think it could be made better with vr that'd be pretty fun yeah i'd go back and check

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:35.420
it out i don't think it's as horrible the game as most people are making it out to be however i

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:38.940
don't think it's going to be a game of the year it's it's a game that gets born very fast yeah

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:45.820
uh also hey how about some music game news to go at 20 november it's not a konami game but i'm sure

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:51.260
a lot of you follow this series anyway it's dj max and dj max respect is going to be coming out

01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:59.180

01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:15.180
from across dj max portable dj max portable 2 and songs from other dj max titles to be download

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:19.740
content arcade mode mission mode online mode gallery mode and so forth now it should be

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:25.500
pointed out this is going to be the dj max that involves the falling notes that you hit with

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:31.180
buttons on your controller like left right up on the d-pad square triangle circle it is not

01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:37.900
touching the screen elite beat agent style like the dj max was on the psp like psp technica yes

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:44.460
so um just just so you know it's different type of dj max but that's more in line i think i think

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:48.380
there were dj max games on the psp that were very similar to that so that's what you're going to be

01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:53.020
getting on the ps4 so i'm sure i'm sure a lot of you music game fans will be into that and checking

01:34:53.020 --> 01:35:01.740
that out next year dark sakura well we do have some uh other little news about uh some zelda stuff

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:11.340
computer to bring up the page now okay there we go so um there is an escape room

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:18.860
game coming out called defenders of the triforce and it is a uh

01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:26.060
a group puzzle story event that's being hosted in eight different cities in the us

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:31.580
looks like a real world one so basically different teams are going to come together in the area and

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:37.420
solve puzzles and items and definitely recover the triforce so the experience will be in san

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:45.500
francisco phoenix seattle chicago los angeles san diego houston and new york you know these escape

01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:51.740
room things these are the things that shane was raving about when he was uh doing the um like the

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:58.220
trips and stuff he was he was uh doing these escape rooms and spoke very highly of them so

01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:01.500
don't they have like a resident evil one coming out or silent hill or something like that i think

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:06.300
it's resident evil i would do a silent hill one yeah well and i'm sure like most things nintendo

01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:10.540
there won't be enough supply to match demand especially if they did like you know only eight

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:17.100
cities or what have you so and in other news what the mass effect is coming out on vinyl

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:24.940
the album and i needs them i needs them uh the for the whole trilogy or just the first game for

01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:29.020
the whole thing oh that's pretty cool i'm sorry those aren't gonna fit in your playstation 4 or

final fantasy 15 finally gonna be making its way out well actually it's on the let's say the 29th

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:26.300
so that'll be yeah i was gonna say unfortunately it's after thanksgiving when final fantasy finally

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:31.500
yeah that's lame no it's not it's still it's a Tuesday Tuesday that's right anyways well i

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.860
was hoping that was coming out next week unfortunately but i will have to wait a little

01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:40.300
longer for that this week uh not a whole lot so we've got bat um batman the telltale series episode

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:45.740
four uh guardian of gotham that's gonna be coming out on most platforms looks like mobile uh

another remaster of darksiders why i don't know um but that's on playstation 4 weu and xbox one

01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:06.220

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:40.540
following week as well damn that final fantasy 15 see it really should have come out this week

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:46.220
because you know then all that time off now i have to wait yeah that's all right i gotta play your

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:52.380
backlog yeah they're backlog yeah all right traveling to japan time let's uh check out what's

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.980
over there actually it's pretty quiet in japan this week at least on the playstation 4 i think

01:38:55.980 --> 01:39:00.300
that's because final fantasy 15 you know we are ramping up getting closer to that but there is a

01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:05.180
pretty big release uh sengoku musou sonata maru comes out this week in japan that's what dynasty

01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:09.820
warriors right that's just what they call it over there um so that is a release on the playstation

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:15.020
4 then the playstation vita is getting that same release because playstation vita still gets a lot

01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:21.020
of releases and actually a lot of releases on the vita this week uh traveling stars id rebirth and

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:27.020
code realize shukufuku no mirai comes out here's the thing that is really silly if you think about

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:33.420
it and this is consistent week to week there's more releases coming out even in the us on the

01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:39.820
vita than there are in the 3ds right i know right and yet no support for like what the hell sony

01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:45.100
come on like step it up i understand that you're kind of like oh it's never never gonna win

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:50.700
so step it up i mean you have so many games coming out all right well speaking of the 3ds

01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:56.620
uh it's no slouch of a week over in japan uh we do have some games coming out on the 3ds including

01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:03.260
rpg sukuru fest comes out this week i'm not sure if this is like a design your own rpg game it's

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:06.780
what it kind of looks like to me based on the screenshots is that it's like kind of like because

01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.980
it's a very kind of basic rpg but then one of these screens kind of looks like it might be like

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:15.820
a make your own type of thing but that is out this week in japan was it called again um you

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:22.780
asked that when i just closed it rpg sukuru fest it might be rpg maker i want to i thought they

01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:28.300
were doing like no that was thinking i i think there's one that's coming to mobile well then

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:34.380
there's also ikatsu stars my special appeal comes out this week on the 3ds and that looks to be

01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:39.180
another one of those idol style games where you you know kind of you can tap the buttons and to

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:43.580
the beat and then play barbie dress up with your characters and everybody loves those uh and then

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:52.060
lastly on the 3ds this week uh tetsudo nippon rosen tabi aizu tetsudo hen comes out this week

01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:55.900
and this looks to be one of those train simulator games on the 3ds which unfortunately we don't

01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:00.140
really get any of those here but i gotta say just looking at some of like the pictures here it looks

01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:03.740
it's very it's a pretty looking i think that's where steam comes in handy because i'm pretty

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:08.300
sure they've got all the simulators on steam i'll have to i'll have to check out some of those

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:12.380
because yeah this this actually looks like it might be kind of neat but yeah it's not

01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:17.740
something that i would have to get pretty i missed the densha de go series i need to get misty's

01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:21.660
opinion on this because she's the biggest train fan i know but these these games we need a vr

01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:26.300
train game i bet they've got that oh i bet they do have something like that they've got to like

01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:32.940
at least one of those experiences or something like that i swear that um i yeah when i saw like

01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:39.340
an imax i want to say i saw like an imax movie randomly where the hell was i was it seattle

01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:44.140
or something i saw an imax movie that was like a train and it was trains going across canada

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:49.500
and it was this whole documentary about trains or was it canada or was it i don't even remember was

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.780
obviously this is a while ago that i saw but i feel like it was it i feel like it was when alan

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:57.100
and i were in seattle we saw something at the imax like the science the pacific science center or

01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:02.140
whatever it's called there and it was like a train imax movie but it was i mean it was very pretty

01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:07.180
obviously as you would expect the other fun one i like is the uh video that was one one of those

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.940
train simulator games where i think you can make your own tracks where they did train drifting

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:14.940
where they have the back wheels on like different tracks in the front wheels no that'll be eurobeat

01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:18.380
in the back yeah that only works if you play eurobeat and it would have eurobeat in the back

01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:23.580
okay good good train drifting it's awesome you gotta seriously watch i want to see the fast and

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:28.380
the furious but it's about trains and it's about the california bullet train that they're never

01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:32.140
gonna fucking build even though what that was approved in what 2008 they're never gonna fucking

01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:42.300
build it anyway uh dark sakura hey we've missed you doing the uk releases the united kingdom is

01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:57.420
one meme that's like and now you know brexit happened it can't get worse than that and us is

01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:06.380

01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:16.460
noise i'm very good at making noise dark sakura i'll make noise but also though occasionally

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:21.980
running away from your problems leads to disneyland that is true and in chat uh akuma jp is

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:29.820
asking rob is visiting japan too you know i hadn't been planning on it but well fuck it why not i

01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:53.580
why don't i lose a friend too in 26 well actually that would be 2017 but wouldn't that just be the

01:43:53.580 --> 01:44:03.420
icing on the cake anyhow hey you saw the 22nd we have pokemon moon and pokemon sun yay on the 24th

01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:12.940

01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:17.660
news articles here uh and then we'll get to the phone calls better than beating the meat

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:22.380
orange lounge radio we already talked about the game um oh we need to get to the mailbag actually

01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:27.900
we had a last minute email that came in uh dark sucker i forwarded it to your um address yes

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:34.460

01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:40.140
emails participate at orange lounge radio.com and some of you wait until the very last minute to do

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:46.860
it yeah rage nader but in the absence of no other emails to read if we didn't get this one late

01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:54.940
breaking yeah rage nader we're gonna read this one from rage nader this one's from yyr kidding

01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:01.020
kidding kidding kidding kidding this is from rage nader i like the idea of crediting emails

01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:10.380
to different people hi folks rage nader here just a short last second email every so often

01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:16.300
a game or series of games comes along that we end up becoming a fan of this is so tiny

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:21.820
god i'm just gonna put it up to my nose but for whatever reason that game or series dies out a

01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:28.060
developer folds the rights a holder loses interest in publishing it etc that being said if you have

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:32.860
the ability to do so what ip would you buy up inject a new life into and publish new entries

01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:37.580
for for me it would be the socom franchise but i'd have it published on pc and console

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:42.700
how about silent hill i was gonna say easiest oh i was gonna say easiest fucking question i've

01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.660
ever been asked but i thought jamie would take my answer but apparently she's not

01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:49.820
what you're gonna say silent hill yeah because it's been shit after four

01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:55.740
fair enough uh i'm gonna make you wait loki what would you pick what rights to the game

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:59.100
would you buy oh i know what this is because you've been saying it for years

01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:04.620
what rights would i buy i mean god i don't know i mean it could be a couple things uh

01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:09.020
i'd either do dance dance revolution excite truck there you go that was the answer i was thinking

01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:16.780
or saints row because i could do some kick-ass things with saints row saints

01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.300
rose not exactly dead though i don't think those rights are being given up anytime soon

01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:30.220
i don't know about that and then my answer dark socra will be this little game that was on the

01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:36.540
nes many years ago the guardian legend it was a small series guardic wasn't that great no guardic

01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:41.020
was kind of like the only reason people know of guardic is because of the guardian legend that's

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:47.180
seriously all it is so uh yes we need a new game now here's the funny thing now jamie you've been

01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:52.220
out a few weeks so you may have missed this um the other game i would have suggested is blaster

01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:57.020
master but it's somebody did it somebody bought the rights the japanese company bought the rights

01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:01.500
they're making a new 3ds game that is a retro style but it's gonna have some new stuff that

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:04.860
you would have missed would it cost for us to get the rights for the guardian legend

01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:11.820
i i don't know but i'll bid five dollars i've got ten fifteen dollars right dollars for the

01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:17.260
guardian legend you want to help on a dollar all right sixteen dollars the guardian legend

01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:22.380
maybe we should make this a kickstarter go fund me let's do it let's do a kickstarter

01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.900
our first kickstarter orange lounge radio buying the guardian legend

01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:32.940
i've come on compile you can let us have it i've never turned to kickstarter for anything

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:38.700
but this might just do it this might just do it uh anyway uh dungeon buster says orange

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:43.900
lounge legend i just uh who has the guardian legend ip didn't we track it down at one point

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:47.980
and i thought we did i know it was originally compile um because it was made by compile

01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:54.540
somehow i went to see this title which would be square enix right fuck i want to say well

01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:59.020
actually all we have to do is find the people who are doing the reimagining and then see who sent

01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:06.540
them the cnd great question someone was in a reimagining yeah it looks pretty neat um the

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:15.660
internet of course somebody was doing something hey bloodhounds of vog look for us all right

01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:21.020
this is biad by the rights for doa extreme beach volleyball and just turn it to straight porn

01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:25.820
because that's really what everybody's hoping it goes to now dark barbie's for boys this is a great

01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:31.100
idea from dark tetsuya because we probably could get this license for 16 i'd resurrect rock

01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:36.540
revolution but bring in more guitar freaks draw media crossovers and fix up that interface

01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:41.740
can we can we buy the rights to rock revolution maybe should we send konami a letter i'll offer

01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:47.740
you 16 for all the rights to rock revolution i don't know i saw like a thing today randomly

01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:51.260
you know i was like hey i'm going to work on my game which meant i'm turning on youtube and

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:56.620
totally not working on my game and so one of the random videos that came up was someone playing one

01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:02.380
of those uh i don't know what you'd call like a pipe instrument it's basically um like the

01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:06.380
blue man didgeridoo no not the didgeridoo like the blue man group they have a bunch of things

01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:10.940
made of pvc pipe at different lengths and they are hitting them with you know like spoons or

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:16.540
something like that and you know makes kind of like a techno synth sound type thing let's make

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:23.420
that into a music game why not why not all right there you go rage nater hope you enjoyed the

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:29.420
answers to your question if you want to send us an email do it participate at orange lounge radio

01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:36.700
com do it now getting back into some news well actually i just found a facebook page for a

01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:44.220
skinner ks who's working on another guardian guardian legend remake so yes but is it official

01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:47.820
or is it a fan remake it's probably a fan remake but we'll see what i'm thinking

01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:56.060
all right in the meantime let's get back into some other news with loki all right so in case

01:49:56.060 --> 01:50:03.420
you weren't aware there is a sequel to swap note out now for your 3ds it's called swap doodle

01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:12.700
and it's out on the 3d se shop yeah so apparently um you get less you can get lessons to draw

01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:21.740
characters for 299 and yeah apparently you can swap doodles with swap pass and stuff how much

01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:27.820
to get lessons to draw genital jousting well come on everybody knows how to draw penises i mean

01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:36.860
that's that's easy that game is literally time to penis the game it is like it zero it's zero time

01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:42.220
the penis and we're done all right i i had no idea that a sequel to swap note was out so swap doodle

01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:47.740
but you can download swap doodle for free but it's just the other stuff in it is pay money right

01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:52.140
so nintendo shuts something down and then brings it back years later but with microtransactions

01:50:53.820 --> 01:51:02.220
how nice of them sounds legit moving on uh hey let's talk about pinball let's talk about pinball

01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:07.740
tables that don't actually exist except in the minds of zen studios but that's cool because

01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:11.820
then studios make some good they should totally make real pinball tables they they should and

01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:16.300
these would be some good things to maybe make them have any kind of ironic going from like a digital

01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:22.300
pinball company to making like actual pinball tables well here's the cool thing is that they're

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:27.420
they're going to be reimagining for their next tables they're bringing bethesda properties so

01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:31.900
it's kind of a team-up of sorts and they're actually going to be making a fallout pinball

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:39.100
table a doom pinball table and an elder scrolls 5 skyrim pinball table and that was all in a press

01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:44.620
release that came out from zen uh no news on when uh but just that they do have the rights and that

01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:49.740
they are adapting these properties to pinball so i would assume at some point within 2017 because

01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:53.020
it's not like they have to write the engine or anything they probably just have to you know come

01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:57.100
up with the ideas which are probably already being worked on and then actually put them into tables

01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:02.220
so that's pretty cool uh i would play a skyrim pinball table hell yeah and doom and fallout

01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:06.940
pretty good choices as well so and i'm sure they'll have some of the music and all that stuff

01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:11.500
so that'll be really cool dark soccer you're the pinball fan do you but you don't do you play a

01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:16.940
lot of the e pinball or digital pinball like fake tables you don't really play a lot of that right

01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:24.620
so much dan does a bit um he got into zen pinball for a little bit and then um but most of the time

01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:29.580
he i think both of us just prefer to have it on a real thing i know i used to love that stuff

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:34.780
like pinball dreams and epic pinball and all those like 90s great pinball games dan dan's

01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:40.940
big one was pin maim for a while yeah yeah they do like they you can put that on a tv and lay the tv

01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:48.060
down face down that's something i could do with my old tv well now it is they've got the um shit

01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:56.460
what's it called uh the ultra the ultra pin oh yeah yeah but not the same not the same as a

01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:00.940
real table i understand ultra pin was an interesting concept i tried to play black knight on one

01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:07.180
and it just it you need to have the feedback you have to feel the table yeah uh by the way going

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:12.380
to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com some folks stepping up to the challenge uh dungeon buster

01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:18.940
says us copyright notes iram as the holder but nothing else after that so i guess they may still

01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:23.740
hold the rights to the guardian legend compile made it but it could be the case where iram as

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:33.500
the publisher owns the ip and they're into pachinko now so 16. let me do some digging

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:38.780
all right uh by the way of speaking of the pinball tables stop he says i'd pay for a

01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:44.060
fallout pinball table with a glowing green ball um so i'm sure they'll do some silly

01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:49.100
effects and stuff uh vid power says real pinball is very difficult to be good at i'm amazed when

01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:54.300
i watch good pinball players you know i know vid powers from vegas and i or at least last time i

01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:58.220
checked he was uh and that's one of the things i'm sad i didn't get to do when i was in vegas

01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:01.740
as i was planning to go to that pinball museum that they have there but i just i never made it

01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:06.540
over there i was just too busy with the convention oh darn i'll have to go back to vegas who darn

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:11.340
anyway uh dark sakura i know you're you're putting your research hat on but how about

01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:20.460
one more story for us i reckon um well if you are fans of uh guardians of the galaxy well guess what

01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:28.700
there's going to be a uh game come out by uh uh telltale with marvel um that should be out in 2017

01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:38.620
um that actually the uh the saga uh after a strike has actually been uh what revealed this uh to

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:47.340
exist um because the uh it was listed as um one of the games uh that needed to be negotiated for

01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:55.500
voice acting rights so but the game is to be sexy and authentic whatever is the sequel to guardians

01:54:55.500 --> 01:55:02.060
in the galaxy next year or the year after i know one thing next year next year so this would be

01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:07.740
appropriately timed for something like that yeah i don't know i'm still kind of salty about

01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:12.460
guardians now because of tower of terror oh yeah i can't write it yeah i'm a little salty about

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:17.900
that too i got to admit that's just well it's stupid fault it's disney's fault but for being

01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:24.700
dumb well disney owns marvel thou though i mean i don't know i i understand that the the uh twilight

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:31.020
zone is not the ip that it used to be but it's just like now now i understand it could be yeah

01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:35.580
exactly it could be and now i just understand why older people have the get off my lawn mentality is

01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:40.140
that we just i like guardians of the galaxy i just don't think they need a ride for it

01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:46.300
yeah every ip like all your popular ip's don't necessarily need rides i mean no one's gonna be

01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:51.420
like oh man i gotta go just killing the ride that guardians of the galaxy right no one is saying

01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:56.860
that no one i i think there'll be some people that want to check it out i but it's weird is

01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:01.020
it going to be the same shit where it just falls is that it yeah the the ride essentially is not

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:05.180
changing but all this all the skin the theming and all that stuff is changing but that was like the

01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:10.460
best part of the tower of terror was that whole like story or whatever the the that was the only

01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:16.060
part i liked yeah for sure it was awesome but i i'm gonna try to give it a chance but i'm just

01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:23.020
everything i love disney destroys gets it's hard to hard to love after a while but i haven't been

01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:28.060
dar sakra there was a time here on olr where you and i were obsessed with disneyland we were going

01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:33.020
multiple times a year every year and now it's like i haven't been i i want to say the last

01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:40.300
trip i took was when i went to like my last e3 with bobby i got poor yeah it's just it's money

01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:45.580
yeah it is it's got really expensive way too much to get in for sure for sure all right

01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:51.660
anyway sorry not to tangent too much but it happens uh meanwhile loki one more story we're

01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:55.820
gonna open up skype line soon guys uh orange lounge radio all one word on skype but first

01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:00.300
loki so this is pretty cool and i'd be kind of curious to see how well this works um but they

01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:07.340
showed off a new um they launched a new thing for the htc vibe called google earth vr and it's a

01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:13.500
free app on steam you can check out and allows you to fly around the planet now i'm not sure

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:17.660
how detailed it is i mean some of the screenshots or the video they're showing

01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:21.740
it looked like is pretty detailed but i'm not sure if it's like specific areas that are these

01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:27.100
this detailed or if it's everything i have a hard time believing that's everything but

01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:33.900
it looked cool so if you got a vibe go check it out i really want to check this out this sounds

01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:39.500
awesome actually i love that it's free and the fact that you know there's all these different

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:44.220
i mean all these pictures kind of exist i mean even if you do the street view on google you

01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:49.100
can kind of rotate things around in a 360 degree view anywhere anywhere that the google car has

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:53.260
been basically it doesn't probably have that level of detail that you're talking about

01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:59.260
but they probably did send photographers out to get high res and better detail of these places

01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:03.900
that people would would really want to visit yeah i mean it looked cool so i mean get that

01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:07.740
definitely check it out yeah if you have that i really want to check that out except i don't

01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:11.100
have a vibe and i don't know if i can spend that kind of money to get one so i'm just gonna have

01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:16.380
to really hope that my pal bobby blackwolf brings us to dragon con because i know he has a vibe or

01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:20.140
hopefully at some point in the next few months you know some more people i know here locally

01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:25.340
will have one i want to check this out but that sounds really cool and it's free yep can't be free

01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:32.940
does google even run ads or anything on it i guess not it's crazy no all right well speaking of free

01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:38.060
everybody's favorite operating system linux you know they try to install linux on everything they

01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:42.860
try to put it on a toaster they try to put it on a refrigerator like if it has a screen if it has

01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:49.020
any type of computer chip in it somebody inevitably somewhere will try to put linux on it so of course

01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:55.980
as you probably can guess the nes classic edition yes they've installed linux on that now actually

01:58:55.980 --> 01:59:01.180
i didn't know this the classic edition of the nes already runs on a form of linux so this made it

01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:06.780
really really easy to do so a japanese hacker actually did this with the famicom version of

01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:11.740
the nes classic edition so the famicom mini and actually posted a guide online on how to do it

01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:17.420
so basically using a serial to usb cable and then a u-boot loader software and then actually

01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:24.780
installed uh linux's boot sequence now it's very limited obviously what it can do it's not like

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:30.300
you're gonna be able to do all this crazy stuff on there but uh apparently um yeah it's it's done

01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:33.820
would you replace the roms in there because that would be pretty awesome you know what's funny is

01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:38.540
that it's actually called out that his efforts do not look to be that he's trying to extract

01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:43.260
the emulator or change the game files in there that would really be different than just trying

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:51.740
to install linux off on it um but that is that is what this person's done so there it is linux now

01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:55.980
on the nes classic release the famicom classic but come on if they got it on there they're

01:59:55.980 --> 02:00:01.180
gonna get it it's the same it's like the same hardware please probably next week we'll hear

02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:06.700
that i get one of those they look pretty fun i'm disappointed that the the size of the the um

02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:11.420
cables on them but there are there's third-party companies that sell extension cords for them which

02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:17.740
that's nice and that really it is silly that they didn't put it with a longer cord because

02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:24.460
come on i mean well our skype line is now open at orange lounge radio all one word on skype but

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:29.020
loki we we talked about the nes classic a little bit on the the show you missed earlier this week

02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:35.260
but um i'm curious because you're you know you're usually one of the first to express reservations

02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:38.620
about nintendo things but you are into this nes class well yeah i thought it looked pretty cool

02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:41.820
i mean i don't know if i'll actually play it because i bought a clico one and never

02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:47.740
really did anything with that so i don't know but i wanted to play it all right well let's

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:50.860
get to the phones it's uh ringing off the hook tonight hi you're on orange launch radio who's

02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:59.500
this dare you ask mortal this is satan prince of darkness now wait a minute i know dj satan's

02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:05.980
voice and he's on strike right now apparently oh well this is not a dj satan this is the satan

02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:12.220
oh oh excuse me there is a oh i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry satan how dare i doubt you uh how can we

02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:19.980
help you tonight uh well um hi how are you how are you on this fine evening um i'm i'm feeling

02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:25.660
sassy and wonderful it's episode 666 uh i bet you're really happy about that aren't you satan

02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:32.860
oh absolutely i really wanted to congratulate you guys on this milestone i mean i i'd say i'd

02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:39.340
have you over for a party but you probably don't want to wind up here i hear it's really hot yeah

02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:44.540
i i don't think i i really want to be visiting you anytime soon satan but do you have any tips on how

02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:49.340
to stay away like because i don't i mean i mean i'm sure you're cool and all but i i don't really

02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:55.740
want to visit you for all eternity are there any tips on how to stay away well um let me just say

02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:01.100
i'm actually really happy with the outcome of this u.s presidential election

02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:08.380
of course of course well i mean you know i'd like anyone else i get worried about the future too

02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:13.660
and if everyone had a conscience and did the right thing and tried to be accepting and

02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:19.420
understanding and tried to make our society better then we'd stop receiving new clients

02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:24.620
business would sink like a stone we'd be out of work but this election tells us that we're going

02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:29.660
to have a lot of work ahead of us for years to come satan i feel like at night you know i feel

02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:34.140
like you're on a broadway show or something um right now but that's it's all good it's all good

02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:38.780
satan what's your favorite if only what are your favorite video games to play

02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:46.620
uh well really i'd say mostly mobile games because they're all evil i mean they're evil

02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:52.940
in a way that we can really learn from down here have you ever heard of game of war uh is that the

02:02:52.940 --> 02:03:00.460
one that mariah carrey is the spokesperson for i think kate upton for a while yeah but like it's

02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:05.660
it's not about the the spokesperson it's about the game itself i mean the whole game is upgrades

02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:11.500
upgrade and then you upgrade again and then you realize that the only way to upgrade faster is

02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:17.340
to pay the money so you pay the money and then and only then they reveal that the upgrades go

02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:22.940
farther than you'd ever imagined and that you'll never ever get there unless you pay them about a

02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:31.260
shit ton it's like Scientology well you know at that point you could quit but you need to train

02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:36.860
more troops and help your buddy and your alliance and upgrade your farm to level 24 and oh my god i

02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:43.020
can't stop now and well that's how they do it and and last week you mentioned that the same company

02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:49.740
that made this game is adapting final fantasy into a game like this now you don't need me to tell you

02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:55.180
that's evil satan i i gotta get your opinion on one more thing before we let you go uh

02:03:55.180 --> 02:03:58.060
saying because i don't know how long anything i don't know how long you're gonna be able to

02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:03.820
hold out that voice but satan uh what what are your thoughts what are your thoughts on diablo 3

02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:12.940
um well you know uh honestly i don't like it because i mean it everything in there are

02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:19.660
supposedly from hell but that isn't a realistic portrayal at all you know it's all the equivalent

02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:25.180
of movie sets and office buildings down here and and our citizens you know they just don't look

02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:29.740
like that we mostly look like lawyers whose hopes and dreams have been forever crushed

02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:33.900
don't you hate it when the goddamn media blows everything out of proportion

02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:40.940
oh no i i love it i think it's great more chaos the better that's what i say

02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:46.220

02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:13.340
yes i did congrats that's awesome but here's the thing i almost didn't make it in oh no

02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:18.940
because i didn't know that you needed a wristband to get into the event but thankfully somebody i

02:07:18.940 --> 02:07:23.020
was talking to one of his friends left gave me his wristband and the manager's like yeah sure

02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:28.940
let him in phew well that's good so what i know you talked about this already on bobby's show i

02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:33.260
don't want you to repeat yourself too much but give our listeners like the 50 000 foot overview

02:07:33.260 --> 02:07:38.780
how was the event what happened it was pretty amazing now i gave um the bike black will show

02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:46.060
like the the meat and potatoes i'm giving you guys the big mac okay we'll take it all right see

02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:51.660
there's a few cosplayers and i took some pictures and i know uh act up got excited about the kirby

02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:55.340
cosplay because we all know he loves kirby so i had to make sure i get pictures of that

02:07:56.300 --> 02:08:03.340
pretty much when you walked in all the party was on the second floor and they had some fruit snacks

02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:08.540
fun dip and other cool snacks from the 80s and 90s that we all ran home to eat or we kind of

02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:16.140
hoped that was in our lunch boxes when we went to lunch and they had juice boxes and unfortunately

02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:21.020
i didn't get there in time to get some ecto cooler but i still had a thing of of apple juice which

02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:25.820
was pretty cool did they have capri sun no that's a bummer

02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:34.780
maybe next time maybe next time yeah so when you walk in on the left there is a section you know

02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:39.180
where you can take pictures they had a lot of blow-up balloons and stuff that were that kind

02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:47.260
of looked like stuff from the 80s like the old um zach morris cell phone oh god all right yeah

02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:52.140
like the giant like the giant antenna and all that stuff like car phones legit car phones

02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:58.220
yeah and when i got there there was a guy they dressed as mario his girlfriend was peach and

02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:02.220
we couldn't even walk through like three feet with somebody asking to take our picture which

02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:06.380
i thought was pretty cool oh gosh that must have been such a tragedy for somebody who loves

02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:11.420
attention so much right i'm not that bad of an attention whore rob come on no i know i'm just

02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:15.900
giving you crap but come on it's it's fun to be in the spotlight for a little bit true especially

02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:21.740
since i didn't do standard luigi i decided to go ahead and do super mario brothers super show

02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:28.540
luigi so i was there with the mallet the plunger and some tools you know that nice colored shirt

02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:35.180
you know i'm thinking you know why not nice so and what was cool was a little bit in they brought

02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:41.180
everyone together and they had a gentleman who i forget his name but most likely somebody recorded

02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:47.820
it and it's on youtube that they did like a brief history of the nes and the nintendo coming to new

02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:54.380
york in america and so forth they talked about how they had rented out a warehouse in jersey

02:09:54.380 --> 02:10:00.060
and they were putting together the display props um trying to get the inventory in and the stories

02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:08.940
behind that warehouse that it was haunted uh deer would walk by and there was uh toxic waste going

02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:14.460
by as well but mind you this warehouse was in jersey so none of this surprised me in the least

02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:25.100
of course not so as they got into that they showed off some cool commercials what was cool was they

02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:32.540
did the entire video as if someone brought it in on a vhs tape nice now they showed the very first

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:37.820
commercial for rob and let me tell you i cannot find this commercial on youtube i went searching

02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:44.860
for about three days could not find this one this one was never released then they showed the

02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:51.260
commercial for super mario brothers 3 now we've all seen that commercial super mario brothers 3 but

02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:56.540
not everybody knows there is a variant of that commercial i was gonna say yes we've all watched

02:10:56.540 --> 02:11:06.220
the wizard god damn it loki well what was what was this variant okay now we've all seen the

02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:11.260
commercial for mario 3 where everyone's chanting mario's name and the screen pulls back and it

02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:18.060
shows his face now there's three versions of that commercial it's all the same the first version

02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:23.980
goes he's back and the all-new super mario brothers 3 for nintendo there's that version

02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:28.540
that's the original one that they showed and that was the one that they originally showed here in

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:35.500
the us a little bit down the line same commercial but they changed the wording at the end to

02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:41.100
all you had to do was back all you had to do was ask he's back in super mario brothers 3

02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:49.340
third version was only in the uk because there nintendo and Mattel had an agreement

02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:54.540
for releasing the console over there right and that commercial advertised super mario brothers

02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:59.420
one two and three and boys the background goes there strength in numbers super mario brothers

02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:04.140
one two and three for nintendo entertainment system yeah i feel like the nes came out later

02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:08.940
in europe too so they kind of had some catching up to do yeah they did yeah then they showed the

02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:14.860
commercial for dr mario not the original one where it was where the the commercial was based

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:18.220
off of the witch doctor it was the second commercial where everyone is singing and dancing

02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:25.020
now by chance do you remember that commercial uh no all right here's a brief clip

02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:27.740
oh

02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:38.220
okay i do remember that you're right i remember that on nickelodeon

02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:44.620
yeah and then they switched over to the commercial for yoshi and we've all seen that one

02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:53.020
i don't know if i remember the yoshi one all right hold on there's nowhere to hide

02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:01.100
because here comes yoshi and he's up against goombas bloopers blue buddies and piranha plants

02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:06.540
in nintendo's new stack and sandwich puzzle game called yoshi match the creatures and wipe them out

02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:12.620
play along i don't remember that one i remember that one and the third one was a commercial for

02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:19.420
a game i did not think they would bring up but star tropics well why not star tropics is one

02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:24.460
of the games in in the uh nes classic edition so it makes sense true but i didn't think it

02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:27.580
was that popular enough where he's gonna show the commercial for that i figured they would be

02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:33.820
showing it for another game but that was also pretty cool that's awesome so it's a lot of

02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:38.460
retro-tastic stuff going on at the event yeah and then they talked about a brief history of

02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:48.940
the nintendo famicom which became the avs which became the nes well that's cool um so but you

02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:53.660
didn't walk out of there with one of the systems right no i did not i kind of hoped i did because

02:13:53.660 --> 02:13:58.860
when the costume contest started it was basically that you would stand next to each person you know

02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:05.260
level of applause so when they got to me the entire floor was just chanting luigi back to

02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:10.780
back like luigi luigi and i'm just standing there feeling like freaking um wink from the

02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:15.100
legend of zelda i'm standing there with my fist up in the air holding the plunger like i'm the best

02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:22.060
there is right and then he got beat yeah i got beat by by someone came as little mac did did

02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:27.740
the winners get a nes classic no um they had this limited edition nes classic shirt that

02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:34.060
the first place got second place got um a water bottle which what i got and third place got a

02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:40.060
cool beanie uh classic hat well that's cool he had something well of course they're not

02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:43.740
going to give him a system they didn't have enough to go around it they didn't have enough

02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:50.460

02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:08.380
um your music break today had reminded me you know which included a bunch of uh um

02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:16.220
castlevania music also you know including some um super castlevania 4 music reminded me of

02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:24.060
when i first got the the super nintendo way back in the day yeah which was which was the the first

02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:32.780
console that i had bought completely on my own and super castlevania 4 was one of the uh first

02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:38.460
three games i got with the system dollar two obviously being you know super mario world which

02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:44.460
came back with the system and the third being act razor and just so our listeners know uh because

02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:49.260
the podcast folks didn't get the music break because we can't just play the music uh uh for

02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:54.220
uh free recordings and all that uh so uh yeah we had a uh you know because we take a little break

02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:57.740
between the first second half of the show we just played a variety of music from castlevania something

02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:04.540
fit the theme a little bit so you are reminded of when you bought a super nintendo yeah and you know

02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:10.220
this being the first console that i had bought completely on my own season up my money and all

02:17:10.220 --> 02:17:18.380
that i was immensely proud of the fact this one system was wholly mine couple letters mine no

02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:25.260
uh you know if i want to have it in my bedroom you know no one could tell me any differently

02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:34.620
if i want to have any living room whatever uh that being said um do you have any fond memories

02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:41.900
of uh the first console that you had bought what and if you don't mind sharing like what

02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:48.540
console that was and what games you got with it yeah uh what about you guys cons first console

02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:54.140
you bought and the memories that go with that dark soccer wasn't wasn't like the nes a gift

02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:59.740
or something to you i remember there was my my nes was a gift the first thing that i paid money

02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:07.980
for myself was buying a super nintendo because at the time i actually had money um it was right

02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:13.820
before the playstation came out and i went to thrift store and bought one because it was cheap

02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:21.420
um the next system that i well actually all the rest of the systems that i bought with

02:18:21.420 --> 02:18:29.340
my money mine and dan's money so everything else after that um yeah but i know the first one i

02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:35.580
owned was a clique-o-vision but that was like that was present parents gift right yeah and

02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:44.140
our neighbors had a um an odyssey too um the first one i remember buying for myself well here's the

02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:48.860
funny thing because it was a gift but it wasn't so i got christmas money as a gift i got like

02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:54.140
200 in christmas money i promptly went and bought a playstation one with the money i remember my

02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:58.700
mom was mad because she was like i can't believe he's spending all that money on freaking video

02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:03.100
games but it's like she should have known that was going to happen come on so i i went to the

02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:07.820
warehouse if you all remember that chain i don't even know if it existed on nope not anymore well

02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:12.460
i know it's long gone but uh was that a west coast only chain or did it exist other places i don't

02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:16.540
know but anyway i went to this place called the warehouse and i bought a playstation one and a

02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:21.100
copy of crash bandicoot 2 i think was the first game i had on that because the playstation had

02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:24.220
already been out for a year or two by the time i got it because it was down it must have been

02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:29.820
down to 150 or the point where i was able to buy it or maybe i might have sold some games or

02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:33.900
something to kind of differentiate the cost i don't remember but i do remember that was the

02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:39.100
first console i bought with my own money uh was the playstation one what about you logie um i

02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:44.860
bought super nintendo because i had gotten uh my nintendo was a gift for my parents and then

02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:51.260
i had a clique ovision which my dad had purchased which he says he wasn't a gamer but he had like

02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:59.420
47 games for it so please explain that and all the peripherals um so i sold that and my nintendo

02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:05.260
collection to earn enough money to buy super nintendo i think i got like the first game i

02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:09.260
wanted to get super mario world but they didn't have for sale because i bought it i thought it

02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:14.460
was like a packing game by default i thought yeah not no not this was just the basic thing and so

02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:20.700
i got uh roadrunners death valley rally which actually funny enough is actually not a game

02:20:20.700 --> 02:20:26.540
it's it's a pretty cool sonic clone um and then i forget i think i may have gotten linked to the

02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:31.660
past or something like that with it but um i know i didn't ever get i don't think i ever bought

02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:35.980
super mario world but hey you know what that was back in the day when it's like it doesn't fucking

02:20:35.980 --> 02:20:39.420
matter because my friend down the street has super mario world i'll just borrow it from him

02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:46.300
and that's kind of what we did so yeah nice uh yeah uh one final question you know before i do

02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:53.180
hang up and let you get on with the show uh since you know you know everyone's pretty much mentioned

02:20:53.180 --> 02:21:01.980
uh you know uh you know either buying the super nintendo on their own or at least owning the system

02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:08.860
well uh at one point or another you know you know be a gift or relatives you know or siblings

02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:17.980
system um you know just playing and playing it that way um i gotta ask this now when you

02:21:17.980 --> 02:21:25.500
when you uh played the game uh the system for the first time we heard now the sound you know

02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:30.620
you know music sound effects coming from the system be it playing uh

02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:37.020
super castlevania or actuaries or any other games did you have you know have uh

02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:44.060
no uh holy shit moment you know with you know with the sound you know like wow you know

02:21:44.060 --> 02:21:52.460
again system is actually capable of this i have to admit not i i yes and no i think no because

02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:57.180
most systems that i bought i had seen it at friend's house before i bought them so you kind

02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:01.740
of already had that holy shit moment at somebody else's house i think before i necessarily had the

02:22:01.740 --> 02:22:07.740
thing in my own house the the i the lone exception may be the nes there was something about when i

02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:13.340
first got that and i had played that at friends houses already you know plenty of it but i think

02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:17.740
when i first played that system on like my own tv it was definitely like a holy shit moment like

02:22:17.740 --> 02:22:22.780
this is this is mine essentially and like it's my own little you know version of super mario

02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:26.620
brothers that you know is arcade perfect you know if you think about the pay choice 10 back in the

02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:32.300
day and all that like that there was kind of that moment but at the same time i think i was kind of

02:22:32.300 --> 02:22:37.660
prepared what to expect because i had seen it at friends houses i don't know did you guys have a

02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:43.740
holy crap moment i think it was like all the systems you know pretty much the nintendo was

02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:49.420
you know it's more exciting than i had one and then um but like even just going from each system

02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:54.780
up until about maybe the playstation 3 i don't think the playstation 3 was that holy shit for

02:22:54.780 --> 02:23:01.500
me because i had an xbox 360 and that was kind of holy shit you know going from that um and then

02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:06.060
like playstation 4 there's not a whole lot that's really kind of like like this generation that's

02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:11.820
not been like hey it looks nicer i mean like grand theft 5 looks fucking awesome so that's kind of

02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:17.740
wowing but um and then playstation vr is pretty good but yeah i mean i think each generation i

02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:22.940
remember like you know because i bought like i had my first job at round table you know pizza

02:23:22.940 --> 02:23:27.500
working there and stuff and i my first paycheck i went and bought a playstation one with final

02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:33.340
fantasy 7 that was like holy shit this is fucking awesome you know yeah that that's the game to

02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:37.420
start on right there yeah i remember actually playing that for the first time that playstation

02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:42.060
i bought served me really well i mean that saw me through college and playing that playstation

02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:46.540
one's still kicking oh i'm sure i'm sure mine storage somewhere but it's you know still kicking

02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:50.220
mine would work too if i could find it it's probably in a fucking bin somewhere but

02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:55.020
i mean that was the same playstation that we played japanese ddr mixes because dark

02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:59.660
sakura bought some or brought some plug over to my house oh yeah i love this and actually

02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:04.060
yeah work on the playstation one that i bought like i think that was the year between high school

02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:10.380
and college so yeah anyway well thank you for the trip down memory lane uh rage nader appreciate it

02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:34.700
tetsuya says i think my holy shit moment was the metal gear solid 1 demo there's that part in the

02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:38.460
beginning where you have to crawl under the pipe i didn't expect the camera to pan down and turn

02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:42.860
into a first person perspective i never see anything like that on the system up until that

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:50.220
point uh and the yyr also calls out the playstation 1 my holy shit moment was resident evil the

02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:55.020
hallway with the dogs crashing through the window enough said oh god i remember that that made me

02:24:55.020 --> 02:25:00.860
scream so loud i think i had friends over too we all played that anyway that is going to do

for our listeners tonight i'm tired i want chocolate would you want the chocolate that

02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:04.700
has caffeine in it so it wakes you up so you're not tired i gotta sleep eventually i guess that's

02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:11.260
true um let's see my final thought tonight is um i i'm trying to decide if i need to go play more

02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:17.580
pokemon or more overwatch because i do my copy my actual copy of overwatch got here today hooray for

02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:22.460
sunday shipping that's weird but um yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna play i think maybe a little overwatch

02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:26.220
after the show maybe i'll do some streaming it's been like i haven't streamed since no man sky came

02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:30.300
out i really need to get back into that and i hear the ps4 pro to 60 frame a second streaming

02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:34.140
it looks really good you know well i saw x for doing that the other night uh because i got you

02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:38.540
fallout um they just added mod support that was something i forgot that i mentioned they just

02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:42.140
added that this week with a patch oh i want to check that out so they have mod support now so

02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:46.460
yeah go check that out i was downloading i was actually going to play that today um i got to

02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:50.460
downloading mazin and my wife decided she wanted to watch netflix on the tv i was like fuck i'm

02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:53.900
like i keep saying we should get it like a roku or something like that way you can watch netflix

02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:58.460
and i can like play games on the playstation vr you know whether it be like actual vr games or

02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:02.940
just using that virtual screen i mean then that way we can both do it she's like no chris macuz

02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:08.300
right around the corner well actually i still can play it on my laptop because i've that does work

02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:13.580
now which is nice so i mean i guess i well no actually no i can't because she's still fucking

02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:19.100
using the playstation for the netflix so that doesn't work so no all right and is uh is that

02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:24.940
your final thought my final thought is i'm gonna really try to work on games this week um i've even

02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:31.100
decided not to go to work tomorrow so it's gonna end up one two ways one i'm gonna work on my game

02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:35.340
or two i'm playing gris and i know ingress is going to be for part of the day because i had

02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:39.260
to get out of the house in the morning because wife doesn't know i'm taking the day off god

02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:43.180
then i'll have to watch the kids or something like that um so ingress is gonna be part of the

02:27:43.180 --> 02:27:46.780
day but it's shitty wetter and i don't really want to be out in the weather like this so i'll

02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:53.020
probably try to program maybe maybe or go see dr strange or something all right well that's

02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:57.100
gonna do it for another episode of orange lounge radio thank you guys so much for tuning into the

02:27:57.100 --> 02:28:02.300

02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:10.540
believe in it to be true whoa i know kung fu just kidding that's true the truth doesn't require you

02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:15.020
to believe in it for it to be true like halo beam the classic game of the week nope not gonna happen

02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:21.500
