00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week, less than a month after PSVR hit stores, the process repeats with the release of the PS4 Pro. If you're hearing this an hour later than you expected, you might have forgotten to set your clocks back last night. No matter the hour, it's time for the news and so much more right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, November the 6th of 2016 with episode number 664 of our show.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter though, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me as always as he does every week, say hello over there to Techmaster Loki!

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, this time not popping and locking.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We may have had to do a take two while we were live tonight, but we wanted to have everything nice and clean for those of you listening on the podcast. We had some major audio issues, but I think we've worked it out.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And we're just setting the audio levels appropriately so that when Nintendo comes up later on and your voice gets a little louder, the audio can compensate for that without making some of our listeners deaf because I don't think they appreciate that.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But how have you been otherwise, Loki? You had a good week?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, it was alright.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well my week sucked, thanks for asking. I was sick on Thursday and Friday, and a little better Saturday, doing much better today although I'm still a little stuffy. So if I sound a little different than usual, that's what's happening as I'm getting over a nasty little sinus cold or something.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So yeah, that part has sucked. But I'm happy to be here with you guys with what is essentially our last live episode before episode number 666 on the 20th of November.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So I'll go out of order a little bit here and do housekeeping first. We're not actually, and this is a bit of a change for what we announced in previous weeks, so listen up y'all.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Those of you that listen to the show live, there actually is not going to be a live show next week and unfortunately there's not going to be a taped one either.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My schedule before I leave for Chicago just got too crazy busy with me making crazy money, except I'm not. So unfortunately we can't all align to tape a show in advance for next Sunday.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So what we're going to do is we're going to do a special podcast only episode number 665 which will be our last pure episode that will go up in about a week and a half.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It'll go up a few days before episode number 666 in a couple weeks. But don't, I don't know what you're expecting with episode 666 y'all.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I know we've been joking about it for a long, long time.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We have no plans.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, I think we're just kind of doing the same show we always do. Except I will say this, one of Dark Soccer's friends at work did make a new intro just for that episode.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So that'll be that'll be kind of fun and a little bit different. And you never know what other surprises might be in store. We'll try to pull through in the next couple weeks.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So we will be back in a couple weeks with that. Speaking of Dark Sakura, she will be here for that episode. I know you guys have missed her.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She's been on a break for a few months due to her day job. She will be joining us for the mini episode.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She will be joining us for episode 666 and she will be back in mid-December. Confirm that she will be back on the show in mid-December.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So that'll be fun. The gang will be all back together up to our usual selves. Although I think, Loki, we've done an outstanding job holding the fort down.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And we have yet to make Halo the classic game of the week. But who knows what will happen tonight.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Not without me trying.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Anything is possible.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news tonight. Top of the show.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is why I don't do Classic of the Week. Or Classic of the Week, you'll notice.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
As I say, Loki, you can do any game you want except that one. Because I don't want that phone call. And you don't want that phone call.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, I don't care.

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Like, I won't answer my phone.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Alright, anyway. Let's talk a little bit about some of the big news happening in gaming this week.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And of course, if you are listening live, a big hello and thank you. We do tape live every Sunday night at the VoiceGeeks Network.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And some comments in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Bobby Black Wolf suggests Sky is just going to replay episode 1 as episode 666.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, then we can get another night off. That sounds great. I love it.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's see. Rageinator in chat says, will Sky do another D.Va rant on OLR 666?

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's see how the election goes on Tuesday. I'm kidding. Maybe.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Tech2030 in chat says, OLR should do an episode negative 1 where they pretend it's 200 whatever again.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, like our Minus World episode. I like that as well.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
sg100matt says, or replay the episode that Travis, John, and Rama did that was labeled OLR episode 666.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, we were gone one week. So we had like some substitute hosts fill in.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And this was way back when OLR was maybe like in the 150 or 200 range.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And so they joked and called it episode 666 because the show is never going to make it that long.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
15 years for the show. But oops, now we have the upside down episode 666.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And that's what I'm referring to that episode as.

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That is the episode 666 from the upside down world. From the parallel universe that was communicated via Christmas lights.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That is that episode 666. They did a fantastic job, but it exists in a world we can't see.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So anyway, I promise gaming news. Let's get into it.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Big Expo that happened this weekend was BlizzCon, which was a convention I went to a couple years ago.

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Had a pretty good time. That was the year they announced Overwatch was the year I went.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So that was a pretty big year. They had a lot of announcements. It was a pretty big seven.

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That was when people got to play Overwatch for the first time.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This year people knew that there wouldn't be big announcements because there was no real new...

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know, Warcraft just got an expansion so they weren't going to announce one of those.

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't think Blizzard had anything secret they were working on so there was no real game.

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But I think a lot of people expected that there would be a Diablo expansion.

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A lot of rumors about Diablo 4, but then I think I had even said on last week's OLR the week before.

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And it'll probably be a Diablo 3 expansion. I would gather as a Diablo 3 fan, we're due for an expansion.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And that didn't happen either.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, lower your expectations even more.

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Apparently. Apparently.

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So no, the big Diablo news was that they are going to be recreating the original Diablo within Diablo 3 as an event.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So you can do the original maps.

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I mean, they're going so far as to actually do the original bosses as new bosses that'll be in these maps.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know if the dude was joking or what, but he was talking about a retro filter as well.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And there's going to be unique rewards in this so it's going to be worth running.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So that's neat, but there's also a part of me that goes,

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
wow, all those resources you spent on recreating old bosses could have went to a new expansion and new bosses for that expansion.

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So that's a little bit disappointing as a Diablo fan.

75
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But it was cool that they announced that the Necromancer is going to be making its debut in Diablo 3.

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And a lot of people played the Necromancer in earlier Diablo games and were excited to see that it was coming back.

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But they are going to charge for that.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They really slipped it in there that it's going to be part of a character pack that they're going to sell.

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I understand Blizzard's got to make money, so I don't think it's crazy that they're charging for the character, but I'm just...

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes, I do.

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Why is that?

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because they're making a ton of money already.

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They're making plenty of money.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
For example, look at Overwatch.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Overwatch, you have the $60 base game, and then they're charging microtransactions on top of that.

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's like, come on.

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Again, it depends what that price is.

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If it's something like $9.99, then all right, cool, whatever.

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If it's something like $20, I'm going to start to give it a little side-eye.

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Because that's half as much as...

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, actually, I think you can probably buy the original Diablo 3 for $20 right now.

92
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So if it's $20, I'm going to give it a little side-eye.

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But there's a part of me that worries they're going to sell the Necromancer in some pack that will be like,

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
you get the Necromancer and you get a banner for Heroes of the Storm and you get a pet for World of Warcraft.

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They're going to use that to justify the $20 cost.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And I'm going to be like, no. No, no, no.

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Stop putting it...

98
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like those forced...

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Remember when everybody was pissed off when the Wii was really hard to find?

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But GameStop would sell a $500 Wii bundle that was the Wii and a bunch of games and a controller.

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's so strange that GameStop would do that.

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
In fact, I saw similar things with the NES, was it the Classic that they're doing?

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That little micro console that's coming out?

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
They're bundling it with a book.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And they're bundling it with an extra controller and stuff and they're charging $120 for it.

106
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I'm like, wait a second, that's not supposed to be $120. What the fuck?

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So, needless to say, I'm going to be a little irritated if that's what they end up doing with the Necromancer.

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But we'll see. Again, I don't know what price that's going to be yet.

109
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Alan Alkeby pointing out, with Overwatch, you can buy loot boxes at rates like $4.99, $9.99, $20, and $40.

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Tech2030 saying, I just looked and Diablo 3 with Reaper of Souls is $30.

111
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Now, all things considered, that's a really good deal for that game.

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you're not playing Diablo 3 or haven't tried it yet, it's not what it was when it first came out.

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's a really fun game and worth your time. And it's pretty good on consoles, too.

114
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And they did announce, as part of BlizzCon, that Seasons, which have been a PC-exclusive thing, are going to come out on consoles.

115
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I miss the details of that. I don't know if any of you chatters over at live.vogniteware.com picked up on,

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
does that mean that the consoles are going to have to be always online when they play Seasons?

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Because how are they going to keep the integrity of Seasons?

118
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Or do they just don't give a shit at this point?

119
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Because you know those console versions are hacked to filth. Exploited, whatever you want to call it.

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
People are running through there with Paragon 1 billion levels that they got through Artificial XP Boost and things like that.

121
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So my question is, how are they going to keep that?

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That was the PC thing that was very controversial, was it's going to have to be always online.

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But, hate it or whatever, the nice thing about it is that people can't really cheat in it.

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Or if they do, it gets shut down really fast. So the leaderboards are pretty pure in that.

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Whereas the console version, I'm not sure you could say the same thing with that.

126
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So, yeah, I'd be very curious if this console Season thing is going to be online.

127
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Anyway, Diablo wasn't the only thing they talked about.

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They didn't say a lot with World of Warcraft, just because, again, their expansion just came out.

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But if you're really into that game, they started to detail what's going to come out with patch 7.2.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And they're going to do a mini patch for 7.1.5 or something like that.

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think they realized they've been really weak in patching.

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And they really got dragged for that in their last expansion, where that game went a year with no content patch.

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I think Blizzard is really making a commitment to do that better.

134
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Especially when one of their biggest competitors, a game that I play a lot, Final Fantasy XIV, does kind of have their patching thing down pretty well.

135
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Blizzard is now under pressure to step that up. That's why that competition is good.

136
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Even though, as a fan of Final Fantasy XIV, I'll readily admit, it doesn't have nearly the number of subscribers that World of Warcraft does.

137
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But, I mean, WoW's come down a bit from its heyday. Final Fantasy XIV has done pretty okay for itself.

138
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So, I mean, it's not even a blip on the radar type of thing.

139
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So that's cool that Blizzard is stepping up their game in that regard to patching and offering a lot of stuff for the upcoming patches.

140
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Starcraft 2, admittedly, I don't play that a lot, so I kind of tuned out.

141
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But I think I caught that they're going to have an additional single player campaign that they're going to sell.

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So basically another DLC pack type of thing. That's what they're going to do for Starcraft 2.

143
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But they didn't spend a lot of time on that.

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And then they mentioned with Hearthstone, that Hearthstone is getting another expansion.

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Which is, I think they do about two expansions a year for Hearthstone, so that's kind of par for the course.

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They spent a lot of time on that. I'm not super into Hearthstone, but I realize a lot of people are.

147
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And the fact that you can kind of pick it up with a tablet makes it very alluring for a lot of people.

148
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So, you know, I think it's good they're keeping that going in that competitive scene and so forth.

149
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So, cool, cool, I guess.

150
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But I was very, very, very interested by what they were saying about Overwatch.

151
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
First off, Overwatch had the best reveal trailer out of anything.

152
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Because Overwatch announced that they are going to have a new character that is not DLC.

153
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That will just be in the game, as they've promised new maps and characters will be.

154
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And this is the one that they've been teasing for a long time, Sombra.

155
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And they announced Sombra with a really cute reveal trailer that was supposed to be an Overwatch behind the scenes thing.

156
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And then suddenly, like, the audio cut out and does all this stuff and you start to think,

157
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Uh-oh, LOL Blizzcon fuck-up live, haha, just like our first take earlier this evening, haha, that type of thing.

158
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And it turns out, oh no, gotcha, it was Sombra hacking it and they did a little reveal thing and they did a little short.

159
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And it was very, very well done.

160
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And, you know, the strength of the character design in Overwatch, I mean, when you play Overwatch, it's like, you would think Disney did it.

161
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm not saying like Disney games necessarily, I'm just saying you would think you're playing a Disney movie.

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Even though Disney movies don't usually shoot people in the face, I can't explain it.

163
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's just like the character development in Overwatch is that strong.

164
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And these characters are so good and Sombra really, really sticks out as well.

165
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And I could go into the whole spiel on, and they're diverse too, which is great, but, you know, I've said it before.

166
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But, then they announced, it wasn't even so much that that caught my attention, although that makes me happy, even though I'm still terrible at Overwatch, but I like the character Sombra a lot.

167
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But it was the fact that they announced this Overwatch League. Did you see this? Their announcement for the Overwatch League?

168
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

169
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Because you know Blizzard has really been pushing into esports, and half of Blizzcon is esports.

170
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It almost feels like more than half of Blizzcon right now is esports.

171
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's the finals for WoW Arena, it's the final for Hearthstone, now they do Overwatch, it's the finals for all these big competitions.

172
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And now they're talking about, they're really making this push for Overwatch, they want to make a freaking league.

173
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Like, NFL style league that is based on the cities you live in, and not necessarily, you know, these other types of teams that are formed around corporate sponsorship.

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Not that that's necessarily bad, because that's how esports has kind of maintained itself today.

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So, Blizzard is kind of wanting to change the game a little bit, I think.

176
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And I'm going to, I will readily admit, I am not well versed enough in the world of esports to really understand how this is different, and like in the weeds, how this is going to be very different from what we see today.

177
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But it really feels to me like Blizzard is really, really pushing this to be that game that is going to be, you know, the sport that is on TV.

178
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And yes, I realize ESPN2 has aired some matches in here and there, things like that, and they've done some stuff on what, TNT or TBS, one of those networks as well.

179
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But, I mean, this is probably going to be Blizzard's big, big push to really try to maybe dominate that conversation in a way, with one of their games.

180
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They're talking, what, salaries and benefits with contract signing and all this stuff? Like, again, the same thing you would expect of like a player signing up for the NFL.

181
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So, this is very, very interesting how the game is going to change with that.

182
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, Overwatch knocked League of Legends out of the top on Twitch for a bit after Sombra was announced.

183
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I think Hearthstone also came in third after League of Legends, that BlizzCon hype.

184
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Kaijuto says, if they do a league, they have to do a minor league. I would be curious how that would work as well.

185
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Sign me up for the minor, minor, minor league.

186
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's right, right? Can I be the water boy for the team? Because I'm not sure I can do too well at the game itself.

187
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
William Ritterface says, I wonder if they have the money for that because that's a whole other ballpark.

188
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, I don't know how that's going to work. I'm assuming we're not talking multi-million dollar deals here, but I don't know.

189
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Where is that money going to come from and how is that all going to work? We'll see the details.

190
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, you see, we charge for an expansion for Diablo 3 to add the Necromancer.

191
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes, but Diablo isn't fucking Overwatch.

192
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It doesn't matter. It's all the same umbrella there.

193
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Really, we charge way too much that we should be charging, but we'll use it as an excuse as we're promoting this esports thing.

194
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Meanwhile, line in our pockets.

195
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't know. I'm very interested to see more details and see what this really looks like when it starts to unfold.

196
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm not going to kid myself that I'm any good to get into something like this, but can you imagine?

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Loki, can you imagine? Can you imagine if 15 years ago, Konami had started the Dance Dance Revolution League?

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Can you imagine what that would have looked like, Loki?

199
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Can you imagine if we'd been making salaries and benefits off dancing to arrows on the screen?

200
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I mean, my my, how far can you...

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Considering the current state of Konami, you probably wouldn't look that great.

202
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Sad but true, but...

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You'd be dancing with a, you know, wood arrow on the corner.

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Kaijuto in chat says if they don't do a minor league, they can do fantasy draft so we can play along.

205
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They're gonna have to go more interactive than just watching shit, and maybe that's where the money comes from.

206
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Fantasy draft, really? Just play the fucking game at that point. I mean, it's just not even worth it.

207
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But maybe it's something where you play along with the pros? I don't know. I don't know how that works out.

208
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But I figure like that's something there.

209
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Stoppy in chat points out Tracer is already in my fantasies.

210
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
DungeonBuster says you're doing a dance event. Okay, where are we going? A pachinko parlor.

211
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
SSG100Matt says I remember when DDR was considered in ESPN's Summer X Games.

212
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I remember those days well too. They're long gone.

213
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I could have been an Olympic contender once, but then I took a DDR arrow to the knee.

214
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I could have been a contender, but then I gained like 50, 60, 70 pounds.

215
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I could have been a contender.

216
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Could have been a contender, but I stopped exercising.

217
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But then I started a podcast.

218
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I got married, had kids, and they sucked all the life out of me.

219
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Anyway, that was pretty much all I got out of BlizzCon.

220
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What about you, Loki? Is there anything you caught out of BlizzCon I didn't touch on there that you wanted to mention?

221
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I was like, oh, hey, BlizzCon's going on right now?

222
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I didn't realize that was going on.

223
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I heard people complaining about Diablo, and I'm like, alright, I'm done.

224
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well, since I was home sick, and yes, I really was sick.

225
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I was not one of those people that was like, I'm sick and I gotta stay home and watch BlizzCon.

226
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I like Blizzard, but I could have looked at a live blog on my phone on break or something.

227
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You weren't staying home to watch, was it Animal Crossing? Their little...

228
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, no, I was really fucking sick.

229
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But I was like, well, I might as well make the best of it.

230
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So in between naps, I did watch the live thing.

231
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Which, you know, I think may be the first time I've been able to do that.

232
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Besides the year I was actually there in person.

233
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So, I mean, that was cool that I could watch that, I guess.

234
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But, you know, pretty much the same stuff you'd catch on a live blog or what have you anyway.

235
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But yeah, I hope those that went to BlizzCon had fun.

236
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You know, a large part of BlizzCon is just being with the people.

237
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Especially for these people that are so...

238
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And I count myself, I say these people, but I'm really one of them.

239
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That are so invested in games like World of Warcraft, where you play with people from across a great distance.

240
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You know, BlizzCon for many people is like the one time a year where everybody can kind of get together.

241
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you were able to get a ticket.

242
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And get in and celebrate, you know, in the same place.

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And people meet up with guildies and all this stuff.

244
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, I know that's a big part of it for a lot of people.

245
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And, you know, the WoW community when we were doing Horde House was always very welcoming and so forth.

246
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So, you know, nothing but hearts for the folks at BlizzCon this weekend.

247
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I'm sure the event was run better than the one I ranted about a few weeks ago.

248
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But we won't go there because I still love that game too.

249
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I'm not going to get negative tonight. I'm just not.

250
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm too sick.

251
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's why I'm here.

252
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's why you're here.

253
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Alright.

254
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
William Murderface says he got that BlizzCon flu.

255
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The year I went, I probably did.

256
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But this year, no.

257
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I didn't go to any conventions to get this flu.

258
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I just, I went to work and that's how I got sick, I think.

259
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Somebody at work was probably sick or something happened.

260
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't know.

261
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Anyway.

262
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's talk about our gaming week.

263
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So, how was your gaming week and what types of games did you play this week besides BlizzCon stuff?

264
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

265
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I reluctantly played Ingress this week because I felt some sort of obligation to keep a streak of, was it, 13?

266
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Well, 12 cycles.

267
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And so, you know, they're trying to make it 13.

268
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And it's just, it's very conflicting because it's at the point where it's like, it really feels like a chore.

269
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And, yeah.

270
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And it just, I don't know.

271
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But I'm still doing it for some dumb reason because I sit there with like a, you know, time to waste.

272
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And it's just like, I could be doing something else.

273
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But no, here I'm going to try to play Ingress and I really don't know why I do it.

274
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I think you really have to treat that game like any other MMO.

275
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I think you really do.

276
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And that's really what it is.

277
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's just an MMO, but it takes place in the real world or what have you.

278
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I like the win, but there's like, you have to understand the odds are stacked against us.

279
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's our team right now because the other side has lots of people that are retired that play this all day long.

280
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
For one. And two, there's a lot more people in my area on the other team that are playing versus me.

281
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So it's like, you know, it's very frustrating because it's like, what am I going to do?

282
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
There's really no way that this is going to come out in my favor.

283
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, without getting too far into strategy discussion or things like that,

284
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you have to remember you're also coming off this 12-week winning streak type of thing where it's like,

285
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
okay, for a while we've been kicking a lot of ass and the team still kicks a lot of ass.

286
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But it's just that I think the other side is really sick of losing.

287
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So they're trying some new tricks and some things like that.

288
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So when the old tricks don't work, you have to kind of put on your thinking hat and say,

289
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
maybe I'm going to take solace in.

290
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm going to be the biggest pain in the ass.

291
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And now you're going to be the spoiler for what they're doing.

292
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And that's where you can get your rewards out of the game.

293
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And for the first year in the game when it was like that the entire time I was playing,

294
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
that's where you kind of get a lot of rewards from it is that, oh, well, I'm spoiling their shit.

295
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's funny.

296
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So I think you just have to kind of take that approach.

297
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It is just a game for fuck's sake.

298
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's like any other MMO.

299
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's not that serious at the end of the day.

300
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But it's a very zen thing.

301
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The other night I was like, I'm going to go out and just play for an hour

302
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
because I don't want to play my console games right now.

303
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I just kind of want to go for a drive.

304
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So I went out and played and made some fields, had fun, and that was that.

305
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The other stuff I played, I meant to actually play something other than Ingress this week.

306
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So I went ahead and played some more PlayStation VR.

307
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So I fired up, I downloaded that Call of Duty demo thing that they've got.

308
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't remember the hell it was called, but let's see here.

309
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That was the Jackal Assault because it meant that much to me knowing the name.

310
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And it's just, I don't even know why they put it together to be honest.

311
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
For people that have a PlayStation VR or played the demo disc,

312
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
it's like that demo that they've got for Eve Valkyrie, which I think is badass.

313
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But a very budget, not so great version of that.

314
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So it basically starts off the same thing.

315
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You're flying this ship around and you're scanning some shit.

316
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then all of a sudden things warp in and you have to destroy ships.

317
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's like literally the same fucking demo as Eve Valkyrie.

318
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The problem is it's so cheap looking.

319
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Like Eve Valkyrie feels fucking amazing.

320
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Correct me if I'm wrong though, but isn't the Jackal one free

321
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and the Eve thing is a demo for what's going to be a $60 game?

322
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Right, it is free, but technically both are demos for $60 games if you want to.

323
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But in the other games that aren't even in VR, it's just...

324
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm comparing demo to demo because I'm not buying the $60 Eve Valkyrie game.

325
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Seriously, we need to fill that void of a really kick-ass single-player flight sim game would be amazing.

326
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You want to go old school and go Wing Commander VR?

327
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I want to go fucking Colony Wars or Wing Commander or some shit like that.

328
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Because Eve was fantastic. I don't want to play constant MMO.

329
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Not necessarily, just like an online multiplayer game.

330
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That's not what I'm interested in. I want to play a solid campaign or something.

331
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That game felt very badass.

332
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
This game on the other hand, this little Jackal assault thing, felt very fucking cheap.

333
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
In fact, one of the things I noticed on it, the explosions when you destroy something are flat sprites.

334
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's like, holy shit. Seriously? This is the crap that we're pulling 2016?

335
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Flat fucking sprites on the explosions? It looks so goddamn cheap.

336
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Zero out of ten. Explosions are completely unrealistic.

337
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
No, it wasn't that they're unrealistic. It's just so cheap. It's so terrible.

338
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm not using the proper VoG network scale. F the bad explosions.

339
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It just wasn't good. It just wasn't interesting at all.

340
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It was just kind of like, well, cool. This isn't going to get me the buy Call of Duty.

341
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You just see how many ships you can blow up in a certain amount of time.

342
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's free I guess, but the demo for Eve Valkyrie is free as well.

343
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I got a lot more enjoyment out of that than I did this.

344
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't know. It was just kind of lame. I'm kind of disappointed.

345
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I was hoping Lisa would be on par with the other one.

346
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I do want to point out Bobby Blackwell says,

347
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I thought Jackal Assault was well done for what it was.

348
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Also points out Elite Dangerous is in VR.

349
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't know if that's a game that interests you, but maybe something to check out.

350
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, but that's not on PlayStation 4. I know Elite Dangerous is on PC.

351
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh yeah, because you had to get rid of the Oculus to get the PlayStation VR, huh?

352
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I don't have a computer that can run it anyways, so it's no big deal.

353
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The other thing I did play through is I played through Rez Infinite, which is pretty fun.

354
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I kind of understood a little bit more of the game mechanics than I did the original time playing through.

355
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I didn't really remember too much of the game, but it was fun.

356
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And then the Area X thing, which is interesting, because for people that may not have played Rez,

357
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
may think, oh, that's just an extra level that they added to the game.

358
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But no, it's actually a completely separate game that's in the style of Rez.

359
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's in a completely different engine. They made the whole thing in Unreal 4, and it's just fantastic looking.

360
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's unlike Rez, which is kind of an on-rails shooter, this is pretty much a free form.

361
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You can go wherever you want and stuff in the game, which is kind of cool.

362
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And then Rez is very kind of old school, like, vector-y, just very low poly stuff.

363
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Whereas the Area X was very particle crazy.

364
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Like, everything you blew up exploded in a cloud of particles, and it looked cool.

365
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That game's kind of visual presence.

366
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I thought it was really neat, especially being able to fly wherever you want in there.

367
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And it looked fantastic. It's like, this gives me hope for another Rez game.

368
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Make it like that, because that was fantastic.

369
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And it looked much better compared to the actual game in VR, actually.

370
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But they're both great. It was a fun experience in both of them, so I enjoyed it.

371
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But yeah, it was quick. I finished that really fast, and I guess I still have the bonus levels to play through.

372
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But I don't know. I enjoyed it in VR. I thought it was a fun experience.

373
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And I guess I found out that I don't get motion sick from any of this stuff.

374
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Because on all these games where they're like, okay, you can have a few settings.

375
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
This is for VR experts, you know. It's a lot of movement. This is this.

376
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm like, always crank it up. The more movement, the better. I don't really care.

377
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So, I don't know. But yeah, definitely if you haven't gotten a chance to, check out Area X in Rez Infinite.

378
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Because it's fantastic. It's basically a sequel to Rez, almost. But sadly, only one level of it.

379
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Alright.

380
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That's it.

381
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's it. My Gaming Week. I don't really have...

382
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

383
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, excuse me.

384
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
One more thing. Because I wanted, you know, this was a recommendation. I tried PolitiCats.

385
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh, you did?

386
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I did try PolitiCats. I played it for a little bit, and I uninstalled it because I hated that game.

387
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm sorry. You know, I like clicker games. I do. But for some reason, that one just did not hook me.

388
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It would just, it didn't hook me.

389
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I have failed in checking it out, I regret to say. So, I can't really argue with you one way or the other on this.

390
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Or support you. But why was it so bad?

391
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't know. It's just the presentation of it. I just didn't like it. I don't know what it is.

392
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Cats are not cute enough. Kitten explosions were bad. F.

393
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
No, the cats are fine. The art style is cute and everything, but it just didn't seem interesting to me at all.

394
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It just, I don't know. It didn't hook me like Katamari or something.

395
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Maybe it's because it's a completely random, random franchise or something.

396
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
SSG100Matt suggests, it didn't hook him in because he couldn't cheat in it.

397
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Now, that's not true, but yes.

398
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Alright.

399
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It wasn't because I couldn't cheat in it, it was because it just wasn't interesting.

400
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Alright, my gaming week. Sadly, not a lot of new stuff to really report. I've been continuing in Final Fantasy XIV.

401
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I was also playing Dragon Quest Builders, and I finally got to the end of chapter one.

402
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Which I know doesn't sound like very far, like, oh, good job, you got to the end of chapter one.

403
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But I swear, it took, like, I've been playing at least ten hours. At least.

404
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And, I mean, like, yeah, I feel like it took me a while to get there to the end of chapter one.

405
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So, maybe I'm just slow with the way I've been progressing things, and doing kind of like that OCD collecting and side quest thing.

406
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
But, yeah, so I finally got to the final boss, who's a bit of a pain in the ass, and I realized that I need better stuff.

407
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So, I think what happens, based on some other stuff I picked up around Twitter, is that I think there's only, like, three chapters in the game.

408
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So, even though I'm like, ooh, chapter one, I think that actually is a lot further than you'd think.

409
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And I get the sense that you have to, I mean, minor spoiler, but I don't think so.

410
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You have to start over when you do chapters two and three, basically, but you're in a new part of the world with new stuff.

411
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So, it's kind of like starting over.

412
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So, yeah, but anyway, for fighting the boss at the end of chapter one, I realized I didn't have enough of the end game stuff that I needed to really effectively fight the guys.

413
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So, I was like, alright, I've got to spend more time killing the rocks that explode, which is their version of creepers, to get, you know, to craft the bombs I need to take down the boss.

414
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But anyway, so that's something I was working on.

415
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And then, I've also been playing Civilization VI, which came out a couple weeks ago.

416
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And I'm finding that that game is hard.

417
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's harder than any of the previous civilizations, based on the fact that I don't, like, when I play on the easiest difficulty, which is where I will always start my civilization experience, the easiest difficulty.

418
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And then, when I feel comfortable, I'll kick it up another level and again and again.

419
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But, like, this time, even on the easiest difficulty, I'm having trouble just trouncing the competition.

420
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And so, I think the type of old strategies I've been using are wrong now.

421
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And I understand that they want to do that to mix up things a little bit and that not the same old trick, like we just mentioned, sometimes you have to use new tricks.

422
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So, I understand that I have to do that.

423
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But, yeah, I just kind of wasn't ready for how different that was all going to be.

424
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So, yeah, again, it blows my mind that some people say Civ VI is, like, the same thing as Civ V, because unless you're looking at it on a purely visual, aesthetic level, I don't know how the fuck you can say that.

425
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I really don't. Like, the game plays very, very differently than Civ V to me.

426
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So, yeah. So, I'm still kind of learning and moving along in that game.

427
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I'll let you guys know if I'm able to actually get in a position where I can win a damn game. I'll let you know.

428
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So, yeah, there was that. And I'll mention this quickly.

429
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Last night, I was hanging out with my pals, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick.

430
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And you might know them because they do a show here at VOG Network called gamebuoy.org.

431
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But we were all playing a game called TKO, which is part of the Jackbox Party Pack, right?

432
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So, Jackbox Party Pack 3 came out. And I think we talked about a couple of those games last week, right?

433
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yes, we did.

434
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We played Murder Party. Well, this time, Captain Spike was doing, like, a late Halloween get-together type of thing.

435
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So, there were several people there. And so, it was like, okay, you know, Jackbox Party Pack being with a bunch of gamer nerds, it made for a great, like, easy thing to just put on the TV.

436
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That's what everybody can just kind of do. So, we were playing Trivia Murder Party, okay?

437
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But then we played TKO, which, you know, when I had heard it described to me, you know, it was mentioned that, oh, you know, some people draw things and you come up with slogans and then you kind of put them together in their shirts and you vote on the best shirts.

438
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And I was like, that doesn't sound funny. Like, that doesn't sound as strong as the other stuff.

439
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But I was totally wrong. Like, that game is fucking hilarious.

440
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And I laughed. I don't think I've laughed that hard in my life since the episode of South Park where Mr. Garrison gets a sex change.

441
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I have not laughed that hard in my life that I did last night when we were playing TKO.

442
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And, granted, this was with sick, disturbing people, so I'm not going to repeat for you the things that came up in the game.

443
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Oh, come on.

444
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't need, I'll tell you off air, because I don't need Tumblr against me. But, I mean, this was just, it was hilarious.

445
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So, yeah, what happens is you draw pictures, and you can draw anything you want. You just draw pictures so you know somebody's going to draw a dick. You know somebody's going to draw a dick.

446
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Okay, I'll tell you one shirt that happened that is, in my opinion, is not that controversial.

447
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Take me through, like, how do you play this? Because, like, does everybody draw, like, a picture, then everybody comes up with a slogan and you mix and match them to come up with, like, the best shirt?

448
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Kind of, yes. Okay, so, first round comes up. You draw three pictures. Okay, so you use your shitty little paint program on your phone to draw the pictures with your finger.

449
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Although, Alan was like, you know, oh, I left my stylist at home. I was like, oh, you would. You would have been trying to use your stylist to play this shit.

450
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But, anyway, so you draw pictures. So, somebody always draws a dick, you know, depending on the group you're playing with, or even worse, with the group I was with.

451
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And then, the next round is just submit as many slogans as you can. And you don't have pictures, it's just submit slogans in, like, 60 seconds.

452
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So, some people will get four in, some people get ten in. Then what happens is everybody on their phone gets one picture, or no, three pictures and four slogans.

453
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And you have to mix and match between the pictures and the slogans which one makes the best shirt. And then the shirts go head to head in a strongest M&M style competition.

454
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Where, basically, it's like the first one fights the second one and then, you know, you push them together. Whichever one cracks first, you eat.

455
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And then the surviving M&M goes on to the next M&M, right? The M&M gauntlet. It's that type of voting. And then, yeah, that's how it works.

456
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And then the shirt, there's a gauntlet winner and then a streak winner. And then the whole process repeats again, but you only draw one drawing to replace the one that got picked, like you do less slogans.

457
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And then, in the very last round, all the winning shirts go through one more battle and then you come up with a supreme champion that way.

458
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So, like, one of the shirts that almost won was somebody just drew a bunch of dicks. It was just like a little dick and a big dick and different colored dicks.

459
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It was like all these dicks in the picture, right? Because my friends are mature. And it got matched up with the slogan, which if you've ever seen RuPaul's Drag Race, Tatiana was very famous for saying, Choices.

460
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So, you had this shirt with all these different dicks on it that says, Choices. And that shirt almost won. It was like the second place thing.

461
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But then what was brilliant that they did, and I would be dying to know how much money they're making off of it. If Jackbox people still listen to this show, somebody send me a tweet on the down low, so I don't want to know how much money you're making off this.

462
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:49,000
At the very end, there's a button that says, Click here to purchase the shirts in the game. So, if I wanted to go to the next Rocky Horror Show and wear a shirt with a bunch of dicks on it, crudely drawn, that says, Choices on the bottom, I could do it through TKO.

463
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So, I thought that was pretty funny.

464
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That's pretty awesome.

465
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah, it was pretty awesome. So, that was one of those games that, in execution, it actually worked a lot better than I thought it would in theory.

466
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And then real quickly, we also played the Fake In It game. I didn't like it as much. It's too hard to be the faker. It is too hard to be the faker.

467
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Like, in theory, it's a cute concept and stuff, and I know bluffing games are really fun, but it was way too easy to figure out who the faker was every time, even when it was me.

468
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I tried really hard to lie, but one of my friends was like, Your lip quivered slightly before you pointed, and I know you're the fucking liar.

469
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And I was like, How the fuck? Are you a fucking cop? What is that? I'm like, I know you're not a cop.

470
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You're a cop?

471
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I know, right? Are we all cops?

472
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Some sort of cop or something?

473
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Anyway, it's okay that there's one game in a pack that makes you go, because we played a little Quiplash 2, which was good as well, so there's a lot of strong games in that pack.

474
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I think even the last pack had a game that made you go, They all kind of have one game that's okay.

475
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But there's probably somebody out there who loves that game the most, so whatever, more props to them.

476
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Going to chat, SSJ100Matt says, This sounds hilarious. Rob needs to stream this next time this happens.

477
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:26,000
No, because again, I don't need Tumblr. Here's the thing, I'll give you the watered down politically correct version if we're going to stream it.

478
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But some bad things happen in these games, so I'm just, it's not as bad as I'm making it sound, but I'm just like, I might want to run for elected office some year, let's put it that way.

479
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I would still do it. I would stand up on stage, you know, doing the debates, wearing my Dicks and Choices shirt.

480
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Alright, let's see. Vidpower in chat says, Gamers draw penises? Shocking.

481
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Stoppy says, I'm guessing there was a lot of make blank great again shirts. No, I don't remember seeing a lot of that as a slogan.

482
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I did submit the slogan, I'm Captain Spike and I approve this message, thinking that somebody would again like draw a butthole or something that that would get paired up with.

483
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,000
But no, the slogan never got used. Unfortunately, not all the slogans get used, so it didn't work out. But anyway.

484
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Alright, Dark Tetsuya in chat says, Doesn't Travis already have dirt on you though Rob?

485
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:32,000
He's still desperately trying to find the public access show, but it's, I'm pretty sure those tapes have disintegrated by now. That shows like over 20 years old at this point.

486
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on. We pretty much already talked about our housekeeping, so again, no show next Sunday.

487
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So for those listening on the podcast feed, you're going to have to wait a little extra longer for a show, but the good news is, it's kind of like interest.

488
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You don't get a show next week, but you'll get two shows the next week.

489
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And you can use that time to play all the games that are coming out because there's so many games.

490
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Oh, this is that week. This is that week before Black Friday, well not right before, but there's always a huge week in November where like everything comes out.

491
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So, I'm going to go on a random tangent, well it's not a random tangent I guess, it sort of has to do with my game week.

492
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So, I seem to be completely making 180 decisions, everything that I've come to like decide originally, and I'm just like hmm, I'm going to do the exact opposite.

493
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, totally the same.

494
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So, I'm thinking now I'm probably going to get a PlayStation Pro.

495
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Me too, me too. I am getting the PlayStation 4 Pro.

496
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And if you ask me why, I can't even really give you a good reason besides like, oh no, I want to play Final Fantasy 15 the best way possible.

497
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Well, just like looking at like some of the enhancements that they're doing for like VR and stuff, I think that might be kind of useful as well because the games look better on that.

498
00:42:47,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I don't know if I'm going to get one right away, but I think that would be the best time to trade in a system and stuff because like even like if I went to Evil G or whatever, you get 150 bucks and then you've, you know, pretty much 250 at that point.

499
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So, it's not that big a deal. I don't have to say though. It may wait because it's not, you know, a whole big deal, but eventually it might be nice to get one.

500
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Because right now I have a 1080p TV, so it's not, you know, it's not going to notice a huge difference. Once I get a 4K TV, then fuck yeah, but right now it's not going to happen.

501
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Nope, I have my PS4 Pro in pre-order and I'm probably going to go ahead and let it go through and get the system and I probably will sell my PlayStation 4.

502
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'll probably sell it like, not like on eBay, but like kind of go to Facebook first and be like, who wants a PlayStation 4 and, you know, kind of do it that way and then, you know, kind of go from there.

503
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Because I'm kind of like, okay, well, if I can sell it like really cheap and one of my friends gets it like, and I still get some money recovered, like it's kind of a win, right?

504
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So, I'm really probably going to do that and then get the PlayStation 4 Pro, but I didn't end up getting the PlayStation VR and I was convinced I was going to.

505
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But even still, I'm kind of like, eh, I think I'll hold off a little bit. I want to wait and see what 2017 makes for right now.

506
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm not sure there's enough like single player, I just want to sit and play by myself type of stuff right now on VR.

507
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And a lot of it's really short, like Robinson The Journey looks all right, but even that's kind of like, okay, I don't know.

508
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I just want to see what develops. I really enjoy it when Shane brings his over or at least the time he did, I enjoyed it, you know, but, and hopefully he'll bring it by again sometime, but I'm not in a rush, I'm not in a rush to pick up my own system.

509
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yes, and I am thinking about that as well is that, you know, 15 is coming out soon and I know I'm going to play that a lot. So, yeah, there's that.

510
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So, all right, well, let's get into the gaming news that we do have for the week. Loki, starting us off.

511
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So, there was the rumor that Nintendo had stopped production on the Wii U, but apparently that is incorrect.

512
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And they're saying that apparently IT Media contacted Nintendo and a spokesperson said there has been no change in continuing Wii U productions.

513
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So, apparently it is still being produced. At least that's what we're led to believe.

514
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Honestly, with there not being any new games coming out for it, I don't think it's going to be much longer that it's going to be produced.

515
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yeah, I mean, I think one reason a lot of people were running with the story when it was reported is, well, it sounds plausible. Your favorite, everybody.

516
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,000
No, not the, I mean, it makes sense because, you know, there's still the Wii U version of the Zelda game coming out later on in March.

517
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So, obviously you're going to sell some systems maybe for that, assuming hopefully they'll be smart enough to drop the price of the system if they're releasing, you know, the Switch and everything.

518
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But how many-

519
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
We still don't know how much the Switch is going to be.

520
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
How many more Wii U's are they really going to sell?

521
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Not a lot.

522
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah, and so there is going to come a point where they have to say, okay, we're going to sell through what we have left on shelves and that's that.

523
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And Nintendo probably does want that to be at a point where people instead go over to the Switch. I mean, they don't necessarily want both systems existing on the Switch.

524
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
They want them to Switch over.

525
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But, I mean, if we do see that a lot of Wii U games are being redone for the Switch, like we saw Mario Kart 8 and we saw Splatoon in that trailer, I fully realize we don't know exactly what that looks like yet, but hear me out.

526
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:29,000
If the Switch is doing redone, reimagined versions of those games or whatever, then I can see where maybe they're a little more eager to kind of push the Wii U out the window.

527
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Which I know seems weird, like why would a company want to push their system out that fast? But, you know, I think to really make the Switch come out with a bang, I could see why they'd want to do that.

528
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But, you know, I fully realize Nintendo denied the story. I understand why they kind of need to deny the story going into the holidays.

529
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I mean, they would still like to sell Wii U's this holiday, don't get me wrong.

530
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I think we fully realize that Nintendo is instead looking to Pokemon Sun and Moon on the 3DS, the Nintendo Mini, and these other ways that they're going to make money during the holidays.

531
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But, I don't think Nintendo wants to suddenly say like, oh no, don't buy a Wii, you're not going to be able to find a Wii U this holiday. Nintendo does not want to say that.

532
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It wouldn't make any sense, yeah.

533
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But, I mean, can we, I mean, Loki, I don't know, I didn't look at the direct quotes. Can we read between the lines that maybe Nintendo could scale back productions?

534
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
They're not stopping, but maybe one factory is type of thing.

535
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure they've got the plan to ramp it down. I don't think that they're producing a ton of them. There's not like it's going to be a shortage on the Wii U.

536
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I just don't think there's anything out there that's really driving that purchase right now.

537
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Granted, in March, you know, you will have the Zelda game, and that's a big factor is what those two systems are in price because of the Switches.

538
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:08,000
If people are looking to buy the Switch for Zelda, and they have a Wii U already, and the price of the Switch is higher than we want, they may hold off on the Switch.

539
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
True.

540
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I mean, especially if all they're offering is like, hey, there's these games that you've already had that have some extra shit in them.

541
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I mean, I don't know, I just, we need to get more information on what's going to be launched with it.

542
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Because if it's just old Wii U games, that's great if you're getting into it, but if you already have a Wii U, it's kind of like, why am I purchasing these?

543
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But now we know, right after the holidays are over, what is it, January 12th, Nintendo's coming out swinging with the Switch stuff.

544
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So these answers we're going to have right at the beginning of the year.

545
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Although they have a new Excite truck, I am going to have to purchase that day.

546
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Oh, even Loki.

547
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
That is my, but you know what though, they're not. You know why? Because that would be too good.

548
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And because if they're making an Excite truck, it makes no goddamn sense because why wouldn't they make an F-Zero?

549
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah. But what about a new F-Zero? A new F-Zero would do it for you too, right, Loki?

550
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Nah, I don't really like F-Zero that much.

551
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
What? Get out. Out my house.

552
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Well, I'm sure the Switch is going to be luring a lot of people over.

553
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
You know, we've had several AAA companies saying that, you know, they're planning on supporting the Switch.

554
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And there are indie developers as well talking about supporting the Switch and that some already have games in development.

555
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Nintendo Life did an interview with several different indie developers to get their thoughts and if they plan to support the Switch.

556
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Are they going to support the Nintendo Switch in the future?

557
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yacht Club Games, a rep from them, said of course.

558
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Engine Software said we're already working on the platform and we hope to support it for a long time.

559
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Drinkbox Studios says yes, we do hope to support the Switch.

560
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Choice Provisions says we hope to.

561
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
We got our start with the Bit.Trip series on WiiWare and we plan to continue to bring our games to Nintendo platforms.

562
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
We're not ashamed to admit that we're huge Nintendo fanboys and girls over here.

563
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Atui simply said yes and Shinen Multimedia said we've already been working on it for some time.

564
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So, it sounds like the Switch will be luring a lot of these, you know, well done indie studios as well as the AAA stuff.

565
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And that's important. You know, the big games are important but, you know, if the next Undertale or the next Five Nights at Freddy's is exclusive to the Switch.

566
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
A lot of people are going to be looking at that.

567
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Okay, you guys ready for Switch rumors? Your favorite part.

568
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Oh yeah.

569
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You ready?

570
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Should we bring out the wheel of plausibility?

571
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Hold on, I think I have my song.

572
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Wheel of plausibility. Turn, turn, turn. Tell us the lessons we might learn.

573
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Alright, these are coming from Laura Kate Dale, which is one of the folks that was kind of doing a lot of those early rumors on the Switch, right?

574
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Didn't she call a lot of the early stuff going on with the Switch before the trailer was out there?

575
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I don't know.

576
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Well, the Nintendo Switch supposedly is going to support NFC ID cards.

577
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:17,000
The card would allow you to download content from your friend's personal device, allowing you to get anything from new characters to digital games downloaded through the eShop.

578
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
This could minimize the potential battery drain while the Nintendo Switch is in portable use.

579
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
A basic card reportedly included with the Nintendo Switch but additional cards for $10.

580
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
This sounds a lot like Amiibo, so why are we getting both?

581
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I mean, is the NFC thing supposed to be a little bit more like, I guess I'm assuming you can fit maybe more on one of those little cards than you can on an Amiibo?

582
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Like, when we say NFC card, we're talking about like an eAmusement Pass type thing, right?

583
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So what's the point of this again?

584
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Well, we don't know.

585
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Allegedly, what is the point of this again?

586
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Easily download content from your friend's personal device, allowing you to get anything from new characters to digital games downloaded through the eShop.

587
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Why would I want to do that?

588
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Well, here's, okay, and some of the chatters are saying this as well.

589
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Act F says, yeah, sounds like eAmuse.

590
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Get your tinfoil hats on, alright?

591
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Get the tarp out, get the tarp out, because I'm going to do fan wank everywhere.

592
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You ready?

593
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Alright, what if, like eAmuse, and if one of these comes with every Switch and you can get additional ones for extra charge, which I'm sure they would happily print cute Nintendo characters and things people want on these cards.

594
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:42,000
What if these cards were like your identity, no matter where you are and what Switch you're playing.

595
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And that maybe you can unlock your own personal achievements on a friend's Switch when you've tapped into being the one playing that console.

596
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Or your records and your scores and your Super Mario levels, you can tap in on a friend's Switch, just like that.

597
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Like it's basically, essentially what I'm saying is that you are the amiibo with a fantasy card.

598
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
That's dumb.

599
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I'm sorry, it's just, that's just, it's completely unnecessary.

600
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Now, and I'm making this up, I'm pulling it out of my ass based on what this is.

601
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So we can't say Nintendo is or is not doing this, but I'm just thinking like, how could Nintendo kind of do this whole like, online gaming thing but put their own spin on it?

602
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And I think maybe rip, I don't want to say ripping off, but taking what's happening in the arcades with things like EMUs and stuff and maybe putting that into a console type environment.

603
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's not a bad idea. I don't know why you think it's dumb as hell. I think that could be kind of neat.

604
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Because, okay, you're comparing the arcade.

605
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Especially if it, okay, especially if it could also work on things like Pokken Tournament in the arcades. That's awesome.

606
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And it's your Nintendo, it's your universal Nintendo ID that you'll inevitably lose because it's on a card.

607
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah, that's assuming that they have that kind of support in the arcades. Like, it makes sense with EMUs because you're going to arcade machines, which you're not exactly going to be bringing that into your house.

608
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And you want to track your progress, of course, across all these different machines.

609
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And that makes sense. I'm not going to go over to my friend's house and tap my amiibo card or whatever the fuck it's going to be to log into their system for what, achievements and shit?

610
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Couldn't we just like, I don't know, like any other fucking system out there already, sign in, oh hey, I'm a guest, log in with your username and password, we're done.

611
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But, to be fair, Loki, that's a pain in the ass on the Xbox 360. I'm not so sure about the Xbox One because I haven't done that. Remember how you have to sit there and wait for it to download your entire fucking profile?

612
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And this wouldn't happen with the whole amiibo card thing, too, because those things aren't going to store a ton of data on it.

613
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Well, now that I'm thinking about it, aren't the Wiimotes supposed to have a little bit of memory in them? Can't you save a Mii to the Wiimote?

614
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah, you can.

615
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So you can take your Mii over to a friend's house?

616
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
That's also very little data. I mean, that's basically the same type of data that's stored in a Mii.

617
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But, so it would show that there's precedent. So, Loki, it's plausible.

618
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:35,000
No, it's stupid because no one ever uses that feature in the first place because, I don't know, it's just they're doing things just to do things. It doesn't make any sense to do them.

619
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It's not something that people are like, oh shit, I would totally play over at my friend's house if it weren't so cumbersome for me to log in on their system.

620
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I don't think it's that, Loki. I think it's that people don't realize they can log in on their friend's Xbox 360s.

621
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Most people don't realize that's a thing you can do. Nintendo can make it part of their ecosystem and they can sell it in a way where they'll be like,

622
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:11,000
that cute little toad on a card, that is your identity. And all you have to do, and they'll show the little video of somebody going to their friend's house, be like, bing!

623
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And like the little sound that it'll make when they tap into their friend's Switch or whatever and then it's like, oh look, my Mii appeared and look, it brought over my Mario levels and all this shit and look what we can do now.

624
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You know that Nintendo can explain it to people in a way that Microsoft can't. That is why I think this idea is not as bad as you think it is.

625
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You explain it like it's gonna do that, but it's not.

626
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That's true, that's true.

627
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Because this is Nintendo and they don't fucking get it.

628
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
We don't know, I am, again, I'm rolling around on the tarp right now.

629
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I mean, I'm just, I'm sorry, but this is not gonna happen. I mean, it's, you're still gonna have to download a profile, whatever, you know what, who cares?

630
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Enough wank, enough wank, mom's home.

631
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It doesn't matter.

632
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I'll move on to the next thing, I just want to quickly say.

633
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Oh, and can we, while we're on the subject of Miis, can we please like fucking update that shit because they look fucking stupid at this point.

634
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And they look fucking dumb.

635
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Do they?

636
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
They do, they look fucking dumb.

637
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I don't think so, I think they're kind of part of the Nintendo culture at this point.

638
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Because they force fed that shit, it's just like fucking, you know, removing features from your products is part of Apple's culture, it doesn't necessarily mean something that we need to have.

639
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Alright, anyway, I don't know how you feel about this, Loki, but it sounds like those little previews of things we saw in the Switch trailer are Director's Cut editions.

640
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Brothers, apparently one of them as well, and Splatoon will be games that are rolled out as a Director's Cut edition for the Switch.

641
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It will include all previously released content and new extras.

642
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That is the other rumor going around too, which, you know, I think what many people are already thinking it probably is, except for the fact that Super Smash Brothers is included in that.

643
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But it makes an awful lot of sense, why not do Smash Brothers as part of that?

644
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I guess maybe because there's a lot of people that like to see an all new Smash Brothers on the Switch, but, you know, do you want to wait five years for them to develop one?

645
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So, you know, anyhow.

646
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:32,000
StoppyInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says, what if you took a hottie out on the first date, you pull out your wallet to get your credit card, and your Nintendo Switch It card falls out instead.

647
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You both stare in silence. What do you do next?

648
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Then she taps it to her Switch and finds out that you've made an amiibo that looks like Hitler as your fucking me.

649
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And then, you know, or penis head or something like that.

650
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yes, that's what happens next, Stoppy. She pulls her Nintendo Switch out of her purse and she says, let's see what kind of gamer you are.

651
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And then taps the Switch card to her Switch and finds out that you are MrDicksLOL on the Nintendo Network.

652
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Then what happens, Stoppy? Then what happens?

653
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
SSG100Matt says, Sakurai says he wanted to take a long, long break from Smash Brothers.

654
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Then again, Nintendo could pay him to reconsider. That's very true, money does talk, but at the same time, the man's earned a break.

655
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, and his me name is Choices.

656
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Exactly.

657
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Fuck you all, next story.

658
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So this was, this was, so this was the live thing that I watched, because it was like, oh, Nintendo Direct, cool.

659
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Maybe we'll get some cool information, but then the back of my brain said, you're right.

660
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So there was a free update for Animal Crossing that they announced for Animal Crossing New Leaf.

661
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It adds amiibo support, because why the fuck not? And then RVs.

662
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah, so it's called Welcome Amiibo.

663
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And basically you can, you know, take your amiibos and you can even bring in, I guess, some of the non-Animal Crossing amiibos,

664
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
which I think also like kind of adds skins and stuff for your characters or like different clothing.

665
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Some of the other stuff that they have, you can actually get an RV and a new RV campground.

666
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And you can even, I guess, they have some different mini games, including Animal Crossing Puzzle League.

667
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Oh, that's cool that they brought in like some of the mini game stuff.

668
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah. And they said that Desert Island Escape.

669
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But I guess with the amiibos, what that does is it actually brings the villager, whatever villager you want into your village.

670
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So like if you have a favorite villager or something, you can go purchase one of those amiibo cards.

671
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Although if I remember correctly, I think they're all blind packs, so fuck you guys.

672
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But you can try to find one for the villagers that you like and then you scan it and then they come in their RV and you can, I don't know, hang out or something.

673
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And question your life that you purchased cards.

674
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Stop it.

675
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Get a character in your town.

676
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Hey, you know what, I think it's rad that Nintendo put in this pretty major update to a game that is what, like three years old at least?

677
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
At least four?

678
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
It's a pretty major update to this game.

679
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So I think that's kind of rad actually.

680
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Like I want to go back and check this out for like to see like how the mini games are and apparently you can sell your town.

681
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
And now here's the thing though.

682
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I still have the old 3DS, so I can't use the amiibo.

683
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I mean, I know I can buy one of those adapter things, but why? Why would I do that?

684
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Because you're an Apple fan and you like dongles.

685
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
No, I'm not going to do it.

686
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
But I'm sure there's 50 amiibo cards you can buy. 50! Think of all those 50 purchases you can make.

687
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I don't need the 50 amiibo cards because I already have way too many of the fucking regular amiibo.

688
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Are you sure?

689
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Well, and I understand. Didn't they put the Splatoon stuff in it too? And Zelda stuff?

690
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So there's other amiibo that I already have that I can use in it.

691
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I just need to find a friend with a reader. Maybe Shane has an adapter.

692
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
No, Shane doesn't have an adapter because he has like seven DS's and so he has all the new DS's.

693
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Somebody I know has to have one of those adapters and I can just borrow it to get what I need and then that's it.

694
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's just like the cards. You find your friend that has the villager that you want and you just borrow the friend's card.

695
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:39,000
You don't actually need to buy 5,000 packs to find the one blind card that's eluding you.

696
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
ActDeft says four years old, release date November 8th, 2002.

697
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
So that's, I mean, that's pretty, look.

698
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
2012 I'm assuming.

699
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
2012, sorry, 2012. EA would have shut the server down this year.

700
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Nintendo updated the game. You gotta give them credit for that. Come on. That's pretty cool.

701
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
They're not making any other animal products.

702
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Yes, it's just sell more Abibo, but I think it's still really cool.

703
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
RageNator in chat says, Sky, you have how many versions of Mass Effect 3, yet you won't get a new 3DS.

704
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Is Mass Effect 3 on the 3DS? Thank you. Have a seat.

705
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,000
No. And I'm guessing that the reason you're buying a PlayStation Pro is because the Pro support for the new Mass Effect game, right?

706
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yes, that would be correct. And Final Fantasy.

707
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And are you, are you hyped up for N7 Day tomorrow?

708
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yes, I am. And you better believe that, especially because DarkSakura will be back on our next mini episode.

709
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Loki, you could just have a, you could have a little nap the first 45 minutes of the next episode,

710
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
because that will be, and we'll get out the tarp again,

711
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
because Jamie and I are going to have a time with whatever comes out tomorrow in N7 Day.

712
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So, bring a book, is what I'm saying.

713
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Alright. If you have no interest in Mass Effect.

714
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I don't.

715
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
You should.

716
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Alright. Anyway, let's move on with, I'm sorry, what is this?

717
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Rama in chat says, Mass Effect 3 isn't on 3DS because there's a no trash games policy enforced.

718
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Okay, you and I both know that's not true, and for that comment, I'm going to right-click, control, kick.

719
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
That was fun.

720
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Alright, let's move on and talk about that PlayStation 4 Pro that somehow I'm being suckered into buying,

721
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
and yeah, probably because of Mass Effect, and because of Final Fantasy, and Lord knows what out.

722
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Lord knows what else.

723
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:50,000
The PlayStation 4 is coming out within days, and we're finally getting an idea of what all is actually going to be supported by the PlayStation 4 Pro,

724
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and that includes things like Battlefield 1, Battlezone, Call of Duty, Black Ops 3 Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare, Dishonored 2,

725
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Drive Club VR, Firewatch, Hitman, Infamous First Light and Second Sun, Mafia 3, NBA 2K17, PlayStation VR Worlds,

726
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Rez Infinite, Rise of the Tomb Raider, SMITE, Elder Scrolls Online, Elder Scrolls Skyrim Special Edition,

727
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Super Stardust Ultra, Titanfall 2, Uncharted 4, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, World of Tanks, XCOM 2.

728
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I didn't even read everything on the list. That is a lot of games that are going to be getting some additional support,

729
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
and that's just what the old games are that are going to be getting new stuff in PS4 Pro.

730
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
This doesn't talk about everything moving forward, although now that the PlayStation 4 Pro is in play,

731
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,000
we kind of know based on the first press conference that Sony is really encouraging developers to think about the PlayStation 4 Pro

732
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
when they're developing games, and obviously with things like Mass Effect, like Final Fantasy XV,

733
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
we know the PlayStation 4 Pro will be a part of that.

734
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But there are some games that have said they are not doing stuff. I know Witcher 3 was one of them.

735
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
The publisher of Witcher 3 was like, we are moving on to developing our next game,

736
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
and it's kind of one of those we don't have time to go back and do it for PlayStation 4 Pro.

737
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:16,000
But that game is solid as it is. Plus, that game was out a while ago already.

738
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I realize they did a best of edition that has all the DLC included and all that, but that's different.

739
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm just hoping they go back. I know that they just released Skyrim Special Edition, and they have Fallout 4 already.

740
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I remember Bethesda was talking about how they were going to have a full VR version of Fallout 4 at some point.

741
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
It would be nice to see that support added. I would say that's what I'd like to see, is VR support added to older games.

742
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
You know which game could really use that right now, could really benefit from that?

743
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,000
A game called No Man's Sky. Because honestly, no one's playing that right now. I'm not playing that right now.

744
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
But with VR, I would certainly go back and try it again.

745
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Are they still working on patches for No Man's Sky? I don't think we know.

746
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,000
The only way to get a response out of them is to hack them. Apparently at this point.

747
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Not that I'm saying you should, but I'm just noticing that's the only time we've gotten a response lately.

748
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yep, I don't know.

749
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Alright, anyhow.

750
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the past phrase, hot.

751
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Moving on, Logie.

752
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Alright, so this is kind of a good policy that they're putting in place.

753
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Valve has asked developers now to stay away from using just concept art or other art assets on their Steam pages for these games.

754
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And use more in-game screenshots. So it's part of their Discovery 2.0 update on Steam.

755
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And they're gonna actually kind of follow along with that because one of the games that was a culprit of that was Dota 2.

756
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And so they've actually gone in and updated the page and removed the concept art and put more screenshots in there.

757
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Which I think is a genuine thing that they should be doing.

758
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And a lot of games really should be doing that to be as honest as possible for the players.

759
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Because you're looking at this concept art and you're like, oh wow, the game looks really good.

760
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And come to find out, it doesn't look like that at all. Sorry.

761
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Yeah, I don't think any of us like when the only stuff we see in the game is a full CGI trailer.

762
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
And it's like, the game doesn't really look like that.

763
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Exactly.

764
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah.

765
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So that's cool. You know, I think people want to know exactly what it is they're buying.

766
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So encouraging more actual in-game screenshots is a good thing.

767
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Not that you can't have some CG because, you know, especially some games kind of build themselves on epic CG cutscenes.

768
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
That's fine. That's still a screenshot from the game.

769
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Yeah, exactly, exactly. But, you know, there's gonna be a lot of people that are gonna ask, as in the case of No Man's Sky, for example.

770
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Where's the game? What's the game? What is it? Show me the game.

771
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
You know, and I think it's good to encourage those types of screenshots as well.

772
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Well, and also, yeah, too, that's a perfect example because look at No Man's Sky.

773
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,000
A lot of the screenshots they were showing were from those E3 trailers, which don't look anything like the actual game.

774
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:23,000
This game can only look better with time and age, and that's the classic game Bastion, which was released on the Xbox 360.

775
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Gosh, it was several years ago at this point. That's why I'm almost calling it a classic at this point.

776
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It was a while ago at this point when Bastion first came out.

777
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:37,000
But, what's kind of neat is that Bastion is gonna be coming to Xbox One, but it's not just backwards compatibility.

778
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
They're going to do a new adaptation, Supergiant Games that is, a new adaptation of Bastion on Xbox One.

779
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:51,000
They've rebuilt it to make it feel native to the platform, so it will now run at a full 1080p, and it's gonna include the Stranger's Dream add-on.

780
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
There will be new achievements in there as well, and this is really cool.

781
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So it's coming out on December 12th, that's when the Xbox One adaptation comes out.

782
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And if you own it on 360, you can get the new one free if you get it before January 1st.

783
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So you will have like, what, a two and a half week window to get the new remaster free if you had it on Xbox 360.

784
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Otherwise, if you're looking to get it for the first time, 15 bucks, which I believe is what the game costs the first time.

785
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So yeah, that's really cool. I think I did own that game on 360. I owned it somewhere, it was PC.

786
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But I thought I had it on PC. I think I had it on 360, I can't even remember, isn't that sad?

787
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I think I had it on 360, and then I played it again on PC because I got it as some type of bundle thingy.

788
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And so, yeah, but I'm pretty sure I had picked it up when it first came out on 360, because you know, it was a rad game.

789
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
So I'm glad we'll kind of have an excuse to revisit it.

790
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It would be cool if more backwards compatibility stuff did this, but I understand its resources.

791
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And you know, like CD Projekt Red, the Witcher guy is not wanting to do PS4 Pro.

792
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It's because they want to focus on new stuff. I get it, I get it.

793
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
But this is a cool little, it's a cool little perk. I like that.

794
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Alright, Logy.

795
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
So while we have Microsoft supporting some of that stuff pretty well, this is something that really could use some work.

796
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And that would be the Windows 10 store.

797
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So, if you were buying Call of Duty on PC, where would you choose to purchase it from?

798
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Most people would probably decide to pick it up on the Steam store, because you know, that makes sense.

799
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Although some crazy people like to, you know, go against the norm and decide, hey, let's purchase it off the Windows 10 store.

800
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Well, if you happen to purchase it off the Windows 10 store, you'll be unfortunately, or you'll be pleased or surprised to find out that you can't play it against any of the people that are owning it on the Steam store.

801
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So, if you own the Steam version, you can't see the people that have it on the Windows 10 store, and vice versa.

802
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
They have actually split the PC version for some reason. I'm not really sure why.

803
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Yeah. Apparently, I don't know, according to Activision, they're saying that they support cross-play between devices and platforms for partners who want to enable it.

804
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Well, I guess that's what Microsoft said, but I'm not sure why these versions were split on PC.

805
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:31,000
But hey, if you're planning on picking it up on PC, probably go with the Steam version if you want actual people to play against when you go to play online.

806
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Because I'm sure there's like a handful of people that probably bought it on the Windows 10 store.

807
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I don't understand why anybody thought this was a good idea.

808
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Well, here's why I would think maybe why people might have decided to purchase that. Maybe they thought that this was one of those games that you purchased it on PC.

809
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,000
You also get, you know, the Xbox One version or something like that, which is not the case at all.

810
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But if you do make that mistake and end up purchasing that, you can't play, I mean, no other game does this where you can't play on, you know, another person on PC.

811
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's stupid. Why? Why would that exist? Activision, why would you do that? I mean, I only get it.

812
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Raginator in chat says, aside from the free version of Killer Instinct plus the Windows 10 version of Minecraft, I've got nothing game-wise from the Windows 10 store.

813
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Well, I think I got Jetpack Joyride and maybe whatever Mahjong thing they had for free, I think, on the store.

814
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
And then the Minecraft. I think that's about all I've picked up on the Windows 10 store, too.

815
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
The Minecraft version's fantastic, but that's really the only thing I'd be interested in picking up.

816
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And you know what? The only other thing would be, like, stuff that, you know, you do that cross-buy thing where you purchase, like, Forza or something and you can download.

817
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:55,000
But fuck, if I'm actually gonna make third-party purchases on that. That goes with, like, even you play or anything like that.

818
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I'm not purchasing shit on your store. It's all Steam, unless that's the only place I can purchase that.

819
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Which, if it was a Valve game, yes, Steam would be the only place you could purchase that.

820
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Right.

821
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Or a Blizzard game. Can't get those on Steam. Can't get Diablo on Steam.

822
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:19,000
So, some companies get, which, by the way, also Activision. Funny how that works, huh?

823
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
So maybe Activision thinks they can do it that way.

824
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Well, but no, that doesn't make any sense, though, because they have it on both storefronts, so it's like, who said that those versions should be incompatible with each other?

825
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Was that an Activision call? Because that doesn't make any goddamn sense. If it was a Microsoft call, that still doesn't make any goddamn sense.

826
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Yeah, no, it doesn't. I would think it would have to be on Activision's ends, because it would be their servers, right?

827
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I guess. There's, like, literally two different versions of the game, but I just don't understand.

828
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Or does the Windows 10 version go through Microsoft servers? Is that the problem?

829
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But if that's the case, then would they be able to play against Xbox One players? Because then that would make sense.

830
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Oh, I'm sorry, you just won't be playing against PC players, but you'll play against Xbox One players.

831
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:13,000
But if it's just, I'm sorry, you're stuck with this tiny subset of the PC players and you're playing with... that's stupid.

832
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
It's still a little weird to splinter it that way.

833
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
If you want to sell it for $19.99, I'm on board, but, yeah.

834
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:27,000
All right. Well, you know what? We're going to take a step back into the time machine here at Orange Lounge Radio.

835
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
We're going to take a step back with the Classic Game of the Week.

836
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And every week, we step into the gaming vault here at OLR Studios and pull out a game that we think,

837
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,000
hey, you kids should be checking this game out. This is back before they could splinter audiences.

838
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
In fact, this is a time when the only thing that's going to give you a splinter is the console, because of all the wood in it.

839
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It's the Classic Game of the Week. DarkSakura is sadly unable to join us, thanks to Radio Magic.

840
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
That could be related to the fact that I've been sick the past few days, and I hear she was, too.

841
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
So, being sick sucks. But, again, she will be back joining us next week,

842
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
where we can fill her in on what a good job we've been doing keeping this segment going while the Radio Magic has been broken.

843
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So, the Classic Game of the Week this week is one that I'm picking, and you might have guessed based on my opening joke there,

844
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
that I've picked something on the Atari 2600. And it doesn't really have much of a soundtrack.

845
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Usually, we play the music in the background, but because this is Atari 2600, there isn't much.

846
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:30,000
But there is this, so let's see if you can guess from this sound what game this is.

847
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
If you were only listening to that, Loki, what does that sound like to you?

848
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Any Atari game ever?

849
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
The game is Kaboom! Kaboom!, which was on the Atari 2600.

850
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It was published in 1981 for the 2600, although it did come out later on the 5200 in 1983.

851
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It was designed by Larry Kaplan, and then David Crane, who was a legend in the 2600 games, Game Days.

852
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
He did the sprites, overlay sprites for the game. This game did very well.

853
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It was a million-plus seller, which the interesting thing about Kaboom! is, like many Atari 2600 games,

854
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
it was very, very simple in concept. There wasn't a whole lot to it.

855
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
You controlled these buckets. You had a series of three buckets that were stacked on top of each other,

856
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
like a little elevator, that you controlled with the paddle, moving them left and right,

857
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
as the mad bomber at the top of the screen would drop bombs in a swirly pattern or whatever,

858
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
so you had to move the paddle left and right to catch the bombs.

859
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And if one of the bombs hit the ground, Kaboom! That's where the game gets its name from,

860
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
when the bomb hits the ground, which hopefully won't happen to you.

861
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
It is a lot like a 1978 Atari coin-operated game called Avalanche,

862
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
but when Activision, believe it or not, again, this is when Activision is a very old company,

863
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
and this is when they were doing games of the 2600.

864
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
When Activision did this, and Larry Kaplan and David Crane put this together,

865
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
they rethemed it to be the mad bomber instead of falling rocks,

866
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
probably so that it wouldn't get confused with the Avalanche games.

867
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Anyhow, so again, you use the paddle controller, you have multiple buckets,

868
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
but if a bomb hits the ground, you lose a bucket.

869
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So, like, the bucket on the bottom will disappear, which actually makes the game a little bit harder,

870
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
because you don't have as much time to actually catch one of the bombs.

871
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
So, yeah, I wouldn't recommend letting a bomb hit the ground on purpose,

872
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
unless, you know, it's some part of some weird strategy.

873
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Because when a bomb does hit the ground,

874
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:43,000
it will resume with the bombs falling half as fast as they were previously before you screwed up.

875
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
So, I have seen some high score runners purposefully lose a bucket

876
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
right before they're about to get a free bucket to purposely slow down the game.

877
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So, I have seen that happen.

878
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
But otherwise, you get points for every bomb caught.

879
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Extra buckets are awarded to every thousand points.

880
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
If you pay attention to the mad bomber's face, he's usually not happy,

881
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
probably because you're catching all his bombs.

882
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
But if a bomb hits the ground, he smiles, because he's an asshole,

883
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
and he's trying to, you know, drop bombs on you, and that's not nice.

884
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,000
However, there was always this tease that if you could get 10,000 points in the game,

885
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
something special would happen.

886
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Do you know what that special thing was?

887
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
The mad bomber would look surprised.

888
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
That was the special thing that happens at 10,000 points.

889
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
The mad bomber's surprised.

890
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Anyway, if you could score over 3,000 points,

891
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
that is how you could get the old school achievements on the Atari 2600.

892
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
You mail in a Polaroid photo of your TV,

893
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
and they would send you a patch for your super cool jacket.

894
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
So, that was what you had to do.

895
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
3,000 points would earn you one of those patches.

896
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So, again, this was one of the all-time greats on the Atari 2600.

897
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It was just, I remember playing this game at a very young age,

898
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
and I think because it was so simple, yet it was so engrossing,

899
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
and so easy to pick up, and, you know,

900
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
it's like just one of those games you can kind of sit there and you Zen out.

901
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
It's like following the pattern and trying to make sure you catch the bombs and everything.

902
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It's a lot of fun, and usually the games are pretty short,

903
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
unless there's some YouTuber out there who uploaded his video

904
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
that he submitted to Twin Galaxies of scoring, get this, 999,999 points.

905
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Took him three hours, no, almost three and a half hours, I think, to do it,

906
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and then the game finally fucking breaks when he hits that number.

907
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
It freezes because the game doesn't know what to do.

908
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It can't count that high, so the game freezes up.

909
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
That is absolutely the highest score you can get is 999,999.

910
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So, there it is, your classic game of the week.

911
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Kaboom.

912
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Which, yes, it was part of, as some folks in chat are mentioning,

913
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
it was part of the Game Room service.

914
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,000
You could get this in 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Room service,

915
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
which is no longer around.

916
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Screw you, Microsoft, for that.

917
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I'm not a fan that they shut down Game Room.

918
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Although, honestly, nothing matches that paddle controller.

919
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,000
The little analog stick is okay, but it doesn't match the paddle controller.

920
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Like, the closest thing I've used that actually kind of works is a mouse.

921
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
A mouse will do an all right job, but, I mean,

922
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
the paddle controller was really where it's at.

923
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So, there it is, your classic game of the week.

924
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Kaboom.

925
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Something really, really, really old for you to check out,

926
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
but I think a classic.

927
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Certainly one of the best Atari 2600 games,

928
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
one of the best selling they ever put out.

929
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Anyhow, we are going to take a break, but don't go anywhere, you guys.

930
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
When we come back, plenty more Orange Lounge ready to come,

931
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
including your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

932
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
When we come back, with the conclusion of Orange Lounge Radio,

933
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
right after this.

934
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

935
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Tonight, episode number 664 in progress.

936
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
For this, November the 6th of 2016.

937
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Hey, shout out to everybody that participated with Extra Life over the weekend.

938
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I know that was something that was going on this weekend,

939
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and looking at the tote board over at their Twitter account,

940
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Extra Life 4, the number 4 kids,

941
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,000
they raised over $6.6 million for the Children's Hospital Miracle Network,

942
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
or, excuse me, Children's Mir- I got that out of order.

943
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Children's Miracle Network Hospitals charity.

944
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Sorry about that, but we know it's a good cause, no matter which way I order the words.

945
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I had some friends that participated in that.

946
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I tried to host a couple streams on my Twitch channels,

947
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
but every time they switched games, it broke the hosting,

948
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
so I wasn't able to do that all weekend long.

949
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I do know Dark Sakura and Dan were participating in that at some point,

950
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
because she was streaming at some point,

951
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
but their setup, they couldn't really talk, so it was just raw gameplay.

952
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
But they were playing some cool games.

953
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
They weren't playing anything new.

954
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
They were playing at one point Street Fighter Alpha 2,

955
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
just random shit, because you know Jamie and Dan.

956
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
They drove over to their house.

957
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
They're always playing some random shit that probably isn't from this decade,

958
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
but that's why we love them, because they play a lot of classic games as well.

959
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
But anyway, very cool that that marathon raised a lot, a lot of money,

960
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,000
so congrats to everybody involved in that, and job well done.

961
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Let's get back into some rapid-fire news.

962
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Start with Loki.

963
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:32,000
All right, so aside from getting one of these with a Google Pixel or something like that,

964
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:41,000
the Google Daydream View VR will be releasing very soon, next week in fact, on November 10th,

965
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
and you can get it at a variety of locations.

966
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
For example, in the United States, they're going to be selling it for $79,

967
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
and that's going to be through Best Buy or Verizon.

968
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:03,000
If you're in the UK, you can get it at Ee, our car phone warehouse for 69 pounds, it looks like.

969
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Some of the games that they said are going to be supported by it, Danger Goat, Gun Jack 2 End of Shift,

970
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Home Run Derby, Hunter's Gate, Macorama, Need for Speed No Limits VR, and Wonder Glade.

971
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I thought about picking up a Pixel just to get one of these, but no, I got PlayStation VR instead.

972
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Fair enough.

973
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, Call of Duty Infinite Warfare's Jackal Assault is out now on PlayStation VR.

974
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's free, so you can go check it out, download it, and see if you think it's more impressive than I thought it was, but it's free.

975
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
That's right, make your own damn decision. Don't listen to Loki, especially when the game is free.

976
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It's free, but jeez, you know, it's just...

977
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Although I use free with quotey fingers, because you have to buy a PlayStation VR.

978
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
So there is a little investment to make up front, but yeah.

979
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
At least it's something else you get to experience when you put down the money for a PlayStation VR.

980
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:13,000
There's like the Apollo 11 thing that they have on Oculus and stuff,

981
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
and I thought that was supposed to be coming out on PlayStation VR as well soon, but for some reason that hasn't been released yet.

982
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
It might just be in a couple weeks or something.

983
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
November is a very busy month for games, as we'll find out here shortly, right?

984
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Anyhow, some other news.

985
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Hey, remember the game Destroy All Humans?

986
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:37,000
The game is only about, what, 11 years old, but it is now available on the PlayStation 4 digital store.

987
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Now there's trophies and widescreen support.

988
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So yeah, there was I guess supposed to be a Destroy All Humans 2.

989
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Oh no, I'm sorry, I meant there's supposed to be one as well coming out for PlayStation 4,

990
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:58,000
because it's been spoiled by the PEGI ratings board, but it is not actually out on PlayStation 4 yet.

991
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It did not come out with Part 1.

992
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
So yeah, there you go.

993
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So if you want to check out another PlayStation 2 classic on PlayStation 4, there you go.

994
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
That's available for $20.

995
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Speaking of classics, Blue Dragon has made its way to Xbox One backwards compatibility.

996
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:23,000
So if you own a copy of Blue Dragon, which I do, yay, you can go check that out now on Xbox One backwards compatibility.

997
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But I would ask you, have you beat Lost Odyssey yet?

998
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Because if not, don't go back and play Blue Dragon yet.

999
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
No, I'm just kidding.

1000
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Both games were fine.

1001
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I preferred Lost Odyssey a little more.

1002
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Some people really love the art style of Blue Dragon,

1003
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
especially because they had some very well done characters and so forth.

1004
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So yeah, check that out.

1005
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I don't know if anything else was announced at the same time for backwards compatibility.

1006
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I didn't check if there were, because usually it's like three games at a time,

1007
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
but I didn't check if anything else was released that same day.

1008
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Blue Dragon was kind of getting all the press on that.

1009
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Alright, let's get into what is in stores this week.

1010
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Although our pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat has an update for you, Loki, on Apollo 11 VR.

1011
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
We will be releasing the PSVR version of Apollo 11 VR later this year.

1012
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:20,000
We are aiming for release of the PSVR, but we felt we needed to update the experience first before release.

1013
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
It's coming very, very soon.

1014
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Cool.

1015
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Alright, well speaking of coming very, very soon, Loki, this Tuesday in stores.

1016
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
So yeah, this week we've got quite a few things.

01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000

Eagle Flight, that weird Ubisoft game where you play as an eagle.

1021
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
That's on PlayStation VR this week.

01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000

Candle on PC, Mac, and Linux.

1033
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And Dishonored 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1034
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
That's it.

1035
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Big Week, are you picking up anything on that?

1036
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
No.

1037
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Maybe I might check out, I had to see about Robinson, The Journey, how expensive it is.

1038
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And what the reviews look like on that.

1039
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
But maybe that one.

1040
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
But no for the rest.

1041
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Alright, well things in Japan, not quite as noisy as they are here.

1042
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
But we do still have some releases to point out this week.

1043
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Which includes the Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes plus Phantom Pain combo pack is out this week.

1044
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
As well as the PlayStation 4 Pro of course also gets its release in Japan.

1045
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And there is a game called Fate, Excella.

1046
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Which comes out in a Regalia box and a Velbor box.

1047
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Which are I guess two different types of collectibles there.

1048
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
That you can get that is out in Japan.

1049
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Also there is a red and a blue controller that you can pick up.

1050
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
That's the new Dualshock that goes with the new PlayStation.

1051
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You can check that out.

1052
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And you can also get a full PlayStation 4 with Fate, Excella actually included with it.

1053
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Where some of the artwork from the game is like on the PlayStation 4 itself.

1054
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
So this release is big enough to justify that type of special PlayStation.

1055
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So you can check that out over in Japan this week.

1056
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Otherwise over on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

1057
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:00,000
There is also some new Nintendo, I'm sorry that is another countries release that snuck in there.

1058
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So I will mention Beyblade comes out this week in Japan.

1059
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Saikai Kusou no Sainen.

1060
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Shijuu Sadae no Saina comes out as well.

1061
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And Rilu Rilu Feralu Kira Kira Hajimeite no Feralu Magic comes out as well.

1062
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Obviously all of this will not matter the next week because Pokemon Sun and Moon are out.

1063
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Which is a huge release.

1064
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So that's why things are, you know, there are some games on the 3DS but it's going to get really noisy on the 3DS next week.

1065
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
As it will over here.

1066
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Lastly on the Vita since, you know, it's still a thing, the Vita in Japan.

1067
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
We do have that Fate, Excella also releasing there in Japan this week.

1068
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,000
There is also a Vita to go with Fate, Excella also releasing in Japan this week.

1069
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
It's a white PlayStation Vita with some of the artwork from the game on its back.

1070
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And AkumaJP is in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com and says,

1071
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Fate has its mania.

1072
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,000
So basically like there's definitely a lot of fans over there that will buy this stuff up.

1073
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
So there you go, that's what you have in Japan.

1074
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
How about the UK, Loki?

1075
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
The only thing listed for this week is Dishonored 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

1076
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Alright, before we get to our mailbag, I thought this is a good time for us to get a little bit angsty

1077
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
and get some things off our chest because we've been waiting until the end of the show the past few weeks.

1078
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And you know what, I don't have time to wait, I'm mad, we're getting it out right now.

1079
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Loki?

1080
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I would like to try to act more angry, but unfortunately I have a really killer migraine right now

1081
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,000
that hasn't gone away for a few hours.

1082
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I mean it's dulled itself for the medication, but as soon as that 4 hour mark hits, it's coming back.

1083
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So just have to get the migraine.

1084
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Well, my F.U. goes to being sick because even though I thought I'd shaken most of this,

1085
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
my God, this is hard to get through a 3 hour show.

1086
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I'm like, oh my God.

1087
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. And I have one more actually.

1088
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Oh, sure. F.U. to Loki for cutting me off.

1089
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
But yeah, God, being sick sucks. I hate it.

1090
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I cannot miss any more works. I need to go back tomorrow.

1091
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And it's just like, oh my God, don't let me feel like crap tomorrow.

1092
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And I'm supposed to go to Chicago on Thursday. Don't ruin my trip.

1093
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What did I do to deserve this? I'm a good person.

1094
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Loki?

1095
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Okay, my other F.U. goes to people that drive cars who blow through intersections

1096
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
or just flat out just try to hit you with their car.

1097
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And then when you look at them like you fucking idiot, they're like, sorry, and shrug their shoulders.

1098
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Like I literally saw a guy do this.

1099
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
He ran through the stop sign, just completely blew through it at 40 miles an hour in a residential.

1100
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
He just kind of like shrugged his shoulders like, sorry.

1101
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I'm like, you're not fucking sorry.

1102
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
You dumbass, you're not sorry at all.

1103
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
They're like this old woman, I was like crossing the street.

1104
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And she like nearly hit me with her car.

1105
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And she's just like, sorry.

1106
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I'm like, you're not fucking sorry at all, you old bat.

1107
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I just hate people like that.

1108
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It's like seriously, just, yes, it's your road, of course.

1109
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I'm interfering with your driving.

1110
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
All right.

1111
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
There it is, the F.U.s of the week.

1112
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Let's try to better our mood a little bit by reading some fan mail.

1113
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Every week you guys send an email to the show.

1114
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do it.

1115
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
And we pick our favorites and we read them here live on air.

1116
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
You know, it's been a while since we've really had some emails, but we have a few this week.

1117
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
We're making up for some lost time this week.

1118
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
So I have some emails to get into tonight.

1119
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And our first email tonight comes from our old pal YYR.

1120
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And this email caught my attention immediately because the subject of the email was that Shane.

1121
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And I was like, oh, good, we're going to have an email to drag Shane a little bit tonight.

1122
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Hopefully he's not listening, but we'll see.

1123
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Anyway, let's get to YYR's email.

1124
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
It starts off like this.

1125
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Hello, my name is Aaron Tepletsky.

1126
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I hope I said that right. Sorry, buddy.

1127
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
And this email is about how much I hate Shane Alinko.

1128
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
You have my attention. I'm a fan of this fan mail. Let's get to it.

1129
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And then says, just kidding. Oh, bummer.

1130
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Actually, this is regarding the discussion you guys had on last week's show about Super Mario Run.

1131
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:47,000
The way that Nintendo is choosing to sell it and their ambitious goal to make it as popular as Pokemon Go.

1132
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
For years now, it's been obvious that Nintendo mostly ignores what their competitors are doing.

1133
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And instead, they do things their own way.

1134
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
The Switch trailer clearly showed that they will continue down that path.

1135
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Super Mario Run is no exception to this.

1136
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,000
One of the ways the most popular mobile games have held on and grown their audience over the years has been continuous expansion.

1137
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Hate all you want on Candy Crush, but the game now contains over 2,700 levels.

1138
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
What?

1139
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I think I got as far as level 40 and then it was like, I literally could not get past the stage without some of the pay to win stuff.

1140
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And I was like, fuck this game.

1141
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Exactly why there's 2,700 levels.

1142
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Oh my god, that's how there's 2,700 levels? Jesus.

1143
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
You gotta beat them all and if you can't beat them all, then you gotta pay to beat them.

1144
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Even Rama, who played that game more than anybody else I know, said I hit level 375 and bailed.

1145
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And even when he was that far into it, I was like, intervention! Call A&E.

1146
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Believe it or not, over 1,000 of those levels, email continuing, were added just over the last 18 months.

1147
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:03,000
King, along with the makers of other popular mobile games, have been able to keep and grow their player bases just by continuing to add content to their games.

1148
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And many of their players have not actually paid them anything at all.

1149
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Nintendo, on the other hand, seem to be releasing a game that unlocks entirely after one purchase.

1150
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:21,000
On one hand, it sounds nice, but this also implies that the purchase game will be complete as is and will not be expanded in the future.

1151
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:28,000
If this is the case, I expect that the majority of the audience will complete all the levels within days, if not sooner, and then will never come back.

1152
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
That's not going to generate much word of mouth.

1153
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:37,000
If Nintendo wanted to use this sort of outright purchase strategy, I feel like a better idea would have been to release level packs,

1154
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:43,000
and then continue to release level packs every month in the future to keep the players engaged in the revenue coming in.

1155
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:51,000
But it seems that's not what they're doing. I wish Nintendo luck with Super Mario Run, sure, and I'll look forward to just trying it personally.

1156
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:58,000
But to think it can match the previous success of Pokemon GO is just delusional, unless they borrow a page from Candy Crush,

1157
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
or just about every other long-term successful mobile game.

1158
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Sigh. I blame Shane for this, and for every misguided idea Nintendo has ever had.

1159
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
As well I should.

1160
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Until next time, YYR.

1161
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Now, unfortunately, Shane is not here to defend himself.

1162
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,000
But SSJ100Matt enters a very plausible Shane plea.

1163
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I'll give you Shane's thoughts on it, from SSJ100Matt's.

1164
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Um, whatever, you're wrong. Also, I don't care.

1165
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I think that's very fair. It's like he's in the room with us right now.

1166
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,000
No, all that aside, I'm actually, all seriousness, I'm actually not sure what that had to do with Shane so much.

1167
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Shane must have taken a stance on it last night. I know he's been very hard on Pokemon GO.

1168
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:57,000
On the Pokestop podcast, which we just did another episode that I have to put on the feed, but he still is very, very harsh on Pokemon GO,

1169
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
and the fact that, you know, that game's kinda over, basically.

1170
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Yeah.

1171
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,000
The minute, but to YYR's credit, he's absolutely right.

1172
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
The minute they release more Pokemon, there'll be more people back in the game, for sure.

1173
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Imagine when they release shinies on there.

1174
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Yeah, exactly. Imagine when they release shinies, even Shane will be back. Absolutely.

1175
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,000
But they're kind of drip feeding some of that now, because, you know, just today, like hours before we went live,

1176
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Pokemon GO added that whole daily bonus thing, which I think we'll cover in detail a little later in the show.

1177
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
So, I mean, Pokemon GO is, you know, trying to add some of that stuff.

1178
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:39,000
So, I can see for one perspective where, based on, you know, YYR's, kind of what he's saying in his email,

1179
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Super Mario Run does have to do great business out the gate, because it might not have a lot of longevity otherwise.

1180
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:57,000
But at the same time, YYR, to be fair, we are also talking about a company that put out a very major patch for a four-year-old game this week.

1181
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:04,000
So, anything's possible. Maybe there will be some free level packs that come out throughout the line,

1182
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
or some other types of expansions, or so forth. Who knows? Who knows?

1183
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Alright, let's get to some other emails here. Next email comes to us from Robert M., who says,

1184
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I went to Six Flags with my brother's family. Some major issues with food service, but that's not the relevant part.

1185
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:30,000
My corn dog wasn't cooked. When we went by the arcade, I quietly lamented the very small selection of redemption machines,

1186
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:37,000
and got to thinking, what were the original, literal Penny arcades like before Space War and Pong?

1187
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I imagine largely simple pinball machines, before flippers even, and hand-cranked movies.

1188
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Personally, I'd love to see a clever and forceful steampunk group build an elaborate,

1189
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:55,000
mutoscope version of Dragon's Lair with art more resembling iWorks? I don't know.

1190
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
That's referencing an old technology that I don't know the name off the top of my head.

1191
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Then Bluth, and somehow fully mechanical. Oh, it's a name. Sorry about that.

1192
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:12,000
What's your historical knowledge about that era of arcades? Clearly, if I'm fumbling over your names, not enough.

1193
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Would some form of redemption machine have been a thing back then? Thanks.

1194
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Well, I do know pinball's been around a very long time.

1195
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Pinball's been around certainly longer than video arcade machines have been.

1196
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Pinball was always kind of a bar thing, although certainly there were arcades and things like what you're talking about as well.

1197
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,000
But yeah, a lot of the Penny arcades was also those old visual crank-turning things. You would see that.

1198
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And then, you know, we really didn't start seeing arcades as they were now until it was really like Pong,

1199
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:52,000
and then just the floodgates that opened in the late 70s once Atari started doing more like asteroids and things like that.

1200
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And then you started getting Pac-Man, and just like in the early 80s, it was really like the floodgates were opened and just unleashed there.

1201
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:09,000
So before that, I don't think you had as many arcades, but you certainly still probably had them in places like boardwalks and stuff,

1202
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
where I think it was probably a lot more like carnival games and those sorts of things.

1203
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,000
And then like you talked about in there, like the very old crank machines and things like that.

1204
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I do know that, at least for a while, I don't think they have it anymore.

1205
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I know for a while Disneyland had a place called Penny Arcade, but it was like there was a few of those crank machines.

1206
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
You could see old Disney cartoons, and then the rest of it is a souvenir shop. Like there's not really a whole lot in there.

1207
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
But now it's all about Penny slot machines, but that's very, very different.

1208
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I suppose in Nevada, if you went to a Penny Arcade, it was a very different thing. It was slot machines.

1209
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Anyhow, oh, there was a PS on that email. I want to make sure I get here.

1210
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I did pick up Severed and Crypt of the Necrodancer during the iOS spooky game sale.

1211
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Not sure how long I can dedicate a full gigabyte to the latter, but certainly recommendable.

1212
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Alright, let's get to our last email tonight from Ragenator, who says,

1213
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Hi Sky, Loki, and Shane and or Alan, if either one of you are there.

1214
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Well, you missed, it's just Loki and I hope that's okay.

1215
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:27,000
It's Ragenator yet again. Seeing as it's become more or less my thing, I just wanted to point out a deal for everyone.

1216
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:31,000
As I type this, GOG, or Good Old Games, is having their fall sale.

1217
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
While not everything is on sale, there are plethora of games that are.

1218
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:42,000
On top of that, the sale does have a gimmick of sorts. You can gain XP by performing certain tasks or spending money.

1219
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And once you cross certain thresholds, you can unlock free games.

1220
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I actually had no idea that was going on, so I do need to check that out.

1221
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Now that I got that news out of the way, I'd like to pose an open-ended question.

1222
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:00,000
As we all know, PC gaming has multiple online storefronts, with Steam and GOG being the two most popular of the bunch.

1223
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Of course, there's a certain amount of overlap game-wise that these stores carry, plus sometimes there can be differences too.

1224
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:14,000
For example, you could buy GameX on Steam, and when you play it, the game drops cards that you can either sell for a profit or use to craft badges.

1225
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:22,000
If you bought GameX on GOG, it may not come with cards, but you'd get digital extras like wallpapers, OSTs, ebooks, etc.

1226
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Steam also tends to have the better sales more often.

1227
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:34,000
With all that being said, do you guys find it difficult to choose what service or storefront to buy the games from, or do you just say fuck it and buy on both?

1228
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,000
No, I would not buy on both, that's for sure.

1229
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Although, certainly in one of those bundles, I've probably bought something on PC that I also had on console, but that's also a little bit different.

1230
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I don't think I've ever bought the same game from two different stores. I don't think I can say I do that.

1231
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:01,000
And I think honestly, Rage Nader, a lot of what you just basically said is what weighs into my thinking.

1232
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Well, what are the perks here, versus what are the perks here?

1233
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I don't really view the trading cards as much of a perk. It's pennies at most, and it's not really a big thing.

1234
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:24,000
But at the same time, I also don't really use a lot of those books and things that they do on good old games, because there's this thing called the internet where a lot of the same information comes from.

1235
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:30,000
However, I can appreciate what they're trying to do from a collector standpoint, especially for the classic stuff.

1236
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:40,000
So I'm not trying to shade that stuff, I'm just trying to say, realistically, especially for the newer games, a PDF file is not really going to make or break where I'm going to buy this game from.

1237
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:47,000
So it does usually come down to the sales, which yes, Steam tends to have the better ones.

1238
01:44:47,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I tend to stick with good old games for classic games, and I'm actually kind of bummed that they're moving more into the newer stuff, because there's still so many classic games, I would like to see them get on their service.

1239
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I'm sure they're trying, but there's things like the original Civilization where it's like, please get this game on your service.

1240
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And I understand, I'm sure they've asked, and there's reasons why it's not there, but I still feel like there's more to develop in that back catalogue.

1241
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,000
And maybe this is just what they have to do to stay profitable and so forth, so I get it, I get it.

1242
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Loki, is there anything you want to add to this? Any insight you have on where you choose to buy your games online?

1243
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Well, it tends to be worth it, especially on PC, since most of the stuff I purchase I don't end up playing anyways.

1244
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
It just ends up in the back catalogue that's ever growing.

1245
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So typically it's just bundles a lot of the times. If I'm actually going to go out and purchase something, it's usually on Steam, but it's whoever offers it cheapest at that point.

1246
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Yeah. Dungeon Buster points out in chat over at live.vog network.com, says GOG still does classic games, but there's the whole sorting out the rights of who has what now thing.

1247
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Yeah, that can get complicated sometimes.

1248
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:11,000
And AkumaJP is trying to invoke Mass Effect again, but hold on, because Mass Effect 3 was only available on Origin, so it kind of made that decision easy.

1249
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And I think I did get 1 and 2 on Origin as well, but only because all of them, I bought all of them when they were on a deep discounted sale.

1250
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Like it was long after I'd already played the trilogy on Xbox 360, and I bought, no, Mass Effect 3 actually I did buy on PC, not on a deep discount, because I wanted to play online on PC.

1251
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I really loved multiplayer on Mass Effect 3, don't forget, that was a big thing I was super into for a while.

1252
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:47,000
So, yeah, and I really hope that's something in Andromeda as well. We'll find out tomorrow! I hope. We better.

1253
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Anyway, lastly, Raginator concludes the email with, this email was not brought to you by Loki, because if Loki had anything to do with this email, it wouldn't have been finished and sent.

1254
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:07,000
That was unnecessarily mean. That was unnecessarily mean, but I laughed.

1255
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Alright, there it is, your emails. Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1256
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I'm just looking at chat over at Live.Vognor.com. This isn't relevant to what we're talking about right now, but it is kind of relevant to gaming.

1257
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:33,000
ActDeft says, did an emote, ActDeft needs to not pay attention to R slash Pokemon Go. Jesus Christ, the salt going on right now.

1258
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Yeah, and you know what, that's not the only Reddit that gets a lot of salt. I don't know if they finally cleaned it up, but I know No Man's Sky was really bad for a while.

1259
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I would say for Pokemon Go, what the hell is the name of it? It has another name, it's the Silph Road, that's the name of it.

1260
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
That's where there's a lot of people that play Pokemon Go, but it doesn't have quite as much salt.

1261
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:05,000
And that's sometimes what happens on Reddit, is that the communities will form something with a more niche title that you have to search for a little bit to kind of keep the ranters out.

1262
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
To keep it more of a fans only thing because you had to search it out a little bit.

1263
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:17,000
So, anyway, just an observation from your comments there in chat. Let's get back into some other news. Loki.

1264
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Alright, so there's a hedgehog movie guest coming out, which I was unaware of that, but apparently now they've got some people attached to it.

1265
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Tim Miller, who was working on Deadpool, is now working on developing an adaptation of Sonic the Hedgehog for Sony Pictures.

1266
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:50,000
So he's bringing one of his collaborators, Jeff Fowler, to work on the project as well.

1267
01:48:50,000 --> 01:49:02,000
And it would be his directorial debut. It's supposed to be a CGI animated slash live action hybrid family oriented movie. Oh god.

1268
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Yay, family oriented. I just think it's funny that, you know, Deadpool is going to have this in common with Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's not like I suddenly expect Sonic the Hedgehog to start coming out saying fuck.

1269
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:23,000
That would be fucking amazing. Like, it's just all family for a little while, then something happens like, fuck.

1270
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
And it's like, it just goes downhill from there. That would be awesome.

1271
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Tigerclaw in chat pointing out Tim Miller's background is with animation since he worked at Blur Studios.

1272
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Right.

1273
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:42,000
SSJ100Matt saying, just don't have Sonic's friends in the movie. For god's sake, don't put his friends in it.

1274
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I would be fine with his friends being in there if it was like a joke. Like, you know, like all of his friends.

1275
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Or they all get brutally murdered.

1276
01:49:50,000 --> 01:50:00,000
But I imagine some like Tails, Knuckles, Doctor Robotnik, some of them are going to have to be there, but the other ones, murder.

1277
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:12,000
This kind of sounds like it's like one of those, oh, they've entered our dimension and now Doctor Robotnik's going to try to take over Earth and it's lame and cliche and tropey.

1278
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Tigerclaw says, I bet the live action Sonic is based on the Sonic Adventure games. It's the only ones that had Sonic on Earth.

1279
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, oh god, so like the Smurfs movie?

1280
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And Bob Coffee suggests, that's when Sonic says fuck as soon as his friends appear.

1281
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Aw, fuck you guys.

1282
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Alright, we'll give this movie the benefit of the doubt.

1283
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,000
You know who should write the Sonic the Hedgehog movie? You know who should write that movie, Loki?

1284
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Whoever's running their Twitter account should be writing the movie. That would be an awesome movie and you know it.

1285
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Anyway, so there was a, I guess there was an arcade convention thingy going on this weekend, right?

1286
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:11,000
We're getting some information about some new products that are going to be unveiled at IAAPA, which I think is something like International Amusement.

1287
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:22,000
So we get some new games that are being unveiled and Sega Amusements actually unveiled a lot of their lineup that can be expected that they're going to be showing off at this expo.

1288
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So they have a game coming out called Target Bravo Operation Ghost.

1289
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:37,000
So this is a game where it looks like it's kind of an update of a game that they did back in 2011, which was Operation Ghost and this is a new sequel to it.

1290
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:45,000
So it looks like you've got an actual scene from Operation Ghost in this giant blue camo cabinet there, so that looks pretty cool.

1291
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya, it says International Arcade Amusement and Pinball Association. Thank you, that sounds a lot better than what I said.

1292
01:51:52,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Also, Let's Go Island Dream Edition, another classic game coming back from Let's Go Jungle.

1293
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,000
This is a casual light gun game where you're in a tropical setting blasting bugs away, so that's been updated.

1294
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
So yeah, there's lots of cool stuff as well.

1295
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:26,000
And, apparently, it doesn't stop there, because at the, I guess this is the AAMA Gala, it was announced that Daytona is coming back.

1296
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:33,000
That's right, Daytona 3 Championship USA is coming back.

1297
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And I always would love an excuse to play this song here on Orange Lounge Radio, although it's tragic Dark Soccer is not here to celebrate.

1298
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:57,000
That's right, Daytona is back, motherfuckers, Daytona 3 Championship USA.

1299
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:04,000
That's it, I don't think we know much more about it right now, if it's a remake or remaster or what.

1300
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:14,000
It's gonna have new tracks, and it's also gonna be the old tracks that are remastered as well, but it's gonna have the same arcade physics feel of the original Daytona games.

1301
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:22,000
And if this song isn't in it, throw it in the garbage. Throw it in the garbage if that song isn't in it.

1302
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
It's gotta be in it.

1303
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Am I right? It's gotta be in it.

1304
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Hopefully a remix.

1305
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Ooh, that'll be even better.

1306
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Maybe they could get a celebrity singer, maybe they could get Ariana Grande to sing it or something, complete with the...

1307
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

1308
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
David Hasselhoff.

1309
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Oh, that'll be even better.

1310
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I'm excited about that.

1311
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Yeah, it seems like, I mean, that's the type of thing that'll probably end up at a Dave & Buster's or a Round 1, so I'm really excited to check that out.

1312
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Heck yeah.

1313
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Loki, what's next?

1314
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Alright, so as we kind of alluded to earlier, Pokémon GO is getting some new daily bonuses to get you to check out the game each day.

1315
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
So after the Halloween event, they actually launched this.

1316
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Each day, resetting at 12 midnight local time, you'll get some new bonuses.

1317
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:23,000
So that'll be different things like activating a Pokésop or catching a Pokémon or something like that.

1318
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:32,000
You'll get extra rewards for doing those activities seven days in a row, and it'll give you extra experience and extra stardust.

1319
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
And maybe the stops will give you more items.

1320
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
That's cool.

1321
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Because I sure as hell don't open this game up anymore for, I don't know, I just don't want to play it anymore.

1322
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Is this just not something, I mean, is this something that might bring you back, or is this just not a game you're playing again?

1323
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I've been playing Ingress, so it feels like it would take away from that, but it's just, I don't know.

1324
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

1325
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:05,000
The interesting thing is, apparently the client is supposed to be getting an update, but I didn't get the client update,

1326
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:11,000
yet I got a bonus for catching Pokémon just right outside today, which I'm sure you already know.

1327
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:17,000
They decreased the Pidgey and Rattata spawn, and so now different stuff spawns everywhere.

1328
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:24,000
So like here at the house, I'm always catching Nidorans, and I've caught like three Pikachus, just randomly opening the app here.

1329
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,000
So somehow our house in this neighborhood is a Pikachu nest again, so that's pretty cool.

1330
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
So that's cool if they shook up those spawns too, is that it's not just fucking Pidgey and Rattata.

1331
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I mean, they're still out there, don't get me wrong, but it's not nearly as many as it was before, so that's kind of cool.

1332
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Alright, but it's not like you're going to suddenly see Porygons everywhere.

1333
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:51,000
It's just like the Sandshrews, the Nidorans, the Cubones, the stuff that was like common, but not too common.

1334
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
You know, it's just showing up everywhere.

1335
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Anyhow, I am really, really, really, really excited about this announcement,

1336
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,000
and that is that Inti Creates has revealed that they are now holding the rights to Blaster Master,

1337
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
and they've announced Blaster Master Zero.

1338
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:17,000
That's right, the classic 8-bit series Blaster Master is coming back on the 3DS eShop in Spring 2017.

1339
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,000
This was shared during the company's Fan Festa event in Japan.

1340
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:26,000
So they got the rights to the original Blaster Master game, and they're working on this title.

1341
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:32,000
They are creating a fully 8-bit experience in a way that harkens back to the golden age of the NES,

1342
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:38,000
but uses the current generation hardware to optimize and power up the game for the players of today.

1343
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:44,000
This, of course, includes new areas and bosses, and new gameplay elements such as extra sub-weapons,

1344
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
improved gameplay when battling outside your Sophia III tank, a more robust scenario,

1345
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
refined and expanded exploration mechanics, and more.

1346
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And there's actually some screenshots out there, so this definitely isn't like a remake of the first game,

1347
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:02,000
but it certainly looks like it, yeah.

1348
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Well, there's parts that are definitely inspired by it, for sure.

1349
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,000
But then you look at some of these pictures, like there's some parts of it where the pictures,

1350
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
like especially in the outdoor scenes, they don't look the same at all.

1351
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
So they've definitely changed some things with this.

1352
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Now, I don't know if you guys remember, but there was a Blaster Master game on the Wii,

1353
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:28,000
in the Wii Shop 2006, maybe, was when that was out.

1354
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,000
The problem was it was a little bit clunkier, it didn't control quite right,

1355
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
so it just didn't have that same feel of the original game.

1356
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:43,000
But, you know, there have been attempts to do this before, and it didn't work so well.

1357
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Although, I don't know, that Wii one, it wasn't bad, it just didn't capture the magic in the same way.

1358
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,000
So I do think it's pretty cool that they are kind of going back to the 8-bit roots type of thing,

1359
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
and the 3DS certainly is an interesting platform to try that on.

1360
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
You know there's a part of me that's like, why don't you put that on the Switch, though,

1361
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
so I can put that on my TV in all its 8-bit glory?

1362
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Like, would it be that hard for them to move a 3DS game over to the Switch?

1363
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I'll just put it on the Wii U eShop.

1364
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Oh yeah, or the Wii U eShop, heck yeah, I'd go for that as well.

1365
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
So that would be very cool if that would happen.

1366
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Put it on another console that's not the Nintendo.

1367
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,000
So, I don't know, we'll see, I'm waiting to see a video as well, all there is is screenshots right now.

1368
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
But, yeah, excited to check that out when it comes out next year.

1369
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:36,000
So, yay, Blaster Master, I kind of figured that series was done after the Wii version didn't really energize things as well.

1370
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:44,000
However, I do want to take this opportunity to say, NTCreates, if you happen to be out there listening to this program,

1371
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:53,000
if you are in the business of buying up old franchises from the NES that are long dead that deserve a new game,

1372
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I got four words for you.

1373
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
The motherfucking Guardian Legend.

1374
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I think that might be five words there.

1375
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Motherfucking is one word.

1376
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Ah, fine.

1377
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Alright.

1378
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Loki, before we get to the Skype line, what do you have for us?

1379
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

1380
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
So, Left 4 Dead getting an unfinished campaign that you can download.

1381
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
So, Turtle Rock Studios had released this on like a third party site,

1382
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:31,000
and it includes campaigns for two previously released, or it combines the two campaigns of dead air and blood harvest.

1383
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:37,000
And they say it's not an official release, it's what they call a gray box.

1384
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Which means some of the environments lack proper textures, and some of the code and features are missing,

1385
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
but it's playable from beginning to end.

1386
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
You know, that means modders will just finish it though.

1387
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Also adds two survival maps, which have never been released as well.

1388
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
That is also an old game, it's nice to see it getting support.

1389
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Wow, it seems to be a running theme tonight.

1390
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Everything old is new again.

1391
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Sorta.

1392
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Fresh coats of paint for everything.

1393
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Which, speaking of things that are old, is new again.

1394
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,000
How many of y'all are picking up that NES Classic Edition that's coming out next week?

1395
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Although, there's been surprisingly little information on where to pick this thing up,

1396
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
considering that it's coming out in days.

1397
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Yeah, and then also the other big bitch about it too is those cord sizes.

1398
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Yeah.

1399
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,000
That's kinda like fucking stupid.

1400
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Yeah, they may have really made a mistake with that.

1401
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Although, I'll probably just get one for my computer room.

1402
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Even though I said I wasn't gonna buy one originally.

1403
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,000
However, remember, Loki, we're in that year of we say we're gonna do something and then we do the exact opposite.

1404
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
So, that's been a trend on this show the past year.

1405
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Exactly. Like I said, I've been working on my game, but I really haven't because I've been fucking exhausted every night.

1406
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:59,000
And like, I seriously, I do open up, Unity is opened up on my computer,

1407
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,000
I stare at it for five minutes, and then my brain's like, fuck that, we're going YouTube.

1408
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:07,000
And it's just, it just can't handle programming.

1409
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Alright, well anyway, to celebrate the re-release of the Nintendo Entertainment System Mini NES,

1410
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:21,000
for three days from November 11th through the 13th, the power line is coming back.

1411
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:27,000
It's available from 6 AM to 7 PM Pacific, and the advice line will be available at,

1412
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I guess I can give the number out, area code 425-885-7529.

1413
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
So, the advice line is coming back.

1414
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
However, there's a catch, it's fully automated.

1415
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
You won't be speaking to anybody live.

1416
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:50,000
You'll get recorded tips for several games and behind the scenes stories from original Nintendo gameplay counselors.

1417
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:56,000
So, unfortunately, no, they're not bringing in temps to get overwhelmed with questions for three days.

1418
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
To try to find the answer in a binder somewhere.

1419
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
They are going to just do recorded things to try to...

1420
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Hold on, let me type that into Game Facts to see if...

1421
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
But at least it doesn't seem like it'll be 99 cents a minute.

1422
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
At least there's that.

1423
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,000
There, there, I guess, and now that we live in the age of cell phones that,

1424
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I don't know anybody that has a cell phone that charges long distance for calling a different area code this day and age.

1425
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:23,000
So, I mean, I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that are just calling that for the lulz.

1426
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
So, we'll see.

1427
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Anyway, check that out.

1428
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
By the way, also, some other events going on.

1429
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
The official Nintendo Store in New York.

1430
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
There's going to be a retro 80s-themed launch event.

1431
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
The first 250 visitors are going to be able to play classic NES games,

1432
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
participate in a costume contest,

1433
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
and show off their NES knowledge in a retro Nintendo game show.

1434
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Is Rama going to go as Luigi?

1435
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Like, tell me that's happening.

1436
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Hopefully he can swing, I don't know what his schedule's like, but hopefully he can swing that.

1437
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
So, there it goes.

1438
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
That is launching on November 11th, which is Friday, right?

1439
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
That's Veterans Day.

1440
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I guess so, yeah.

1441
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Wait, am I, no.

1442
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Am I timing there? Yeah, 11th is Friday.

1443
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
It's Veterans Day, or Veterans Day Observed is on the 11th.

1444
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
So, cool.

1445
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Alright.

1446
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.

1447
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
It's that time. Orange Lounge Radio.

1448
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
All one word on Skype if you would like to give us a call.

1449
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
And talk about anything we've talked about on the show so far tonight,

1450
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,000
or perhaps there's something we haven't discussed yet that you'd like us to bring up.

1451
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Skype line is open now.

1452
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,000
While we wait for any calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

1453
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
No, I was just taking a look at some of these.

1454
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,000
They have some pins some guy made that are mashups between Simpsons and Pokemon.

1455
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
They're fucking awesome.

1456
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Wait, they're pins?

1457
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
They're pins.

1458
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Is that like an Etsy thing, or what is this?

1459
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I don't know, but it looks cool though.

1460
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Cool stuff. It's just on Reddit.

1461
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Okay. That's pretty cool.

1462
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Again, and I'm not going to keep this open long.

1463
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
If nobody calls, then I'm going to say screw it.

1464
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I'm going back to sleep because I'm fighting this cold.

1465
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

1466
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Kaijuto says, calling that Nintendo power number back in the day was so cool.

1467
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
We are getting calls.

1468
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Oh, my threat apparently paid off because now we're getting calls.

1469
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1470
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Hola, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1471
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Hello?

1472
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:28,000
This is a caller that calls in an awful lot to the show, and the audio usually works.

1473
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I don't know what's up, buddy. If you can hear me, I can't hear you.

1474
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:38,000
So, give it the good old Echo 123, turn it off and then on again, and give us a call back.

1475
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
So, we'll try that again.

1476
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

1477
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Yeah, it sounded like a muted mic or something like that.

1478
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I don't know what was up with that.

1479
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,000
So, we'll just wait for them to call back.

1480
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Oh, somebody else is beating them to it, getting back in here.

1481
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1482
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Hey, this is Act F.

1483
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Okay, good. I know it's not our end.

1484
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Hi, Act F. How are you, buddy?

1485
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Really great, really great.

1486
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
What's in your mind tonight?

1487
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Pokemon Go.

1488
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Ah, how are you enjoying it?

1489
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Well, I've been playing daily, so I pretty much enjoy it all the time.

1490
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
It's what I play the most.

1491
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I've been playing it more now, probably, than when it first launched.

1492
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Well, I actually haven't stopped, so yeah, my experience with it hasn't decreased or...

1493
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Well, it has increased, so yeah.

1494
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Yeah.

1495
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Well, yeah, we were talking about it in chat a little bit earlier. You mentioned it.

1496
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Yeah, the subreddit for Pokemon Go, it's full of complaints right now.

1497
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Now what are they complaining about, dare I ask?

1498
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Hello?

1499
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Hello?

1500
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Oh, oh, we just, okay, here in studio, we just lost the entire internet somehow, which caused us to lose the call.

1501
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:10,000
And I got that message on the computer that said a local network cable is unplugged, which means we lost the entire internet for a moment there.

1502
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Well, I saw the lights flicker, so I wonder if it was like a...

1503
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Oh, do we maybe have a power surge for a minute?

1504
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Yeah, because I did see that light turn off and turn back on again.

1505
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Well, thank God we didn't just lose the entire recording there, because y'all know I still don't have one of those little emergency brick things.

1506
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:29,000
So, we lost that call.

1507
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I guess that's it.

1508
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Well, let me see, nope, we're getting it back. I think it's coming back.

1509
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Hello, are you there?

1510
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Hello again.

1511
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Hi, we had a power surge or something weird happened.

1512
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
So, sorry about that, buddy.

1513
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:48,000
So, where did we leave off? You were talking about Pokemon Go, and that you've been playing it pretty steady.

1514
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Oh, we were talking about the Reddit, and what is their complaint now on Reddit?

1515
02:06:52,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Well, I was talking about the client update, and it has something that many people are complaining about.

1516
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:19,000
It's the speed limit, and it has been affecting people for the last month or so, because if you go over 30 miles, I think, or 25 miles, I cannot remember right now.

1517
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:26,000
You cannot see Pokemon either on your tracker, or even those that spawn.

1518
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:34,000
With this latest update, you cannot use PokeStops if you're going over that certain mileage.

1519
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Oh, ouch. Okay, so now people can't hack the gear as fast anymore.

1520
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Well, it was that way in Ingress. You can't hack portals if you go any faster. It's 35 miles an hour, which actually, or it's about 35 miles an hour.

1521
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
That's not entirely true, but yeah.

1522
02:07:53,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Well, it is and it isn't. Here's the thing. It has to be, the game doesn't necessarily know where all the legal roads are.

1523
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:12,000
So the distance between the two portals that you hack, the game can't think it took you more than 30, that you were going more than 35 miles an hour to get between the two of them, if that makes sense.

1524
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
And it's an average speed.

1525
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Yeah, it's basically like an average speed.

1526
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:28,000
See, Pokemon Go works by basically, it pings where you are every few seconds, or not even every few seconds, every second or so, and then it calculates your speed that way, whereas Ingress, it calculates it based on your last action.

1527
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:41,000
So if you either charge a portal or you hack something, that's where it counts it, and then when you do it again, it calculates the time it took you based off the distance, and then it tries to estimate your speed.

1528
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:52,000
But I mean, I understand that people are probably irritated because they can't just drive through downtown and hack everything in sight anymore, but I don't know.

1529
02:08:52,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I mean, I can also understand why they want to put this in here for safety reasons, although it certainly sucks if you're the passenger, especially if you're on a train or a bus.

1530
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Yeah, it kind of sucks. I do kind of understand the complaints and all, but really, the subreddit is going like crazy complaints. Like, fuck.

1531
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:23,000
You cannot read that subreddit because it's like really a downer, and I don't understand how many people get upset like that.

1532
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Yeah, if you're a passenger, it sucks, but the game pretty much states that you have to walk. You have to go out there, walk, and do all that stuff.

1533
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Let's see, I'm looking. Since you don't want to read PokemonGo's Reddit, I will. I will right now. Let's see, we have,

1534
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:48,000
What the actual hell is Niantic doing with their PokeStop speed cap? I am so confused as to why they try so hard to kill their own game.

1535
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Well, I mean, could some of this be due to some of the lawsuits they were getting, too? I mean, think about that.

1536
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I mean, if somebody got in a car accident and blamed PokemonGo, which I seem to recall was in the news the week this game came out.

1537
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
You can't blame PokemonGo. You can blame yourself for violating, you know, cell phone laws.

1538
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
That's right.

1539
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Yeah, but people are stupid, so.

1540
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:15,000
That's right. Let's see, final nail in the coffin. Oh, friendly reminder to Niantic that not everyone lives in San Fran.

1541
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Yeah, they expanded the whole San Francisco thing out to, here's the hilarious thing.

1542
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Okay, so the new range thing, the new scanner thing works outside the Bay Area. It's the extended Bay Area now, right?

1543
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:40,000
So that will work in Davis. It will not work here in Sacramento, which is literally on the other side of the river.

1544
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
So we're like the cutoff point for where that thing no longer works.

1545
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It also works in some parts of Arizona, which I don't know which parts. I didn't ask my buddy in Tucson if he sees it.

1546
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
The Bay Area parts.

1547
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
And Seattle has it now, too.

1548
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Well, at least they are rolling out to other places.

1549
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Yeah, at least they're rolling out to other places.

1550
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I imagine that it's going to be like, oh, we're gonna do it first, like, in the US, maybe Japan.

1551
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:13,000
But I live in Mexico, and I don't see how or when I'm gonna get that tracker.

1552
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:19,000
This has been a frickin' slow process, and they kinda need to get on it, like, you know.

1553
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:27,000
And, you know, if you listen to Pokestop Podcast, Shane is very adamant about the fact that the original tracker was the best.

1554
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
And that's the one they need to bring back, was the whole hot and cold game.

1555
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:36,000
And so, you know, the game kinda lost something when it lost that. So, you know, and it's a fair criticism.

1556
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Yeah, it's criticism and all that, but some take it way too far.

1557
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Anyway.

1558
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Even then, because, let me continue just a bit.

1559
02:11:47,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Because with the new update, I don't know if you read it all, or read it all, the gym thing where you can get sniped from other people.

1560
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Right.

1561
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:08,000
If you take down the gym and other people just can pretty much put their Pokemon and you're screwed.

1562
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Yeah, they fixed that, right?

1563
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Yeah, they fixed that. If you take down the gym or the gym leader, only you can put another Pokemon on the gym.

1564
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So, yeah, Niantic finally did something great. They're doing some really great things right now with Pokemon Go.

1565
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Yeah.

1566
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,000
And people also need to see that, that they're actually listening to us.

1567
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:43,000
If it's anything like Ingress, the game that people are playing in Pokemon Go in a year won't look anything like the game that it was originally.

1568
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
And I remember Ingress from the early, like, beta years.

1569
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Yeah.

1570
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Well, beta game, like, and I played it recently before Pokemon Go and it's a completely whole new game.

1571
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Yeah, it's different. And there's big rumors, big, big rumors that an Ingress 2.0 is coming soon.

1572
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,000
So, we'll see. Because that would be a big deal.

1573
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:12,000
They're thinking that Ingress is going to get updated graphics, kind of like what Pokemon Go has.

1574
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
And maybe some other stuff to go with that. So, we'll see.

1575
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
That would be nice. I know lots of people that still play Ingress, so.

1576
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Yeah.

1577
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
They'll be really happy about this.

1578
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I still play as well, but, you know, I'm kind of getting to the point where I don't know if I want to say I'm burned out.

1579
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Because I still like a lot of the social stuff, but it's just, I'm just, I'm ready to play other games.

1580
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Like, it's just like, I played Warcraft fucking Pedal to the Metal for like four or five years.

1581
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:43,000
And then I just kind of burned out on it. And I think that's, I'm starting to kind of get there with Ingress.

1582
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Which I'm sure if any of our local competition is listening to the show, they will be thrilled to hear that.

1583
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,000
But, you know, I think it just happens with games. Sometimes you're sick of playing.

1584
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
But I still like the social stuff.

1585
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Yeah.

1586
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
So.

1587
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Yeah, I did get burned out on Ingress, like, really. Well, not fast, but, yeah.

1588
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:09,000
After Pokemon Go started, and I didn't, like, have any interest for Ingress after that.

1589
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
But, yeah.

1590
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:16,000
But if some of my friends are like, hey, come down to this bar and, by the way, we might frack a portal there.

1591
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I'm going to be like, alright, cool, I'll drop an eight. I'll open the game to do that for you.

1592
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
You know, it's that type of thing. I like the social stuff still.

1593
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Yeah.

1594
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Alright. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can try to sneak in one or two more calls.

1595
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Thanks for the call, okay?

1596
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

1597
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Yep. Take care.

1598
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Alright, let's see if we can sneak in this one other call here.

1599
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Hello, you're on Orange Dogs Radio. Who's this?

1600
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Hey, it's Ron.

1601
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Hey, fixed your mic. What's up, buddy?

1602
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Yeah, I had to unplug the mixer and plug it back in so it'd kind of reset itself.

1603
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Uh-huh. So you did have to, you had to turn it off and then on again.

1604
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Something along those lines.

1605
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
What's on your mind, my friend?

1606
02:14:51,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I just want you to know, I was on the other side of my little small studio apartment being a responsible adult for once in my life, folding my clothes for my laundry.

1607
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Good job.

1608
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Thank you. And I hear you say something about me having to make an appearance as Luigi somewhere in New York City, so what's going on now?

1609
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
You just called in to get more information?

1610
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Yes.

1611
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:24,000
So the Nintendo Store in New York is doing a launch event for that mini Nintendo on November 11th is the launch.

1612
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I don't know when the launch event is, but they're saying the first 250 visitors will be able to play the classic NES games and participate in a costume contest dressed as their favorite Nintendo character.

1613
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:43,000
So I don't know if that's like a midnight launch or if that's like when the store opens or something, so you're gonna have to look into that, but it's for the mini NES.

1614
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Well, you know, I am going away this weekend, but I think I could fit that in on a Friday, see if I could do it.

1615
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
There you go. You can pencil it in.

1616
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:59,000
If the timing is right, I may have to show up as Luigi from Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

1617
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I love it.

1618
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Well, I did do that version, you know, for a couple of conventions, and I did buy some more tools, so you know, gotta add to the tool belt, you know?

1619
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Uh, yeah. Where are you going this weekend?

1620
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I'm visiting a friend upstate New York.

1621
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Oh, okay. I thought it was a convention. Sorry, I didn't know.

1622
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Uh, no, no, no. I have one more convention on my list, and that's if I can get into it. If I can get in, I'll be going. If not, you'll only be seeing me at MAGFest.

1623
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Oh, you are going to MAGFest?

1624
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,000
If everything falls according to plan, I will be at MAGFest.

1625
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Yay, I'm excited.

1626
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Oh, yeah. The main reason is, I will be breaking out one of my favorite cosplays I haven't worn in a very long time, so I've been looking for a reason to wear that one again.

1627
02:16:49,000 --> 02:17:00,000
SSJ100Matt says, again, isn't Exeterfer going to be in New York City next weekend? Oh, is it that soon? It's whenever GamerX East is. He's going out there for that. So, wow, that's great.

1628
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:04,000
You know what's interesting about GamerX East? Do you know where it's being held at?

1629
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Yeah, it's like at Microsoft's office or something.

1630
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Yep, right on 42nd Street on the 5th floor, if I'm not mistaken.

1631
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Yeah, they're converting conference rooms and stuff into what this is going to be. That's why, apparently, you cannot get tickets at the door. You will have to get tickets in advance, because it's going to be kind of locked down to people who only have the tickets, basically.

1632
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Yeah, pretty much. Before I started working for the company, I was there a couple of times previously for a couple of independent gaming events, so it's pretty nice.

1633
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:42,000
And I already told Exeterfer to keep in touch with me, that way I can drag him around to some cool spots in the city.

1634
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Awesome. I know you'll take good care of him.

1635
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Alright, but one thing, though. Do I have to take him to the West Village?

1636
02:17:50,000 --> 02:18:07,000
That's up to him. I don't know if he's really super into that type of stuff. I think he has to go to where Christopher Street and Gay Street meet. If he doesn't go there, I don't know why the fuck he got on a plane.

1637
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Okay, I think we can arrange that. I'll take a picture and I'll post it to somebody's Facebook or Twitter so you can put your seal of approval on it.

1638
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Perfect, perfect. How can he go and not get that picture? He has to.

1639
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Well, you do realize if this happens, you have to do the same thing, too, mister.

1640
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I did when I was there in 2006, because I sent it to him. I took a picture there and I showed it to him. I said I took that picture for you.

1641
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Ah, so, turnabout's fair play.

1642
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Exactly, exactly. Alright, my friend. I'm going to let you go, but if you end up going to the event this week, be sure to let us know how it was.

1643
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I will be posting pictures. I'll have a battery with me. I'll try to do a livestream or something. We'll figure something out.

1644
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Sounds good, my friend. Take care.

1645
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
You, too.

1646
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Alright, bye-bye. Alright, and I think that is going to do it for the calls. Those are the two folks I saw trying to get in there. I think I am going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

1647
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Sorry if you didn't get through, but please consider sending us an email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1648
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:21,000
But for now, I've about hit my limit for how much I can talk with still being this sinus cold is still horrible and I need to rest up so I can get back to work tomorrow.

1649
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:25,000
But thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to the show. Really appreciate it.

1650
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Again, as a reminder, we will not be here live next week. There will be no new show on the feed next week.

1651
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:45,000
However, we will have a show on the feed. I'm thinking Wednesday the 16th, I think is the date, there will be a show on the feed, episode 665.

1652
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:54,000
And then we will be back live on 20 November with episode 666 of Orange Lounge Radio. So that will be our next live show.

1653
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Thank you so much for tuning in and supporting our show. If you like what you heard, please consider leaving us a review on a site like iTunes.

1654
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:06,000
A nice 5 star review goes a very, very, very long way in helping us out. So we really appreciate that.

1655
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
We don't ask for your money. We just ask you to tell a friend or five about the show.

1656
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Otherwise, time for final thoughts. And my final thought is I'm ready to edit the show and then lie down and take a nap or something.

1657
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:24,000
It's going to be more than a nap at this point. And then face the day tomorrow. Loki, your final thought tonight?

1658
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I don't know. I'm deciding where I'm going to drive tonight.

1659
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Alright, well I hope it's a good drive. And that's it. Have a good night everybody. We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Bye bye.

1660
02:20:54,000 --> 02:21:06,000
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

1661

See you next week.
