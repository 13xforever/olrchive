7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week, less than a month after PSVR hit stores, the process repeats with the release of the PS4 Pro. If you're hearing this an hour later than you expected, you might have forgotten to set your clocks back last night. No matter the hour, it's time for the news and so much more right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, November the 6th of 2016 with episode number 664 of our show.
44000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter though, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me as always as he does every week, say hello over there to Techmaster Loki!
54000	57000	Yes, this time not popping and locking.
57000	67000	We may have had to do a take two while we were live tonight, but we wanted to have everything nice and clean for those of you listening on the podcast. We had some major audio issues, but I think we've worked it out.
67000	83000	And we're just setting the audio levels appropriately so that when Nintendo comes up later on and your voice gets a little louder, the audio can compensate for that without making some of our listeners deaf because I don't think they appreciate that.
83000	85000	But how have you been otherwise, Loki? You had a good week?
85000	86000	Yeah, it was alright.
86000	101000	Well my week sucked, thanks for asking. I was sick on Thursday and Friday, and a little better Saturday, doing much better today although I'm still a little stuffy. So if I sound a little different than usual, that's what's happening as I'm getting over a nasty little sinus cold or something.
101000	112000	So yeah, that part has sucked. But I'm happy to be here with you guys with what is essentially our last live episode before episode number 666 on the 20th of November.
112000	122000	So I'll go out of order a little bit here and do housekeeping first. We're not actually, and this is a bit of a change for what we announced in previous weeks, so listen up y'all.
122000	129000	Those of you that listen to the show live, there actually is not going to be a live show next week and unfortunately there's not going to be a taped one either.
129000	142000	My schedule before I leave for Chicago just got too crazy busy with me making crazy money, except I'm not. So unfortunately we can't all align to tape a show in advance for next Sunday.
142000	152000	So what we're going to do is we're going to do a special podcast only episode number 665 which will be our last pure episode that will go up in about a week and a half.
152000	162000	It'll go up a few days before episode number 666 in a couple weeks. But don't, I don't know what you're expecting with episode 666 y'all.
162000	164000	I know we've been joking about it for a long, long time.
164000	165000	We have no plans.
165000	175000	Yeah, I think we're just kind of doing the same show we always do. Except I will say this, one of Dark Soccer's friends at work did make a new intro just for that episode.
175000	182000	So that'll be that'll be kind of fun and a little bit different. And you never know what other surprises might be in store. We'll try to pull through in the next couple weeks.
182000	188000	So we will be back in a couple weeks with that. Speaking of Dark Sakura, she will be here for that episode. I know you guys have missed her.
188000	194000	She's been on a break for a few months due to her day job. She will be joining us for the mini episode.
194000	201000	She will be joining us for episode 666 and she will be back in mid-December. Confirm that she will be back on the show in mid-December.
201000	209000	So that'll be fun. The gang will be all back together up to our usual selves. Although I think, Loki, we've done an outstanding job holding the fort down.
209000	214000	And we have yet to make Halo the classic game of the week. But who knows what will happen tonight.
214000	216000	Not without me trying.
216000	218000	Anything is possible.
218000	223000	Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news tonight. Top of the show.
223000	228000	This is why I don't do Classic of the Week. Or Classic of the Week, you'll notice.
228000	235000	As I say, Loki, you can do any game you want except that one. Because I don't want that phone call. And you don't want that phone call.
235000	236000	Oh, I don't care.
236000	238000	Like, I won't answer my phone.
238000	244000	Alright, anyway. Let's talk a little bit about some of the big news happening in gaming this week.
244000	251000	And of course, if you are listening live, a big hello and thank you. We do tape live every Sunday night at the VoiceGeeks Network.
251000	258000	vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
258000	261000	And some comments in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.
261000	267000	Bobby Black Wolf suggests Sky is just going to replay episode 1 as episode 666.
267000	271000	Oh, then we can get another night off. That sounds great. I love it.
271000	277000	Let's see. Rageinator in chat says, will Sky do another D.Va rant on OLR 666?
278000	283000	Let's see how the election goes on Tuesday. I'm kidding. Maybe.
283000	291000	Tech2030 in chat says, OLR should do an episode negative 1 where they pretend it's 200 whatever again.
291000	294000	Yeah, like our Minus World episode. I like that as well.
294000	301000	sg100matt says, or replay the episode that Travis, John, and Rama did that was labeled OLR episode 666.
301000	304000	Yeah, we were gone one week. So we had like some substitute hosts fill in.
304000	309000	And this was way back when OLR was maybe like in the 150 or 200 range.
309000	315000	And so they joked and called it episode 666 because the show is never going to make it that long.
315000	323000	15 years for the show. But oops, now we have the upside down episode 666.
323000	326000	And that's what I'm referring to that episode as.
326000	334000	That is the episode 666 from the upside down world. From the parallel universe that was communicated via Christmas lights.
334000	340000	That is that episode 666. They did a fantastic job, but it exists in a world we can't see.
340000	344000	So anyway, I promise gaming news. Let's get into it.
344000	350000	Big Expo that happened this weekend was BlizzCon, which was a convention I went to a couple years ago.
350000	354000	Had a pretty good time. That was the year they announced Overwatch was the year I went.
354000	357000	So that was a pretty big year. They had a lot of announcements. It was a pretty big seven.
357000	360000	That was when people got to play Overwatch for the first time.
360000	367000	This year people knew that there wouldn't be big announcements because there was no real new...
367000	371000	You know, Warcraft just got an expansion so they weren't going to announce one of those.
371000	375000	I don't think Blizzard had anything secret they were working on so there was no real game.
375000	380000	But I think a lot of people expected that there would be a Diablo expansion.
380000	387000	A lot of rumors about Diablo 4, but then I think I had even said on last week's OLR the week before.
387000	393000	And it'll probably be a Diablo 3 expansion. I would gather as a Diablo 3 fan, we're due for an expansion.
393000	395000	And that didn't happen either.
395000	397000	No, lower your expectations even more.
397000	400000	Apparently. Apparently.
400000	409000	So no, the big Diablo news was that they are going to be recreating the original Diablo within Diablo 3 as an event.
409000	411000	So you can do the original maps.
411000	417000	I mean, they're going so far as to actually do the original bosses as new bosses that'll be in these maps.
417000	421000	I don't know if the dude was joking or what, but he was talking about a retro filter as well.
421000	424000	And there's going to be unique rewards in this so it's going to be worth running.
424000	428000	So that's neat, but there's also a part of me that goes,
428000	437000	wow, all those resources you spent on recreating old bosses could have went to a new expansion and new bosses for that expansion.
437000	441000	So that's a little bit disappointing as a Diablo fan.
441000	446000	But it was cool that they announced that the Necromancer is going to be making its debut in Diablo 3.
446000	452000	And a lot of people played the Necromancer in earlier Diablo games and were excited to see that it was coming back.
452000	455000	But they are going to charge for that.
455000	460000	They really slipped it in there that it's going to be part of a character pack that they're going to sell.
461000	469000	I understand Blizzard's got to make money, so I don't think it's crazy that they're charging for the character, but I'm just...
469000	470000	Yes, I do.
470000	472000	Why is that?
472000	474000	Because they're making a ton of money already.
474000	476000	They're making plenty of money.
476000	478000	For example, look at Overwatch.
478000	485000	Overwatch, you have the $60 base game, and then they're charging microtransactions on top of that.
485000	487000	It's like, come on.
487000	490000	Again, it depends what that price is.
490000	493000	If it's something like $9.99, then all right, cool, whatever.
493000	496000	If it's something like $20, I'm going to start to give it a little side-eye.
496000	497000	Because that's half as much as...
497000	502000	No, actually, I think you can probably buy the original Diablo 3 for $20 right now.
502000	504000	So if it's $20, I'm going to give it a little side-eye.
504000	509000	But there's a part of me that worries they're going to sell the Necromancer in some pack that will be like,
509000	515000	you get the Necromancer and you get a banner for Heroes of the Storm and you get a pet for World of Warcraft.
515000	518000	They're going to use that to justify the $20 cost.
518000	523000	And I'm going to be like, no. No, no, no.
523000	525000	Stop putting it...
525000	527000	It's like those forced...
527000	530000	Remember when everybody was pissed off when the Wii was really hard to find?
530000	539000	But GameStop would sell a $500 Wii bundle that was the Wii and a bunch of games and a controller.
539000	541000	That's so strange that GameStop would do that.
541000	547000	In fact, I saw similar things with the NES, was it the Classic that they're doing?
547000	550000	That little micro console that's coming out?
550000	552000	They're bundling it with a book.
552000	557000	And they're bundling it with an extra controller and stuff and they're charging $120 for it.
557000	562000	And I'm like, wait a second, that's not supposed to be $120. What the fuck?
562000	569000	So, needless to say, I'm going to be a little irritated if that's what they end up doing with the Necromancer.
569000	573000	But we'll see. Again, I don't know what price that's going to be yet.
573000	582000	Alan Alkeby pointing out, with Overwatch, you can buy loot boxes at rates like $4.99, $9.99, $20, and $40.
582000	589000	Tech2030 saying, I just looked and Diablo 3 with Reaper of Souls is $30.
589000	593000	Now, all things considered, that's a really good deal for that game.
593000	598000	If you're not playing Diablo 3 or haven't tried it yet, it's not what it was when it first came out.
598000	603000	It's a really fun game and worth your time. And it's pretty good on consoles, too.
603000	611000	And they did announce, as part of BlizzCon, that Seasons, which have been a PC-exclusive thing, are going to come out on consoles.
611000	617000	I miss the details of that. I don't know if any of you chatters over at live.vogniteware.com picked up on,
617000	620000	does that mean that the consoles are going to have to be always online when they play Seasons?
620000	623000	Because how are they going to keep the integrity of Seasons?
623000	625000	Or do they just don't give a shit at this point?
625000	632000	Because you know those console versions are hacked to filth. Exploited, whatever you want to call it.
632000	639000	People are running through there with Paragon 1 billion levels that they got through Artificial XP Boost and things like that.
639000	642000	So my question is, how are they going to keep that?
642000	649000	That was the PC thing that was very controversial, was it's going to have to be always online.
649000	655000	But, hate it or whatever, the nice thing about it is that people can't really cheat in it.
655000	660000	Or if they do, it gets shut down really fast. So the leaderboards are pretty pure in that.
660000	664000	Whereas the console version, I'm not sure you could say the same thing with that.
664000	670000	So, yeah, I'd be very curious if this console Season thing is going to be online.
670000	672000	Anyway, Diablo wasn't the only thing they talked about.
672000	677000	They didn't say a lot with World of Warcraft, just because, again, their expansion just came out.
677000	683000	But if you're really into that game, they started to detail what's going to come out with patch 7.2.
683000	687000	And they're going to do a mini patch for 7.1.5 or something like that.
687000	691000	I think they realized they've been really weak in patching.
691000	697000	And they really got dragged for that in their last expansion, where that game went a year with no content patch.
697000	700000	So I think Blizzard is really making a commitment to do that better.
700000	707000	Especially when one of their biggest competitors, a game that I play a lot, Final Fantasy XIV, does kind of have their patching thing down pretty well.
707000	713000	Blizzard is now under pressure to step that up. That's why that competition is good.
713000	720000	Even though, as a fan of Final Fantasy XIV, I'll readily admit, it doesn't have nearly the number of subscribers that World of Warcraft does.
720000	725000	But, I mean, WoW's come down a bit from its heyday. Final Fantasy XIV has done pretty okay for itself.
725000	730000	So, I mean, it's not even a blip on the radar type of thing.
730000	738000	So that's cool that Blizzard is stepping up their game in that regard to patching and offering a lot of stuff for the upcoming patches.
738000	744000	Starcraft 2, admittedly, I don't play that a lot, so I kind of tuned out.
744000	748000	But I think I caught that they're going to have an additional single player campaign that they're going to sell.
748000	752000	So basically another DLC pack type of thing. That's what they're going to do for Starcraft 2.
752000	754000	But they didn't spend a lot of time on that.
754000	759000	And then they mentioned with Hearthstone, that Hearthstone is getting another expansion.
759000	763000	Which is, I think they do about two expansions a year for Hearthstone, so that's kind of par for the course.
763000	770000	They spent a lot of time on that. I'm not super into Hearthstone, but I realize a lot of people are.
770000	774000	And the fact that you can kind of pick it up with a tablet makes it very alluring for a lot of people.
774000	779000	So, you know, I think it's good they're keeping that going in that competitive scene and so forth.
779000	781000	So, cool, cool, I guess.
781000	785000	But I was very, very, very interested by what they were saying about Overwatch.
785000	789000	First off, Overwatch had the best reveal trailer out of anything.
789000	794000	Because Overwatch announced that they are going to have a new character that is not DLC.
794000	799000	That will just be in the game, as they've promised new maps and characters will be.
799000	802000	And this is the one that they've been teasing for a long time, Sombra.
802000	809000	And they announced Sombra with a really cute reveal trailer that was supposed to be an Overwatch behind the scenes thing.
809000	813000	And then suddenly, like, the audio cut out and does all this stuff and you start to think,
813000	821000	Uh-oh, LOL Blizzcon fuck-up live, haha, just like our first take earlier this evening, haha, that type of thing.
821000	828000	And it turns out, oh no, gotcha, it was Sombra hacking it and they did a little reveal thing and they did a little short.
828000	830000	And it was very, very well done.
830000	837000	And, you know, the strength of the character design in Overwatch, I mean, when you play Overwatch, it's like, you would think Disney did it.
837000	842000	I'm not saying like Disney games necessarily, I'm just saying you would think you're playing a Disney movie.
842000	848000	Even though Disney movies don't usually shoot people in the face, I can't explain it.
848000	852000	It's just like the character development in Overwatch is that strong.
852000	856000	And these characters are so good and Sombra really, really sticks out as well.
856000	862000	And I could go into the whole spiel on, and they're diverse too, which is great, but, you know, I've said it before.
863000	873000	But, then they announced, it wasn't even so much that that caught my attention, although that makes me happy, even though I'm still terrible at Overwatch, but I like the character Sombra a lot.
873000	879000	But it was the fact that they announced this Overwatch League. Did you see this? Their announcement for the Overwatch League?
879000	880000	Yeah.
880000	885000	Because you know Blizzard has really been pushing into esports, and half of Blizzcon is esports.
885000	888000	It almost feels like more than half of Blizzcon right now is esports.
889000	896000	It's the finals for WoW Arena, it's the final for Hearthstone, now they do Overwatch, it's the finals for all these big competitions.
896000	902000	And now they're talking about, they're really making this push for Overwatch, they want to make a freaking league.
902000	914000	Like, NFL style league that is based on the cities you live in, and not necessarily, you know, these other types of teams that are formed around corporate sponsorship.
914000	919000	Not that that's necessarily bad, because that's how esports has kind of maintained itself today.
919000	922000	So, Blizzard is kind of wanting to change the game a little bit, I think.
922000	935000	And I'm going to, I will readily admit, I am not well versed enough in the world of esports to really understand how this is different, and like in the weeds, how this is going to be very different from what we see today.
935000	946000	But it really feels to me like Blizzard is really, really pushing this to be that game that is going to be, you know, the sport that is on TV.
946000	955000	And yes, I realize ESPN2 has aired some matches in here and there, things like that, and they've done some stuff on what, TNT or TBS, one of those networks as well.
955000	963000	But, I mean, this is probably going to be Blizzard's big, big push to really try to maybe dominate that conversation in a way, with one of their games.
963000	973000	They're talking, what, salaries and benefits with contract signing and all this stuff? Like, again, the same thing you would expect of like a player signing up for the NFL.
973000	978000	So, this is very, very interesting how the game is going to change with that.
978000	988000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, Overwatch knocked League of Legends out of the top on Twitch for a bit after Sombra was announced.
988000	992000	I think Hearthstone also came in third after League of Legends, that BlizzCon hype.
992000	999000	Kaijuto says, if they do a league, they have to do a minor league. I would be curious how that would work as well.
999000	1001000	Sign me up for the minor, minor, minor league.
1001000	1009000	That's right, right? Can I be the water boy for the team? Because I'm not sure I can do too well at the game itself.
1009000	1014000	William Ritterface says, I wonder if they have the money for that because that's a whole other ballpark.
1015000	1023000	Yeah, I don't know how that's going to work. I'm assuming we're not talking multi-million dollar deals here, but I don't know.
1023000	1029000	Where is that money going to come from and how is that all going to work? We'll see the details.
1029000	1034000	Well, you see, we charge for an expansion for Diablo 3 to add the Necromancer.
1034000	1036000	Yes, but Diablo isn't fucking Overwatch.
1036000	1038000	It doesn't matter. It's all the same umbrella there.
1038000	1046000	Really, we charge way too much that we should be charging, but we'll use it as an excuse as we're promoting this esports thing.
1046000	1048000	Meanwhile, line in our pockets.
1048000	1056000	I don't know. I'm very interested to see more details and see what this really looks like when it starts to unfold.
1056000	1061000	I'm not going to kid myself that I'm any good to get into something like this, but can you imagine?
1061000	1069000	Loki, can you imagine? Can you imagine if 15 years ago, Konami had started the Dance Dance Revolution League?
1069000	1072000	Can you imagine what that would have looked like, Loki?
1072000	1079000	Can you imagine if we'd been making salaries and benefits off dancing to arrows on the screen?
1081000	1082000	I mean, my my, how far can you...
1082000	1086000	Considering the current state of Konami, you probably wouldn't look that great.
1091000	1093000	Sad but true, but...
1094000	1098000	You'd be dancing with a, you know, wood arrow on the corner.
1099000	1105000	Kaijuto in chat says if they don't do a minor league, they can do fantasy draft so we can play along.
1105000	1111000	They're gonna have to go more interactive than just watching shit, and maybe that's where the money comes from.
1111000	1116000	Fantasy draft, really? Just play the fucking game at that point. I mean, it's just not even worth it.
1116000	1122000	But maybe it's something where you play along with the pros? I don't know. I don't know how that works out.
1122000	1124000	But I figure like that's something there.
1124000	1128000	Stoppy in chat points out Tracer is already in my fantasies.
1131000	1136000	DungeonBuster says you're doing a dance event. Okay, where are we going? A pachinko parlor.
1137000	1142000	SSG100Matt says I remember when DDR was considered in ESPN's Summer X Games.
1143000	1146000	I remember those days well too. They're long gone.
1146000	1151000	I could have been an Olympic contender once, but then I took a DDR arrow to the knee.
1153000	1158000	I could have been a contender, but then I gained like 50, 60, 70 pounds.
1158000	1160000	I could have been a contender.
1160000	1162000	Could have been a contender, but I stopped exercising.
1162000	1164000	But then I started a podcast.
1165000	1169000	I got married, had kids, and they sucked all the life out of me.
1172000	1175000	Anyway, that was pretty much all I got out of BlizzCon.
1175000	1179000	What about you, Loki? Is there anything you caught out of BlizzCon I didn't touch on there that you wanted to mention?
1179000	1181000	I was like, oh, hey, BlizzCon's going on right now?
1181000	1183000	I didn't realize that was going on.
1183000	1187000	I heard people complaining about Diablo, and I'm like, alright, I'm done.
1188000	1192000	Well, since I was home sick, and yes, I really was sick.
1192000	1196000	I was not one of those people that was like, I'm sick and I gotta stay home and watch BlizzCon.
1196000	1201000	I like Blizzard, but I could have looked at a live blog on my phone on break or something.
1201000	1204000	You weren't staying home to watch, was it Animal Crossing? Their little...
1204000	1206000	No, no, I was really fucking sick.
1208000	1211000	But I was like, well, I might as well make the best of it.
1211000	1214000	So in between naps, I did watch the live thing.
1214000	1218000	Which, you know, I think may be the first time I've been able to do that.
1218000	1220000	Besides the year I was actually there in person.
1220000	1223000	So, I mean, that was cool that I could watch that, I guess.
1223000	1227000	But, you know, pretty much the same stuff you'd catch on a live blog or what have you anyway.
1228000	1231000	But yeah, I hope those that went to BlizzCon had fun.
1231000	1235000	You know, a large part of BlizzCon is just being with the people.
1235000	1237000	Especially for these people that are so...
1237000	1240000	And I count myself, I say these people, but I'm really one of them.
1240000	1246000	That are so invested in games like World of Warcraft, where you play with people from across a great distance.
1246000	1250000	You know, BlizzCon for many people is like the one time a year where everybody can kind of get together.
1250000	1252000	If you were able to get a ticket.
1252000	1255000	And get in and celebrate, you know, in the same place.
1255000	1257000	And people meet up with guildies and all this stuff.
1257000	1259000	So, I know that's a big part of it for a lot of people.
1259000	1264000	And, you know, the WoW community when we were doing Horde House was always very welcoming and so forth.
1264000	1269000	So, you know, nothing but hearts for the folks at BlizzCon this weekend.
1269000	1272000	And I'm sure the event was run better than the one I ranted about a few weeks ago.
1272000	1276000	But we won't go there because I still love that game too.
1276000	1278000	And I'm not going to get negative tonight. I'm just not.
1278000	1280000	I'm too sick.
1280000	1281000	That's why I'm here.
1281000	1282000	That's why you're here.
1282000	1283000	Alright.
1283000	1286000	William Murderface says he got that BlizzCon flu.
1286000	1288000	The year I went, I probably did.
1288000	1290000	But this year, no.
1290000	1293000	I didn't go to any conventions to get this flu.
1293000	1296000	I just, I went to work and that's how I got sick, I think.
1296000	1298000	Somebody at work was probably sick or something happened.
1298000	1299000	I don't know.
1299000	1300000	Anyway.
1300000	1302000	Let's talk about our gaming week.
1302000	1308000	So, how was your gaming week and what types of games did you play this week besides BlizzCon stuff?
1308000	1310000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1310000	1318000	I reluctantly played Ingress this week because I felt some sort of obligation to keep a streak of, was it, 13?
1318000	1321000	Well, 12 cycles.
1321000	1324000	And so, you know, they're trying to make it 13.
1324000	1330000	And it's just, it's very conflicting because it's at the point where it's like, it really feels like a chore.
1330000	1333000	And, yeah.
1333000	1335000	And it just, I don't know.
1335000	1340000	But I'm still doing it for some dumb reason because I sit there with like a, you know, time to waste.
1340000	1344000	And it's just like, I could be doing something else.
1344000	1349000	But no, here I'm going to try to play Ingress and I really don't know why I do it.
1349000	1353000	I think you really have to treat that game like any other MMO.
1353000	1354000	I think you really do.
1354000	1355000	And that's really what it is.
1355000	1358000	It's just an MMO, but it takes place in the real world or what have you.
1358000	1363000	I like the win, but there's like, you have to understand the odds are stacked against us.
1363000	1369000	It's our team right now because the other side has lots of people that are retired that play this all day long.
1369000	1375000	For one. And two, there's a lot more people in my area on the other team that are playing versus me.
1375000	1382000	So it's like, you know, it's very frustrating because it's like, what am I going to do?
1382000	1385000	There's really no way that this is going to come out in my favor.
1385000	1388000	Well, without getting too far into strategy discussion or things like that,
1388000	1394000	you have to remember you're also coming off this 12-week winning streak type of thing where it's like,
1394000	1400000	okay, for a while we've been kicking a lot of ass and the team still kicks a lot of ass.
1400000	1403000	But it's just that I think the other side is really sick of losing.
1403000	1405000	So they're trying some new tricks and some things like that.
1405000	1410000	So when the old tricks don't work, you have to kind of put on your thinking hat and say,
1410000	1412000	maybe I'm going to take solace in.
1412000	1414000	I'm going to be the biggest pain in the ass.
1414000	1417000	And now you're going to be the spoiler for what they're doing.
1417000	1419000	And that's where you can get your rewards out of the game.
1419000	1425000	And for the first year in the game when it was like that the entire time I was playing,
1425000	1430000	that's where you kind of get a lot of rewards from it is that, oh, well, I'm spoiling their shit.
1430000	1431000	That's funny.
1431000	1434000	So I think you just have to kind of take that approach.
1434000	1436000	It is just a game for fuck's sake.
1436000	1438000	It's like any other MMO.
1438000	1440000	It's not that serious at the end of the day.
1440000	1442000	But it's a very zen thing.
1442000	1445000	The other night I was like, I'm going to go out and just play for an hour
1445000	1451000	because I don't want to play my console games right now.
1451000	1454000	I just kind of want to go for a drive.
1454000	1457000	So I went out and played and made some fields, had fun, and that was that.
1457000	1462000	The other stuff I played, I meant to actually play something other than Ingress this week.
1462000	1465000	So I went ahead and played some more PlayStation VR.
1465000	1472000	So I fired up, I downloaded that Call of Duty demo thing that they've got.
1472000	1477000	I don't remember the hell it was called, but let's see here.
1477000	1485000	That was the Jackal Assault because it meant that much to me knowing the name.
1485000	1490000	And it's just, I don't even know why they put it together to be honest.
1490000	1497000	For people that have a PlayStation VR or played the demo disc,
1497000	1503000	it's like that demo that they've got for Eve Valkyrie, which I think is badass.
1503000	1509000	But a very budget, not so great version of that.
1509000	1512000	So it basically starts off the same thing.
1512000	1516000	You're flying this ship around and you're scanning some shit.
1516000	1520000	And then all of a sudden things warp in and you have to destroy ships.
1520000	1523000	It's like literally the same fucking demo as Eve Valkyrie.
1523000	1526000	The problem is it's so cheap looking.
1526000	1529000	Like Eve Valkyrie feels fucking amazing.
1529000	1533000	Correct me if I'm wrong though, but isn't the Jackal one free
1533000	1536000	and the Eve thing is a demo for what's going to be a $60 game?
1536000	1541000	Right, it is free, but technically both are demos for $60 games if you want to.
1541000	1546000	But in the other games that aren't even in VR, it's just...
1546000	1552000	I'm comparing demo to demo because I'm not buying the $60 Eve Valkyrie game.
1552000	1562000	Seriously, we need to fill that void of a really kick-ass single-player flight sim game would be amazing.
1562000	1565000	You want to go old school and go Wing Commander VR?
1565000	1568000	I want to go fucking Colony Wars or Wing Commander or some shit like that.
1568000	1574000	Because Eve was fantastic. I don't want to play constant MMO.
1574000	1577000	Not necessarily, just like an online multiplayer game.
1577000	1582000	That's not what I'm interested in. I want to play a solid campaign or something.
1582000	1586000	That game felt very badass.
1586000	1591000	This game on the other hand, this little Jackal assault thing, felt very fucking cheap.
1591000	1597000	In fact, one of the things I noticed on it, the explosions when you destroy something are flat sprites.
1597000	1603000	It's like, holy shit. Seriously? This is the crap that we're pulling 2016?
1603000	1607000	Flat fucking sprites on the explosions? It looks so goddamn cheap.
1607000	1610000	Zero out of ten. Explosions are completely unrealistic.
1610000	1614000	No, it wasn't that they're unrealistic. It's just so cheap. It's so terrible.
1614000	1620000	I'm not using the proper VoG network scale. F the bad explosions.
1620000	1623000	It just wasn't good. It just wasn't interesting at all.
1623000	1628000	It was just kind of like, well, cool. This isn't going to get me the buy Call of Duty.
1628000	1633000	You just see how many ships you can blow up in a certain amount of time.
1633000	1639000	It's free I guess, but the demo for Eve Valkyrie is free as well.
1639000	1642000	I got a lot more enjoyment out of that than I did this.
1642000	1647000	I don't know. It was just kind of lame. I'm kind of disappointed.
1647000	1649000	I was hoping Lisa would be on par with the other one.
1650000	1652000	I do want to point out Bobby Blackwell says,
1652000	1655000	I thought Jackal Assault was well done for what it was.
1655000	1657000	Also points out Elite Dangerous is in VR.
1657000	1660000	I don't know if that's a game that interests you, but maybe something to check out.
1660000	1668000	Yeah, but that's not on PlayStation 4. I know Elite Dangerous is on PC.
1669000	1673000	Oh yeah, because you had to get rid of the Oculus to get the PlayStation VR, huh?
1673000	1678000	I don't have a computer that can run it anyways, so it's no big deal.
1678000	1683000	The other thing I did play through is I played through Rez Infinite, which is pretty fun.
1683000	1688000	I kind of understood a little bit more of the game mechanics than I did the original time playing through.
1688000	1691000	I didn't really remember too much of the game, but it was fun.
1691000	1697000	And then the Area X thing, which is interesting, because for people that may not have played Rez,
1697000	1701000	may think, oh, that's just an extra level that they added to the game.
1701000	1706000	But no, it's actually a completely separate game that's in the style of Rez.
1706000	1714000	It's in a completely different engine. They made the whole thing in Unreal 4, and it's just fantastic looking.
1714000	1720000	It's unlike Rez, which is kind of an on-rails shooter, this is pretty much a free form.
1720000	1724000	You can go wherever you want and stuff in the game, which is kind of cool.
1724000	1733000	And then Rez is very kind of old school, like, vector-y, just very low poly stuff.
1733000	1738000	Whereas the Area X was very particle crazy.
1738000	1742000	Like, everything you blew up exploded in a cloud of particles, and it looked cool.
1742000	1747000	That game's kind of visual presence.
1747000	1751000	I thought it was really neat, especially being able to fly wherever you want in there.
1751000	1756000	And it looked fantastic. It's like, this gives me hope for another Rez game.
1756000	1758000	Make it like that, because that was fantastic.
1759000	1764000	And it looked much better compared to the actual game in VR, actually.
1764000	1769000	But they're both great. It was a fun experience in both of them, so I enjoyed it.
1769000	1773000	But yeah, it was quick. I finished that really fast, and I guess I still have the bonus levels to play through.
1773000	1777000	But I don't know. I enjoyed it in VR. I thought it was a fun experience.
1779000	1783000	And I guess I found out that I don't get motion sick from any of this stuff.
1783000	1786000	Because on all these games where they're like, okay, you can have a few settings.
1786000	1791000	This is for VR experts, you know. It's a lot of movement. This is this.
1791000	1796000	I'm like, always crank it up. The more movement, the better. I don't really care.
1796000	1803000	So, I don't know. But yeah, definitely if you haven't gotten a chance to, check out Area X in Rez Infinite.
1803000	1808000	Because it's fantastic. It's basically a sequel to Rez, almost. But sadly, only one level of it.
1809000	1810000	Alright.
1810000	1811000	That's it.
1811000	1814000	That's it. My Gaming Week. I don't really have...
1814000	1815000	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
1815000	1816000	Oh, excuse me.
1816000	1820000	One more thing. Because I wanted, you know, this was a recommendation. I tried PolitiCats.
1820000	1821000	Oh, you did?
1821000	1825000	I did try PolitiCats. I played it for a little bit, and I uninstalled it because I hated that game.
1825000	1832000	I'm sorry. You know, I like clicker games. I do. But for some reason, that one just did not hook me.
1832000	1834000	It would just, it didn't hook me.
1834000	1841000	I have failed in checking it out, I regret to say. So, I can't really argue with you one way or the other on this.
1841000	1844000	Or support you. But why was it so bad?
1844000	1849000	I don't know. It's just the presentation of it. I just didn't like it. I don't know what it is.
1849000	1853000	Cats are not cute enough. Kitten explosions were bad. F.
1853000	1859000	No, the cats are fine. The art style is cute and everything, but it just didn't seem interesting to me at all.
1859000	1864000	It just, I don't know. It didn't hook me like Katamari or something.
1864000	1871000	Maybe it's because it's a completely random, random franchise or something.
1871000	1875000	SSG100Matt suggests, it didn't hook him in because he couldn't cheat in it.
1875000	1879000	Now, that's not true, but yes.
1879000	1881000	Alright.
1881000	1886000	It wasn't because I couldn't cheat in it, it was because it just wasn't interesting.
1886000	1892000	Alright, my gaming week. Sadly, not a lot of new stuff to really report. I've been continuing in Final Fantasy XIV.
1892000	1897000	I was also playing Dragon Quest Builders, and I finally got to the end of chapter one.
1898000	1902000	Which I know doesn't sound like very far, like, oh, good job, you got to the end of chapter one.
1902000	1907000	But I swear, it took, like, I've been playing at least ten hours. At least.
1907000	1912000	And, I mean, like, yeah, I feel like it took me a while to get there to the end of chapter one.
1912000	1919000	So, maybe I'm just slow with the way I've been progressing things, and doing kind of like that OCD collecting and side quest thing.
1919000	1927000	But, yeah, so I finally got to the final boss, who's a bit of a pain in the ass, and I realized that I need better stuff.
1927000	1934000	So, I think what happens, based on some other stuff I picked up around Twitter, is that I think there's only, like, three chapters in the game.
1934000	1938000	So, even though I'm like, ooh, chapter one, I think that actually is a lot further than you'd think.
1938000	1943000	And I get the sense that you have to, I mean, minor spoiler, but I don't think so.
1943000	1949000	You have to start over when you do chapters two and three, basically, but you're in a new part of the world with new stuff.
1949000	1952000	So, it's kind of like starting over.
1952000	1962000	So, yeah, but anyway, for fighting the boss at the end of chapter one, I realized I didn't have enough of the end game stuff that I needed to really effectively fight the guys.
1962000	1971000	So, I was like, alright, I've got to spend more time killing the rocks that explode, which is their version of creepers, to get, you know, to craft the bombs I need to take down the boss.
1971000	1974000	But anyway, so that's something I was working on.
1974000	1981000	And then, I've also been playing Civilization VI, which came out a couple weeks ago.
1981000	1985000	And I'm finding that that game is hard.
1985000	1996000	It's harder than any of the previous civilizations, based on the fact that I don't, like, when I play on the easiest difficulty, which is where I will always start my civilization experience, the easiest difficulty.
1996000	2000000	And then, when I feel comfortable, I'll kick it up another level and again and again.
2000000	2006000	But, like, this time, even on the easiest difficulty, I'm having trouble just trouncing the competition.
2006000	2010000	And so, I think the type of old strategies I've been using are wrong now.
2010000	2018000	And I understand that they want to do that to mix up things a little bit and that not the same old trick, like we just mentioned, sometimes you have to use new tricks.
2018000	2022000	So, I understand that I have to do that.
2022000	2026000	But, yeah, I just kind of wasn't ready for how different that was all going to be.
2026000	2038000	So, yeah, again, it blows my mind that some people say Civ VI is, like, the same thing as Civ V, because unless you're looking at it on a purely visual, aesthetic level, I don't know how the fuck you can say that.
2038000	2043000	I really don't. Like, the game plays very, very differently than Civ V to me.
2043000	2048000	So, yeah. So, I'm still kind of learning and moving along in that game.
2048000	2053000	And I'll let you guys know if I'm able to actually get in a position where I can win a damn game. I'll let you know.
2053000	2058000	So, yeah, there was that. And I'll mention this quickly.
2058000	2063000	Last night, I was hanging out with my pals, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick.
2063000	2068000	And you might know them because they do a show here at VOG Network called gamebuoy.org.
2069000	2076000	But we were all playing a game called TKO, which is part of the Jackbox Party Pack, right?
2076000	2080000	So, Jackbox Party Pack 3 came out. And I think we talked about a couple of those games last week, right?
2080000	2081000	Yes, we did.
2081000	2088000	We played Murder Party. Well, this time, Captain Spike was doing, like, a late Halloween get-together type of thing.
2088000	2097000	So, there were several people there. And so, it was like, okay, you know, Jackbox Party Pack being with a bunch of gamer nerds, it made for a great, like, easy thing to just put on the TV.
2097000	2101000	That's what everybody can just kind of do. So, we were playing Trivia Murder Party, okay?
2101000	2114000	But then we played TKO, which, you know, when I had heard it described to me, you know, it was mentioned that, oh, you know, some people draw things and you come up with slogans and then you kind of put them together in their shirts and you vote on the best shirts.
2114000	2120000	And I was like, that doesn't sound funny. Like, that doesn't sound as strong as the other stuff.
2120000	2125000	But I was totally wrong. Like, that game is fucking hilarious.
2125000	2135000	And I laughed. I don't think I've laughed that hard in my life since the episode of South Park where Mr. Garrison gets a sex change.
2135000	2142000	I have not laughed that hard in my life that I did last night when we were playing TKO.
2142000	2147000	And, granted, this was with sick, disturbing people, so I'm not going to repeat for you the things that came up in the game.
2147000	2148000	Oh, come on.
2148000	2156000	I don't need, I'll tell you off air, because I don't need Tumblr against me. But, I mean, this was just, it was hilarious.
2156000	2166000	So, yeah, what happens is you draw pictures, and you can draw anything you want. You just draw pictures so you know somebody's going to draw a dick. You know somebody's going to draw a dick.
2166000	2171000	Okay, I'll tell you one shirt that happened that is, in my opinion, is not that controversial.
2171000	2180000	Take me through, like, how do you play this? Because, like, does everybody draw, like, a picture, then everybody comes up with a slogan and you mix and match them to come up with, like, the best shirt?
2180000	2190000	Kind of, yes. Okay, so, first round comes up. You draw three pictures. Okay, so you use your shitty little paint program on your phone to draw the pictures with your finger.
2190000	2197000	Although, Alan was like, you know, oh, I left my stylist at home. I was like, oh, you would. You would have been trying to use your stylist to play this shit.
2197000	2205000	But, anyway, so you draw pictures. So, somebody always draws a dick, you know, depending on the group you're playing with, or even worse, with the group I was with.
2205000	2216000	And then, the next round is just submit as many slogans as you can. And you don't have pictures, it's just submit slogans in, like, 60 seconds.
2216000	2225000	So, some people will get four in, some people get ten in. Then what happens is everybody on their phone gets one picture, or no, three pictures and four slogans.
2225000	2235000	And you have to mix and match between the pictures and the slogans which one makes the best shirt. And then the shirts go head to head in a strongest M&M style competition.
2235000	2240000	Where, basically, it's like the first one fights the second one and then, you know, you push them together. Whichever one cracks first, you eat.
2240000	2248000	And then the surviving M&M goes on to the next M&M, right? The M&M gauntlet. It's that type of voting. And then, yeah, that's how it works.
2248000	2260000	And then the shirt, there's a gauntlet winner and then a streak winner. And then the whole process repeats again, but you only draw one drawing to replace the one that got picked, like you do less slogans.
2260000	2268000	And then, in the very last round, all the winning shirts go through one more battle and then you come up with a supreme champion that way.
2268000	2278000	So, like, one of the shirts that almost won was somebody just drew a bunch of dicks. It was just like a little dick and a big dick and different colored dicks.
2278000	2290000	It was like all these dicks in the picture, right? Because my friends are mature. And it got matched up with the slogan, which if you've ever seen RuPaul's Drag Race, Tatiana was very famous for saying, Choices.
2291000	2300000	So, you had this shirt with all these different dicks on it that says, Choices. And that shirt almost won. It was like the second place thing.
2300000	2313000	But then what was brilliant that they did, and I would be dying to know how much money they're making off of it. If Jackbox people still listen to this show, somebody send me a tweet on the down low, so I don't want to know how much money you're making off this.
2313000	2329000	At the very end, there's a button that says, Click here to purchase the shirts in the game. So, if I wanted to go to the next Rocky Horror Show and wear a shirt with a bunch of dicks on it, crudely drawn, that says, Choices on the bottom, I could do it through TKO.
2329000	2331000	So, I thought that was pretty funny.
2331000	2332000	That's pretty awesome.
2332000	2338000	Yeah, it was pretty awesome. So, that was one of those games that, in execution, it actually worked a lot better than I thought it would in theory.
2339000	2348000	And then real quickly, we also played the Fake In It game. I didn't like it as much. It's too hard to be the faker. It is too hard to be the faker.
2348000	2360000	Like, in theory, it's a cute concept and stuff, and I know bluffing games are really fun, but it was way too easy to figure out who the faker was every time, even when it was me.
2360000	2368000	I tried really hard to lie, but one of my friends was like, Your lip quivered slightly before you pointed, and I know you're the fucking liar.
2368000	2373000	And I was like, How the fuck? Are you a fucking cop? What is that? I'm like, I know you're not a cop.
2373000	2375000	You're a cop?
2375000	2377000	I know, right? Are we all cops?
2377000	2379000	Some sort of cop or something?
2380000	2395000	Anyway, it's okay that there's one game in a pack that makes you go, because we played a little Quiplash 2, which was good as well, so there's a lot of strong games in that pack.
2395000	2401000	And I think even the last pack had a game that made you go, They all kind of have one game that's okay.
2401000	2407000	But there's probably somebody out there who loves that game the most, so whatever, more props to them.
2407000	2415000	Going to chat, SSJ100Matt says, This sounds hilarious. Rob needs to stream this next time this happens.
2415000	2426000	No, because again, I don't need Tumblr. Here's the thing, I'll give you the watered down politically correct version if we're going to stream it.
2426000	2436000	But some bad things happen in these games, so I'm just, it's not as bad as I'm making it sound, but I'm just like, I might want to run for elected office some year, let's put it that way.
2437000	2446000	I would still do it. I would stand up on stage, you know, doing the debates, wearing my Dicks and Choices shirt.
2448000	2454000	Alright, let's see. Vidpower in chat says, Gamers draw penises? Shocking.
2454000	2461000	Stoppy says, I'm guessing there was a lot of make blank great again shirts. No, I don't remember seeing a lot of that as a slogan.
2461000	2470000	I did submit the slogan, I'm Captain Spike and I approve this message, thinking that somebody would again like draw a butthole or something that that would get paired up with.
2470000	2477000	But no, the slogan never got used. Unfortunately, not all the slogans get used, so it didn't work out. But anyway.
2477000	2483000	Alright, Dark Tetsuya in chat says, Doesn't Travis already have dirt on you though Rob?
2483000	2492000	He's still desperately trying to find the public access show, but it's, I'm pretty sure those tapes have disintegrated by now. That shows like over 20 years old at this point.
2492000	2502000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on. We pretty much already talked about our housekeeping, so again, no show next Sunday.
2502000	2509000	So for those listening on the podcast feed, you're going to have to wait a little extra longer for a show, but the good news is, it's kind of like interest.
2509000	2512000	You don't get a show next week, but you'll get two shows the next week.
2512000	2516000	And you can use that time to play all the games that are coming out because there's so many games.
2516000	2524000	Oh, this is that week. This is that week before Black Friday, well not right before, but there's always a huge week in November where like everything comes out.
2524000	2529000	So, I'm going to go on a random tangent, well it's not a random tangent I guess, it sort of has to do with my game week.
2529000	2539000	So, I seem to be completely making 180 decisions, everything that I've come to like decide originally, and I'm just like hmm, I'm going to do the exact opposite.
2539000	2540000	Oh, totally the same.
2540000	2543000	So, I'm thinking now I'm probably going to get a PlayStation Pro.
2543000	2547000	Me too, me too. I am getting the PlayStation 4 Pro.
2547000	2557000	And if you ask me why, I can't even really give you a good reason besides like, oh no, I want to play Final Fantasy 15 the best way possible.
2557000	2566000	Well, just like looking at like some of the enhancements that they're doing for like VR and stuff, I think that might be kind of useful as well because the games look better on that.
2567000	2582000	I don't know if I'm going to get one right away, but I think that would be the best time to trade in a system and stuff because like even like if I went to Evil G or whatever, you get 150 bucks and then you've, you know, pretty much 250 at that point.
2582000	2590000	So, it's not that big a deal. I don't have to say though. It may wait because it's not, you know, a whole big deal, but eventually it might be nice to get one.
2591000	2601000	Because right now I have a 1080p TV, so it's not, you know, it's not going to notice a huge difference. Once I get a 4K TV, then fuck yeah, but right now it's not going to happen.
2601000	2609000	Nope, I have my PS4 Pro in pre-order and I'm probably going to go ahead and let it go through and get the system and I probably will sell my PlayStation 4.
2610000	2620000	I'll probably sell it like, not like on eBay, but like kind of go to Facebook first and be like, who wants a PlayStation 4 and, you know, kind of do it that way and then, you know, kind of go from there.
2620000	2627000	Because I'm kind of like, okay, well, if I can sell it like really cheap and one of my friends gets it like, and I still get some money recovered, like it's kind of a win, right?
2627000	2637000	So, I'm really probably going to do that and then get the PlayStation 4 Pro, but I didn't end up getting the PlayStation VR and I was convinced I was going to.
2637000	2643000	But even still, I'm kind of like, eh, I think I'll hold off a little bit. I want to wait and see what 2017 makes for right now.
2643000	2649000	I'm not sure there's enough like single player, I just want to sit and play by myself type of stuff right now on VR.
2649000	2654000	And a lot of it's really short, like Robinson The Journey looks all right, but even that's kind of like, okay, I don't know.
2654000	2665000	I just want to see what develops. I really enjoy it when Shane brings his over or at least the time he did, I enjoyed it, you know, but, and hopefully he'll bring it by again sometime, but I'm not in a rush, I'm not in a rush to pick up my own system.
2666000	2674000	Yes, and I am thinking about that as well is that, you know, 15 is coming out soon and I know I'm going to play that a lot. So, yeah, there's that.
2674000	2679000	So, all right, well, let's get into the gaming news that we do have for the week. Loki, starting us off.
2679000	2685000	So, there was the rumor that Nintendo had stopped production on the Wii U, but apparently that is incorrect.
2686000	2698000	And they're saying that apparently IT Media contacted Nintendo and a spokesperson said there has been no change in continuing Wii U productions.
2698000	2705000	So, apparently it is still being produced. At least that's what we're led to believe.
2705000	2713000	Honestly, with there not being any new games coming out for it, I don't think it's going to be much longer that it's going to be produced.
2714000	2722000	Yeah, I mean, I think one reason a lot of people were running with the story when it was reported is, well, it sounds plausible. Your favorite, everybody.
2722000	2729000	No, not the, I mean, it makes sense because, you know, there's still the Wii U version of the Zelda game coming out later on in March.
2729000	2739000	So, obviously you're going to sell some systems maybe for that, assuming hopefully they'll be smart enough to drop the price of the system if they're releasing, you know, the Switch and everything.
2739000	2740000	But how many-
2740000	2742000	We still don't know how much the Switch is going to be.
2742000	2744000	How many more Wii U's are they really going to sell?
2744000	2745000	Not a lot.
2745000	2752000	Yeah, and so there is going to come a point where they have to say, okay, we're going to sell through what we have left on shelves and that's that.
2752000	2762000	And Nintendo probably does want that to be at a point where people instead go over to the Switch. I mean, they don't necessarily want both systems existing on the Switch.
2762000	2763000	They want them to Switch over.
2764000	2779000	But, I mean, if we do see that a lot of Wii U games are being redone for the Switch, like we saw Mario Kart 8 and we saw Splatoon in that trailer, I fully realize we don't know exactly what that looks like yet, but hear me out.
2779000	2789000	If the Switch is doing redone, reimagined versions of those games or whatever, then I can see where maybe they're a little more eager to kind of push the Wii U out the window.
2789000	2801000	Which I know seems weird, like why would a company want to push their system out that fast? But, you know, I think to really make the Switch come out with a bang, I could see why they'd want to do that.
2801000	2810000	But, you know, I fully realize Nintendo denied the story. I understand why they kind of need to deny the story going into the holidays.
2810000	2814000	I mean, they would still like to sell Wii U's this holiday, don't get me wrong.
2814000	2825000	I think we fully realize that Nintendo is instead looking to Pokemon Sun and Moon on the 3DS, the Nintendo Mini, and these other ways that they're going to make money during the holidays.
2825000	2833000	But, I don't think Nintendo wants to suddenly say like, oh no, don't buy a Wii, you're not going to be able to find a Wii U this holiday. Nintendo does not want to say that.
2833000	2835000	It wouldn't make any sense, yeah.
2835000	2847000	But, I mean, can we, I mean, Loki, I don't know, I didn't look at the direct quotes. Can we read between the lines that maybe Nintendo could scale back productions?
2847000	2852000	They're not stopping, but maybe one factory is type of thing.
2853000	2863000	Yeah, I mean, I'm sure they've got the plan to ramp it down. I don't think that they're producing a ton of them. There's not like it's going to be a shortage on the Wii U.
2863000	2867000	I just don't think there's anything out there that's really driving that purchase right now.
2867000	2876000	Granted, in March, you know, you will have the Zelda game, and that's a big factor is what those two systems are in price because of the Switches.
2876000	2888000	If people are looking to buy the Switch for Zelda, and they have a Wii U already, and the price of the Switch is higher than we want, they may hold off on the Switch.
2888000	2889000	True.
2889000	2895000	I mean, especially if all they're offering is like, hey, there's these games that you've already had that have some extra shit in them.
2895000	2901000	I mean, I don't know, I just, we need to get more information on what's going to be launched with it.
2901000	2910000	Because if it's just old Wii U games, that's great if you're getting into it, but if you already have a Wii U, it's kind of like, why am I purchasing these?
2910000	2916000	But now we know, right after the holidays are over, what is it, January 12th, Nintendo's coming out swinging with the Switch stuff.
2916000	2919000	So these answers we're going to have right at the beginning of the year.
2919000	2922000	Although they have a new Excite truck, I am going to have to purchase that day.
2922000	2924000	Oh, even Loki.
2924000	2930000	That is my, but you know what though, they're not. You know why? Because that would be too good.
2930000	2936000	And because if they're making an Excite truck, it makes no goddamn sense because why wouldn't they make an F-Zero?
2936000	2940000	Yeah. But what about a new F-Zero? A new F-Zero would do it for you too, right, Loki?
2940000	2942000	Nah, I don't really like F-Zero that much.
2942000	2944000	What? Get out. Out my house.
2944000	2949000	Well, I'm sure the Switch is going to be luring a lot of people over.
2949000	2954000	You know, we've had several AAA companies saying that, you know, they're planning on supporting the Switch.
2955000	2962000	And there are indie developers as well talking about supporting the Switch and that some already have games in development.
2962000	2969000	Nintendo Life did an interview with several different indie developers to get their thoughts and if they plan to support the Switch.
2969000	2971000	Are they going to support the Nintendo Switch in the future?
2971000	2974000	Yacht Club Games, a rep from them, said of course.
2974000	2980000	Engine Software said we're already working on the platform and we hope to support it for a long time.
2980000	2984000	Drinkbox Studios says yes, we do hope to support the Switch.
2984000	2987000	Choice Provisions says we hope to.
2987000	2992000	We got our start with the Bit.Trip series on WiiWare and we plan to continue to bring our games to Nintendo platforms.
2992000	2997000	We're not ashamed to admit that we're huge Nintendo fanboys and girls over here.
2997000	3003000	Atui simply said yes and Shinen Multimedia said we've already been working on it for some time.
3003000	3011000	So, it sounds like the Switch will be luring a lot of these, you know, well done indie studios as well as the AAA stuff.
3011000	3020000	And that's important. You know, the big games are important but, you know, if the next Undertale or the next Five Nights at Freddy's is exclusive to the Switch.
3020000	3022000	A lot of people are going to be looking at that.
3024000	3027000	Okay, you guys ready for Switch rumors? Your favorite part.
3027000	3028000	Oh yeah.
3028000	3029000	You ready?
3030000	3032000	Should we bring out the wheel of plausibility?
3033000	3035000	Hold on, I think I have my song.
3038000	3044000	Wheel of plausibility. Turn, turn, turn. Tell us the lessons we might learn.
3044000	3054000	Alright, these are coming from Laura Kate Dale, which is one of the folks that was kind of doing a lot of those early rumors on the Switch, right?
3054000	3059000	Didn't she call a lot of the early stuff going on with the Switch before the trailer was out there?
3059000	3060000	I don't know.
3061000	3068000	Well, the Nintendo Switch supposedly is going to support NFC ID cards.
3068000	3077000	The card would allow you to download content from your friend's personal device, allowing you to get anything from new characters to digital games downloaded through the eShop.
3077000	3082000	This could minimize the potential battery drain while the Nintendo Switch is in portable use.
3082000	3088000	A basic card reportedly included with the Nintendo Switch but additional cards for $10.
3089000	3096000	This sounds a lot like Amiibo, so why are we getting both?
3096000	3106000	I mean, is the NFC thing supposed to be a little bit more like, I guess I'm assuming you can fit maybe more on one of those little cards than you can on an Amiibo?
3106000	3110000	Like, when we say NFC card, we're talking about like an eAmusement Pass type thing, right?
3110000	3111000	So what's the point of this again?
3111000	3113000	Well, we don't know.
3113000	3116000	Allegedly, what is the point of this again?
3116000	3123000	Easily download content from your friend's personal device, allowing you to get anything from new characters to digital games downloaded through the eShop.
3123000	3125000	Why would I want to do that?
3125000	3128000	Well, here's, okay, and some of the chatters are saying this as well.
3128000	3130000	Act F says, yeah, sounds like eAmuse.
3132000	3134000	Get your tinfoil hats on, alright?
3134000	3139000	Get the tarp out, get the tarp out, because I'm going to do fan wank everywhere.
3139000	3140000	You ready?
3140000	3154000	Alright, what if, like eAmuse, and if one of these comes with every Switch and you can get additional ones for extra charge, which I'm sure they would happily print cute Nintendo characters and things people want on these cards.
3154000	3162000	What if these cards were like your identity, no matter where you are and what Switch you're playing.
3162000	3171000	And that maybe you can unlock your own personal achievements on a friend's Switch when you've tapped into being the one playing that console.
3171000	3179000	Or your records and your scores and your Super Mario levels, you can tap in on a friend's Switch, just like that.
3179000	3186000	Like it's basically, essentially what I'm saying is that you are the amiibo with a fantasy card.
3189000	3190000	That's dumb.
3190000	3196000	I'm sorry, it's just, that's just, it's completely unnecessary.
3196000	3202000	Now, and I'm making this up, I'm pulling it out of my ass based on what this is.
3202000	3214000	So we can't say Nintendo is or is not doing this, but I'm just thinking like, how could Nintendo kind of do this whole like, online gaming thing but put their own spin on it?
3214000	3225000	And I think maybe rip, I don't want to say ripping off, but taking what's happening in the arcades with things like EMUs and stuff and maybe putting that into a console type environment.
3225000	3230000	It's not a bad idea. I don't know why you think it's dumb as hell. I think that could be kind of neat.
3230000	3232000	Because, okay, you're comparing the arcade.
3232000	3239000	Especially if it, okay, especially if it could also work on things like Pokken Tournament in the arcades. That's awesome.
3239000	3245000	And it's your Nintendo, it's your universal Nintendo ID that you'll inevitably lose because it's on a card.
3246000	3255000	Yeah, that's assuming that they have that kind of support in the arcades. Like, it makes sense with EMUs because you're going to arcade machines, which you're not exactly going to be bringing that into your house.
3255000	3260000	And you want to track your progress, of course, across all these different machines.
3260000	3271000	And that makes sense. I'm not going to go over to my friend's house and tap my amiibo card or whatever the fuck it's going to be to log into their system for what, achievements and shit?
3271000	3282000	Couldn't we just like, I don't know, like any other fucking system out there already, sign in, oh hey, I'm a guest, log in with your username and password, we're done.
3282000	3292000	But, to be fair, Loki, that's a pain in the ass on the Xbox 360. I'm not so sure about the Xbox One because I haven't done that. Remember how you have to sit there and wait for it to download your entire fucking profile?
3292000	3298000	And this wouldn't happen with the whole amiibo card thing, too, because those things aren't going to store a ton of data on it.
3298000	3307000	Well, now that I'm thinking about it, aren't the Wiimotes supposed to have a little bit of memory in them? Can't you save a Mii to the Wiimote?
3307000	3308000	Yeah, you can.
3308000	3310000	So you can take your Mii over to a friend's house?
3311000	3316000	That's also very little data. I mean, that's basically the same type of data that's stored in a Mii.
3316000	3322000	But, so it would show that there's precedent. So, Loki, it's plausible.
3322000	3335000	No, it's stupid because no one ever uses that feature in the first place because, I don't know, it's just they're doing things just to do things. It doesn't make any sense to do them.
3335000	3345000	It's not something that people are like, oh shit, I would totally play over at my friend's house if it weren't so cumbersome for me to log in on their system.
3345000	3353000	I don't think it's that, Loki. I think it's that people don't realize they can log in on their friend's Xbox 360s.
3353000	3363000	Most people don't realize that's a thing you can do. Nintendo can make it part of their ecosystem and they can sell it in a way where they'll be like,
3363000	3371000	that cute little toad on a card, that is your identity. And all you have to do, and they'll show the little video of somebody going to their friend's house, be like, bing!
3371000	3381000	And like the little sound that it'll make when they tap into their friend's Switch or whatever and then it's like, oh look, my Mii appeared and look, it brought over my Mario levels and all this shit and look what we can do now.
3381000	3388000	You know that Nintendo can explain it to people in a way that Microsoft can't. That is why I think this idea is not as bad as you think it is.
3388000	3395000	You explain it like it's gonna do that, but it's not.
3395000	3396000	That's true, that's true.
3396000	3399000	Because this is Nintendo and they don't fucking get it.
3399000	3404000	We don't know, I am, again, I'm rolling around on the tarp right now.
3404000	3413000	I mean, I'm just, I'm sorry, but this is not gonna happen. I mean, it's, you're still gonna have to download a profile, whatever, you know what, who cares?
3413000	3416000	Enough wank, enough wank, mom's home.
3417000	3418000	It doesn't matter.
3418000	3421000	I'll move on to the next thing, I just want to quickly say.
3421000	3428000	Oh, and can we, while we're on the subject of Miis, can we please like fucking update that shit because they look fucking stupid at this point.
3428000	3430000	And they look fucking dumb.
3430000	3431000	Do they?
3431000	3432000	They do, they look fucking dumb.
3432000	3436000	I don't think so, I think they're kind of part of the Nintendo culture at this point.
3437000	3446000	Because they force fed that shit, it's just like fucking, you know, removing features from your products is part of Apple's culture, it doesn't necessarily mean something that we need to have.
3446000	3457000	Alright, anyway, I don't know how you feel about this, Loki, but it sounds like those little previews of things we saw in the Switch trailer are Director's Cut editions.
3457000	3466000	Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Brothers, apparently one of them as well, and Splatoon will be games that are rolled out as a Director's Cut edition for the Switch.
3466000	3471000	It will include all previously released content and new extras.
3471000	3480000	That is the other rumor going around too, which, you know, I think what many people are already thinking it probably is, except for the fact that Super Smash Brothers is included in that.
3480000	3485000	But it makes an awful lot of sense, why not do Smash Brothers as part of that?
3486000	3496000	I guess maybe because there's a lot of people that like to see an all new Smash Brothers on the Switch, but, you know, do you want to wait five years for them to develop one?
3496000	3500000	So, you know, anyhow.
3500000	3512000	StoppyInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says, what if you took a hottie out on the first date, you pull out your wallet to get your credit card, and your Nintendo Switch It card falls out instead.
3512000	3515000	You both stare in silence. What do you do next?
3515000	3523000	Then she taps it to her Switch and finds out that you've made an amiibo that looks like Hitler as your fucking me.
3523000	3526000	And then, you know, or penis head or something like that.
3526000	3534000	Yes, that's what happens next, Stoppy. She pulls her Nintendo Switch out of her purse and she says, let's see what kind of gamer you are.
3534000	3544000	And then taps the Switch card to her Switch and finds out that you are MrDicksLOL on the Nintendo Network.
3544000	3548000	Then what happens, Stoppy? Then what happens?
3552000	3558000	SSG100Matt says, Sakurai says he wanted to take a long, long break from Smash Brothers.
3558000	3563000	Then again, Nintendo could pay him to reconsider. That's very true, money does talk, but at the same time, the man's earned a break.
3564000	3571000	Bobby Blackwolf says, and his me name is Choices.
3571000	3573000	Exactly.
3573000	3576000	Fuck you all, next story.
3576000	3586000	So this was, this was, so this was the live thing that I watched, because it was like, oh, Nintendo Direct, cool.
3586000	3591000	Maybe we'll get some cool information, but then the back of my brain said, you're right.
3591000	3598000	So there was a free update for Animal Crossing that they announced for Animal Crossing New Leaf.
3598000	3604000	It adds amiibo support, because why the fuck not? And then RVs.
3604000	3609000	Yeah, so it's called Welcome Amiibo.
3609000	3618000	And basically you can, you know, take your amiibos and you can even bring in, I guess, some of the non-Animal Crossing amiibos,
3618000	3623000	which I think also like kind of adds skins and stuff for your characters or like different clothing.
3623000	3630000	Some of the other stuff that they have, you can actually get an RV and a new RV campground.
3630000	3639000	And you can even, I guess, they have some different mini games, including Animal Crossing Puzzle League.
3639000	3643000	Oh, that's cool that they brought in like some of the mini game stuff.
3643000	3647000	Yeah. And they said that Desert Island Escape.
3647000	3654000	But I guess with the amiibos, what that does is it actually brings the villager, whatever villager you want into your village.
3654000	3658000	So like if you have a favorite villager or something, you can go purchase one of those amiibo cards.
3658000	3662000	Although if I remember correctly, I think they're all blind packs, so fuck you guys.
3662000	3672000	But you can try to find one for the villagers that you like and then you scan it and then they come in their RV and you can, I don't know, hang out or something.
3672000	3675000	And question your life that you purchased cards.
3675000	3676000	Stop it.
3676000	3677000	Get a character in your town.
3677000	3684000	Hey, you know what, I think it's rad that Nintendo put in this pretty major update to a game that is what, like three years old at least?
3684000	3686000	At least four?
3686000	3688000	It's a pretty major update to this game.
3688000	3691000	So I think that's kind of rad actually.
3691000	3697000	Like I want to go back and check this out for like to see like how the mini games are and apparently you can sell your town.
3697000	3699000	And now here's the thing though.
3699000	3703000	I still have the old 3DS, so I can't use the amiibo.
3703000	3708000	I mean, I know I can buy one of those adapter things, but why? Why would I do that?
3708000	3710000	Because you're an Apple fan and you like dongles.
3710000	3712000	No, I'm not going to do it.
3712000	3718000	But I'm sure there's 50 amiibo cards you can buy. 50! Think of all those 50 purchases you can make.
3718000	3723000	I don't need the 50 amiibo cards because I already have way too many of the fucking regular amiibo.
3723000	3724000	Are you sure?
3724000	3729000	Well, and I understand. Didn't they put the Splatoon stuff in it too? And Zelda stuff?
3729000	3733000	So there's other amiibo that I already have that I can use in it.
3733000	3737000	I just need to find a friend with a reader. Maybe Shane has an adapter.
3737000	3742000	No, Shane doesn't have an adapter because he has like seven DS's and so he has all the new DS's.
3742000	3747000	Somebody I know has to have one of those adapters and I can just borrow it to get what I need and then that's it.
3747000	3752000	It's just like the cards. You find your friend that has the villager that you want and you just borrow the friend's card.
3752000	3759000	You don't actually need to buy 5,000 packs to find the one blind card that's eluding you.
3759000	3765000	ActDeft says four years old, release date November 8th, 2002.
3765000	3768000	So that's, I mean, that's pretty, look.
3768000	3769000	2012 I'm assuming.
3769000	3773000	2012, sorry, 2012. EA would have shut the server down this year.
3773000	3778000	Nintendo updated the game. You gotta give them credit for that. Come on. That's pretty cool.
3778000	3780000	They're not making any other animal products.
3780000	3783000	Yes, it's just sell more Abibo, but I think it's still really cool.
3785000	3791000	RageNator in chat says, Sky, you have how many versions of Mass Effect 3, yet you won't get a new 3DS.
3791000	3796000	Is Mass Effect 3 on the 3DS? Thank you. Have a seat.
3797000	3804000	No. And I'm guessing that the reason you're buying a PlayStation Pro is because the Pro support for the new Mass Effect game, right?
3804000	3808000	Yes, that would be correct. And Final Fantasy.
3808000	3812000	And are you, are you hyped up for N7 Day tomorrow?
3812000	3819000	Yes, I am. And you better believe that, especially because DarkSakura will be back on our next mini episode.
3819000	3823000	Loki, you could just have a, you could have a little nap the first 45 minutes of the next episode,
3823000	3826000	because that will be, and we'll get out the tarp again,
3826000	3830000	because Jamie and I are going to have a time with whatever comes out tomorrow in N7 Day.
3831000	3834000	So, bring a book, is what I'm saying.
3834000	3836000	Alright. If you have no interest in Mass Effect.
3836000	3837000	I don't.
3838000	3839000	You should.
3840000	3845000	Alright. Anyway, let's move on with, I'm sorry, what is this?
3845000	3851000	Rama in chat says, Mass Effect 3 isn't on 3DS because there's a no trash games policy enforced.
3852000	3859000	Okay, you and I both know that's not true, and for that comment, I'm going to right-click, control, kick.
3862000	3863000	That was fun.
3863000	3870000	Alright, let's move on and talk about that PlayStation 4 Pro that somehow I'm being suckered into buying,
3870000	3877000	and yeah, probably because of Mass Effect, and because of Final Fantasy, and Lord knows what out.
3877000	3879000	Lord knows what else.
3881000	3890000	The PlayStation 4 is coming out within days, and we're finally getting an idea of what all is actually going to be supported by the PlayStation 4 Pro,
3890000	3900000	and that includes things like Battlefield 1, Battlezone, Call of Duty, Black Ops 3 Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare, Dishonored 2,
3900000	3910000	Drive Club VR, Firewatch, Hitman, Infamous First Light and Second Sun, Mafia 3, NBA 2K17, PlayStation VR Worlds,
3910000	3917000	Rez Infinite, Rise of the Tomb Raider, SMITE, Elder Scrolls Online, Elder Scrolls Skyrim Special Edition,
3917000	3925000	Super Stardust Ultra, Titanfall 2, Uncharted 4, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, World of Tanks, XCOM 2.
3925000	3930000	I didn't even read everything on the list. That is a lot of games that are going to be getting some additional support,
3930000	3936000	and that's just what the old games are that are going to be getting new stuff in PS4 Pro.
3936000	3941000	This doesn't talk about everything moving forward, although now that the PlayStation 4 Pro is in play,
3941000	3947000	we kind of know based on the first press conference that Sony is really encouraging developers to think about the PlayStation 4 Pro
3947000	3951000	when they're developing games, and obviously with things like Mass Effect, like Final Fantasy XV,
3951000	3955000	we know the PlayStation 4 Pro will be a part of that.
3955000	3960000	But there are some games that have said they are not doing stuff. I know Witcher 3 was one of them.
3960000	3965000	The publisher of Witcher 3 was like, we are moving on to developing our next game,
3965000	3969000	and it's kind of one of those we don't have time to go back and do it for PlayStation 4 Pro.
3969000	3976000	But that game is solid as it is. Plus, that game was out a while ago already.
3976000	3983000	I realize they did a best of edition that has all the DLC included and all that, but that's different.
3983000	3990000	I'm just hoping they go back. I know that they just released Skyrim Special Edition, and they have Fallout 4 already.
3990000	3997000	I remember Bethesda was talking about how they were going to have a full VR version of Fallout 4 at some point.
3997000	4003000	It would be nice to see that support added. I would say that's what I'd like to see, is VR support added to older games.
4003000	4009000	You know which game could really use that right now, could really benefit from that?
4009000	4015000	A game called No Man's Sky. Because honestly, no one's playing that right now. I'm not playing that right now.
4015000	4018000	But with VR, I would certainly go back and try it again.
4018000	4023000	Are they still working on patches for No Man's Sky? I don't think we know.
4023000	4029000	The only way to get a response out of them is to hack them. Apparently at this point.
4029000	4035000	Not that I'm saying you should, but I'm just noticing that's the only time we've gotten a response lately.
4035000	4037000	Yep, I don't know.
4037000	4038000	Alright, anyhow.
4040000	4046000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the past phrase, hot.
4046000	4048000	Moving on, Logie.
4048000	4053000	Alright, so this is kind of a good policy that they're putting in place.
4053000	4065000	Valve has asked developers now to stay away from using just concept art or other art assets on their Steam pages for these games.
4065000	4071000	And use more in-game screenshots. So it's part of their Discovery 2.0 update on Steam.
4071000	4079000	And they're gonna actually kind of follow along with that because one of the games that was a culprit of that was Dota 2.
4079000	4085000	And so they've actually gone in and updated the page and removed the concept art and put more screenshots in there.
4085000	4088000	Which I think is a genuine thing that they should be doing.
4088000	4093000	And a lot of games really should be doing that to be as honest as possible for the players.
4093000	4096000	Because you're looking at this concept art and you're like, oh wow, the game looks really good.
4096000	4100000	And come to find out, it doesn't look like that at all. Sorry.
4102000	4108000	Yeah, I don't think any of us like when the only stuff we see in the game is a full CGI trailer.
4108000	4110000	And it's like, the game doesn't really look like that.
4110000	4111000	Exactly.
4111000	4112000	Yeah.
4113000	4117000	So that's cool. You know, I think people want to know exactly what it is they're buying.
4117000	4120000	So encouraging more actual in-game screenshots is a good thing.
4120000	4128000	Not that you can't have some CG because, you know, especially some games kind of build themselves on epic CG cutscenes.
4128000	4131000	That's fine. That's still a screenshot from the game.
4131000	4137000	Yeah, exactly, exactly. But, you know, there's gonna be a lot of people that are gonna ask, as in the case of No Man's Sky, for example.
4137000	4140000	Where's the game? What's the game? What is it? Show me the game.
4140000	4143000	You know, and I think it's good to encourage those types of screenshots as well.
4143000	4146000	Well, and also, yeah, too, that's a perfect example because look at No Man's Sky.
4146000	4152000	A lot of the screenshots they were showing were from those E3 trailers, which don't look anything like the actual game.
4154000	4163000	This game can only look better with time and age, and that's the classic game Bastion, which was released on the Xbox 360.
4163000	4166000	Gosh, it was several years ago at this point. That's why I'm almost calling it a classic at this point.
4166000	4169000	It was a while ago at this point when Bastion first came out.
4169000	4177000	But, what's kind of neat is that Bastion is gonna be coming to Xbox One, but it's not just backwards compatibility.
4177000	4183000	They're going to do a new adaptation, Supergiant Games that is, a new adaptation of Bastion on Xbox One.
4183000	4191000	They've rebuilt it to make it feel native to the platform, so it will now run at a full 1080p, and it's gonna include the Stranger's Dream add-on.
4191000	4195000	There will be new achievements in there as well, and this is really cool.
4195000	4199000	So it's coming out on December 12th, that's when the Xbox One adaptation comes out.
4199000	4206000	And if you own it on 360, you can get the new one free if you get it before January 1st.
4206000	4214000	So you will have like, what, a two and a half week window to get the new remaster free if you had it on Xbox 360.
4214000	4221000	Otherwise, if you're looking to get it for the first time, 15 bucks, which I believe is what the game costs the first time.
4221000	4226000	So yeah, that's really cool. I think I did own that game on 360. I owned it somewhere, it was PC.
4226000	4231000	But I thought I had it on PC. I think I had it on 360, I can't even remember, isn't that sad?
4231000	4238000	I think I had it on 360, and then I played it again on PC because I got it as some type of bundle thingy.
4238000	4244000	And so, yeah, but I'm pretty sure I had picked it up when it first came out on 360, because you know, it was a rad game.
4244000	4247000	So I'm glad we'll kind of have an excuse to revisit it.
4247000	4253000	It would be cool if more backwards compatibility stuff did this, but I understand its resources.
4253000	4259000	And you know, like CD Projekt Red, the Witcher guy is not wanting to do PS4 Pro.
4259000	4262000	It's because they want to focus on new stuff. I get it, I get it.
4262000	4267000	But this is a cool little, it's a cool little perk. I like that.
4267000	4269000	Alright, Logy.
4269000	4276000	So while we have Microsoft supporting some of that stuff pretty well, this is something that really could use some work.
4276000	4278000	And that would be the Windows 10 store.
4278000	4284000	So, if you were buying Call of Duty on PC, where would you choose to purchase it from?
4284000	4289000	Most people would probably decide to pick it up on the Steam store, because you know, that makes sense.
4289000	4297000	Although some crazy people like to, you know, go against the norm and decide, hey, let's purchase it off the Windows 10 store.
4298000	4312000	Well, if you happen to purchase it off the Windows 10 store, you'll be unfortunately, or you'll be pleased or surprised to find out that you can't play it against any of the people that are owning it on the Steam store.
4312000	4318000	So, if you own the Steam version, you can't see the people that have it on the Windows 10 store, and vice versa.
4318000	4323000	They have actually split the PC version for some reason. I'm not really sure why.
4323000	4338000	Yeah. Apparently, I don't know, according to Activision, they're saying that they support cross-play between devices and platforms for partners who want to enable it.
4338000	4344000	Well, I guess that's what Microsoft said, but I'm not sure why these versions were split on PC.
4344000	4351000	But hey, if you're planning on picking it up on PC, probably go with the Steam version if you want actual people to play against when you go to play online.
4351000	4356000	Because I'm sure there's like a handful of people that probably bought it on the Windows 10 store.
4356000	4360000	I don't understand why anybody thought this was a good idea.
4360000	4367000	Well, here's why I would think maybe why people might have decided to purchase that. Maybe they thought that this was one of those games that you purchased it on PC.
4367000	4372000	You also get, you know, the Xbox One version or something like that, which is not the case at all.
4372000	4384000	But if you do make that mistake and end up purchasing that, you can't play, I mean, no other game does this where you can't play on, you know, another person on PC.
4384000	4393000	It's stupid. Why? Why would that exist? Activision, why would you do that? I mean, I only get it.
4394000	4403000	Raginator in chat says, aside from the free version of Killer Instinct plus the Windows 10 version of Minecraft, I've got nothing game-wise from the Windows 10 store.
4403000	4411000	Well, I think I got Jetpack Joyride and maybe whatever Mahjong thing they had for free, I think, on the store.
4411000	4415000	And then the Minecraft. I think that's about all I've picked up on the Windows 10 store, too.
4415000	4419000	The Minecraft version's fantastic, but that's really the only thing I'd be interested in picking up.
4420000	4428000	And you know what? The only other thing would be, like, stuff that, you know, you do that cross-buy thing where you purchase, like, Forza or something and you can download.
4428000	4435000	But fuck, if I'm actually gonna make third-party purchases on that. That goes with, like, even you play or anything like that.
4435000	4441000	I'm not purchasing shit on your store. It's all Steam, unless that's the only place I can purchase that.
4441000	4446000	Which, if it was a Valve game, yes, Steam would be the only place you could purchase that.
4446000	4447000	Right.
4447000	4452000	Or a Blizzard game. Can't get those on Steam. Can't get Diablo on Steam.
4452000	4459000	So, some companies get, which, by the way, also Activision. Funny how that works, huh?
4459000	4462000	So maybe Activision thinks they can do it that way.
4462000	4475000	Well, but no, that doesn't make any sense, though, because they have it on both storefronts, so it's like, who said that those versions should be incompatible with each other?
4475000	4481000	Was that an Activision call? Because that doesn't make any goddamn sense. If it was a Microsoft call, that still doesn't make any goddamn sense.
4481000	4486000	Yeah, no, it doesn't. I would think it would have to be on Activision's ends, because it would be their servers, right?
4486000	4492000	I guess. There's, like, literally two different versions of the game, but I just don't understand.
4492000	4496000	Or does the Windows 10 version go through Microsoft servers? Is that the problem?
4496000	4501000	But if that's the case, then would they be able to play against Xbox One players? Because then that would make sense.
4501000	4506000	Oh, I'm sorry, you just won't be playing against PC players, but you'll play against Xbox One players.
4506000	4513000	But if it's just, I'm sorry, you're stuck with this tiny subset of the PC players and you're playing with... that's stupid.
4513000	4516000	It's still a little weird to splinter it that way.
4516000	4520000	If you want to sell it for $19.99, I'm on board, but, yeah.
4520000	4527000	All right. Well, you know what? We're going to take a step back into the time machine here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4527000	4531000	We're going to take a step back with the Classic Game of the Week.
4531000	4535000	And every week, we step into the gaming vault here at OLR Studios and pull out a game that we think,
4535000	4541000	hey, you kids should be checking this game out. This is back before they could splinter audiences.
4541000	4547000	In fact, this is a time when the only thing that's going to give you a splinter is the console, because of all the wood in it.
4547000	4551000	It's the Classic Game of the Week. DarkSakura is sadly unable to join us, thanks to Radio Magic.
4551000	4556000	That could be related to the fact that I've been sick the past few days, and I hear she was, too.
4556000	4562000	So, being sick sucks. But, again, she will be back joining us next week,
4562000	4569000	where we can fill her in on what a good job we've been doing keeping this segment going while the Radio Magic has been broken.
4569000	4575000	So, the Classic Game of the Week this week is one that I'm picking, and you might have guessed based on my opening joke there,
4575000	4580000	that I've picked something on the Atari 2600. And it doesn't really have much of a soundtrack.
4580000	4584000	Usually, we play the music in the background, but because this is Atari 2600, there isn't much.
4584000	4590000	But there is this, so let's see if you can guess from this sound what game this is.
4598000	4602000	If you were only listening to that, Loki, what does that sound like to you?
4602000	4604000	Any Atari game ever?
4605000	4610000	The game is Kaboom! Kaboom!, which was on the Atari 2600.
4610000	4617000	It was published in 1981 for the 2600, although it did come out later on the 5200 in 1983.
4617000	4623000	It was designed by Larry Kaplan, and then David Crane, who was a legend in the 2600 games, Game Days.
4623000	4627000	He did the sprites, overlay sprites for the game. This game did very well.
4627000	4633000	It was a million-plus seller, which the interesting thing about Kaboom! is, like many Atari 2600 games,
4633000	4637000	it was very, very simple in concept. There wasn't a whole lot to it.
4637000	4642000	You controlled these buckets. You had a series of three buckets that were stacked on top of each other,
4642000	4646000	like a little elevator, that you controlled with the paddle, moving them left and right,
4646000	4652000	as the mad bomber at the top of the screen would drop bombs in a swirly pattern or whatever,
4652000	4654000	so you had to move the paddle left and right to catch the bombs.
4654000	4659000	And if one of the bombs hit the ground, Kaboom! That's where the game gets its name from,
4659000	4663000	when the bomb hits the ground, which hopefully won't happen to you.
4663000	4669000	It is a lot like a 1978 Atari coin-operated game called Avalanche,
4669000	4674000	but when Activision, believe it or not, again, this is when Activision is a very old company,
4674000	4676000	and this is when they were doing games of the 2600.
4676000	4679000	When Activision did this, and Larry Kaplan and David Crane put this together,
4679000	4683000	they rethemed it to be the mad bomber instead of falling rocks,
4683000	4688000	probably so that it wouldn't get confused with the Avalanche games.
4688000	4693000	Anyhow, so again, you use the paddle controller, you have multiple buckets,
4693000	4697000	but if a bomb hits the ground, you lose a bucket.
4697000	4702000	So, like, the bucket on the bottom will disappear, which actually makes the game a little bit harder,
4702000	4706000	because you don't have as much time to actually catch one of the bombs.
4706000	4711000	So, yeah, I wouldn't recommend letting a bomb hit the ground on purpose,
4711000	4715000	unless, you know, it's some part of some weird strategy.
4715000	4717000	Because when a bomb does hit the ground,
4717000	4723000	it will resume with the bombs falling half as fast as they were previously before you screwed up.
4723000	4728000	So, I have seen some high score runners purposefully lose a bucket
4728000	4732000	right before they're about to get a free bucket to purposely slow down the game.
4732000	4734000	So, I have seen that happen.
4734000	4738000	But otherwise, you get points for every bomb caught.
4738000	4741000	Extra buckets are awarded to every thousand points.
4741000	4745000	If you pay attention to the mad bomber's face, he's usually not happy,
4745000	4747000	probably because you're catching all his bombs.
4747000	4751000	But if a bomb hits the ground, he smiles, because he's an asshole,
4751000	4754000	and he's trying to, you know, drop bombs on you, and that's not nice.
4754000	4760000	However, there was always this tease that if you could get 10,000 points in the game,
4760000	4762000	something special would happen.
4762000	4764000	Do you know what that special thing was?
4764000	4766000	The mad bomber would look surprised.
4766000	4769000	That was the special thing that happens at 10,000 points.
4769000	4771000	The mad bomber's surprised.
4771000	4774000	Anyway, if you could score over 3,000 points,
4774000	4778000	that is how you could get the old school achievements on the Atari 2600.
4778000	4781000	You mail in a Polaroid photo of your TV,
4781000	4785000	and they would send you a patch for your super cool jacket.
4785000	4787000	So, that was what you had to do.
4787000	4789000	3,000 points would earn you one of those patches.
4789000	4793000	So, again, this was one of the all-time greats on the Atari 2600.
4793000	4797000	It was just, I remember playing this game at a very young age,
4797000	4801000	and I think because it was so simple, yet it was so engrossing,
4801000	4803000	and so easy to pick up, and, you know,
4803000	4806000	it's like just one of those games you can kind of sit there and you Zen out.
4806000	4810000	It's like following the pattern and trying to make sure you catch the bombs and everything.
4810000	4814000	It's a lot of fun, and usually the games are pretty short,
4814000	4819000	unless there's some YouTuber out there who uploaded his video
4819000	4825000	that he submitted to Twin Galaxies of scoring, get this, 999,999 points.
4825000	4829000	Took him three hours, no, almost three and a half hours, I think, to do it,
4829000	4832000	and then the game finally fucking breaks when he hits that number.
4832000	4834000	It freezes because the game doesn't know what to do.
4834000	4836000	It can't count that high, so the game freezes up.
4836000	4839000	That is absolutely the highest score you can get is 999,999.
4839000	4843000	So, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4843000	4844000	Kaboom.
4844000	4848000	Which, yes, it was part of, as some folks in chat are mentioning,
4848000	4850000	it was part of the Game Room service.
4850000	4855000	You could get this in 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Room service,
4855000	4857000	which is no longer around.
4857000	4859000	Screw you, Microsoft, for that.
4859000	4861000	I'm not a fan that they shut down Game Room.
4861000	4866000	Although, honestly, nothing matches that paddle controller.
4866000	4872000	The little analog stick is okay, but it doesn't match the paddle controller.
4872000	4876000	Like, the closest thing I've used that actually kind of works is a mouse.
4876000	4879000	A mouse will do an all right job, but, I mean,
4879000	4881000	the paddle controller was really where it's at.
4881000	4884000	So, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4884000	4885000	Kaboom.
4885000	4887000	Something really, really, really old for you to check out,
4887000	4890000	but I think a classic.
4890000	4892000	Certainly one of the best Atari 2600 games,
4892000	4894000	one of the best selling they ever put out.
4894000	4897000	Anyhow, we are going to take a break, but don't go anywhere, you guys.
4897000	4900000	When we come back, plenty more Orange Lounge ready to come,
4900000	4904000	including your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
4904000	4907000	When we come back, with the conclusion of Orange Lounge Radio,
4907000	4909000	right after this.
4916000	4919000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
4919000	4923000	Tonight, episode number 664 in progress.
4923000	4926000	For this, November the 6th of 2016.
4926000	4930000	Hey, shout out to everybody that participated with Extra Life over the weekend.
4930000	4932000	I know that was something that was going on this weekend,
4932000	4936000	and looking at the tote board over at their Twitter account,
4936000	4938000	Extra Life 4, the number 4 kids,
4938000	4945000	they raised over $6.6 million for the Children's Hospital Miracle Network,
4945000	4948000	or, excuse me, Children's Mir- I got that out of order.
4948000	4951000	Children's Miracle Network Hospitals charity.
4951000	4954000	Sorry about that, but we know it's a good cause, no matter which way I order the words.
4954000	4956000	I had some friends that participated in that.
4956000	4959000	I tried to host a couple streams on my Twitch channels,
4959000	4961000	but every time they switched games, it broke the hosting,
4961000	4964000	so I wasn't able to do that all weekend long.
4964000	4967000	I do know Dark Sakura and Dan were participating in that at some point,
4967000	4970000	because she was streaming at some point,
4970000	4974000	but their setup, they couldn't really talk, so it was just raw gameplay.
4974000	4976000	But they were playing some cool games.
4976000	4977000	They weren't playing anything new.
4977000	4980000	They were playing at one point Street Fighter Alpha 2,
4980000	4983000	just random shit, because you know Jamie and Dan.
4983000	4984000	They drove over to their house.
4984000	4987000	They're always playing some random shit that probably isn't from this decade,
4987000	4993000	but that's why we love them, because they play a lot of classic games as well.
4993000	4997000	But anyway, very cool that that marathon raised a lot, a lot of money,
4997000	5002000	so congrats to everybody involved in that, and job well done.
5002000	5004000	Let's get back into some rapid-fire news.
5004000	5006000	Start with Loki.
5006000	5012000	All right, so aside from getting one of these with a Google Pixel or something like that,
5012000	5021000	the Google Daydream View VR will be releasing very soon, next week in fact, on November 10th,
5021000	5024000	and you can get it at a variety of locations.
5024000	5028000	For example, in the United States, they're going to be selling it for $79,
5028000	5032000	and that's going to be through Best Buy or Verizon.
5032000	5043000	If you're in the UK, you can get it at Ee, our car phone warehouse for 69 pounds, it looks like.
5043000	5049000	Some of the games that they said are going to be supported by it, Danger Goat, Gun Jack 2 End of Shift,
5049000	5058000	Home Run Derby, Hunter's Gate, Macorama, Need for Speed No Limits VR, and Wonder Glade.
5058000	5065000	I thought about picking up a Pixel just to get one of these, but no, I got PlayStation VR instead.
5065000	5066000	Fair enough.
5066000	5074000	And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, Call of Duty Infinite Warfare's Jackal Assault is out now on PlayStation VR.
5074000	5086000	It's free, so you can go check it out, download it, and see if you think it's more impressive than I thought it was, but it's free.
5086000	5090000	That's right, make your own damn decision. Don't listen to Loki, especially when the game is free.
5090000	5093000	It's free, but jeez, you know, it's just...
5093000	5097000	Although I use free with quotey fingers, because you have to buy a PlayStation VR.
5097000	5100000	So there is a little investment to make up front, but yeah.
5100000	5105000	At least it's something else you get to experience when you put down the money for a PlayStation VR.
5105000	5113000	There's like the Apollo 11 thing that they have on Oculus and stuff,
5113000	5118000	and I thought that was supposed to be coming out on PlayStation VR as well soon, but for some reason that hasn't been released yet.
5118000	5120000	It might just be in a couple weeks or something.
5120000	5124000	November is a very busy month for games, as we'll find out here shortly, right?
5124000	5127000	Anyhow, some other news.
5127000	5130000	Hey, remember the game Destroy All Humans?
5130000	5137000	The game is only about, what, 11 years old, but it is now available on the PlayStation 4 digital store.
5137000	5140000	Now there's trophies and widescreen support.
5140000	5145000	So yeah, there was I guess supposed to be a Destroy All Humans 2.
5145000	5151000	Oh no, I'm sorry, I meant there's supposed to be one as well coming out for PlayStation 4,
5151000	5158000	because it's been spoiled by the PEGI ratings board, but it is not actually out on PlayStation 4 yet.
5158000	5160000	It did not come out with Part 1.
5160000	5162000	So yeah, there you go.
5162000	5167000	So if you want to check out another PlayStation 2 classic on PlayStation 4, there you go.
5167000	5169000	That's available for $20.
5169000	5176000	Speaking of classics, Blue Dragon has made its way to Xbox One backwards compatibility.
5176000	5183000	So if you own a copy of Blue Dragon, which I do, yay, you can go check that out now on Xbox One backwards compatibility.
5183000	5186000	But I would ask you, have you beat Lost Odyssey yet?
5186000	5189000	Because if not, don't go back and play Blue Dragon yet.
5189000	5190000	No, I'm just kidding.
5190000	5191000	Both games were fine.
5191000	5193000	I preferred Lost Odyssey a little more.
5193000	5196000	Some people really love the art style of Blue Dragon,
5196000	5200000	especially because they had some very well done characters and so forth.
5200000	5202000	So yeah, check that out.
5205000	5209000	I don't know if anything else was announced at the same time for backwards compatibility.
5209000	5212000	I didn't check if there were, because usually it's like three games at a time,
5212000	5215000	but I didn't check if anything else was released that same day.
5215000	5217000	Blue Dragon was kind of getting all the press on that.
5218000	5222000	Alright, let's get into what is in stores this week.
5222000	5227000	Although our pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat has an update for you, Loki, on Apollo 11 VR.
5227000	5232000	We will be releasing the PSVR version of Apollo 11 VR later this year.
5232000	5240000	We are aiming for release of the PSVR, but we felt we needed to update the experience first before release.
5240000	5242000	It's coming very, very soon.
5242000	5243000	Cool.
5243000	5247000	Alright, well speaking of coming very, very soon, Loki, this Tuesday in stores.
5247000	5250000	So yeah, this week we've got quite a few things.
5250000	5252000	So The Silver Case on Mac.
5252000	5255000	Trillion, God of Destruction on PC.
5255000	5261000	Cartoon Network Battle Crashers on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and 3DS.
5261000	5265000	Eagle Flight, that weird Ubisoft game where you play as an eagle.
5265000	5267000	That's on PlayStation VR this week.
5267000	5270000	Lethal VR on HTC Vive.
5270000	5273000	Harvest Moon, Skytree Village on 3DS.
5273000	5277000	Robinson, The Journey on PlayStation VR.

5282000	5288000	Sword Art Online, Hollow Realization on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
5288000	5291000	Transport Fever on PC.
5291000	5296000	Fate, Excella, The Umbral Star on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

5305000	5308000	Tyranny on PC.
5308000	5311000	Candle on PC, Mac, and Linux.
5311000	5316000	And Dishonored 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5316000	5317000	That's it.
5317000	5320000	Big Week, are you picking up anything on that?
5322000	5323000	No.
5323000	5327000	Maybe I might check out, I had to see about Robinson, The Journey, how expensive it is.
5327000	5329000	And what the reviews look like on that.
5329000	5331000	But maybe that one.
5331000	5333000	But no for the rest.
5333000	5337000	Alright, well things in Japan, not quite as noisy as they are here.
5337000	5339000	But we do still have some releases to point out this week.
5339000	5345000	Which includes the Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes plus Phantom Pain combo pack is out this week.
5345000	5350000	As well as the PlayStation 4 Pro of course also gets its release in Japan.
5350000	5354000	And there is a game called Fate, Excella.
5354000	5357000	Which comes out in a Regalia box and a Velbor box.
5357000	5360000	Which are I guess two different types of collectibles there.
5360000	5362000	That you can get that is out in Japan.
5362000	5366000	Also there is a red and a blue controller that you can pick up.
5366000	5369000	That's the new Dualshock that goes with the new PlayStation.
5369000	5370000	You can check that out.
5370000	5378000	And you can also get a full PlayStation 4 with Fate, Excella actually included with it.
5378000	5382000	Where some of the artwork from the game is like on the PlayStation 4 itself.
5382000	5387000	So this release is big enough to justify that type of special PlayStation.
5387000	5390000	So you can check that out over in Japan this week.
5390000	5393000	Otherwise over on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
5393000	5400000	There is also some new Nintendo, I'm sorry that is another countries release that snuck in there.
5400000	5403000	So I will mention Beyblade comes out this week in Japan.
5403000	5405000	Saikai Kusou no Sainen.
5405000	5409000	Shijuu Sadae no Saina comes out as well.
5409000	5416000	And Rilu Rilu Feralu Kira Kira Hajimeite no Feralu Magic comes out as well.
5416000	5421000	Obviously all of this will not matter the next week because Pokemon Sun and Moon are out.
5421000	5423000	Which is a huge release.
5423000	5430000	So that's why things are, you know, there are some games on the 3DS but it's going to get really noisy on the 3DS next week.
5430000	5432000	As it will over here.
5432000	5439000	Lastly on the Vita since, you know, it's still a thing, the Vita in Japan.
5439000	5443000	We do have that Fate, Excella also releasing there in Japan this week.
5443000	5448000	There is also a Vita to go with Fate, Excella also releasing in Japan this week.
5448000	5452000	It's a white PlayStation Vita with some of the artwork from the game on its back.
5452000	5456000	And AkumaJP is in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com and says,
5456000	5458000	Fate has its mania.
5458000	5464000	So basically like there's definitely a lot of fans over there that will buy this stuff up.
5464000	5466000	So there you go, that's what you have in Japan.
5466000	5467000	How about the UK, Loki?
5467000	5472000	The only thing listed for this week is Dishonored 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.
5472000	5480000	Alright, before we get to our mailbag, I thought this is a good time for us to get a little bit angsty
5480000	5485000	and get some things off our chest because we've been waiting until the end of the show the past few weeks.
5485000	5488000	And you know what, I don't have time to wait, I'm mad, we're getting it out right now.
5503000	5505000	Loki?
5505000	5511000	I would like to try to act more angry, but unfortunately I have a really killer migraine right now
5511000	5515000	that hasn't gone away for a few hours.
5515000	5521000	I mean it's dulled itself for the medication, but as soon as that 4 hour mark hits, it's coming back.
5521000	5523000	So just have to get the migraine.
5523000	5529000	Well, my F.U. goes to being sick because even though I thought I'd shaken most of this,
5529000	5532000	my God, this is hard to get through a 3 hour show.
5532000	5533000	I'm like, oh my God.
5533000	5536000	Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. And I have one more actually.
5536000	5539000	Oh, sure. F.U. to Loki for cutting me off.
5539000	5542000	But yeah, God, being sick sucks. I hate it.
5542000	5545000	I cannot miss any more works. I need to go back tomorrow.
5545000	5548000	And it's just like, oh my God, don't let me feel like crap tomorrow.
5548000	5552000	And I'm supposed to go to Chicago on Thursday. Don't ruin my trip.
5552000	5555000	What did I do to deserve this? I'm a good person.
5555000	5556000	Loki?
5557000	5563000	Okay, my other F.U. goes to people that drive cars who blow through intersections
5563000	5567000	or just flat out just try to hit you with their car.
5567000	5572000	And then when you look at them like you fucking idiot, they're like, sorry, and shrug their shoulders.
5572000	5574000	Like I literally saw a guy do this.
5574000	5579000	He ran through the stop sign, just completely blew through it at 40 miles an hour in a residential.
5579000	5582000	He just kind of like shrugged his shoulders like, sorry.
5582000	5584000	I'm like, you're not fucking sorry.
5584000	5586000	You dumbass, you're not sorry at all.
5586000	5588000	They're like this old woman, I was like crossing the street.
5588000	5591000	And she like nearly hit me with her car.
5591000	5593000	And she's just like, sorry.
5593000	5597000	I'm like, you're not fucking sorry at all, you old bat.
5597000	5599000	I just hate people like that.
5599000	5603000	It's like seriously, just, yes, it's your road, of course.
5603000	5606000	I'm interfering with your driving.
5606000	5608000	All right.
5608000	5610000	There it is, the F.U.s of the week.
5610000	5614000	Let's try to better our mood a little bit by reading some fan mail.
5619000	5622000	Every week you guys send an email to the show.
5622000	5625000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do it.
5625000	5628000	And we pick our favorites and we read them here live on air.
5628000	5632000	You know, it's been a while since we've really had some emails, but we have a few this week.
5632000	5634000	We're making up for some lost time this week.
5634000	5637000	So I have some emails to get into tonight.
5637000	5642000	And our first email tonight comes from our old pal YYR.
5642000	5648000	And this email caught my attention immediately because the subject of the email was that Shane.
5648000	5652000	And I was like, oh, good, we're going to have an email to drag Shane a little bit tonight.
5652000	5654000	Hopefully he's not listening, but we'll see.
5654000	5657000	Anyway, let's get to YYR's email.
5657000	5658000	It starts off like this.
5658000	5661000	Hello, my name is Aaron Tepletsky.
5661000	5663000	I hope I said that right. Sorry, buddy.
5663000	5666000	And this email is about how much I hate Shane Alinko.
5668000	5672000	You have my attention. I'm a fan of this fan mail. Let's get to it.
5672000	5675000	And then says, just kidding. Oh, bummer.
5675000	5680000	Actually, this is regarding the discussion you guys had on last week's show about Super Mario Run.
5680000	5687000	The way that Nintendo is choosing to sell it and their ambitious goal to make it as popular as Pokemon Go.
5687000	5691000	For years now, it's been obvious that Nintendo mostly ignores what their competitors are doing.
5691000	5693000	And instead, they do things their own way.
5693000	5697000	The Switch trailer clearly showed that they will continue down that path.
5697000	5700000	Super Mario Run is no exception to this.
5700000	5706000	One of the ways the most popular mobile games have held on and grown their audience over the years has been continuous expansion.
5706000	5712000	Hate all you want on Candy Crush, but the game now contains over 2,700 levels.
5713000	5714000	What?
5715000	5723000	I think I got as far as level 40 and then it was like, I literally could not get past the stage without some of the pay to win stuff.
5723000	5725000	And I was like, fuck this game.
5725000	5727000	Exactly why there's 2,700 levels.
5727000	5730000	Oh my god, that's how there's 2,700 levels? Jesus.
5731000	5736000	You gotta beat them all and if you can't beat them all, then you gotta pay to beat them.
5736000	5742000	Even Rama, who played that game more than anybody else I know, said I hit level 375 and bailed.
5742000	5746000	And even when he was that far into it, I was like, intervention! Call A&E.
5748000	5754000	Believe it or not, over 1,000 of those levels, email continuing, were added just over the last 18 months.
5754000	5763000	King, along with the makers of other popular mobile games, have been able to keep and grow their player bases just by continuing to add content to their games.
5763000	5767000	And many of their players have not actually paid them anything at all.
5767000	5773000	Nintendo, on the other hand, seem to be releasing a game that unlocks entirely after one purchase.
5773000	5781000	On one hand, it sounds nice, but this also implies that the purchase game will be complete as is and will not be expanded in the future.
5781000	5788000	If this is the case, I expect that the majority of the audience will complete all the levels within days, if not sooner, and then will never come back.
5788000	5791000	That's not going to generate much word of mouth.
5791000	5797000	If Nintendo wanted to use this sort of outright purchase strategy, I feel like a better idea would have been to release level packs,
5797000	5803000	and then continue to release level packs every month in the future to keep the players engaged in the revenue coming in.
5803000	5811000	But it seems that's not what they're doing. I wish Nintendo luck with Super Mario Run, sure, and I'll look forward to just trying it personally.
5811000	5818000	But to think it can match the previous success of Pokemon GO is just delusional, unless they borrow a page from Candy Crush,
5818000	5821000	or just about every other long-term successful mobile game.
5821000	5827000	Sigh. I blame Shane for this, and for every misguided idea Nintendo has ever had.
5827000	5828000	As well I should.
5829000	5832000	Until next time, YYR.
5833000	5836000	Now, unfortunately, Shane is not here to defend himself.
5837000	5842000	But SSJ100Matt enters a very plausible Shane plea.
5843000	5846000	I'll give you Shane's thoughts on it, from SSJ100Matt's.
5846000	5850000	Um, whatever, you're wrong. Also, I don't care.
5851000	5857000	I think that's very fair. It's like he's in the room with us right now.
5858000	5864000	No, all that aside, I'm actually, all seriousness, I'm actually not sure what that had to do with Shane so much.
5864000	5869000	Shane must have taken a stance on it last night. I know he's been very hard on Pokemon GO.
5869000	5877000	On the Pokestop podcast, which we just did another episode that I have to put on the feed, but he still is very, very harsh on Pokemon GO,
5877000	5880000	and the fact that, you know, that game's kinda over, basically.
5880000	5881000	Yeah.
5881000	5885000	The minute, but to YYR's credit, he's absolutely right.
5885000	5889000	The minute they release more Pokemon, there'll be more people back in the game, for sure.
5889000	5891000	Imagine when they release shinies on there.
5892000	5896000	Yeah, exactly. Imagine when they release shinies, even Shane will be back. Absolutely.
5897000	5903000	But they're kind of drip feeding some of that now, because, you know, just today, like hours before we went live,
5903000	5909000	Pokemon GO added that whole daily bonus thing, which I think we'll cover in detail a little later in the show.
5909000	5913000	So, I mean, Pokemon GO is, you know, trying to add some of that stuff.
5913000	5919000	So, I can see for one perspective where, based on, you know, YYR's, kind of what he's saying in his email,
5919000	5926000	Super Mario Run does have to do great business out the gate, because it might not have a lot of longevity otherwise.
5926000	5937000	But at the same time, YYR, to be fair, we are also talking about a company that put out a very major patch for a four-year-old game this week.
5937000	5944000	So, anything's possible. Maybe there will be some free level packs that come out throughout the line,
5944000	5948000	or some other types of expansions, or so forth. Who knows? Who knows?
5948000	5956000	Alright, let's get to some other emails here. Next email comes to us from Robert M., who says,
5956000	5962000	I went to Six Flags with my brother's family. Some major issues with food service, but that's not the relevant part.
5963000	5970000	My corn dog wasn't cooked. When we went by the arcade, I quietly lamented the very small selection of redemption machines,
5970000	5977000	and got to thinking, what were the original, literal Penny arcades like before Space War and Pong?
5977000	5984000	I imagine largely simple pinball machines, before flippers even, and hand-cranked movies.
5984000	5989000	Personally, I'd love to see a clever and forceful steampunk group build an elaborate,
5989000	5995000	mutoscope version of Dragon's Lair with art more resembling iWorks? I don't know.
5995000	5999000	That's referencing an old technology that I don't know the name off the top of my head.
5999000	6005000	Then Bluth, and somehow fully mechanical. Oh, it's a name. Sorry about that.
6005000	6012000	What's your historical knowledge about that era of arcades? Clearly, if I'm fumbling over your names, not enough.
6012000	6016000	Would some form of redemption machine have been a thing back then? Thanks.
6017000	6021000	Well, I do know pinball's been around a very long time.
6021000	6025000	Pinball's been around certainly longer than video arcade machines have been.
6025000	6031000	Pinball was always kind of a bar thing, although certainly there were arcades and things like what you're talking about as well.
6031000	6037000	But yeah, a lot of the Penny arcades was also those old visual crank-turning things. You would see that.
6038000	6045000	And then, you know, we really didn't start seeing arcades as they were now until it was really like Pong,
6045000	6052000	and then just the floodgates that opened in the late 70s once Atari started doing more like asteroids and things like that.
6052000	6060000	And then you started getting Pac-Man, and just like in the early 80s, it was really like the floodgates were opened and just unleashed there.
6060000	6069000	So before that, I don't think you had as many arcades, but you certainly still probably had them in places like boardwalks and stuff,
6069000	6073000	where I think it was probably a lot more like carnival games and those sorts of things.
6073000	6078000	And then like you talked about in there, like the very old crank machines and things like that.
6083000	6087000	I do know that, at least for a while, I don't think they have it anymore.
6087000	6094000	I know for a while Disneyland had a place called Penny Arcade, but it was like there was a few of those crank machines.
6094000	6099000	You could see old Disney cartoons, and then the rest of it is a souvenir shop. Like there's not really a whole lot in there.
6099000	6103000	But now it's all about Penny slot machines, but that's very, very different.
6103000	6108000	I suppose in Nevada, if you went to a Penny Arcade, it was a very different thing. It was slot machines.
6108000	6113000	Anyhow, oh, there was a PS on that email. I want to make sure I get here.
6113000	6119000	I did pick up Severed and Crypt of the Necrodancer during the iOS spooky game sale.
6119000	6124000	Not sure how long I can dedicate a full gigabyte to the latter, but certainly recommendable.
6125000	6131000	Alright, let's get to our last email tonight from Ragenator, who says,
6131000	6136000	Hi Sky, Loki, and Shane and or Alan, if either one of you are there.
6136000	6140000	Well, you missed, it's just Loki and I hope that's okay.
6140000	6147000	It's Ragenator yet again. Seeing as it's become more or less my thing, I just wanted to point out a deal for everyone.
6147000	6151000	As I type this, GOG, or Good Old Games, is having their fall sale.
6151000	6155000	While not everything is on sale, there are plethora of games that are.
6155000	6162000	On top of that, the sale does have a gimmick of sorts. You can gain XP by performing certain tasks or spending money.
6162000	6165000	And once you cross certain thresholds, you can unlock free games.
6165000	6169000	I actually had no idea that was going on, so I do need to check that out.
6169000	6173000	Now that I got that news out of the way, I'd like to pose an open-ended question.
6173000	6180000	As we all know, PC gaming has multiple online storefronts, with Steam and GOG being the two most popular of the bunch.
6180000	6186000	Of course, there's a certain amount of overlap game-wise that these stores carry, plus sometimes there can be differences too.
6186000	6194000	For example, you could buy GameX on Steam, and when you play it, the game drops cards that you can either sell for a profit or use to craft badges.
6194000	6202000	If you bought GameX on GOG, it may not come with cards, but you'd get digital extras like wallpapers, OSTs, ebooks, etc.
6202000	6205000	Steam also tends to have the better sales more often.
6205000	6214000	With all that being said, do you guys find it difficult to choose what service or storefront to buy the games from, or do you just say fuck it and buy on both?
6214000	6218000	No, I would not buy on both, that's for sure.
6218000	6228000	Although, certainly in one of those bundles, I've probably bought something on PC that I also had on console, but that's also a little bit different.
6228000	6234000	I don't think I've ever bought the same game from two different stores. I don't think I can say I do that.
6234000	6241000	And I think honestly, Rage Nader, a lot of what you just basically said is what weighs into my thinking.
6241000	6245000	Well, what are the perks here, versus what are the perks here?
6245000	6253000	I don't really view the trading cards as much of a perk. It's pennies at most, and it's not really a big thing.
6253000	6264000	But at the same time, I also don't really use a lot of those books and things that they do on good old games, because there's this thing called the internet where a lot of the same information comes from.
6264000	6270000	However, I can appreciate what they're trying to do from a collector standpoint, especially for the classic stuff.
6270000	6280000	So I'm not trying to shade that stuff, I'm just trying to say, realistically, especially for the newer games, a PDF file is not really going to make or break where I'm going to buy this game from.
6280000	6287000	So it does usually come down to the sales, which yes, Steam tends to have the better ones.
6287000	6300000	I tend to stick with good old games for classic games, and I'm actually kind of bummed that they're moving more into the newer stuff, because there's still so many classic games, I would like to see them get on their service.
6300000	6306000	I'm sure they're trying, but there's things like the original Civilization where it's like, please get this game on your service.
6306000	6314000	And I understand, I'm sure they've asked, and there's reasons why it's not there, but I still feel like there's more to develop in that back catalogue.
6314000	6319000	And maybe this is just what they have to do to stay profitable and so forth, so I get it, I get it.
6319000	6327000	Loki, is there anything you want to add to this? Any insight you have on where you choose to buy your games online?
6327000	6333000	Well, it tends to be worth it, especially on PC, since most of the stuff I purchase I don't end up playing anyways.
6333000	6337000	It just ends up in the back catalogue that's ever growing.
6338000	6347000	So typically it's just bundles a lot of the times. If I'm actually going to go out and purchase something, it's usually on Steam, but it's whoever offers it cheapest at that point.
6347000	6358000	Yeah. Dungeon Buster points out in chat over at live.vog network.com, says GOG still does classic games, but there's the whole sorting out the rights of who has what now thing.
6358000	6360000	Yeah, that can get complicated sometimes.
6361000	6371000	And AkumaJP is trying to invoke Mass Effect again, but hold on, because Mass Effect 3 was only available on Origin, so it kind of made that decision easy.
6371000	6379000	And I think I did get 1 and 2 on Origin as well, but only because all of them, I bought all of them when they were on a deep discounted sale.
6379000	6393000	Like it was long after I'd already played the trilogy on Xbox 360, and I bought, no, Mass Effect 3 actually I did buy on PC, not on a deep discount, because I wanted to play online on PC.
6393000	6399000	I really loved multiplayer on Mass Effect 3, don't forget, that was a big thing I was super into for a while.
6399000	6407000	So, yeah, and I really hope that's something in Andromeda as well. We'll find out tomorrow! I hope. We better.
6408000	6418000	Anyway, lastly, Raginator concludes the email with, this email was not brought to you by Loki, because if Loki had anything to do with this email, it wouldn't have been finished and sent.
6420000	6427000	That was unnecessarily mean. That was unnecessarily mean, but I laughed.
6427000	6435000	Alright, there it is, your emails. Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
6435000	6443000	I'm just looking at chat over at Live.Vognor.com. This isn't relevant to what we're talking about right now, but it is kind of relevant to gaming.
6443000	6453000	ActDeft says, did an emote, ActDeft needs to not pay attention to R slash Pokemon Go. Jesus Christ, the salt going on right now.
6453000	6462000	Yeah, and you know what, that's not the only Reddit that gets a lot of salt. I don't know if they finally cleaned it up, but I know No Man's Sky was really bad for a while.
6463000	6471000	I would say for Pokemon Go, what the hell is the name of it? It has another name, it's the Silph Road, that's the name of it.
6471000	6476000	That's where there's a lot of people that play Pokemon Go, but it doesn't have quite as much salt.
6476000	6485000	And that's sometimes what happens on Reddit, is that the communities will form something with a more niche title that you have to search for a little bit to kind of keep the ranters out.
6485000	6489000	To keep it more of a fans only thing because you had to search it out a little bit.
6489000	6497000	So, anyway, just an observation from your comments there in chat. Let's get back into some other news. Loki.
6497000	6508000	Alright, so there's a hedgehog movie guest coming out, which I was unaware of that, but apparently now they've got some people attached to it.
6508000	6521000	Tim Miller, who was working on Deadpool, is now working on developing an adaptation of Sonic the Hedgehog for Sony Pictures.
6521000	6530000	So he's bringing one of his collaborators, Jeff Fowler, to work on the project as well.
6530000	6542000	And it would be his directorial debut. It's supposed to be a CGI animated slash live action hybrid family oriented movie. Oh god.
6542000	6556000	Yay, family oriented. I just think it's funny that, you know, Deadpool is going to have this in common with Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's not like I suddenly expect Sonic the Hedgehog to start coming out saying fuck.
6556000	6563000	That would be fucking amazing. Like, it's just all family for a little while, then something happens like, fuck.
6563000	6568000	And it's like, it just goes downhill from there. That would be awesome.
6568000	6574000	Tigerclaw in chat pointing out Tim Miller's background is with animation since he worked at Blur Studios.
6574000	6575000	Right.
6575000	6582000	SSJ100Matt saying, just don't have Sonic's friends in the movie. For god's sake, don't put his friends in it.
6582000	6587000	I would be fine with his friends being in there if it was like a joke. Like, you know, like all of his friends.
6587000	6590000	Or they all get brutally murdered.
6590000	6600000	But I imagine some like Tails, Knuckles, Doctor Robotnik, some of them are going to have to be there, but the other ones, murder.
6600000	6612000	This kind of sounds like it's like one of those, oh, they've entered our dimension and now Doctor Robotnik's going to try to take over Earth and it's lame and cliche and tropey.
6612000	6621000	Tigerclaw says, I bet the live action Sonic is based on the Sonic Adventure games. It's the only ones that had Sonic on Earth.
6622000	6627000	And Dark Tetsuya says, oh god, so like the Smurfs movie?
6627000	6635000	And Bob Coffee suggests, that's when Sonic says fuck as soon as his friends appear.
6635000	6638000	Aw, fuck you guys.
6638000	6643000	Alright, we'll give this movie the benefit of the doubt.
6643000	6647000	You know who should write the Sonic the Hedgehog movie? You know who should write that movie, Loki?
6647000	6654000	Whoever's running their Twitter account should be writing the movie. That would be an awesome movie and you know it.
6654000	6662000	Anyway, so there was a, I guess there was an arcade convention thingy going on this weekend, right?
6662000	6671000	We're getting some information about some new products that are going to be unveiled at IAAPA, which I think is something like International Amusement.
6672000	6682000	So we get some new games that are being unveiled and Sega Amusements actually unveiled a lot of their lineup that can be expected that they're going to be showing off at this expo.
6682000	6687000	So they have a game coming out called Target Bravo Operation Ghost.
6687000	6697000	So this is a game where it looks like it's kind of an update of a game that they did back in 2011, which was Operation Ghost and this is a new sequel to it.
6698000	6705000	So it looks like you've got an actual scene from Operation Ghost in this giant blue camo cabinet there, so that looks pretty cool.
6705000	6712000	Thank you, Dark Tetsuya, it says International Arcade Amusement and Pinball Association. Thank you, that sounds a lot better than what I said.
6712000	6720000	Also, Let's Go Island Dream Edition, another classic game coming back from Let's Go Jungle.
6720000	6727000	This is a casual light gun game where you're in a tropical setting blasting bugs away, so that's been updated.
6727000	6731000	So yeah, there's lots of cool stuff as well.
6731000	6746000	And, apparently, it doesn't stop there, because at the, I guess this is the AAMA Gala, it was announced that Daytona is coming back.
6746000	6753000	That's right, Daytona 3 Championship USA is coming back.
6753000	6763000	And I always would love an excuse to play this song here on Orange Lounge Radio, although it's tragic Dark Soccer is not here to celebrate.
6763000	6777000	That's right, Daytona is back, motherfuckers, Daytona 3 Championship USA.
6777000	6784000	That's it, I don't think we know much more about it right now, if it's a remake or remaster or what.
6784000	6794000	It's gonna have new tracks, and it's also gonna be the old tracks that are remastered as well, but it's gonna have the same arcade physics feel of the original Daytona games.
6794000	6802000	And if this song isn't in it, throw it in the garbage. Throw it in the garbage if that song isn't in it.
6802000	6804000	It's gotta be in it.
6804000	6806000	Am I right? It's gotta be in it.
6806000	6807000	Hopefully a remix.
6807000	6809000	Ooh, that'll be even better.
6809000	6815000	Maybe they could get a celebrity singer, maybe they could get Ariana Grande to sing it or something, complete with the...
6815000	6817000	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
6817000	6819000	David Hasselhoff.
6819000	6821000	Oh, that'll be even better.
6823000	6825000	I'm excited about that.
6825000	6832000	Yeah, it seems like, I mean, that's the type of thing that'll probably end up at a Dave & Buster's or a Round 1, so I'm really excited to check that out.
6832000	6833000	Heck yeah.
6833000	6835000	Loki, what's next?
6835000	6845000	Alright, so as we kind of alluded to earlier, Pokémon GO is getting some new daily bonuses to get you to check out the game each day.
6845000	6849000	So after the Halloween event, they actually launched this.
6849000	6856000	Each day, resetting at 12 midnight local time, you'll get some new bonuses.
6856000	6863000	So that'll be different things like activating a Pokésop or catching a Pokémon or something like that.
6863000	6872000	You'll get extra rewards for doing those activities seven days in a row, and it'll give you extra experience and extra stardust.
6872000	6875000	And maybe the stops will give you more items.
6876000	6878000	That's cool.
6878000	6885000	Because I sure as hell don't open this game up anymore for, I don't know, I just don't want to play it anymore.
6885000	6891000	Is this just not something, I mean, is this something that might bring you back, or is this just not a game you're playing again?
6891000	6896000	I've been playing Ingress, so it feels like it would take away from that, but it's just, I don't know.
6896000	6898000	Fair enough, fair enough.
6898000	6905000	The interesting thing is, apparently the client is supposed to be getting an update, but I didn't get the client update,
6905000	6911000	yet I got a bonus for catching Pokémon just right outside today, which I'm sure you already know.
6911000	6917000	They decreased the Pidgey and Rattata spawn, and so now different stuff spawns everywhere.
6917000	6924000	So like here at the house, I'm always catching Nidorans, and I've caught like three Pikachus, just randomly opening the app here.
6924000	6929000	So somehow our house in this neighborhood is a Pikachu nest again, so that's pretty cool.
6929000	6933000	So that's cool if they shook up those spawns too, is that it's not just fucking Pidgey and Rattata.
6933000	6938000	I mean, they're still out there, don't get me wrong, but it's not nearly as many as it was before, so that's kind of cool.
6939000	6943000	Alright, but it's not like you're going to suddenly see Porygons everywhere.
6943000	6951000	It's just like the Sandshrews, the Nidorans, the Cubones, the stuff that was like common, but not too common.
6951000	6953000	You know, it's just showing up everywhere.
6953000	6959000	Anyhow, I am really, really, really, really excited about this announcement,
6959000	6965000	and that is that Inti Creates has revealed that they are now holding the rights to Blaster Master,
6965000	6968000	and they've announced Blaster Master Zero.
6968000	6977000	That's right, the classic 8-bit series Blaster Master is coming back on the 3DS eShop in Spring 2017.
6977000	6981000	This was shared during the company's Fan Festa event in Japan.
6981000	6986000	So they got the rights to the original Blaster Master game, and they're working on this title.
6986000	6992000	They are creating a fully 8-bit experience in a way that harkens back to the golden age of the NES,
6992000	6998000	but uses the current generation hardware to optimize and power up the game for the players of today.
6998000	7004000	This, of course, includes new areas and bosses, and new gameplay elements such as extra sub-weapons,
7004000	7009000	improved gameplay when battling outside your Sophia III tank, a more robust scenario,
7009000	7013000	refined and expanded exploration mechanics, and more.
7013000	7019000	And there's actually some screenshots out there, so this definitely isn't like a remake of the first game,
7019000	7022000	but it certainly looks like it, yeah.
7022000	7025000	Well, there's parts that are definitely inspired by it, for sure.
7025000	7030000	But then you look at some of these pictures, like there's some parts of it where the pictures,
7030000	7034000	like especially in the outdoor scenes, they don't look the same at all.
7034000	7037000	So they've definitely changed some things with this.
7037000	7042000	Now, I don't know if you guys remember, but there was a Blaster Master game on the Wii,
7042000	7048000	in the Wii Shop 2006, maybe, was when that was out.
7048000	7053000	The problem was it was a little bit clunkier, it didn't control quite right,
7053000	7056000	so it just didn't have that same feel of the original game.
7056000	7063000	But, you know, there have been attempts to do this before, and it didn't work so well.
7063000	7069000	Although, I don't know, that Wii one, it wasn't bad, it just didn't capture the magic in the same way.
7069000	7074000	So I do think it's pretty cool that they are kind of going back to the 8-bit roots type of thing,
7074000	7078000	and the 3DS certainly is an interesting platform to try that on.
7078000	7082000	You know there's a part of me that's like, why don't you put that on the Switch, though,
7082000	7085000	so I can put that on my TV in all its 8-bit glory?
7085000	7089000	Like, would it be that hard for them to move a 3DS game over to the Switch?
7089000	7091000	I'll just put it on the Wii U eShop.
7091000	7094000	Oh yeah, or the Wii U eShop, heck yeah, I'd go for that as well.
7094000	7096000	So that would be very cool if that would happen.
7096000	7099000	Put it on another console that's not the Nintendo.
7099000	7104000	So, I don't know, we'll see, I'm waiting to see a video as well, all there is is screenshots right now.
7104000	7108000	But, yeah, excited to check that out when it comes out next year.
7108000	7116000	So, yay, Blaster Master, I kind of figured that series was done after the Wii version didn't really energize things as well.
7116000	7124000	However, I do want to take this opportunity to say, NTCreates, if you happen to be out there listening to this program,
7124000	7133000	if you are in the business of buying up old franchises from the NES that are long dead that deserve a new game,
7133000	7135000	I got four words for you.
7135000	7138000	The motherfucking Guardian Legend.
7140000	7142000	I think that might be five words there.
7142000	7143000	Motherfucking is one word.
7143000	7144000	Ah, fine.
7146000	7147000	Alright.
7148000	7151000	Loki, before we get to the Skype line, what do you have for us?
7151000	7153000	Alright, so this is kind of cool.
7153000	7157000	So, Left 4 Dead getting an unfinished campaign that you can download.
7157000	7161000	So, Turtle Rock Studios had released this on like a third party site,
7161000	7171000	and it includes campaigns for two previously released, or it combines the two campaigns of dead air and blood harvest.
7171000	7177000	And they say it's not an official release, it's what they call a gray box.
7178000	7185000	Which means some of the environments lack proper textures, and some of the code and features are missing,
7185000	7188000	but it's playable from beginning to end.
7189000	7191000	You know, that means modders will just finish it though.
7192000	7196000	Also adds two survival maps, which have never been released as well.
7196000	7199000	That is also an old game, it's nice to see it getting support.
7199000	7202000	Wow, it seems to be a running theme tonight.
7202000	7204000	Everything old is new again.
7204000	7205000	Sorta.
7206000	7208000	Fresh coats of paint for everything.
7208000	7211000	Which, speaking of things that are old, is new again.
7211000	7216000	How many of y'all are picking up that NES Classic Edition that's coming out next week?
7216000	7221000	Although, there's been surprisingly little information on where to pick this thing up,
7221000	7223000	considering that it's coming out in days.
7223000	7228000	Yeah, and then also the other big bitch about it too is those cord sizes.
7228000	7229000	Yeah.
7229000	7232000	That's kinda like fucking stupid.
7232000	7235000	Yeah, they may have really made a mistake with that.
7235000	7238000	Although, I'll probably just get one for my computer room.
7239000	7242000	Even though I said I wasn't gonna buy one originally.
7242000	7247000	However, remember, Loki, we're in that year of we say we're gonna do something and then we do the exact opposite.
7247000	7249000	So, that's been a trend on this show the past year.
7249000	7254000	Exactly. Like I said, I've been working on my game, but I really haven't because I've been fucking exhausted every night.
7254000	7259000	And like, I seriously, I do open up, Unity is opened up on my computer,
7259000	7263000	I stare at it for five minutes, and then my brain's like, fuck that, we're going YouTube.
7263000	7267000	And it's just, it just can't handle programming.
7267000	7274000	Alright, well anyway, to celebrate the re-release of the Nintendo Entertainment System Mini NES,
7274000	7281000	for three days from November 11th through the 13th, the power line is coming back.
7281000	7287000	It's available from 6 AM to 7 PM Pacific, and the advice line will be available at,
7287000	7294000	I guess I can give the number out, area code 425-885-7529.
7294000	7296000	So, the advice line is coming back.
7296000	7300000	However, there's a catch, it's fully automated.
7300000	7302000	You won't be speaking to anybody live.
7302000	7310000	You'll get recorded tips for several games and behind the scenes stories from original Nintendo gameplay counselors.
7310000	7316000	So, unfortunately, no, they're not bringing in temps to get overwhelmed with questions for three days.
7316000	7319000	To try to find the answer in a binder somewhere.
7319000	7322000	They are going to just do recorded things to try to...
7322000	7325000	Hold on, let me type that into Game Facts to see if...
7325000	7328000	But at least it doesn't seem like it'll be 99 cents a minute.
7328000	7329000	At least there's that.
7329000	7334000	There, there, I guess, and now that we live in the age of cell phones that,
7334000	7339000	I don't know anybody that has a cell phone that charges long distance for calling a different area code this day and age.
7339000	7343000	So, I mean, I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that are just calling that for the lulz.
7343000	7345000	So, we'll see.
7345000	7347000	Anyway, check that out.
7347000	7349000	By the way, also, some other events going on.
7349000	7351000	The official Nintendo Store in New York.
7351000	7354000	There's going to be a retro 80s-themed launch event.
7354000	7358000	The first 250 visitors are going to be able to play classic NES games,
7358000	7360000	participate in a costume contest,
7360000	7364000	and show off their NES knowledge in a retro Nintendo game show.
7364000	7367000	Is Rama going to go as Luigi?
7367000	7369000	Like, tell me that's happening.
7369000	7372000	Hopefully he can swing, I don't know what his schedule's like, but hopefully he can swing that.
7372000	7374000	So, there it goes.
7374000	7378000	That is launching on November 11th, which is Friday, right?
7378000	7380000	That's Veterans Day.
7380000	7382000	I guess so, yeah.
7382000	7384000	Wait, am I, no.
7384000	7386000	Am I timing there? Yeah, 11th is Friday.
7386000	7388000	It's Veterans Day, or Veterans Day Observed is on the 11th.
7388000	7390000	So, cool.
7390000	7392000	Alright.
7392000	7394000	We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.
7394000	7396000	It's that time. Orange Lounge Radio.
7396000	7399000	All one word on Skype if you would like to give us a call.
7399000	7403000	And talk about anything we've talked about on the show so far tonight,
7403000	7407000	or perhaps there's something we haven't discussed yet that you'd like us to bring up.
7407000	7409000	Skype line is open now.
7409000	7412000	While we wait for any calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
7412000	7414000	No, I was just taking a look at some of these.
7414000	7418000	They have some pins some guy made that are mashups between Simpsons and Pokemon.
7418000	7420000	They're fucking awesome.
7420000	7422000	Wait, they're pins?
7422000	7423000	They're pins.
7423000	7425000	Is that like an Etsy thing, or what is this?
7425000	7427000	I don't know, but it looks cool though.
7427000	7429000	Cool stuff. It's just on Reddit.
7429000	7431000	Okay. That's pretty cool.
7431000	7434000	Again, and I'm not going to keep this open long.
7434000	7437000	If nobody calls, then I'm going to say screw it.
7437000	7441000	I'm going back to sleep because I'm fighting this cold.
7441000	7445000	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.
7445000	7450000	Kaijuto says, calling that Nintendo power number back in the day was so cool.
7450000	7451000	We are getting calls.
7451000	7453000	Oh, my threat apparently paid off because now we're getting calls.
7453000	7455000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7457000	7461000	Hola, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7461000	7463000	Hello?
7463000	7468000	This is a caller that calls in an awful lot to the show, and the audio usually works.
7468000	7472000	I don't know what's up, buddy. If you can hear me, I can't hear you.
7472000	7478000	So, give it the good old Echo 123, turn it off and then on again, and give us a call back.
7478000	7480000	So, we'll try that again.
7480000	7483000	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.
7483000	7485000	Yeah, it sounded like a muted mic or something like that.
7485000	7487000	I don't know what was up with that.
7487000	7490000	So, we'll just wait for them to call back.
7490000	7493000	Oh, somebody else is beating them to it, getting back in here.
7493000	7496000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7496000	7497000	Hey, this is Act F.
7497000	7499000	Okay, good. I know it's not our end.
7499000	7501000	Hi, Act F. How are you, buddy?
7501000	7502000	Really great, really great.
7502000	7504000	What's in your mind tonight?
7504000	7505000	Pokemon Go.
7505000	7507000	Ah, how are you enjoying it?
7507000	7513000	Well, I've been playing daily, so I pretty much enjoy it all the time.
7513000	7515000	It's what I play the most.
7515000	7519000	I've been playing it more now, probably, than when it first launched.
7519000	7527000	Well, I actually haven't stopped, so yeah, my experience with it hasn't decreased or...
7527000	7529000	Well, it has increased, so yeah.
7529000	7530000	Yeah.
7531000	7538000	Well, yeah, we were talking about it in chat a little bit earlier. You mentioned it.
7538000	7544000	Yeah, the subreddit for Pokemon Go, it's full of complaints right now.
7544000	7547000	Now what are they complaining about, dare I ask?
7551000	7552000	Hello?
7552000	7553000	Hello?
7555000	7563000	Oh, oh, we just, okay, here in studio, we just lost the entire internet somehow, which caused us to lose the call.
7563000	7570000	And I got that message on the computer that said a local network cable is unplugged, which means we lost the entire internet for a moment there.
7570000	7572000	Well, I saw the lights flicker, so I wonder if it was like a...
7572000	7574000	Oh, do we maybe have a power surge for a minute?
7574000	7577000	Yeah, because I did see that light turn off and turn back on again.
7577000	7585000	Well, thank God we didn't just lose the entire recording there, because y'all know I still don't have one of those little emergency brick things.
7585000	7589000	So, we lost that call.
7589000	7590000	I guess that's it.
7590000	7593000	Well, let me see, nope, we're getting it back. I think it's coming back.
7593000	7594000	Hello, are you there?
7594000	7596000	Hello again.
7596000	7598000	Hi, we had a power surge or something weird happened.
7598000	7600000	So, sorry about that, buddy.
7600000	7608000	So, where did we leave off? You were talking about Pokemon Go, and that you've been playing it pretty steady.
7608000	7612000	Oh, we were talking about the Reddit, and what is their complaint now on Reddit?
7612000	7624000	Well, I was talking about the client update, and it has something that many people are complaining about.
7624000	7639000	It's the speed limit, and it has been affecting people for the last month or so, because if you go over 30 miles, I think, or 25 miles, I cannot remember right now.
7639000	7646000	You cannot see Pokemon either on your tracker, or even those that spawn.
7647000	7654000	With this latest update, you cannot use PokeStops if you're going over that certain mileage.
7654000	7660000	Oh, ouch. Okay, so now people can't hack the gear as fast anymore.
7660000	7671000	Well, it was that way in Ingress. You can't hack portals if you go any faster. It's 35 miles an hour, which actually, or it's about 35 miles an hour.
7671000	7673000	That's not entirely true, but yeah.
7673000	7682000	Well, it is and it isn't. Here's the thing. It has to be, the game doesn't necessarily know where all the legal roads are.
7682000	7692000	So the distance between the two portals that you hack, the game can't think it took you more than 30, that you were going more than 35 miles an hour to get between the two of them, if that makes sense.
7692000	7693000	And it's an average speed.
7693000	7694000	Yeah, it's basically like an average speed.
7694000	7708000	See, Pokemon Go works by basically, it pings where you are every few seconds, or not even every few seconds, every second or so, and then it calculates your speed that way, whereas Ingress, it calculates it based on your last action.
7708000	7721000	So if you either charge a portal or you hack something, that's where it counts it, and then when you do it again, it calculates the time it took you based off the distance, and then it tries to estimate your speed.
7722000	7732000	But I mean, I understand that people are probably irritated because they can't just drive through downtown and hack everything in sight anymore, but I don't know.
7732000	7740000	I mean, I can also understand why they want to put this in here for safety reasons, although it certainly sucks if you're the passenger, especially if you're on a train or a bus.
7741000	7752000	Yeah, it kind of sucks. I do kind of understand the complaints and all, but really, the subreddit is going like crazy complaints. Like, fuck.
7752000	7763000	You cannot read that subreddit because it's like really a downer, and I don't understand how many people get upset like that.
7764000	7773000	Yeah, if you're a passenger, it sucks, but the game pretty much states that you have to walk. You have to go out there, walk, and do all that stuff.
7773000	7780000	Let's see, I'm looking. Since you don't want to read PokemonGo's Reddit, I will. I will right now. Let's see, we have,
7780000	7788000	What the actual hell is Niantic doing with their PokeStop speed cap? I am so confused as to why they try so hard to kill their own game.
7789000	7794000	Well, I mean, could some of this be due to some of the lawsuits they were getting, too? I mean, think about that.
7794000	7800000	I mean, if somebody got in a car accident and blamed PokemonGo, which I seem to recall was in the news the week this game came out.
7800000	7804000	You can't blame PokemonGo. You can blame yourself for violating, you know, cell phone laws.
7804000	7805000	That's right.
7805000	7807000	Yeah, but people are stupid, so.
7807000	7815000	That's right. Let's see, final nail in the coffin. Oh, friendly reminder to Niantic that not everyone lives in San Fran.
7815000	7821000	Yeah, they expanded the whole San Francisco thing out to, here's the hilarious thing.
7821000	7831000	Okay, so the new range thing, the new scanner thing works outside the Bay Area. It's the extended Bay Area now, right?
7831000	7840000	So that will work in Davis. It will not work here in Sacramento, which is literally on the other side of the river.
7840000	7844000	So we're like the cutoff point for where that thing no longer works.
7844000	7851000	Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It also works in some parts of Arizona, which I don't know which parts. I didn't ask my buddy in Tucson if he sees it.
7851000	7852000	The Bay Area parts.
7852000	7855000	And Seattle has it now, too.
7855000	7859000	Well, at least they are rolling out to other places.
7859000	7861000	Yeah, at least they're rolling out to other places.
7861000	7866000	I imagine that it's going to be like, oh, we're gonna do it first, like, in the US, maybe Japan.
7866000	7873000	But I live in Mexico, and I don't see how or when I'm gonna get that tracker.
7873000	7879000	This has been a frickin' slow process, and they kinda need to get on it, like, you know.
7879000	7887000	And, you know, if you listen to Pokestop Podcast, Shane is very adamant about the fact that the original tracker was the best.
7887000	7890000	And that's the one they need to bring back, was the whole hot and cold game.
7890000	7896000	And so, you know, the game kinda lost something when it lost that. So, you know, and it's a fair criticism.
7896000	7902000	Yeah, it's criticism and all that, but some take it way too far.
7902000	7903000	Anyway.
7903000	7907000	Even then, because, let me continue just a bit.
7907000	7921000	Because with the new update, I don't know if you read it all, or read it all, the gym thing where you can get sniped from other people.
7921000	7922000	Right.
7922000	7928000	If you take down the gym and other people just can pretty much put their Pokemon and you're screwed.
7928000	7930000	Yeah, they fixed that, right?
7930000	7940000	Yeah, they fixed that. If you take down the gym or the gym leader, only you can put another Pokemon on the gym.
7940000	7949000	So, yeah, Niantic finally did something great. They're doing some really great things right now with Pokemon Go.
7949000	7950000	Yeah.
7950000	7954000	And people also need to see that, that they're actually listening to us.
7955000	7963000	If it's anything like Ingress, the game that people are playing in Pokemon Go in a year won't look anything like the game that it was originally.
7963000	7967000	And I remember Ingress from the early, like, beta years.
7967000	7968000	Yeah.
7968000	7975000	Well, beta game, like, and I played it recently before Pokemon Go and it's a completely whole new game.
7975000	7982000	Yeah, it's different. And there's big rumors, big, big rumors that an Ingress 2.0 is coming soon.
7982000	7986000	So, we'll see. Because that would be a big deal.
7986000	7992000	They're thinking that Ingress is going to get updated graphics, kind of like what Pokemon Go has.
7992000	7995000	And maybe some other stuff to go with that. So, we'll see.
7995000	7999000	That would be nice. I know lots of people that still play Ingress, so.
7999000	8000000	Yeah.
8000000	8002000	They'll be really happy about this.
8002000	8008000	I still play as well, but, you know, I'm kind of getting to the point where I don't know if I want to say I'm burned out.
8008000	8013000	Because I still like a lot of the social stuff, but it's just, I'm just, I'm ready to play other games.
8013000	8019000	Like, it's just like, I played Warcraft fucking Pedal to the Metal for like four or five years.
8019000	8023000	And then I just kind of burned out on it. And I think that's, I'm starting to kind of get there with Ingress.
8023000	8028000	Which I'm sure if any of our local competition is listening to the show, they will be thrilled to hear that.
8028000	8033000	But, you know, I think it just happens with games. Sometimes you're sick of playing.
8033000	8034000	But I still like the social stuff.
8034000	8035000	Yeah.
8035000	8036000	So.
8036000	8042000	Yeah, I did get burned out on Ingress, like, really. Well, not fast, but, yeah.
8042000	8049000	After Pokemon Go started, and I didn't, like, have any interest for Ingress after that.
8049000	8051000	But, yeah.
8051000	8056000	But if some of my friends are like, hey, come down to this bar and, by the way, we might frack a portal there.
8056000	8059000	I'm going to be like, alright, cool, I'll drop an eight. I'll open the game to do that for you.
8059000	8062000	You know, it's that type of thing. I like the social stuff still.
8062000	8064000	Yeah.
8064000	8067000	Alright. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can try to sneak in one or two more calls.
8067000	8069000	Thanks for the call, okay?
8069000	8070000	Hey, thanks for having me.
8070000	8072000	Yep. Take care.
8072000	8075000	Alright, let's see if we can sneak in this one other call here.
8075000	8077000	Hello, you're on Orange Dogs Radio. Who's this?
8077000	8078000	Hey, it's Ron.
8078000	8080000	Hey, fixed your mic. What's up, buddy?
8080000	8084000	Yeah, I had to unplug the mixer and plug it back in so it'd kind of reset itself.
8084000	8087000	Uh-huh. So you did have to, you had to turn it off and then on again.
8087000	8089000	Something along those lines.
8089000	8091000	What's on your mind, my friend?
8091000	8103000	I just want you to know, I was on the other side of my little small studio apartment being a responsible adult for once in my life, folding my clothes for my laundry.
8103000	8104000	Good job.
8104000	8113000	Thank you. And I hear you say something about me having to make an appearance as Luigi somewhere in New York City, so what's going on now?
8113000	8115000	You just called in to get more information?
8115000	8116000	Yes.
8116000	8124000	So the Nintendo Store in New York is doing a launch event for that mini Nintendo on November 11th is the launch.
8124000	8134000	I don't know when the launch event is, but they're saying the first 250 visitors will be able to play the classic NES games and participate in a costume contest dressed as their favorite Nintendo character.
8134000	8143000	So I don't know if that's like a midnight launch or if that's like when the store opens or something, so you're gonna have to look into that, but it's for the mini NES.
8143000	8151000	Well, you know, I am going away this weekend, but I think I could fit that in on a Friday, see if I could do it.
8151000	8153000	There you go. You can pencil it in.
8153000	8159000	If the timing is right, I may have to show up as Luigi from Super Mario Brothers Super Show.
8159000	8161000	I love it.
8161000	8170000	Well, I did do that version, you know, for a couple of conventions, and I did buy some more tools, so you know, gotta add to the tool belt, you know?
8171000	8174000	Uh, yeah. Where are you going this weekend?
8174000	8178000	I'm visiting a friend upstate New York.
8178000	8181000	Oh, okay. I thought it was a convention. Sorry, I didn't know.
8181000	8191000	Uh, no, no, no. I have one more convention on my list, and that's if I can get into it. If I can get in, I'll be going. If not, you'll only be seeing me at MAGFest.
8191000	8193000	Oh, you are going to MAGFest?
8193000	8197000	If everything falls according to plan, I will be at MAGFest.
8197000	8199000	Yay, I'm excited.
8199000	8209000	Oh, yeah. The main reason is, I will be breaking out one of my favorite cosplays I haven't worn in a very long time, so I've been looking for a reason to wear that one again.
8209000	8220000	SSJ100Matt says, again, isn't Exeterfer going to be in New York City next weekend? Oh, is it that soon? It's whenever GamerX East is. He's going out there for that. So, wow, that's great.
8220000	8224000	You know what's interesting about GamerX East? Do you know where it's being held at?
8224000	8227000	Yeah, it's like at Microsoft's office or something.
8227000	8231000	Yep, right on 42nd Street on the 5th floor, if I'm not mistaken.
8231000	8245000	Yeah, they're converting conference rooms and stuff into what this is going to be. That's why, apparently, you cannot get tickets at the door. You will have to get tickets in advance, because it's going to be kind of locked down to people who only have the tickets, basically.
8245000	8254000	Yeah, pretty much. Before I started working for the company, I was there a couple of times previously for a couple of independent gaming events, so it's pretty nice.
8254000	8262000	And I already told Exeterfer to keep in touch with me, that way I can drag him around to some cool spots in the city.
8262000	8264000	Awesome. I know you'll take good care of him.
8264000	8269000	Alright, but one thing, though. Do I have to take him to the West Village?
8270000	8287000	That's up to him. I don't know if he's really super into that type of stuff. I think he has to go to where Christopher Street and Gay Street meet. If he doesn't go there, I don't know why the fuck he got on a plane.
8287000	8297000	Okay, I think we can arrange that. I'll take a picture and I'll post it to somebody's Facebook or Twitter so you can put your seal of approval on it.
8297000	8302000	Perfect, perfect. How can he go and not get that picture? He has to.
8302000	8306000	Well, you do realize if this happens, you have to do the same thing, too, mister.
8306000	8317000	I did when I was there in 2006, because I sent it to him. I took a picture there and I showed it to him. I said I took that picture for you.
8317000	8321000	Ah, so, turnabout's fair play.
8321000	8328000	Exactly, exactly. Alright, my friend. I'm going to let you go, but if you end up going to the event this week, be sure to let us know how it was.
8328000	8333000	I will be posting pictures. I'll have a battery with me. I'll try to do a livestream or something. We'll figure something out.
8333000	8335000	Sounds good, my friend. Take care.
8335000	8336000	You, too.
8336000	8345000	Alright, bye-bye. Alright, and I think that is going to do it for the calls. Those are the two folks I saw trying to get in there. I think I am going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
8345000	8351000	Sorry if you didn't get through, but please consider sending us an email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
8351000	8361000	But for now, I've about hit my limit for how much I can talk with still being this sinus cold is still horrible and I need to rest up so I can get back to work tomorrow.
8361000	8365000	But thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to the show. Really appreciate it.
8365000	8371000	Again, as a reminder, we will not be here live next week. There will be no new show on the feed next week.
8371000	8385000	However, we will have a show on the feed. I'm thinking Wednesday the 16th, I think is the date, there will be a show on the feed, episode 665.
8385000	8394000	And then we will be back live on 20 November with episode 666 of Orange Lounge Radio. So that will be our next live show.
8394000	8400000	Thank you so much for tuning in and supporting our show. If you like what you heard, please consider leaving us a review on a site like iTunes.
8400000	8406000	A nice 5 star review goes a very, very, very long way in helping us out. So we really appreciate that.
8406000	8410000	We don't ask for your money. We just ask you to tell a friend or five about the show.
8410000	8419000	Otherwise, time for final thoughts. And my final thought is I'm ready to edit the show and then lie down and take a nap or something.
8419000	8424000	It's going to be more than a nap at this point. And then face the day tomorrow. Loki, your final thought tonight?
8425000	8429000	I don't know. I'm deciding where I'm going to drive tonight.
8429000	8438000	Alright, well I hope it's a good drive. And that's it. Have a good night everybody. We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Bye bye.
