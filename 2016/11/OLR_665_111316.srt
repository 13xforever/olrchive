Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This week we're doing the Time Warp back to 2006 when Nintendo's hottest new console was nowhere to be found, the NES Classic Edition. Also, OLR was only 4 years old back then. Stay tuned for more news from a now-teenaged OLR right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and Time Warp indeed. We are not live tonight with episode number 665 of our show.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For this, a special Wednesday edition, November the 16th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me once again, reunited without the use of radio magic and it feels so good, say hello to DarkSakura or Tami Summers.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're definitely Time Warping back to 1938, 1939.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, I know there's a lot on everybody's mind this week, but we're just going to try to play some video games instead.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If I could live in several different video game worlds, I would be pleased.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Which world would you want to live in? I think, even though I'll probably get a lot of crap from Shane for this answer because I don't know enough about it according to him, I would want to live in the world of Pokemon. I would. What world would you want to live in? Video game world.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's actually pretty hard to say. I mean, because, I mean, maybe like a hundred years pre Reaper Mass Effect, maybe, you know.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So you have a nice, a chance to live a nice life.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I can die before that's done, you know.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A nice full life before, yeah, that all starts.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Or, or even I would say maybe post Inquisition Dragon Age.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see BioWare fangirl to the very end.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, maybe. Or I would just be a nice barmaid on Azeroth.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That works too.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I would be the barmage.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Would you, would you, would you work at the Goldshire Inn on the Moon Guard server?

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, because it has those fucking creepy kids. You know what I'm talking about.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I do. I know what you're talking about.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh my God.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Alright, welcome back. Sorry, I got to do some audio adjustment on the fly for Dark Soccer because it's been so long since you've been here live. We've missed you.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But welcome back. Quickly, how has your gaming month been?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What is up with my mic?

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's just super sensitive tonight.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, it's actually like weird.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, it's like falling apart in there or something?

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Maybe. Hi, Mike. I'm nice to you, pet, pet, pet.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We'll figure that out. Just don't swing it around too much. We'll, we'll operate on it.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll swing my thing where I wanna.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, I'm, it's been interesting because I've had some voice problems.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And, which I sound okay right now, but.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you? No, you sound fine.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Girl. So, but like I'm on like a big work restriction where like I have to spend 10 minutes every hour just not talking.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And it's, it's made my life interesting. It's made me learn to listen a lot more.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Interesting. Alright.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So forced silence. Everyone should try it.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, I hope you feel better.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And don't, you know, it's, it's great to have you back here on the show though, where luckily since we have several people to share the responsibility here, you don't have to talk nonstop for an hour, which is nice.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're, you're no Bobby Black Wolf, but I would encourage you to join us sometime.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm glad, he's hairy.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I would encourage you, encourage you all to join. What's wrong with that?

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Until Dan, I was going to shave him.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I mean, like shave his back.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Alright, anyway.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just to see if he would notice, like if he woke up with no hair on his back.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:58,000
OMG. Anyway, you can usually listen to us live Sunday nights, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com immediately after the very handsome Bobby Black Wolf and his show, which you're on.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He is handsome.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But we're not live this week. As mentioned on the show previously, I was out of town last week over the weekend.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we're giving you this kind of podcast only special bonus show.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Usually I would introduce about now Techmaster Loki, but sadly, Loki couldn't be here tonight.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And, you know, as tempting as it is to make a joke about can Loki and Jamie be in the same room right now?

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Like what's going on?

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Actually, Loki had a family emergency he has to deal with. He had to bow out this morning.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So our thoughts are with what's going on.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was just going to say reasons.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't want to, you know, it's not my place to disclose.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He's fine. Wife's fine. Kids are fine. It's something else.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's all I can really say.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Reasons.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So hopefully he'll be back Sunday.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I would really be sad if he missed a huge landmark episode like Sunday Show, which is episode 666.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
However, the reality is real life first, family first. We all know that.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So fingers crossed and all that stuff.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
However, joining us in studio at last minute notice, which I really appreciate.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Say hello, everybody, to somebody else who we haven't heard from in a while on this show due to work

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and the environment and place where he works. It's Alan is back.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hello.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hi, Alan. No, not Shane. It's Alan.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, right.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How are you, Alan?

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm good.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Good. Happy that the elections are over since you work in that polling and all that stuff?

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes. So.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm happy that the election is over because of my work schedule, not for any other reason.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right, right. I wasn't trying to set you up for anything there, but it's nice to have you.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's nice to have you back on the show this week.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So you're going to help step in and do some of the stories that Loki was going to do for us tonight.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And how's life been treating you recently?

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah. Oh, let me ask the question that came up with Dark Soccer and myself at the top of the show.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you had to live in any video game world, what video game world would you want to live in?

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Possibly Skyrim.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's fresh on my mind and the version of the game that I had before the special edition, all the dudes were basically like naked.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like they were technically wearing uniforms, but.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So you don't want to live in Skyrim. You want to live in modded Skyrim.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Absolutely.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Alan Alchemy's head cannon Skyrim.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Do you have the Skyrim where the dragons come out to the Macho Man song?

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Because they have Macho Man's face.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I thought it came, but they actually came out to the Village People's song.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Instead of roaring, it would say, oh, yeah.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, okay. I thought it actually came out to the song.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There was also a Tommy the Tank Engine mod.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, that's right.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is that a part of your Skyrim head cannon?

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because I would want to, oh.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The world of Skyrim is pretty brutal. You got to have something to lighten it up a little bit.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's why you roll cabbages down the hill.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I could probably mod it. I could probably find a mod to put like Taco Bell in it or something.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There you go. No, that would be Shane's Skyrim head cannon.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It would be the Taco Bell in every village.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What about what Jamie's suggesting, the 5,000 cabbages rolling off a hill?

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Is that something that would exist in your Skyrim world?

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It could.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, because if you have access to console, that means basically you're God, so.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, okay.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I would also want to live in Rezworld because it would mean that I was high as balls.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is that from watching me play Rez the other night on PlayStation 4?

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Or you were playing Rez with the headphones on, which is the cruelest thing that you could do.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Because of that incredible music. And I'm like, ooh, he's playing Rez and I can't hear a damn thing.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's more selfish. Let's get it right. It's more selfish because I wanted to be surrounded.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I wanted to be cocooned like Jasmine Masters in the experience of Rez.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But it was selfish because I wasn't going to share that with you by putting it to myself.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You weren't willfully inconsiderate. It was just a symptom of the true reason.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All right. Anyway, we'll get into our gaming weeks a little more specifically in a little bit.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We don't have a chat room tonight, sadly. Usually I would plug our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But again, we will be back on 20 November with episode number 666 of our show live.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So if for some interesting reason this is your first episode of Orange Lawns Radio,

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I realize this episode's a little different because we actually don't have the live thing going on.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But we wanted to do something a little bit special. We don't like missing shows.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I will mention real quick before we get into our kickoff topic, I did spend the weekend in Chicago.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I didn't get to spend a lot of time there, so it's not like I could meet up with all these different people and so forth.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I wasn't really there for a gaming convention or anything like that.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Although I was there, well, I don't like to say I went to play Ingress because that wasn't the sole reason I went.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I went to Chicago to visit Chicago and Ingress was a good excuse to have something to do while I'm there.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But it was really about visiting my friends that were out there.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I have some friends out there, several of the hosts of a show that used to be around Koopa Club live there.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And we became friends through the podcasting community and all that stuff.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I was able to hang out with them and just really get to see Chicago.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And I had a great time. It was a fun city.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You really need to go, Alan. Next time, we'll go when there's not an election happening.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And I think you'd enjoy Chicago a lot.

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's go like early February. Just like the worst part of winter.

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Not during the winter. That's the one thing. I love Chicago, but I don't love the winters there.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That airport is cursed because you briefly had a scare.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Everybody gets delayed at O'Hare.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And actually, I learned that for transit, it's honestly easier to do Midway.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So, note to self.

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The weather there is really Bucky.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Bucky O'Hare.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Anyway, didn't really do a lot of gaming in the city.

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Didn't do a round one or a Dave and Buster's.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I mean, it was just Ingress.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I've talked ad nauseam about that game and so has Loki.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So I don't know what else I want to say about the event.

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We lost. I mean, that was that.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But I had a good time. It's not really about winning or losing because it was just meeting people.

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I met people from all over the country and had a really good time.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, yeah, I really found a lot to love in Chicago.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You got to eat pizza flavored casserole. So that was good.

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes. Yes.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That is authentic deep dish pizza. It was amazing.

172
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They took me to a place in Chicago called Cheesy's, which like everything on the menu is like super cheese.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Like I had a grilled cheese sandwich, but instead of just grilled cheese, it actually had mac and cheese in it.

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I knew it was going to make me sick, but actually it didn't.

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I did very well. I was ready for it mentally.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Prepared. Anyway.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
All right. Enough about food.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's get into video games.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Although I suppose snacky foods like mac and cheese go hand in hand with games sometimes.

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And things from the past, which is our kickoff topic tonight.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So a lot of the stories we're going to focus on this week are things that have come up kind of in the last week.

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And then on our next live episode, we'll focus more on the stuff this week.

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But obviously this is a big story that kind of continues to go on is the release of the NES classic, the miniature NES.

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Right. And, you know, we've talked about this on the show before leading up to this, but these retro consoles have been doing very well.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Like Atari has had a new one.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I think they're up to what, like flashback seven or something.

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
They've had a new little Atari on the shelf every year.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It seems like of some type of flashback console Coleco.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There's one out there in television.

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Sega is really big on these now too, right?

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like a target, you can get a Genesis or a handheld, but they didn't call it.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They didn't name it after the Sega handheld.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They just have like a handheld Genesis that you can get too.

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, now Nintendo's getting in on this action.

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And since there's not really a lot going on for Wii U this holiday,

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
granted 3DS has Pokemon, there's not a lot going on on Wii U.

197
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is kind of Nintendo's big thing for the holiday.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And it was released on Friday and it pretty much sold out instantly everywhere.

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like most Nintendo things tend to do these days, it seems.

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Jason mentioned in the intro there, the Wii had this problem, right? Big time.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If you weren't camping outside back in 2006.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Remember 2006 Dark Soccer when we traveled around to all the lines?

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What was it we gave out?

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Orange soda as promo for the show. Some cheesy thing. Donuts.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Donuts is part of it. Maybe coffee.

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I know that Kristin and I bribed our way into the Wii line with donuts and coffee.

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, they were great. It was just Kristin.

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Maisie wasn't here for that, right? It was just Kristin.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But she was great in helping us go around and all that.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, I just had a great time.

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Anyway, so there was that with the Wii.

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And then with the Wii U, there was lowered supply.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It was a little harder to find, but I think because the demand for the Wii U wasn't as high,

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
it wasn't as big a problem. Just kind of depended where you were.

215
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I remember when you got your Wii U, it was a week or two after release,

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and you said, I'm going to open up the Target app.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No, it was the day of. It was the day of.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, it was the day of.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But it wasn't like 6 a.m. camping out front.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It was like after brunch.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, we were out eating and you're like, I'm going to check the Target app,

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
we can find one within 30 minutes drive that just has one, I'm going to get it.

223
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And they had like three of them.

224
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, they did. So I ended up getting it.

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So it wasn't as bad, but then Amiibo was a fucking nightmare.

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So this has a lot of people asking, why can't Nintendo figure out this supply and demand thing?

227
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And are they doing it on purpose?

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And this question was asked around the time that Amiibo were launched.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is Nintendo doing this on purpose?

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Are they driving it up or are they, I guess, artificially, maybe in some way making demand

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
so that this becomes the hot must-have Christmas item that news stations are going to report on to get this thing more coverage?

232
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What do you think, Alan?

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you think Nintendo is doing this on purpose?

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Or do you think Nintendo really just doesn't understand that there is an audience for this stuff?

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I would say that it's on purpose.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, I think it's calculated.

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think they will figure out how many they think will sell and then kind of do exactly that amount

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
or maybe scale it down a little just so that it's like all profit.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Like they just move every single unit and they just be like, we'll catch up later.

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What about you, Dark Soccer? You like to collect collectibles.

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What are your thoughts on the mini NES or classic NES, whatever they're calling it?

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is this something you and Dan are interested in or?

243
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We talked about it, but we have, I think we do have all of those games.

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You have the real thing.

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And we also have an EverDrive.

246
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I just wanted it to sit on my desk because it's cute.

247
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I mean, you wanted it as a prop.

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I wanted it as a prop.

249
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
As a paperweight.

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We discussed that the big problem with it has to do with the length of the wires on the controller.

251
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes.

252
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And that they're hardwired in.

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It must be for like college kids in a dorm room because you have to play the thing on your lap.

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Like it's crazy.

255
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, I'm thinking it's designed for an office.

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's not designed for your living room. It's designed for your office.

257
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That's my thought.

258
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But look at the length of the ones on the original Famicom.

259
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
They were also hardwired in and pretty short.

260
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So.

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I guess that's true.

263
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's just, it's weird though that it won't support like wireless through the Wiimotes or something.

264
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's just, it's some of the, some of the decisions are really baffling sometimes.

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah.

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like the thing that gets me, here's the thing.

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I talked about this when the mini NES first came out is that I kind of felt like I don't need one

268
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
because we already have virtual console on the Wii and the Wii U.

269
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So, I mean, what is this thing?

270
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's just basically virtual console with 30 preloaded games that will never change.

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
At least that's what they say.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And I don't think that thing suddenly has internet capabilities in it.

273
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So I'm pretty certain that they're going to keep it at just the 30 games that are with it.

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's a power AC plug and HDMI.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's it.

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's it.

277
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But then I heard that, well, the emulation in these things is actually supposedly better.

278
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The picture quality is going to be better than what you get on the Wii U and the Wii.

279
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And to be honest, I don't know why, but that actually like it really bothers me that that's the case.

280
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Because I'm kind of like, you can't be asked then to patch that into the Wii U,

281
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
give me that same software in the Wii U, whatever you're running on that $60 device,

282
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
put in my $250 device that I spent $5 a game for NES on,

283
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
whereas this other thing is $2 a game.

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't know. There's a part of me that's just really irritated with this thing.

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But then of course there's the half of me that's like Jamie where I'm like,

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
but it is really cute and I kind of want one for that reason.

287
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But I don't know. It would be a hate purchase. I'd hate myself after buying it.

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If you're a Nintendo fan, I think the code of life you live by is fool me once, shame on me,

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
fool me 20 times, yay Nintendo!

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's so true though! Nintendo always gets a pass on this.

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And like, when are we going to draw the line?

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Like how many times have the people listening bought Link to the Past?

293
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Probably six or seven.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I'm honestly probably included in that.

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't wait to buy a Zelda game. Which one? Oh, the old ones again and again.

296
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Just buy them forever.

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't know. I know people have been buying them and they've been having a great time with them.

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And it is a really solid collection of games that's in it.

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And to be fair, if you're not stocking up on virtual console games on Wii and Wii U,

300
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
it is only $2 a game versus $5 a game.

301
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So in that regard, it's a pretty sweet deal.

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So like, I get it. I'm not knocking it.

303
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But I'm just, I'm kind of irritated that Nintendo's got one thing going on over here

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and they got another going on in the Wii U.

305
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And you fucking know. You know when that Switch comes out, they're gonna make you buy them again.

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Now, I can only hope, fingers crossed, toes crossed,

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that Nintendo's gonna do something like their upgrade program from Wii to Wii U

308
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
where it only costs a dollar or whatever it is.

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Hopefully they do something similar for the Switch.

310
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But then my question is, well, but what about the ones that we bought on the 3DS?

311
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Because now you've got two ecosystems becoming one,

312
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
although Nintendo says the 3DS is still separate, blah, blah, blah.

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You guys all know I don't believe that.

314
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The fact that it was a dollar upgrade is still shady as hell,

315
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but because that's more than what we're used to from them.

316
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Because think about what Xbox does.

317
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I mean, they are porting the games piecemeal, but you're still getting them.

318
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That is very true.

319
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
At least I could justify the one dollar because it is a picture quality upgrade.

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You do have the fact that you can play it on the gamepad.

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You have just minor, minor features that, okay, a dollar is fine.

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But if I had to pay another five dollars, I would have been very, very upset.

323
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So I'm hoping Nintendo does something like that with the Switch,

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that at least they charge maybe a nominal fee.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But I don't know.

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Do they have a need to do Virtual Console

327
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
if now it's shown that the mini things can sell fine on their own?

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Does the Switch even need Virtual Console?

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I kind of think it'll have it anyway.

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I had that day off, and it was around three or four in the afternoon

331
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
when I realized, oh, that came out today,

332
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and I wanted to maybe just see, just like you in the Wii U,

333
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
if I could find one for the lulz.

334
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But by then, I had decided that it was already too late.

335
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Because between Walmart, GameStop, Target, Best Buy,

336
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
there are a lot of places where you could try to hunt the sucker down.

337
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But I think if I had that crazy notion at like 10 or 11 a.m.,

338
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I would have gone for it.

339
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But at 4 p.m., it was like, no, it's gone everywhere.

340
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah. No, and I understand. I understand.

341
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, I mean, and so it's one of those things where it's like,

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
well, maybe if I come into one sitting on the shelf somewhere,

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
maybe I'll buy it.

344
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But at the same time, I've spent enough money on gaming lately.

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Final Fantasy XV is out next week, or sorry, two weeks.

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I mean, Pokemon Sun and Moon is out this week.

347
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I mean, there's so much other stuff that's happening in gaming.

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't know if I'm going to pick up on that NES Classic thing right now.

349
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Maybe next year. Who knows?

350
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'd be very curious to see if they do a Volume 2

351
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
or what that's going to look like in 2017.

352
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But we'll see.

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Anyway, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks

354
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and what kind of video games have you been playing this week.

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Dark Sakura, it's been a while since we've heard of one of your gaming weeks.

356
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
How was your gaming week?

357
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Fuck.

358
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
A little bit of Dragon Age.

359
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
A little bit, actually a lot of WoW lately

360
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
because now I think I just hit 865, no, 856.

361
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It was the other way around.

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I honestly still don't know if that's good, but I could do Mythic, so whatever.

363
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I was playing some Animal Crossing, actually.

364
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, the Happy Home Designer.

365
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Danganronpa 2 because I've been playing just a little bit at a time.

366
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Have you gone back and checked out the major update to Animal Crossing 3DS

367
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
with the Amiibo support and the stuff?

368
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Apparently there's like 20 pieces of furniture

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
if you've done Happy Home Designer or something like that.

370
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Really?

371
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, make sure you check that out. If you missed that.

372
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I might have to move back into my village.

373
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh yeah, get your game card out and download the update

374
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
because they did a huge, even I checked that out this past week.

375
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Now there's RVs that show up and there's a whole new currency

376
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
you get for doing quests in Animal Crossing.

377
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, it was like a whole shit change, Joe.

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And they fucking cleaned up all your weeds.

379
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I know.

380
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Fuck.

381
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Isabelle was like, I hired a guy and they're gone.

382
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Isabelle, get shit done.

383
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Isabelle for president.

384
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I support that over plenty of other things.

385
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Over the orange Cheeto.

386
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

387
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Sorry, Cheeto Hitler. Sorry.

388
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Anyway.

389
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Anyway.

390
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
God, I played other stuff too.

391
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh yeah, Dan did an Extra Life marathon.

392
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So guess what the fuck I played?

393
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You guys were playing random shit.

394
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You had your Twitch thing going.

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I remember tuning in at one point.

396
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You guys were playing Street Fighter Alpha 2

397
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
on the Game Boy Advance through the GameCube thing or something.

398
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It was like random fucking shit you guys were playing.

399
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Dan was going for weirdness and then I busted out the Guardian Legend.

400
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And I hate to say I suck balls at it now.

401
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's hard.

402
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, a lot of these games we were good at when we were kids.

403
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We go back now and we're like, fuck, no wonder our parents sucked at these games.

404
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I got through, it took me four tries to get into the game.

405
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You know, you have that intro thing.

406
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And finally I felt like my skills were coming back.

407
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And then I kept dying on the first level and finally beat it

408
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
because I realized I forgot to go get the other weapons I needed.

409
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Right.

410
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And so, but it was just like, I bet if I sat and played and played,

411
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
but I found something actually that I had to use rubber grips

412
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
on the edge of the NES controller because of my wrist.

413
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And so it was interesting, but we also played, what else did I play?

414
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We actually had Fantasy Zone, the Tengen Fantasy Zone going on.

415
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Nice.

416
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
No, we played other things though.

417
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh yeah, Dan played through The Legend of Zelda.

418
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Just straight played through it.

419
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Nice. The original?

420
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah.

421
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Awesome.

422
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It only takes like, what, an hour?

423
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Did you guys raise any money for that?

424
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah, what about 250?

425
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, that's still really good.

426
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

427
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I don't remember you guys doing a lot of build up to that or anything.

428
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Is this really good?

429
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, Dan was just saying, oh, just get me this off.

430
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I was like, well, do you even have a Twitch channel?

431
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'll just use yours.

432
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That's fair.

433
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Okay.

434
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So, but yeah, the next thing I think investment list is.

435
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We have an Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channel,

436
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and I need to remember to go in and set that up so it auto hosts you, me, or Loki.

437
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't know if Loki has a Twitch.

438
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I think he does.

439
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I think he did something one time on it.

440
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I think he's like my stream from his PS4 or something.

441
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But I need to set it up so it's like you, me, Loki,

442
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
if any of us are ever streaming, it's on there.

443
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And then, you know, some friends of OLR too,

444
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
like Xtopher and Shane or something, you know, set up some of them.

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We used that Elgato thing.

446
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah. Oh yeah. I have one of those. It worked great.

447
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That Loki loaned us.

448
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh, I have like one of the cards in the computer now. Yeah.

449
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But it was like maybe a 20 second delay, but it wasn't terrible.

450
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And I'm thinking, I've actually been thinking about getting myself

451
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
a condenser mic anyway for stuff that we might record on the go.

452
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah, you should.

453
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I bet a lot of people would get a kick out of that if you did more

454
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
streaming.

455
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah, we'll see.

456
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Because I mean, other than that,

457
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
it's just going to be me streaming while going fuck this shit.

458
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Fuck that shit. Fuck you.

459
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, I am foul now, especially fouler on doing stupid.

460
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I mean, heroics are easy as balls now,

461
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
but doing anything that relates to Ayah Vajra, I will cuss.

462
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I will cut every bitch in that game in my head and I will not be nice

463
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
about it. I will cut them with syrup.

464
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
No, not even serrated because that would be too easy.

465
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I would cut them with spoons with little plastic Dairy Queen spoons

466
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and break every single one of them breaking into their faces because I

467
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
hate that dungeon so much.

468
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Is that the one with the big worm in the middle?

469
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yes.

470
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Oh, God, I hate that one.

471
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You want to know what, though, is stupid about that worm?

472
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's easier in Mythic and Heroic than it is in Regular.

473
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Interesting. I believe it. I believe it.

474
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Regulars are really oddly balanced. Really oddly balanced.

475
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Heroics are easy as balls. They're easier for me.

476
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah.

477
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And what's funny is that I didn't even realize that there was a hole

478
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
when I skipped over until I started doing randoms.

479
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And it was like the one where you fight like Helia on the ghost pirate ship.

480
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I don't think I ever did that one.

481
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I did a pug for it earlier today.

482
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And I said something that everyone just goes,

483
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh, my God, you're right. Like, if this is based off of Norse mythology,

484
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
why are they using pirate terminology instead of acting like fucking Vikings?

485
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And that was my WoW revelation of the day.

486
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's Warcraft. You have to suspend disbelief.

487
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, but it was still pretty just random epiphany.

488
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
They should be Vikings, not pirates.

489
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

490
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Uh, oh, yeah, I got really, really bored and played through and beat Regency Solitaire.

491
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That is very bored. You have to be really bored.

492
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Solitaire?

493
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It plays like the fairy solitaire, where it's kind of weird

494
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and you have to just match the numbers instead.

495
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Still, though.

496
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But Regency Solitaire, I was like, she has got to marry what's-as-fuck.

497
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And I even hate like...

498
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You were playing it for the plot, really?

499
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You were playing solitaire for the plot?

500
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I was that bored.

501
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But I mean, I was just like, oh, whatever.

502
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And then I was like, you know what, this actually is kind of a decent story.

503
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I mean, but I don't like like the Regency era, like, you know,

504
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Pride and Prejudice, not Pride and Prejudice, what am I thinking?

505
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Pride and Prejudice is zombies.

506
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
No, um, who was the writer? God, I can't think of her name now.

507
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Jane Austen?

508
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Jane Austen, yes. I was never a fan of Jane Austen.

509
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I mean, good writer.

510
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, I'm a big fan of Clueless, but that's about it.

511
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, but still, you know, it's not my era of classic literature.

512
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
All right, only you can take your gaming Wii to classic literature.

513
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
We're going to move on, if you're good to go.

514
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I reckon. Oh, yeah, Miitomo update.

515
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Eh, Miitomo update can kiss my butt.

516
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It blows my phone up at seven in the morning now.

517
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Well, you can turn off notifications.

518
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm yanking its privileges, that's for sure.

519
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But I like the sending messages and decorating my room.

520
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So now I have my Cullen poster and my Geras poster,

521
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and I have the European Guardian Legend poster,

522
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and I also have, like, some Danganronpa.

523
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'll have to come over and visit.

524
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Come visit.

525
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And steal your posters.

526
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
No.

527
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
All right.

528
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay, I'm good.

529
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Alan, how about you? How was your gaming Wii?

530
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What have you been playing?

531
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'll just rattle off, like, the last month or two.

532
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I was playing Overwatch to death forever and ever, hundreds of hours.

533
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Overwatch forever.

534
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Was? Have you broken up with Overwatch?

535
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I barely play around a day now.

536
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Really?

537
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
If even.

538
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Even with Sombra just coming out this week?

539
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's really hard to get her, because even in Quick Play now,

540
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
there's only one hero allowed per team, which I understand for balance,

541
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
that way people don't do stupid stuff like six Bastions or whatever.

542
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Okay, although the time we had six Torbjorn's, that was hilarious.

543
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah.

545
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But, yeah, I haven't really tried her yet,

546
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and I was spinning my wheels in the...

547
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Build them up, pick them down.

548
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I was spinning my wheels in the mud with the season two ranking.

549
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I was, I peaked at about 2,300, and then the last month or two,

550
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I've been just floating between 1,900, then I'll go up to 2,000,

551
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
get six really bad games in a row,

552
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
fall back down to 1,900, go back to 2,000, 1,900.

553
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So it's not fun.

554
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I was playing the hell out of Dark Souls 2.

555
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I did my anniversary run of Half-Life and Half-Life 2 in the episodes,

556
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
or rather Black Mesa, the remake.

557
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then Mortal Kombat X finally got acknowledged by Warner Brothers

558
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
or NetherRealm Studios for PC,

559
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
because they just didn't touch it for a year or a year and a half.

560
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So they came out with a huge quality patch

561
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and also the XL content with Alien and Predator and Leatherface,

562
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
so I played that.

563
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Then that made me go play story mode again in MK9 with Freddy Krueger.

564
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And now I'm back fully into Skyrim Special Edition.

565
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I knew that was a rabbit hole waiting for you to fall into.

566
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah.

567
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And a lot of the really complicated mods

568
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
depended on this third-party extender for the scripting program.

569
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Because there's a whole programming language, obviously,

570
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
with the creation kit that you can write in to make mods.

571
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Well, the extender that allows for much bigger scripts,

572
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
because it's a 64-bit program, that hasn't been made yet.

573
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So a lot of the mods are really pared down

574
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and gone back to their roots.

575
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's difficult for your save to get corrupted,

576
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
whereas before, if you uninstalled a mod

577
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and it left tons of scripts in your save and you didn't clean it,

578
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
you might have lost that career,

579
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
unless you put the mod back, and so on.

580
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So Special Edition is in this really neat Renaissance period

581
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
where all of these great mods are coming back,

582
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
but in a stripped-down version.

583
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The game runs great. It looks incredible.

584
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I put some really awesome screenshots on my Twitter today.

585
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah, it looks really good.

586
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'll look over my shoulder sometimes,

587
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and it looks really pretty on your computer.

588
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So I've got to get that installed on mine at some point.

589
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Use your Steam login or something to figure that out.

590
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
That'd be nice.

591
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But that's it.

592
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
All right. Awesome.

593
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I won't take up too much time.

594
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
No, don't worry about it.

595
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
My gaming week, I've been playing, you know,

596
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I hate to say it, but a lot of the same stuff.

597
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Still trucking along in Final Fantasy XIV,

598
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
although, you know, a lot of that now is just basically

599
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
grinding my later gear and getting the tomes and everything

600
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and trying to do the Wonder's Tales books every week,

601
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
even though the randomness of that could be really infuriating.

602
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Otherwise, I've actually been playing a little bit of Overwatch,

603
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
just casually.

604
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'll play a match or two a night, and that's still fun.

605
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I think I might finally break and get that on PlayStation 4

606
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
with some of the Black Friday deals,

607
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
just because I know so many people that play it on PlayStation 4.

608
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And I honestly feel like console might be better balanced for me.

609
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, I've heard that it plays almost completely different.

610
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, well, they had the free weekend a few weeks ago.

611
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Remember that?

612
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And I played that.

613
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yeah, that just happened, I think.

614
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Well, there's one coming up this weekend.

615
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Okay, that's what I'm thinking of.

616
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Except Pokemon's happening this weekend,

617
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
so, you know, there's a lot going on this weekend.

618
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But I probably will try it again, Overwatch,

619
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
because I also got a PlayStation 4 Pro,

620
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and Overwatch is one of the games that supports Pro.

621
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Now, I don't have a 4K TV,

622
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
so I fully expect that I'm not going to get a ton of stuff out of the Pro.

623
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Bring it to my house.

624
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I might.

625
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I also, I mean, it's a really tricky scenario,

626
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
because we just got this TV.

627
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I was going to say, not to reveal our business,

628
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
but you paid a nice chunk of change for the great TV we have,

629
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and then to find out,

630
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
oh, there are these three features that we don't have on this year-old TV.

631
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's cute.

632
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah, so that part kind of sucks, so I don't know.

633
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We have to kind of decide,

634
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
because Alan and I don't really have a need for a second TV,

635
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
so I have to kind of figure out, like, do we just sell that TV

636
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and try to, you know, cut our losses?

637
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What do we do?

638
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But for the meantime, I still, you know what?

639
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
There are some things with the Pro

640
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
that some games will run at 60 frames a second,

641
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
like Final Fantasy 15,

642
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and, you know, obviously there's going to be some support

643
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
of Mass Effect and Andromeda,

644
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
so I still kind of want to get it.

645
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I kind of looked at it as getting a video card,

646
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
because I'm selling my PlayStation 4,

647
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
so I'm recouping some of the cost back.

648
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So it's like upgrading your video card.

649
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's kind of what I looked at it as in getting the Pro.

650
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So, but anyway, I still want to check out Overwatch,

651
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
because I want to see, you know,

652
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
just how that feels on PlayStation 4, you know, with that,

653
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
although I anticipate it's not going to be that much different,

654
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
but I'm excited to, like, try Sombra,

655
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
although I have the same problem as you.

656
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I don't really get to use her in any match, because everybody is.

657
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So now the question is, who's a good counter for her?

658
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And apparently I'm hearing it's Winston is the best counter for her.

659
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So you're now seeing a lot of Winstons show up,

660
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
whereas I rarely would see that character ever pop in.

661
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
He's very hard to play.

662
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
He's very hard to play.

663
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I like playing him better than a lot of the tanks,

664
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
but yeah, he's hard to play.

665
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But I guess he can zap her while she's invisible,

666
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and that goes a long way.

667
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah.

668
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Did you see the Sombra, was it Sombra?

669
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't play the game, but...

670
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Cosplay?

671
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
No, no, no, no. Exploit for private matches,

672
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
where you turn off the cooldown.

673
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
She apparently has this, like, jump thing that knocks her into the air.

674
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
She can throw, like, she basically throws a teleporter,

676
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and she can teleport to wherever it lands.

677
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Exactly.

678
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So people were using it to get, with no cooldown,

679
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
to get to the top of the map.

680
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Oh, okay.

681
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And then get, like, a free view of everything,

682
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
or try to free fall into certain locations.

683
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh, that's clever.

684
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
There's videos of it.

685
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Wouldn't you be able to do that with Pharah?

686
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
No, it was Widowmaker.

687
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You take one of the basketballs that are in the starting area,

688
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and you get someone to knock it up,

689
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and then you use your grappling hook,

690
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and you just keep going up, up, up off the basketball,

691
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and you could break the map, or break yourself on the map.

692
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm really surprised.

693
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I would think with Pharah, if you can remove cooldowns,

694
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
you could do the same thing with her boost.

695
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Well, she is limited by her fuel, though.

696
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh, and you can't change that.

697
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh, interesting. Okay.

698
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I mean, I noticed in just looking at some of the maps there,

699
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
if you, you know, can find a place that, like, would work sort of as a ladder,

700
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
but, I mean, does fuel recharge on its own,

701
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
or do you have to find it for her?

702
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
For Pharah?

703
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Uh-huh.

704
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's just on a cooldown.

705
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, it's a meter that recharges.

706
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So you do it, like, ladder style, where you pause on your ladder,

707
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and then see how high you can go.

708
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But, I mean, actually the levels look really nice if it wasn't still, you know, expensive.

709
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah.

710
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And I've, I don't have time for that.

711
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Look, well, Black Friday is my suggestion,

712
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
because I think some places are going to have that down to 35 bucks on Black Friday.

713
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We'll see.

714
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So that's a little more reasonable.

715
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But I know you have the motion thing, and it's a first-person shooter.

716
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Don't forget that.

717
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So that could be a problem.

718
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah, we'll see.

719
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't know, I did okay with portal.

720
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That's true.

721
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Watch streams.

722
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Well, but then you're not in control in the streams.

723
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Maybe that's different.

724
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Maybe.

725
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
All right.

726
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay.

727
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week,

728
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
and I'm kind of coming up short right now.

729
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I haven't played a whole lot else.

730
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I have one thing to add, only because I haven't been on the show in so long.

731
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I do live under a rock in that I had never heard of No Man's Sky until it came out,

732
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and everyone shit the bed.

733
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So I got on PC just to see, because I, again, knew nothing about it.

734
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I played the hell out of it for a good month, month and a half.

735
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It was really meditative and chill.

736
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
A lot of it is because the planets were beautiful,

737
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and it was just a good way to just decompress.

738
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And then one day I just stopped playing it, and I haven't touched it since.

739
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And they haven't done any updates to really bring people back,

740
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
like I thought they were going to do.

741
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Occasionally.

742
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't think one's come through in a couple weeks,

743
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but even through all of the radio silence,

744
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I would occasionally get a patch once a week or twice a week,

745
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
little one or two meg patches, consistently from the release through about six weeks,

746
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
or whatever, through start of September or start of October.

747
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So they were patching it, which kind of lends itself to the,

748
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
we're not talking to anyone because we're busy fixing this broken game that we released.

749
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But yeah, nothing as far as features that I know of.

750
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay.

751
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
All right.

752
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah, I think being in a bubble and not letting yourself fall into the hype too much

753
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
ended up being a really, really good thing for that game.

754
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Because I don't follow E3.

755
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Like, if Half-Life 3 was announced to E3,

756
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
it would take a good hour or two for me to find out about it.

757
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Until I'm screaming about it, right?

758
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah, I would see it on Twitter.

759
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah, right?

760
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I just found something that makes me super happy.

761
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
What's that?

762
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The Kung Fu Panda director is working on an adaptation of Bone.

763
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Oh yeah, I'd heard that on Twitter or somewhere.

764
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The graphic novel?

765
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I love Bone.

766
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That'd be cool.

767
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
All right.

768
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Well, I may as well share some happy news, right?

769
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah, that's true.

770
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
All right, well, we're going to share some gaming news right now with you guys.

771
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I don't have a lot to say for housekeeping.

772
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Just remember to follow us on Twitter at OLR,

773
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and we're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook,

774
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Google Plus as well if you're still trucking along over there.

775
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And again, we will be back Sunday on our normal schedule

776
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

777
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Our next hurdle now that we've cleared Rob's Chicago trip is

778
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
what are we going to do during the holidays?

779
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Because did you know this, Dark Saga?

780
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
December 25th, January 1st, January 8th, all Sundays.

781
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You want to know what else?

782
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Christmas through New Year's is Hanukkah.

783
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Oh, is it? Great.

784
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So we have Chris-ma-kah-nah near year.

785
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, all of it.

786
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
All of it's happening all at once, so I don't know.

787
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We've been throwing around some ideas.

788
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What do you think, Dark Sakura?

789
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Do you think, I know since, you know,

790
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
well, if December 25th is the first night of Hanukkah, though,

791
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
that might not be, that might not work out so well.

792
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Because I was going to say, YOLO, I mean,

793
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I know Loki won't be here, but he wouldn't mind

794
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
if we did a show with Adam on Christmas Day.

795
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I would certainly not mind.

796
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't think that we do much with the family.

797
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Oh, wait, wait. No, I actually, I would be off.

798
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, so.

799
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Because work is usually open on Christmas Day.

800
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
We, but we, and we usually do a thing,

801
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
but we would probably be done in time.

802
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So figure something out.

803
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So.

804
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I mean, unless they call me into work.

805
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah.

806
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Then.

807
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Don't quote us on that,

808
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
because the reality is there's the 25th, the 1st,

809
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and then January 8th.

810
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Guess what?

811
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'm at MAGFest in Washington, D.C.

812
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Woohoo!

813
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So I won't be here.

814
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But guess what?

815
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You know what?

816
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We shouldn't do a Christmas show.

817
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
We should do a first day of Hanukkah show.

818
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
A first day of Hanukkah show?

819
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
A first day of Hanukkah show.

820
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
What about just a holiday show?

821
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
No, Christmas gets way too much,

822
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and we need to reclaim some.

823
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You know what?

824
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Festivus for the rest of us.

825
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
No.

826
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
No, it's the, it's Orange Lounge Radio Day.

827
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That's what we're going to be celebrating.

828
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
A holiday for us.

829
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Why?

830
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Because it's us.

831
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Right?

832
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes.

833
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Alright.

834
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Anyway.

835
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm still, I actually, I found two shirts.

836
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm trying to decide which one I want.

837
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
One of them says Happy Holidays.

838
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It has a piece of bread on it.

839
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And the other one says Happy Hanukat.

840
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I like that.

841
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So, I don't know.

842
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Don't you think December 25th should be Orange Lounge Radio Day?

843
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It's Decemberween.

844
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's Decemberween.

845
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Alright.

846
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I guess some folks would argue,

847
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
no, that should be 20 November because of your roots,

848
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
but I don't know.

849
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm coming.

850
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm coming for Christmas.

851
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Well, it's coming for you.

852
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Alright.

853
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Screaming.

854
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You think the deviants have killed Christmas.

855
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You ain't seen nothing yet.

856
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Alright.

857
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Anyway, let's get into some actual gaming news that has happened.

858
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
While we've been gone, Allen,

859
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
you have something to start us off with tonight.

860
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Yes.

861
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
In Grand Theft Auto Online,

862
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
they released a new adversary mode called Deadline,

863
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and in Deadline, you can use the Tron bicycle.

864
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Like, it's...

865
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I don't know how they did this because Disney...

866
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Grand Theft Auto is not really a property Disney would license to,

867
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
but maybe it's the guy who...

868
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Because it's not actually a Tron bike, right?

869
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's just something that looks like a Tron bike.

870
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Wink, wink, nudge.

871
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's like, yeah, I was going to say,

872
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
maybe they changed the handlebars and, like, said,

873
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
okay, it's not copyright because we changed this one thing about it,

874
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
but it's...

875
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's when they do those pornos and they'll say, like,

876
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
a blank parody type of thing, you know?

877
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Like, I don't know, what are...

878
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't even know it's important.

879
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Like, the slut of the rings or something.

880
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It'll be a Lord of the Rings parody.

881
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Wink, wink, nudge.

882
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That type of thing.

883
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah.

884
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So these things...

885
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Or the Lord of the cock ring.

886
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
These things are 90% identical to a Tron.

887
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I think, oh, you're sitting more upright.

888
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You're not completely like...

889
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Because, you know, on the Tron bikes,

890
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
they're completely like Superman.

891
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's semi-recumbent.

892
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yes.

893
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yes.

894
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That was me.

895
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And I just started an ad on my phone.

896
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Oh.

897
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Good job.

898
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm sorry.

899
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So if you order it now, there's a limited offer.

900
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
This came out a week ago, though,

901
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
so I don't know if it's still valid.

902
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh, through November 21st, there's still time.

903
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You can get a Nagasaki logo t-shirt for your in-game avatar.

904
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That's cool.

905
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And the mode of...

906
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You leave a trail of light behind you that stays there,

907
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
and it's basically the last man standing.

908
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You try to cut people off and get them to slam into your wall.

909
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You know, Loki sent me a tweet the day this was announced and said,

910
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
this is how I'm going to get you to finally play that fucking game.

911
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And I'm like, you're probably right.

912
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But it's GTA Online, not 5.

913
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'd still check it out.

914
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You don't have to play a monthly fee for online, right?

915
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
No, I know.

916
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But I thought the game that he was desperate to get you to play was...

917
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Honestly, Grand Theft Auto 4.

918
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Any of it.

919
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Which I've played and beaten.

920
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's a really downer game.

921
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But yeah.

922
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I think as far as Loki's concerned, any of it, to be honest.

923
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah.

924
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Probably make him happy.

925
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
All right.

926
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
We'll ask him when he gets back.

927
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
What else happened this week, Darzagra?

928
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I have some big news for you, right?

929
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Oh, so many Mass Effect Andromeda things.

930
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
They introduced the crew, which I'm waiting for one to be called peanut butter.

931
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Or jelly, sorry.

932
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So they have peanut butter jelly time?

933
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
They have PB, who's somebody.

934
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But it's...

935
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Sorry, right?

936
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah.

937
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Who is supposed to be just kind of a bit of a badass.

938
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But it's supposed to take place between Mass Effect 2 and 3.

939
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Well, at least the beginning of the story does.

940
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And the writers are siblings and everything.

941
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's just...

942
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
That was cool.

943
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
But I'm trying to find the last thing.

944
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Other than that, the only thing that I know is that there's a new race.

945
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Who look vaguely Prothean anyway, because just about everything that they create

946
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
kind of has that same head.

947
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The big, poofy head in the back.

948
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's supposed to be a more, I guess, robust morality system in there.

949
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Where you have different types of responses based on heart head, professional or casual.

950
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And so it's supposed to lead to more interesting directions with how people judge you in game.

951
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Also, it's supposed to be a more nuanced romance system, things like that.

952
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And multiplayer.

953
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah, I'm excited they confirmed multiplayer.

954
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Although it sounds like they're really gonna cash in on multiplayer.

955
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Like they did last time?

956
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Like that super deluxe edition.

957
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Well, speaking of multiplayer, I still need to go back and check this out.

958
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But on N7 Day, they made Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 backwards compatible on Xbox One, finally.

959
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
They did that.

960
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Which is exciting.

961
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So I want to go back and play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer on Xbox One.

962
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I think that would be super fun.

963
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
But when I went to go do that, my Xbox was like,

964
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you have a seven gig update to download.

965
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And I was like, God, can't you download overnight when I'm sleeping?

966
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That's what the Wii U does. Let the Wii U have its own gimmick.

967
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The Sony does that too, but that's a PlayStation Plus gimmick.

968
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It had the update anyway.

969
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Well, also thanks to a couple of leaks, one of them being from Best Buy,

970
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,000
that they have a dynamic cover system where if you say that you're hiding behind a rock,

971
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
the rock that you're behind could get destroyed.

972
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So lots of blowing up things and particles and stuffs.

973
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh wow, okay. That's gonna be different.

974
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And that it's actually, in fact, a very similar comparison has been The Last of Us.

975
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And then we have a jet pack. We finally have a jet pack.

976
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And they'll be using them to go to places they shouldn't

977
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
because somebody will mod it so that jet pack has unlimited fuel.

978
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Right?

979
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That's the first thing Dar Sager is going to be looking into.

980
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
How can I fly around and see everything?

981
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Well, you know I do that shit anyway. It's so much fun.

982
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You know what struck me as interesting about the whole story in the setup?

983
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You kind of mentioned it really quick,

984
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
but I think it's something that's really interesting to me

985
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
is that you have the rider or the brother and sister, right?

986
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You have a brother and sister.

987
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Whereas in the original Mass Effect trilogy,

988
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
there was a very distinct male shepherd or female shepherd.

989
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
They were the same person.

990
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes, they were, but it's like, but now in this one,

991
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
my point is, if you were male or female, you had that representation.

992
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The other sibling is also out in the...

993
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Exactly. And that was it.

994
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
There was no other half or whatever.

995
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But in this game, if you're going to go with male rider,

996
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
you're not eliminating female rider.

997
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
She will still be there and a part of the story,

998
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
as well as vice versa, obviously.

999
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So that's very interesting to me.

1000
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I reckon if that's kind of like, well, I mean,

1001
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
while it wasn't throughout the whole game,

1002
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
at the start of Fallout 4, you had both characters together.

1003
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You know, I sat and designed both of them because that's what I do.

1004
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Of course, you know, spoilers, one of them dies still.

1005
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yeah, you can spend hours in the character creator,

1006
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
especially if you have mods designing your spouse,

1007
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
whether it be the husband or the wife, and be like,

1008
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I have my hot couple. This is me.

1009
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
The other one is who I'm married to.

1010
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And then they're like, they're dead.

1011
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
We're going to steal your baby.

1012
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
All right.

1013
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Have fun being frozen.

1014
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
All right. So I'm super looking forward to Mass Effect.

1015
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
More gameplay. They said, when are the game awards?

1016
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
They're soon, right? They're probably like in a couple of weeks.

1017
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So that's when we actually get gameplay.

1018
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm excited to see gameplay.

1019
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I'm sure Dark Soccer is excited to see gameplay.

1020
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I want to see the interface because they've been very good at hiding that.

1021
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
They have not shown the interface at all,

1022
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
so I'm very curious what that's going to look like.

1023
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So many questions will be answered soon.

1024
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
One question I'd like to have the answer to is

1025
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
when are Generation 2 Pokémon going to show up in Pokémon GO

1026
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
to try to lure people back to the game?

1027
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Well, apparently, it may be a little sooner rather than later.

1028
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
A new update to Pokémon GO, which showed up on Android devices,

1029
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and I think iPhone's got this too eventually,

1030
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
was version .45.

1031
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And inside the APK, which is basically the package file

1032
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
that goes on the phone that the game comes out of,

1033
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
there were actually new Pokémon, the 100 new Pokémon

1034
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
from 152 through 251.

1035
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's Chikorita through Celebi are now actually in the game data.

1036
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't think that means graphics.

1037
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That just means in the game data.

1038
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But I do think graphics of Ditto showed up.

1039
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So that's telling me that Ditto will probably be the first Pokémon

1040
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
that they either do as an event,

1041
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
because now Pokémon GO has been doing more events recently.

1042
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
They did a Halloween event.

1043
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
They did an increased drop thing recently.

1044
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So they may do the event in-game,

1045
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
but Ingress has an event right now,

1046
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
so maybe Pokémon GO is sitting out while the Ingress is doing the double AP,

1047
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
which is going on right now.

1048
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Or if it's going to be a live event.

1049
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
We still fully know Niantic plans to do Pokémon GO live events.

1050
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Whether they're staffed to handle it, I don't know.

1051
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
But we'll see.

1052
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So that could be something that that comes from.

1053
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm not sure if they can follow the Ingress model,

1054
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
because imagine if kids, there's an event,

1055
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
and it's like an hour's drive away.

1056
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Let's say they do...

1057
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Because the Ingress, it's like three or four cities in the whole country.

1058
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So let's say they do several cities per state.

1059
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You're going to have kids that parents can't take them to

1060
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
for whatever this is, where you have to be there

1061
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
if they follow the Ingress model,

1062
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and the kids will have a total meltdown.

1063
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Ingress does have a van that they take around the country.

1064
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Didn't we go to one? I don't remember if you went.

1065
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I have not been, but you've been once or twice.

1066
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, I went. Okay, so you didn't go that night.

1067
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But they have a van tour thing that goes around,

1068
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and maybe that's how they do it,

1069
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
is they have to literally take the Pokémon on tour.

1070
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And they're only going to be able to do this at very large parks.

1071
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You can't play in the middle of downtown like you do Ingress

1072
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
with kids and people on the street and stuff.

1073
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's going to be big parks, like Chicago as an example.

1074
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It will have to be Millennium Park or something,

1075
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
like a huge park where they can do this.

1076
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That's really the only place that's going to be set up for that.

1077
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm very curious to see how the live events turn out.

1078
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But anyway, we'll talk about this

1079
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
whenever we're able to do a new Pokéstop podcast.

1080
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But with Sun and Moon coming out this weekend,

1081
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Shane's basically said, don't call me.

1082
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
We'll see. We'll see what we get around to doing that.

1083
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Shane was talking about his Pokévacation.

1084
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah, he's taking six days off to play Pokémon.

1085
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah.

1086
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Is he getting four copies of the game,

1087
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
two in English and two in Japanese?

1088
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Last I heard, yes, that was his plan.

1089
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Oh, I was kidding.

1090
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
No, he is...

1091
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I knew he was getting an English and Japanese.

1092
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
He's getting two of them digital and two of them physical.

1093
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Gotcha.

1094
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
He said he may cut it back to three,

1095
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
but there's some type of double dual edition thing or something he wants.

1096
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I don't know.

1097
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm getting one copy of the game. One.

1098
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And you know what? If there's Pokémon in the other game that I don't have,

1099
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
you know what I'll do to get them? I'll trade for them.

1100
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That's what you did in Pokémon back in the day.

1101
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Or I'll just say, Shane, you have 5,000 Pokémon.

1102
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Shane can't trade like that, though, because he doesn't have any friends.

1103
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Stop. He's not here to defend himself. Be nice.

1104
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
All right.

1105
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1106
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
use the passphrase, train.

1107
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Let's travel back in time to a time when you didn't buy four copies of a game

1108
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
because you were probably begging somebody for money to buy the game.

1109
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Or you were mowing the lawn or gardening or something.

1110
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1111
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Or stealing from a convenience store.

1112
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And Dark Soccer is here.

1113
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
She's back with no radio magic. She's here to...

1114
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
We've had to fill in a few weeks without you.

1115
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Because I was, like, dead.

1116
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Well, I hope the picks were worthy.

1117
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I picked it because it's unique, and then I found out it's not as unique as I thought it was,

1118
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
but for a while it was exclusive to a system that people hardly remember existed.

1119
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Well, it must be because I heard it's the 15th anniversary of Halo this week,

1120
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
so you finally did it. You finally picked Halo for the classic game of the week, right?

1121
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm going home.

1122
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
No, you're not. You're here forever.

1123
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Bitch.

1124
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
What is the classic game of the week?

1125
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Al Khazar, the Forgotten Fortress.

1126
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And this game has very little audio.

1127
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It bleeps and bloops.

1128
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I will still leave it up in the background so you can hear some bleeps and bloops,

1129
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
but there's not a lot.

1130
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Besides Dark Soccer and meowing.

1131
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Just like the piercing internal speaker on an old IBM computer.

1132
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Pretty much.

1133
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, here you go.

1134
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
There you go. There's some music.

1135
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I had Chipotle earlier. I'm sorry.

1136
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
An abrupt record scratch right there that you would hear on an old Atari system.

1137
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Anyway, Al Khazar.

1138
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It's an action-adventure game.

1139
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It actually very much resembles Legend of Zelda and Dungeon Master,

1140
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
and it came out in 1985 for the Coleco Adam,

1141
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
which was also the first computer that I ever owned for the record was Coleco Adam,

1142
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
which kind of sucked, but hey.

1143
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It was downgraded later on for a Coleco Vision only version that came out later.

1144
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So for the longest time, it was only on Coleco systems,

1145
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
specifically the good version being the Coleco Adam.

1146
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And it was done by, not specifically by Activision,

1147
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
but by one of their designers.

1148
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I just realized for the record, this clip I'm using is the Coleco Vision version.

1149
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Sorry about that. That's probably why the bleeps and bloops are more bleepy and bloopy.

1150
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah.

1151
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But, Rob, you will be happy to know it was ported to the Commodore 64.

1152
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Well, thank God.

1153
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah.

1154
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Anyway, the goal is to get to the main castle, Al Khazar,

1155
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
by going through different castles, enemy castles,

1156
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
until you can retrieve the stolen crown.

1157
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So you start off on a world map.

1158
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Okay, this is an important question, because this is something I'm noticing about this game.

1159
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
This is important, because it's very Dungeons and Dragon-esque, right?

1160
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
There's torches, and it's a dungeon, and you've got castles.

1161
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But the weapon he's using is a gun.

1162
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It could be a wand.

1163
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
No, it's a gun. It looks like a fucking gun, like the graphic and everything.

1164
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
It's a gun with bullets.

1165
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So it's like, we're going back to medieval times, or I'm going to get medieval on your end.

1166
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
They have guns in Warcraft.

1167
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I guess, no, but this doesn't look like-

1168
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I call it a boomstick!

1169
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
No, this is like a fucking, like, gun.

1170
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Okay.

1171
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Can I finish?

1172
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Gun.

1173
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Actually, Gun was the last song I was listening to in my car.

1174
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Churches.

1175
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Tim Gunn, make it work.

1176
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That's Peter Gunn.

1177
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Anyway.

1178
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Anyway, you have a world map, and it's got 22 castles on it.

1179
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And your goal is to move through each of the castles until you get to the main fortress on the right-hand side of the map.

1180
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Each castle has different rooms, it has traps, it has floors.

1181
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
The maps change every time a new game is started.

1182
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And you've got different difficulty levels, like beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert.

1183
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
You also have different items that you can get, such as a pistol, gun, rob.

1184
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You can also get a grappling hook.

1185
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And you have a little map to help you, you know, remember where you are.

1186
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You do have traps, you have enemies.

1187
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
You know, if you get too much damage, you lose a life and you die.

1188
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
There are no continues in the game.

1189
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
The only way that you can save is on the Coleco Adam version.

1190
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And good luck at that, because the Coleco Adam was notorious for erasing shit.

1191
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Just sayin'.

1192
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Okay, pause. Rant time.

1193
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
The Coleco Adam ran-

1194
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I'm literally pausing the bleeps and bloops for this.

1195
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It's power through the printer that connected to the tape deck.

1196
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yes, it used cassettes.

1197
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And if you had a power surge, like hello me living in Alabama, it would power surge through your cassettes.

1198
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And you know what happened? Erase.

1199
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It burned the cassettes, or magnetized, yeah.

1200
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah, demagnetize them.

1201
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So, I found, like, packs of the Commodore 6- not Commodore 64, what am I saying- the Coleco Adam cassettes.

1202
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And in the box and everything, it's like, I don't know if I can sell these, because I don't know if they're demagnetized or not.

1203
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So I put them on eBay, I said, good luck, bitches.

1204
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Anyway.

1205
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
The game is also one of the earliest adventure games to have a demo mode.

1206
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So it actually gives you a demo, you wait for the title screen for about 30 seconds, it goes into demo mode.

1207
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And believe it or not, there is an earlier version of this that was initially created for the Apple II.

1208
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:20,000
For all of its various versions, apart from the Apple II version, Coleco Adam, Coleco Vision, and Commodore 64, it also was ported to the MSX.

1209
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And that's it.

1210
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Alright.

1211
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1212
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Alcazar. Algazam.

1213
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Alcazar, The Forgotten Fortress.

1214
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It's very Zelda-y.

1215
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I would almost say, like, oh, I wonder if Zelda was inspired by this, but no, the years don't work out.

1216
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I mean, they probably came out nearly at the same time.

1217
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So, in fact, maybe Zelda was even a year or two earlier.

1218
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But yeah, still really cool looking.

1219
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yep.

1220
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Alright, good choice for the classic game of the week.

1221
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Let's get back right into it.

1222
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
We're not going to do a break tonight, we're running right through.

1223
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's going to be a shorter show since it's something we're taping mid-week.

1224
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
But let's get into a few more news items.

1225
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Alan, what else do you have for us tonight?

1226
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'll try to make this quick.

1227
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Final Fantasy XV, when it is released in a couple weeks, is supposed to run allegedly between 40 to 50 frames per second, depending on what's going on.

1228
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It's been announced via Active Time Report that in December, for the PlayStation 4 Pro, they're going to drop a patch that should take the whole game up to 60 FPS sustained.

1229
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And 60 FPS, of course, is the magic number for, I guess, the true gaming experience for hardware people that fap over graphics or whatever.

1230
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Well, 60 frames per second, too, isn't that when the picture starts getting that fake look almost? Like it's too real?

1231
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Yeah.

1232
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That whole type of thing? So that's going to be great.

1233
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So that is happening in December.

1234
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And then, let's see, is there a date for when this is coming out?

1235
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Anyway, Square Enix has partnered with Machine Zone for a Final Fantasy XV franchise mobile MMO.

1236
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Machine Zone, or MZ as they go by now, are the makers of Fire Age Game of War and Mobile Strike.

1237
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:22,000
We actually did a story on Fire Age Game of War that I think I reported on when I guested.

1238
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:29,000
After they did the Kate Upton model campaign when she was in their commercials, they also had Mariah Carey money.

1239
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Oh god, yeah, that was them?

1240
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah, so they'd be like, Mariah Carey, do you want a cape for a video game? Fuck no, here's how much money we'll pay you. Okay.

1241
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,000
That game after the Kate Upton campaign was making a million dollars a day in microtransactions.

1242
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So it's them. So they know what they're doing. Typically, Squeenix is used...

1243
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So now there's only one degree of separation between Mariah Carey and the Final Fantasy franchise.

1244
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And she didn't even have to sing the song at the end of the game to do it.

1245
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Who's the one that did Record Keeper and the other one that are supposedly really good?

1246
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
DNA? That's who Nintendo's partnering with for things like Super Mario Run and whatever else they've got up their sleeve.

1247
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah, so they're not going with them. They're old standard. They are doing it with Machine Zone.

1248
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And yeah, Mobile Strike and Age of War or whatever are consistently top five games.

1249
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And they've gone to the top five or top three and stayed there on both the Apple and Google online mobile stores.

1250
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And the spokesperson for Mobile Strike is Arnold Schwarzenegger, if you've seen those commercials.

1251
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Oh yes, I have.

1252
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So those games are all the same company and they're going to be making the 15 equivalent mobile game.

1253
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I wonder what celebrity they'll get for those commercials for this game.

1254
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And as far as when it's going to come out, I'm not sure if there's a date. Just Google it.

1255
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm thinking David Hasselhoff.

1256
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Oh God.

1257
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I don't know. I'm trying to think. Who's a celebrity that's kind of like way past their time in the spotlight?

1258
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:11,000
They'll get the Backstreet Boys and just put gel in their hair because practically the crew that you play in 15 is a boy band anyway.

1259
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So just get like NSYNC minus Justin Timberlake and put them in a black convertible on a green screen and be like,

1260
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Kirkpatrick, take out your Android.

1261
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
No, didn't you see they're going on tour because it's coming to the new arena thingy we have here.

1262
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's the Backstreet Boys, whatever, boys to men. Cool. Right.

1263
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But then do you know who they just added to that tour? Paula Abdul.

1264
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And like the 12 year old little gay and me was like.

1265
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Because it's it's all fun and games when you're in your 20s and you see those monsters of rock like State Fair of like foreigner and.

1266
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Or when you're me and you see the Spice Girls.

1267
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Or or like Journey and or whatever, like some Led Zeppelin cover band.

1268
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:02,000
But now the ones that are coming up is like I think they had like a triple header of Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson and like Garbage.

1269
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And it was like 90s goth like festival. And I'm like, that sounds so fucking good.

1270
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And it's like, how old am I that we have these three bands that are teaming up to play, you know, the vacant lot behind Shakey's.

1271
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:23,000
My mother messaged me and said, New Kids on the Block are touring.

1272
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,000
The same woman who bought me my sheets. Who is your favorite of the new kids?

1273
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Back then, honestly, it was Joey. The gay one, right? Was Joey? No, that was John.

1274
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Jonathan Knight. Oh, I can. He just seemed the one I'd want to hang out with.

1275
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I see. But I thought that Joey was kind of cute. Jonathan Knight had that nasty song, too, and he had his comeback.

1276
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
All right. Anyway, so the mobile. Oh, yes. Final Fantasy 15 mobile game. Yes.

1277
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Well, I was just the only thing I was going to comment is that, you know, that's that sounds really exciting and will be a cool little like thing for this for the series.

1278
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
But it's like, my God, there's Final Fantasy 15 spinoffs everywhere.

1279
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It seems like it's everywhere like that. And that's not the first mobile game for Final Fantasy 15.

1280
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I already have one on my phone that's like a pinball type game that they put out for 15. Brave Exvius, which I think is their latest release.

1281
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Damn it. This article had what rank it is. It's currently number 46, which I imagine is not very good for a new game.

1282
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I imagine Record Keeper has kept its momentum better than Brave has. So they could use MZ support on that.

1283
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Well, I just, you know, it's very interesting how much they are saturating with Final Fantasy 15.

1284
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
They really want to make sure they get their money back on this game. But this could be a make or break game for the franchise, I guess.

1285
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Well, I'd rather have them do freemium games, as awful as that sounds, than have them charge $20 for a Final Fantasy 5 ROM for like the 10th time.

1286
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Oh, yeah. Or that horrible, but I didn't like the Final Fantasy 5 remake on the phones. I didn't like that at all.

1287
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah. Well, I think they realized, oh, these won't sell because they're bad and they charge too much money for them.

1288
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Yes. Good. Good. All right. Anyhow, Dark Sakura, we got one more from you, right?

1289
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah, you do. Well, two of my favorite franchises. Well, the producers of one of them wants to marry it to another one.

1290
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:44,000
The producer of the Tekken, let's say the more recent Tekken series, Harada Katsuhiro and the designer Michael Murray,

1291
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
were asked before about what their favorite fighting game franchises were, and one of them mentioned was Samurai Showdown.

1292
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And it came up again very recently at the King of Iron Fist 2016 North American Tekken 7 finals.

1293
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And asked again, the quote from Harada was more than still talk of the possibility of a collaboration.

1294
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,000
We would like to buy the rights and make ourselves a new Samurai Showdown title and put the franchise back on the map through our vision.

1295
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It's a distant dream, but a dream.

1296
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Yeah. How long has it been since the Samurai Showdown game?

1297
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Samurai Showdown 5 was the last official one. And I think it was also, if I, I may be wrong, but I think it was also the last official Neo Geo cartridge release.

1298
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Interesting. Well, that'd be cool. I think that would be a franchise that would be fun to have come back.

1299
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yeah.

1300
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Yeah. I'd be into that. Well, one more story for this little special show this week.

1301
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And that has to do with another kind of retro franchise, Super Mario Brothers, specifically number three.

1302
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Apparently there was an interview that happened on the Japanese Nintendo website with Takashi Takusa,

1303
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:59,000
who actually talked about that Super Mario Brothers 3 originally was going to have an overhead perspective rather than a horizontal one,

1304
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
which is kind of the more, the style we're used to. But can you imagine if Super Mario Brothers 3 had been an overhead game?

1305
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
That would have been kind of like, like a Zelda type game. That kind of, that would have been very interesting.

1306
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:16,000
But apparently the plan actually would work. So in this interview, not only is Tezuka there, but Miyamoto is there too.

1307
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And as part of this, Miyamoto said, he said, I want the game to be viewed from a little bit above,

1308
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,000
but having a clear indication of where you're going to land after jumping was a key part of the original Super Mario.

1309
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Viewing everything from above made it very difficult to tell how far you were from the ground.

1310
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
So I told Mr. Tezuka, this will take forever. And Tezuka does a laugh in response and said,

1311
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:47,000
in fact, there are still remnants of the top down view in the final game from before we switch to the horizontal view.

1312
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
And the interviewer calls out the black and white checkered floor and they admit that, yes, that is one of the relics of the overhead view.

1313
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And my thought was the overhead map probably came from that too a little bit, but that's just my, you know, thought.

1314
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Nothing concrete on that. But it is interesting that all these years later we did get, like, Super Mario 3D World,

1315
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:13,000
which is an overhead per se, but it definitely, you know, is a little more like tilted up.

1316
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So that way, you know, but it has the 3D to help lend that perspective to it a little bit.

1317
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And obviously the additional processing power that the NES didn't have probably helped fix a lot of those issues.

1318
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But I just thought it was really cool that, you know, Super Mario Brothers 3 started out as something completely different

1319
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
and then turned into what it is now, which many would argue is the best Mario game.

1320
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Although there's always going to be that Mario Brothers 3 versus Super Mario World debate that we're not doing tonight.

1321
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Yes, Star Shocker?

1322
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I like Super Mario World.

1323
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yes, I knew it. You couldn't resist.

1324
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm surprised that this made it to the point where there are assets to be hidden in the actual cart

1325
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
because just listening to how they're describing it, I'm surprised that it...

1326
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I would imagine it pittered out during like the storyboard, like not even a proof of concept.

1327
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Like they decided this is too much work. So the fact that they had assets is surprising to me.

1328
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Have either of you ever watched Beta64?

1329
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Is that like a YouTube thing?

1330
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It's a YouTube channel.

1331
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Yeah, no, I haven't.

1332
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Beta64 is actually really cool. It's one of my favorite channels because, you know, I like to dig around and play around in places.

1333
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But they go through things like E3 coverage, test copies, photos and magazines, and try to reconstruct the design cycle of a game.

1334
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh, like what it looked like before and how it really ended up.

1335
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Interesting. I'd like to see the episode on No Man's Sky.

1336
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I don't know that they've done that, but as I recall, I think they did do one for Super Mario World.

1337
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,000
In fact, I know they did one for Super Mario World, but I'd like to think that they did one on Super Mario Brothers 3, or if not, then it's been requested.

1338
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But the ones they did on Star Fox 2 was amazing, especially since Star Fox 2 now has been given...

1339
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:12,000
The final release copy is still in the possession of the designer who doesn't have the right to re-release it, but it was finished.

1340
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,000
And someone's actually gone through and done a finalized version and put it out on, you know, Protocarts.

1341
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,000
But I mean, I'm just saying as an example, you know, they're pretty resourceful when it comes to finding that type of information.

1342
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So it'd be worth it to see if they've done one.

1343
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Yeah, cool.

1344
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm a big fan of Beta64.

1345
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Yeah, I'll have to check that out. I like that type of hidden stuff you weren't supposed to see, vault type stuff.

1346
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
There's that one website that has all that type of stuff too, and I can't remember the name for the liveme, like, Forgotten Stuff.

1347
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I don't remember what it is.

1348
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Doctor Tsuruya posts links from there all the time about new things that are found, like, in games.

1349
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
This is where not having a live audience tonight is hurting me, but we'll talk about it maybe on Sunday show.

1350
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But yeah, those are, like, it has, like, all the stuff that, you know, they deleted from games and hidden things.

1351
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I like that stuff. It's interesting.

1352
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Alright, well, we are getting ready to wrap up, but before we do, I mean, usually we would take phone calls at the end of the show,

1353
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
but since we're not live tonight, we can't just do that tonight.

1354
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
You know, the phone's ringing, Rob.

1355
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Hello?

1356
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Sit!

1357
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Just imagine if you called, like, DarkTekTsuruya or TigerClaw and is like,

1358
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
alright, can you just sit on hold for the next hour, and then they'll be like, I need you to look this up really quick.

1359
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Like, we just have to sit on Skype.

1360
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
No, you don't get to listen to us record. We're just gonna cut over.

1361
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
We should just call one of our people randomly.

1362
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
One of our people randomly.

1363
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Let's do it!

1364
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Oh, no, I did that once. We did that at an early OLR, and I'll never do it again.

1365
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Why?

1366
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Because we woke some guy up or something who was in, like, a horrible mood or something, and I swear that guy stopped listening because of it.

1367
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Let's call Dan.

1368
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
We're not gonna call Dan. We're gonna get to the mailbag.

1369
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Fuck.

1370
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Every week, you guys email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1371
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And DarkSakura enthusiastically jumps into the mailbag and finds some emails to read here.

1372
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And you know what? Since she's back this week after, you know, what, like, six weeks not being here, I'm very happy to put her to work.

1373
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So DarkSakura, read some emails.

1374
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Do your job, DarkSakura.

1375
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Okay, I'm... I just caught some keywords in here, but I'm still gonna read it.

1376
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So, um, this... I wonder if these are... Okay, never mind.

1377
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Because I'm reading them sort of secondhand.

1378
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Anyway, um, the first one comes from Robert M.

1379
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And it says, quick clarification, the Six Flags food service, we were having to wait an hour and a half in line for basic meals.

1380
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Still not relevant to this right now.

1381
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Oh, that was a follow-up from last week's show, since you weren't here. He had talked about this whole experience, and we were kind of... Okay, anyway.

1382
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I suppose the carnival games of old would, in fact, be the redemption games of today.

1383
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Note, forgive my use of the term dongless, as opposed to anatomically-inexplicit. It just seemed funnier and more direct.

1384
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I've been having serious issues sleeping for the last few weeks, partially from general anxiety, undiagnosed, and partially from excessive caffeine, due to lack of sleep perpetuating the cycle.

1385
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And I've been browsing YouTube nearly all night.

1386
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Late last night, while browsing Let's Play-type videos, I came across the Rooster Teeth guys looking at a prototype release of a gladiatorial game on the HTC Vive called GORN.

1387
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Where the player battles various numbers of cartoonishly muscular naked dongless warriors with fists, flails, shields, swords, bows, and so on.

1388
01:12:48,000 --> 01:13:01,000
The game features a fair amount of blood and dismemberment, with an audience of blocky heads that are clearly from the silly physics-based Wolfenstein 3D game, if you've seen that one.

1389
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I'm not really sure if this is the same developer.

1390
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Overall, it's very much the vibe of Ridiculous Game presented semi-seriously.

1391
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I do see a later build of the prototype gives gladiators armor and basic leather briefs to break away plate mail and helmets.

1392
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Wait, so this is nudity and violence we're talking about? Because I'm kind of sold.

1393
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
More like no genitalia nudity. It's Ken doll.

1394
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And more blood and bruising.

1395
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm sorry, I'm looking at something. Of course I had to dig up a YouTube. I doubt it's the same one.

1396
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
But I'm actually watching somebody play this game and it looks fucking ridiculous.

1397
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Are you watching this, Talon?

1398
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It's like a 3D Choniki.

1399
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
It's not even that. It just looks...

1400
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We have a winner. Raise your arms in victory, peasant.

1401
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I think you'd laugh at this, Darasaga.

1402
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Okay, well let me finish what you mean.

1403
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Okay, sorry.

1404
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Giving it a slightly more serious feel, even the gladiators still look like a wrestler from Looney Tunes.

1405
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I imagine what I've seen in the... Is it the Veve or the... It's the Veve.

1406
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's the Vive.

1407
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Vive. Vive. That's so weird.

1408
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
This could be more than a little overwhelming. I encourage you to look up Gorn.

1409
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Looks interesting if obviously unfinished.

1410
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
That's from Robert M.

1411
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Well, yes. By your recommendation, I'm looking at this now.

1412
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It does look very plain. There's still a lot of fluff that they could put into this.

1413
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I really don't know what the audience for this game is.

1414
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
If they're going to sell this beyond the WTF factor.

1415
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
They need to pad those guys.

1416
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But the WTF factor is very strong with this. So, congrats, I think.

1417
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Congrats.

1418
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Sorry, they just knocked the guy out. It's funny.

1419
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Alright, next email.

1420
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
This is so stupid.

1421
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Yes, I'm closing this YouTube now.

1422
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Hello, LR.

1423
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Hello.

1424
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Some people might have been confused about the reasons for my email last week.

1425
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Especially me since I didn't hear it.

1426
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Specifically, my calling out of Shane.

1427
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I don't actually dislike Shane.

1428
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And in fact, I find him to be quite entertaining.

1429
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
But during episode 663 when mailbag had been empty for the second week in a row.

1430
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Rob specifically suggested that we write emails ranting about Shane.

1431
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I did. I did.

1432
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Okay, now it makes sense.

1433
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
See, I don't even remember what my ass said a week ago on this very show.

1434
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I have to message Dark Soccer on Twitter. Did I do that?

1435
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
What episode did that happen on? I can't remember.

1436
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I'd be like, bitch, I don't know.

1437
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Yeah, I know, right?

1438
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
So this was just before the 2-0-2 mark.

1439
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And I happen to be quite good at following directions.

1440
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
How are those receipts?

1441
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
If you go to episode 663 and check the two hour and two minute mark.

1442
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
You said this. This is why I'm fucked.

1443
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
It's Red Shirt. It's Red Shirt guy for O.L.R.

1444
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
This is why I'm fucked when it comes to politics.

1445
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Because, you know, somebody's going to dig up some clip of something stupid I said

1446
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
when I was drunk on a particular show.

1447
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Or, you know.

1448
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
We only have to be extra careful about that with the fur now.

1449
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Well, that's neither here nor there.

1450
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
But, you know, just in general, I'm really surprised and I shouldn't encourage this.

1451
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
But I'm really surprised somebody has a strung together, like a clip of things

1452
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
where like I said something in one episode and then said the exact opposite thing

1453
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
like three weeks later. Because I know it's happened. I'll fully admit.

1454
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But opinions change.

1455
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I am sure there's an early episode of O.L.R. where I said

1456
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I don't really like Mass Effect whatsoever.

1457
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Like I tried playing Mass Effect and it wasn't very good.

1458
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Right? And we all know that my opinion on that changed.

1459
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I think that did happen.

1460
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I think I did it too.

1461
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, because I remember playing it and I wasn't like super into it.

1462
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
But then when I give it...

1463
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And this happens all the time with different types of art.

1464
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Like sometimes you'll see a movie a second time and you're like,

1465
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh, this is... I just must have been in a bad mood when I saw this the first time.

1466
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Or music. Huge thing with music, right?

1467
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Haven't you ever listened to an album and the first time you were like,

1468
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Well, whatever. And the second time you listen to it you're like,

1469
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Okay, this is really fucking good.

1470
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Okay, get this. I have been...

1471
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
However many decades broken up with this guy,

1472
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I still can't watch The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

1473
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
The Disney movie?

1474
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
The Disney movie.

1475
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Well, the good news is it's one of the lesser Disney movies.

1476
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Yeah, but still.

1477
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Yeah, I know.

1478
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I saw it in the theater right after.

1479
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yeah.

1480
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
With him and other friends.

1481
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I mean, he's married. He's got kids. It's all fine.

1482
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
But I'm just saying it was just that emotional impact of the moment.

1483
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Sure.

1484
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It's hard to do it.

1485
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Sure.

1486
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
There's certain songs that remind me of X's to this day.

1487
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I mean, it's just the way it is.

1488
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Now at the same time I have certain songs I listen to on repeat because they get me mad.

1489
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I actually have one.

1490
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Well, what song gets you mad?

1491
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Daughters of the Chaos by Luscious Jackson.

1492
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Interesting.

1493
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
It's not my angry song.

1494
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
It's my fired up song.

1495
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Well, I always tell people if I'm listening to Tori Amos, something's wrong.

1496
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Something is really wrong.

1497
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So look out.

1498
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah, no, no, no.

1499
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
If I bust out the Tori Amos, you need to take me out and feed me because I'm depressed.

1500
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It's intervention.

1501
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And food will make it better.

1502
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
We'll fill your face with noodles.

1503
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yes.

1504
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Noodles always make it better.

1505
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Noodles always make it better.

1506
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Anyway, I don't know how we got here from YYR's email, but I think it had something

1507
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
to do with how forgetful I am.

1508
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But anyway.

1509
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Receipts.

1510
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Yes, receipts.

1511
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I hope that you guys are recovering from the election.

1512
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
No.

1513
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
No.

1514
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
At least it is over.

1515
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
It's not gonna be over.

1516
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It seemed like it went on forever.

1517
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Which it is.

1518
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Which is bad.

1519
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Because, yeah, damn right it's bad.

1520
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,640
It's this one time I saw it out on TV saying I should call my doctor if I have an election

1521
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,000
lasting more than four hours.

1522
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Oh well.

1523
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,600
I bet he wrote that email before the election even finished just to make that fucking joke.

1524
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,600
I bet that's-

1525
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,000
Wednesday, November 9th.

1526
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Oh.

1527
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Lots of love, Aaron YYR.

1528
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,320
No, it's not over.

1529
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,800
I am not saying this in jest either.

1530
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,800
It's fucking not over.

1531
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,880
Put on your hard hats.

1532
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,000
Put on your marching boots.

1533
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,800
We got work to do.

1534
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,880
And we got a lot of video games to play to get the fuck all out of it sometimes.

1535
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,880
Fuck yeah.

1536
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,880
Anyway.

1537
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,840
Why do you think I've been playing so much WoW?

1538
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:22,360
I'm doing the fucking 80 Soul Shard Illidan quest right now.

1539
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,440
I'm like, okay, okay.

1540
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:28,240
Dear Blizzard Activision assholes.

1541
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:31,720
First of all, happy 12th anniversary of World of Warcraft today.

1542
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,120
Thanks for the fun history quiz.

1543
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,200
Happy dozen.

1544
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,600
They should celebrate with a dozen donuts.

1545
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,040
I should celebrate with a dozen donuts.

1546
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,760
Here all about the 12th anniversary of WoW on the next Horde house.

1547
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,880
Coming on the 20th anniversary.

1548
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,880
Coming never.

1549
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:50,880
Coming never.

1550
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,880
Never say never.

1551
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,880
Never say never.

1552
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,880
Never say never.

1553
01:19:53,880 --> 01:20:03,400
But, this is a really obvious grasp for time because they must have been so ill prepared

1554
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,400
for the patching.

1555
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:10,080
They should have just left that quiz, the quiz, quest for when the patch comes out and

1556
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,680
just had it be like 40 so you don't have to spend two months farming those pieces.

1557
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,320
At least they have it now that you can do it on heroics and not on just mythics.

1558
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,320
But fuck.

1559
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:26,360
There's only so many times I can run Darkheart Thicket.

1560
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:32,320
Don't give me a new quest every time I'm done with it to do the same damn thing.

1561
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,440
But at least there's always something to do unlike Final Fantasy 14.

1562
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,880
It's now as funny as I feel the exact opposite.

1563
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,000
As I log into WoW and I'm like, I guess I'll pick flowers because I'm kind of not interested

1564
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
in the end game content.

1565
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,160
But then I log into Final Fantasy 14 and I'm like, ooh, I've got wondrous tales to do or

1566
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:55,480
I've got roulettes to run or so it's not going to work with me.

1567
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,720
I think it just depends on what you're into.

1568
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,720
Coke or Pepsi.

1569
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,720
All right.

1570
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:00,720
Anyway.

1571
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,120
But you still have to go run things with me.

1572
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:09,080
I've got four more days to do it and thus I get thirty thousand gold in the next four

1573
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,080
days.

1574
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,080
We'll see.

1575
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,080
I'll give you 20.

1576
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,520
That's you should buy your own month with that.

1577
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,340
I have like one hundred and twenty, one hundred twenty thousand.

1578
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:17,340
My God.

1579
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:18,640
How are you making money in that game?

1580
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,640
Starlight Rose.

1581
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,680
Oh, is that really what they sell for like three hundred a pop.

1582
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,680
OK.

1583
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,680
One sells for three.

1584
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,920
Yeah, no, I was trying to gather that was trying to do that in the fell fell something

1585
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,280
that I'll work is the daily sells pretty well to sell where it's not quite a daily, but

1586
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,840
you get like a seed to plant and you can grow more.

1587
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,520
No, you can collect like one a day somewhere.

1588
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,720
I sell the seeds.

1589
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,160
You make a ton of money off those.

1590
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,720
Just make a ton of money off the plant to you.

1591
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,720
Yes, that's true.

1592
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,720
All right.

1593
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,800
Anyway, I think I think those go for like six hundred a pop.

1594
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,800
So anyway.

1595
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,960
All right.

1596
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,840
Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1597
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,360
I hope you enjoyed this special, shorter, but still fun episode number six hundred sixty

1598
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,360
five.

1599
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,040
I want to thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to the show tonight.

1600
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,240
If you like what you heard, please tell a friend or five about the show.

1601
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,240
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only

1602
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:12,400
if the voices are here to use them and the voices will be back live this Sunday with

1603
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,300
episode number 666.

1604
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,300
We made it, Jamie.

1605
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:16,300
We have a treat.

1606
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,300
We made it.

1607
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,300
I know I'm excited.

1608
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,780
We've taken off the podcast because it sounds different.

1609
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,780
Yes.

1610
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:24,540
There's gonna be a lot different next week.

1611
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,100
Devil's food cake in the studio, hopefully.

1612
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,100
Oh my God.

1613
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,100
That's what I want.

1614
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,100
That's how we celebrate.

1615
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,100
You know what we're talking about.

1616
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,340
What are we going to do for episode 66?

1617
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,700
We eat devil's food cake.

1618
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:33,700
There's the celebration.

1619
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,700
I love it.

1620
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,180
I'm down for that.

1621
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:40,020
I got the day off, OK?

1622
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,020
That's great.

1623
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,020
It is great.

1624
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:44,300
Y'all should come to the bar with me like the night before.

1625
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,300
Should I cancel the order then for the three live chickens because I figured we'd just

1626
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,420
kill them.

1627
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,220
That was every D&D game every week.

1628
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,580
I've got that down to a science.

1629
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:53,580
All right.

1630
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:59,720
Anyway, no, no, we don't need the live chickens, but we do need chicken strips.

1631
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,780
Just saying we do need chicken strips.

1632
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,740
Anyway, that's going to do it.

1633
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:07,780
A nice five star review, of course, on a site like iTunes or Google, wherever you found

1634
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,980
this show is going to go a long way as well.

1635
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:12,620
Before we wrap up, of course, we have to get everybody's final thought.

1636
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,780
Alan, thank you for filling in, even though it was a shorter show tonight, but it was

1637
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,940
great to have you back on the show.

1638
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:19,100
And I say that because I'm completely biased.

1639
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,100
Yeah.

1640
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,520
So thanks for having me.

1641
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,520
You're welcome.

1642
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,660
But, you know, you can kind of invite yourself on whenever you want.

1643
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:25,660
Oh, I do.

1644
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:27,980
I'll just walk up and snatch the mic out of your hand.

1645
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:30,220
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1646
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,220
I like pizza.

1647
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,220
I'm going to make a pizza.

1648
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,220
Sounds good.

1649
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:34,220
P as easy.

1650
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:36,220
I was saying that.

1651
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,220
All right.

1652
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:44,520
Anyway, my final thought tonight is I'm excited for Pokemon this weekend and the Overwatch

1653
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,800
free weekend and lots of games ahead.

1654
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,800
Yay.

1655
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,800
Yay games.

1656
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,560
And Dark Soccer, last but not least.

1657
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,720
And you'll be here next week.

1658
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,400
You get two Jamie shows in a row.

1659
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:58,800
And then we're only going to lose you for what, like two more weeks and you're back

1660
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,800
full time, right?

1661
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,600
Like December 10th or something was your first show back?

1662
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,600
11th?

1663
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,600
Something like that?

1664
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,600
No, it's the 18th.

1665
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,600
Oh, okay.

1666
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,600
So maybe three weeks.

1667
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,600
Yeah.

1668
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,600
All right.

1669
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,600
But something like that.

1670
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,600
But you'll be back full time soon.

1671
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,600
Yeah.

1672
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,600
But in the meantime, give us a really good final thought.

1673
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,600
I got to pee.

1674
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,160
I guess that's what we get.

1675
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,160
Anyway.

1676
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,480
Thank you guys very much for listening to the show.

1677
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,320
We'll be back live on Sunday.

1678
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,320
Good night.

1679
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:27,120
