This week, Hello Games pushed a No Man's Sky feature update, features that Hello Games

00:17.760 --> 00:20.880
undoubtedly hopes will restore play hours and re-engage players.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.720
And that's just the tip of the week's gaming news.

00:22.720 --> 00:29.840
Stay tuned for this and more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.200
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.200 --> 00:37.880
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.880 --> 00:45.160
It is episode number 667 tonight for this November the 27th of 2016.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.600
And we here at OLR hope you all had a happy and safe Thanksgiving, at least those of you

00:49.600 --> 00:52.400
in the States, those of you abroad and other countries.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.520
Well, I hope you had a good week.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.400
I hope you had fun watching all those clips of people beating each other up for toasters

00:57.400 --> 00:58.880
on Black Friday sales.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.440
But meanwhile, we'll talk about any video game deals maybe we got, or you guys got,

01:03.440 --> 01:04.680
in our chat room.

01:04.680 --> 01:10.400
Live here in our studio, studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California is myself, Rob Roberts,

01:10.400 --> 01:13.760
and joining me by my side as he always is, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.760
Hello.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
Hi, Loki, how are you doing?

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
Doing alright.

01:16.760 --> 01:17.760
Did you have a good holiday?

01:17.760 --> 01:20.300
Yeah, I still have a, I got a bit of a cold, but it's not bad.

01:20.300 --> 01:23.960
I have like a little bit, like I was really sick like a few weeks ago, you guys probably

01:23.960 --> 01:26.220
remember that because I think I missed a show because of it.

01:26.220 --> 01:31.020
But yeah, I feel like I like, like another cold might be trying to come in, but it kind

01:31.020 --> 01:36.060
of can't maybe because my body's still, yeah, it's just minor and like just stuffed up.

01:36.060 --> 01:37.060
Yeah.

01:37.060 --> 01:41.220
Well, I should mention Dark Sakura, even though you guys know she's been on leave, she was

01:41.220 --> 01:42.620
actually going to try to be here tonight.

01:42.620 --> 01:46.060
She'd got the night off work and everything, but she actually got really sick, like had

01:46.060 --> 01:48.320
to go to the doctor and get pills type of sick.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.460
So if she's out there listening, hope you feel better soon, Dark Sakura.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.460
Sorry.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.900
She couldn't, she couldn't be here when she thought she could be, but she will be joining

01:54.900 --> 01:59.460
us after her work conflict ends mid December, so I think her first show back will be December

01:59.460 --> 02:01.020
18th.

02:01.020 --> 02:05.060
Hopefully we'll bring her to you via Radio Magic for a couple of episodes in between,

02:05.060 --> 02:08.100
but for now you stuck with just Loki and I, so deal with it.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.100
Yep.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.160
Did you get caught up in any of the shopping stuff?

02:11.160 --> 02:13.680
You probably don't really do that stuff, right?

02:13.680 --> 02:14.680
Really I didn't.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.860
I mean, the only thing I was going to do, cause I've been meaning to replace it for

02:17.860 --> 02:25.980
a while, is I replaced my Boxee, basically my streaming device, which I was looking at

02:25.980 --> 02:29.700
maybe getting like Roku or something, and mainly because, I mean, we were using Netflix

02:29.700 --> 02:32.860
on the PlayStation, but I wanted to use that for games instead.

02:32.860 --> 02:33.860
Right.

02:33.860 --> 02:36.180
You talked a little bit about this conflict, I think last week on the show or the week

02:36.180 --> 02:37.180
before.

02:37.180 --> 02:41.260
So I was looking at a Roku and I almost got one of the Roku premieres, but I ended up

02:41.260 --> 02:47.220
going with, it's called a, ironically a My Box or Me Box or something.

02:47.220 --> 02:54.060
I think it's My Box, is how they pronounce it, and it's basically an Android TV device.

02:54.060 --> 02:59.660
Which is cool, cause you know, I have an Android account, a Google account, and it runs pretty

02:59.660 --> 03:00.660
well.

03:00.660 --> 03:05.660
So I mean, you can put games on it apparently, I have not tried to do that yet, but for Netflix

03:05.660 --> 03:06.900
it works pretty awesome.

03:06.900 --> 03:12.900
It's also got that Pluto TV, which has a Mystery Science, actually several Mystery Science

03:13.900 --> 03:17.260
channels, they're live streaming all the time, I was like, this is fantastic.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.820
I have never heard of Pluto TV.

03:18.820 --> 03:23.260
Yeah, Pluto TV, it's an app, it's just like a live streaming app, and they have like different

03:23.260 --> 03:29.020
streams for, also just stuff, like they have stand-up comedy, they have like an IGN one,

03:29.020 --> 03:33.780
they have one that's like video games, but it was weird, cause it was like, I think I

03:33.780 --> 03:37.020
was playing some really old videos, cause they were like showing like, talking about

03:37.020 --> 03:41.740
the upcoming Lost Odyssey 3, or not Lost Odyssey 3, Lost Planet 3 or something like that, I'm

03:41.740 --> 03:43.580
like, uh, that's pretty old.

03:43.580 --> 03:46.140
Okay, this was like old stuff, like G4 reruns or something.

03:46.140 --> 03:50.460
Like that one, yeah, that was, but it had Mystery Science 3 3000, I mean a few channels

03:50.460 --> 03:54.260
of that, and what's kinda cool about it though is, like I was looking at maybe doing Sling

03:54.260 --> 04:00.180
with it, the only thing, cause it comes with two months free for Sling, and with that it

04:00.180 --> 04:04.580
has live streams as well, live channels, cause they're cable channels, but what's cool about

04:04.580 --> 04:08.960
it in the Android TV is you can mix and match these live streams, so like, there's actually

04:08.960 --> 04:17.040
a live TV or live channel app, and you can say, okay, I wanna pull the streams from this

04:17.040 --> 04:22.020
Pluto TV, and I also want like actual cable channels in there, and I want this other stuff,

04:22.020 --> 04:27.000
so you can mix like the Mystery Science 3 3000, you know, channel with TNT and Comedy

04:27.000 --> 04:31.920
Central and all sorts of stuff, so it's like pretty cool, that's like kinda what I wanted.

04:31.920 --> 04:36.520
Problem is that live streaming, that live app doesn't quite work, but the individual

04:36.520 --> 04:41.720
apps work, so I'm probably gonna end up picking up Hulu. There's so many, I'm sorry, but there's

04:41.720 --> 04:44.960
so many of these like individual streaming apps now, it's like, I remember when it was

04:44.960 --> 04:48.800
like Netflix and Hulu and that's really it, but now it seems like everybody wants a piece

04:48.800 --> 04:52.040
of this, this is what I was afraid of, when HBO got one and Showtime got one. Pluto, what's

04:52.040 --> 04:56.040
the name of Pluto, it's free. Okay, that's good. It sounds like it's just drawing from

04:56.040 --> 04:59.800
all these existing like internet streams and stuff. I think it is, it's just an aggregate,

04:59.800 --> 05:03.920
but it works really nice, and actually, you know what, I'm not sure if it is pulling from

05:03.920 --> 05:08.800
all this, but it's got like, you know, between each like episode, it has commercials, like

05:08.800 --> 05:13.560
actual commercials, and it also, like it looks fancy, it looks like you're watching a TV

05:13.560 --> 05:17.720
channel, so I'm not really sure what it is, but it works cool. That's cool. And you know,

05:17.720 --> 05:21.720
the remote's neat and stuff, it has like voice search and stuff like that, and I think it's

05:21.720 --> 05:26.560
just like it's a nice little compact box, and it wasn't that expensive, so I'm pretty

05:26.560 --> 05:30.280
satisfied with it, and I also removed all the bloat off of it, you know, before I messed

05:30.280 --> 05:33.200
with stuff, so. And what was it called, My Box, so somebody in chat was asking. Yeah,

05:33.200 --> 05:38.480
it's called a My Box, or Me Box, it's some Chinese, they sell them at like Walmart, that's

05:38.480 --> 05:45.120
why I bought it, and it was the same, it was $10 cheaper than the Roku Premier, which feature-wise

05:45.120 --> 05:49.360
is pretty similar. Okay. So, and plus, you know, Walmart is doing a special where they

05:49.360 --> 05:55.480
gave you two months of, of Sling, but normally when they're not doing that, this still comes

05:55.480 --> 06:00.520
with two months of Sling, so that's $50 right there. Wow. There's still so many, and I got

06:00.520 --> 06:05.920
suckered into another one, you know, I subscribed to CBS All Access now, and I only, I only

06:05.920 --> 06:11.280
did it so I could watch frickin' Big Brother Over the Top, which has kind of ended as a

06:11.280 --> 06:14.280
flop season. It comes with a free month of that, by the way, as well. Does it really?

06:14.280 --> 06:18.520
Yeah. Oh, it's a bump. So a free month of that. Wait to cash that in until they do Star

06:18.520 --> 06:23.080
Trek Discovery at this point. I don't really care, but I'm gonna, I seriously, I'm probably

06:23.080 --> 06:27.480
gonna do Hulu because it's like, you know, another eight bucks, and I may do Sling because

06:27.480 --> 06:33.320
it's, it's $25. And right there, those two were basically what I was getting with PlayStation

06:33.320 --> 06:38.160
View, which I have canceled because they removed all the good channels off of it. Comedy Central's

06:38.160 --> 06:42.120
gone. Oh no. Yeah, they were, like, there's some deal that fell through, and so they removed

06:42.120 --> 06:46.960
all these, like, Viacom channels. I'm like, fuck that. I'm, I was watching Comedy Central.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.960
That's really what I wanted it from, and it's not there anymore. I'm like, nope. I'm not

06:50.960 --> 06:57.640
going back. So yeah, I mean, it looks cool. Okay. Well, I'm, I'm glad to see it sounds

06:57.640 --> 07:02.280
like maybe you've, you've hopefully found a box to mediate the TV and game situation

07:02.280 --> 07:08.860
in your home. Yes, I have. Good, good. Glad to hear it. Um, let's see. Uh, Kaijuto, Kaijuto

07:08.860 --> 07:12.760
in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com arguing me, with me saying, Big Brother Over

07:12.760 --> 07:17.080
the Top is not a flop just cause Justin is in bed. This is an epic season. It's the best

07:17.080 --> 07:22.000
Big Brother in a long time. No, I, I actually agree. It, it was, it was an amazing Big Brother,

07:22.000 --> 07:27.320
but it's like, I'm not very inspired by who's left in the game. Uh, I, I would like Justin

07:27.320 --> 07:30.520
to win out of who's left. And, and also the other thing I was going to mention too, it

07:30.520 --> 07:34.480
is 4K capable as well. That's one of the reasons I purchased it, because eventually I am going

07:34.480 --> 07:40.200
to get a 4K TV, and that's why I was between the Premiere, or the Roku Premiere, or this,

07:40.200 --> 07:46.600
because they both output the 4K. Uh, AkumaJP in our chatroom, uh, again, over at live.vognetwork.com

07:46.640 --> 07:50.120
and just a quick plug, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network,

07:50.120 --> 07:55.320
vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com. Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right

07:55.320 --> 08:00.520
after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Uh, AkumaJP's in chat, and if you are, uh, listening, you

08:00.520 --> 08:05.760
should join our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Akuma just says, Stupid people here, even

08:05.760 --> 08:09.840
though we have Black Friday, but they, or even though, I think that's, we don't have

08:09.840 --> 08:14.200
Black Friday, cause in Japan they don't, you know, Thanksgiving is not as it is here in

08:14.200 --> 08:17.480
the States. So, stupid people here, even though we don't have Black Friday, but they

08:17.480 --> 08:21.960
make Black Friday sales anyway. I heard that was the thing, that more and more countries

08:21.960 --> 08:25.920
are trying to kind of get on the Black Friday thing. In fact, I thought I saw a video, and

08:25.920 --> 08:29.320
it was trying to be a very, like, tongue in cheek sort of thing, where it was like, look

08:29.320 --> 08:33.800
at this Black Friday chaos in Canada, and it was just all these people casually walking

08:33.800 --> 08:38.040
into a Best Buy, like, you know, oh, hello, how do you do, you know, they're too, oh,

08:38.040 --> 08:41.080
sorry. Yeah, yeah, sorry about that, sorry about that. Uh, and then, uh, you know, the

08:41.080 --> 08:44.720
Best Buy people applauding, it was like really funny, with the Tim Hortons cups and everything,

08:44.720 --> 08:51.280
it was like really funny, you know, um, but obviously Canada's Thanksgiving is weeks earlier,

08:51.280 --> 08:56.840
and my understanding is that Canada has Boxing Day after Christmas, which was a similar sort

08:56.840 --> 09:00.960
of thing, but now I guess one day isn't enough, they have to get in on, on Black Friday as

09:00.960 --> 09:03.880
well. Oh yeah, I mean, all the stores are getting in on Black Friday, and it's like

09:03.880 --> 09:08.440
cyber, it's like, I don't know what they call it, like cyber week or Thanksgiving. Cyber

09:08.440 --> 09:12.560
Monday now. No, no, I understand it's Cyber Monday, but they've been doing like this Black

09:12.560 --> 09:17.720
Friday thing like all week, so it's, it's not just that, I mean, I don't know what you

09:17.720 --> 09:21.960
call it, cyber discount, I don't know what they're calling it, cyber week or something,

09:21.960 --> 09:26.120
but yeah, it's, it's, they keep extending it, like they do Christmas, eventually it's

09:26.120 --> 09:33.080
gonna be Black Friday from July on or whatever. I'll be interested to see how the, um, sales

09:33.080 --> 09:38.320
numbers look, because I'll tell you what, uh, yesterday, Saturday, um, I went on a little

09:38.320 --> 09:41.760
road trip with Shane and Extover, you know, two pals of mine that you probably know from

09:41.760 --> 09:45.760
other shows on VOG Network, um, and we went up to a town a couple hours north of here

09:45.760 --> 09:50.080
called Chico, um, because there's this really good Mongolian barbecue place there that we

09:50.080 --> 09:54.760
wanted to eat at, and, um, you know, some of their stores, because they're not as trafficked

09:54.760 --> 09:59.560
as stores say in Sacramento and stuff, um, Shane really likes to look for his Power Ranger

09:59.560 --> 10:03.480
stuff, uh, which if you listen to a show, the Ranger Pride cast, you know all about

10:03.480 --> 10:07.360
his collecting. So anyway, we went to the Target up there and the Toys R Us up there,

10:07.360 --> 10:10.760
and I got to say, especially considering it was Saturday on this big sale weekend, like

10:10.760 --> 10:15.960
it wasn't that crowded at all. Like it was, it was maybe like a busy, busy evening or

10:15.960 --> 10:19.000
something. Well, I think a lot of people, if they're going to those Black Friday sales,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.800
they're going like first thing on Thursday and then it's died down. Well, but here's

10:23.800 --> 10:27.720
the thing, when we were walking through, not just Target, but Walmart as well, they still

10:27.720 --> 10:32.200
had a ton of the TVs that were the deep discount, like the stuff you would expect would be the

10:32.200 --> 10:38.120
first thing gone. Like even I had that moment of, should I just get one of these $500 TVs?

10:38.120 --> 10:42.680
Cause it's right there in front of my face and I do need a 4k TV. But then rational Rob

10:42.680 --> 10:48.400
spoke up and said, no idiot, you just dropped, you know, $1,200 on a TV this year and it's

10:48.400 --> 10:53.360
your own damn fault that you missed the 4k bus. So I'm going to wait a little longer

10:53.360 --> 10:57.120
for allowing myself a new TV, but they only get cheaper and they're only going to get

10:57.120 --> 11:03.000
better too. That's, that's very true. So, um, yeah, so, uh, yeah, I just thought that

11:03.000 --> 11:07.160
was interesting that I didn't, I didn't really notice a lot of traffic and even at the stores,

11:07.160 --> 11:11.360
you know, granted what you said is that, you know, most of it was probably Thursday, Friday.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.200
It still seemed like there was a lot of merchandise. Granted, I was in a different town where maybe

11:15.200 --> 11:20.360
it's a different flow by like, I mean, I don't have a lot of extra money to go spend on stuff

11:20.360 --> 11:23.720
like that. I mean, definitely I'm looking at 4k TVs and some of them are even pretty

11:23.760 --> 11:30.280
inexpensive, like $300, $400 for basically the same size TV I have now. I'm like, maybe,

11:30.280 --> 11:34.480
I mean, it's something I'll get later on when I have something that really uses that. I

11:34.480 --> 11:39.880
mean, granted, you know, the streaming thing does it, but I don't know. I mean, it, we'll

11:39.880 --> 11:45.400
see. Um, I'm more of looking at it like a game console or something like that. Um, but

11:45.400 --> 11:52.800
yeah, I did a lot. I mean, most of my shopping was online and it was mostly on the PlayStation

11:52.800 --> 11:56.040
network. You know, and I think that's where a lot of people are going is online. I think

11:56.040 --> 12:00.280
that has a lot of retailers kind of, uh, creeped out, you know, a vid power and chat says dual

12:00.280 --> 12:05.020
shock fours are $34 on Amazon right now. That doesn't, that matches the deal Best Buy was

12:05.020 --> 12:09.200
having, right? I think Amazon like just matches a lot of what these other Black Friday deals

12:09.200 --> 12:14.400
are. And so, you know, people are like, they see the videos on like, maybe if all the videos

12:14.400 --> 12:18.820
looked like the video in Canada, people wouldn't be so adverse to go into the store, but no,

12:18.820 --> 12:22.440
we see the videos that people in Walmart like dog piling on each other fighting for a TV

12:22.480 --> 12:26.080
and all this like crazy stuff. And you're like, nope, I want no part of that. I'm not

12:26.080 --> 12:29.960
going out with that. I will just click the buy it now on Amazon. That's much easier.

12:29.960 --> 12:36.280
And so I don't know, maybe, maybe retailers will have to do something to make the experience

12:36.280 --> 12:41.080
a little more like it is in Canada. Make people behave. I don't know. I don't know how a retailer

12:41.080 --> 12:44.880
does that. I agree. I mean, and I think there now that with so many online options that

12:44.880 --> 12:48.240
a lot of people aren't going to stores is there's, unless there's something that they

12:48.240 --> 12:52.400
really want. And a lot of the times that, you know, they know what the deals are going

12:52.400 --> 12:56.400
to be ahead of time, which is nice. So you know whether it's worth it going out there.

12:56.400 --> 13:01.520
And a lot of it, you can just kind of compare online before you even mess with it. It's,

13:01.520 --> 13:04.600
it's just so easy to go online, especially now with Cyber Monday, there's going to be

13:04.600 --> 13:10.600
even more stuff. So yeah, why bother? No, I'm not going to the store. Fuck that. I don't

13:10.600 --> 13:17.680
really have an extensive Christmas list. And you know, the people that I would buy, um,

13:17.680 --> 13:23.480
I would buy gifts for, I don't think I would buy televisions for, you know what I mean?

13:23.480 --> 13:27.160
Maybe my mother, if she strongly hinted she wanted one, I would buy her a new TV, but

13:27.160 --> 13:30.560
that's, that's about it. You know what I mean? I don't usually have that kind of budget to

13:30.560 --> 13:35.080
spend that kind of money, you know, and Alan and I kind of, I don't, we don't, we don't

13:35.080 --> 13:38.760
really go all out for holidays. Cause like, we're just the type of household where if

13:38.760 --> 13:43.920
we see something, we buy it, you know, we don't, we don't wait until December 25th.

13:43.920 --> 13:48.120
I don't know. Anyway, but every, every household's different for sure. For sure. Uh, anyway,

13:48.120 --> 13:51.680
let's move on. We spent a good time talking about Black Friday, but the real kickoff topic

13:51.680 --> 13:56.480
I wanted to talk about tonight is, you know, um, it has been a slower news week because

13:56.480 --> 14:00.120
of the holiday in the States. You don't have, you know, the news cycle pretty much came

14:00.120 --> 14:03.640
to an abrupt stop on Thursday and Friday. There wasn't as much coverage of what was

14:03.640 --> 14:09.400
going on. Um, but you know, we are on the eve of a major, major game release coming

14:09.400 --> 14:15.440
up this week. Uh, at least of a series that I have a lot of, you know, um, love for, and

14:15.440 --> 14:23.560
that's Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 15, finally, finally releasing, uh, Tuesday. Uh, some people

14:23.560 --> 14:27.880
lucky enough to get it early. I've really tried to stay away from all that stuff. I

14:27.880 --> 14:32.280
haven't been watching any live streams or YouTube's, uh, just outside of, you know,

14:32.280 --> 14:36.800
the stuff that was out there a couple months ago when, when, uh, Square did their big reveal

14:36.840 --> 14:40.760
of the release date that they didn't even make and all that stuff that was out there.

14:40.760 --> 14:46.360
So, um, you know, I've kind of been taking the, the concept of what happened with No Man's Sky,

14:46.360 --> 14:52.120
which I really know is ironic here because we do a podcast about video games, but I think we can

14:52.120 --> 14:58.520
still temper our expectations and not buy into hype a lot. Even like, I haven't been hyped about

14:58.520 --> 15:03.640
it and I didn't like, honestly, even I'm still picking it up because it's Final Fantasy and I

15:03.720 --> 15:09.480
like Final Fantasy, but like, I think there's something you just have to admit. Yes. I'm buying

15:09.480 --> 15:14.120
it just because it's with the comments. It's kind of like, I really don't care for this too much,

15:14.120 --> 15:22.280
but I'll try it. But Final Fantasy, like I, it's just such a legendary series to me. I mean,

15:22.280 --> 15:26.120
I'm not just talking about the fact that I play 14 probably more than any other game right now,

15:26.120 --> 15:32.040
but I'm talking about the fact like this goes back to playing on the NES with my best friend

15:32.040 --> 15:36.520
at the time. And we could get all the way to Tiamat, which is like towards the end of the game,

15:36.520 --> 15:41.400
we could not beat that motherfucker for all it's worth and everything we tried. I remember getting

15:41.400 --> 15:46.600
very frustrated with that and then playing Final Fantasy II, which yes, I know it's really Final

15:46.600 --> 15:52.040
Fantasy IV, but I'm sorry, certain things I'm just tied to, but playing Final Fantasy II on the Super

15:52.040 --> 15:56.840
Nintendo, you know, and, uh, playing through that whole experience, you know, a little more on my

15:56.840 --> 16:02.040
own, but the story in that game, just phenomenal, you know, for a video games just didn't have

16:02.040 --> 16:06.920
stories like that at the time. It was very, very rare to go that deep. Um, and then that was a

16:06.920 --> 16:11.880
tradition that continued with Final Fantasy III or yes, Final Fantasy VI. But, you know, I just,

16:12.600 --> 16:16.920
wow. I mean, those games like blew me away as a kid. So it just made me a fan of the series for

16:16.920 --> 16:23.320
life, I think in many ways. Well, and you know, with, here's my gripe about some of the Final

16:23.320 --> 16:30.040
Fantasy games as of late, the stories are so damn hard to follow. Like 13, like there, it was just

16:30.040 --> 16:35.160
like, here's this, let me just vomit, like the whole lore in front of your face. And like, you

16:35.160 --> 16:39.320
just can't follow any of the fucking thing. And it's, and even at the end, you kind of have like

16:39.960 --> 16:45.720
a better idea, but it's, it's so hard to follow. And like, I mean, the demo for Final Fantasy 15

16:45.720 --> 16:48.680
kind of is the same way. It's like, I don't know what the fuck is going on. So they broke down

16:48.680 --> 16:53.000
their car. Why are they doing all this shit? Why? Hey, my car broke down. Let's go kill those deer

16:53.000 --> 16:56.360
over there. I mean, that's kind of like the equivalent of that. It's like, that's what people

16:56.360 --> 17:01.320
do. It's just like, man, I'm tired of waiting for my car. Let's go break that animal's neck. I mean,

17:01.320 --> 17:08.680
it's like, I don't know, but whatever. It's Final Fantasy. I'll check it out. But I don't know what

17:08.680 --> 17:12.200
the fuck's going on in this game. And like, I know that they have like a prequel movie. It's like,

17:12.200 --> 17:15.640
do I have to fucking watch the movie in order to understand what's going on in this game? I mean,

17:15.640 --> 17:21.320
I don't know. So I just hope that going into it, that the story's laid out better than 13,

17:21.320 --> 17:25.560
because 13, I still don't know what the fuck, I didn't finish it, but I still don't know what

17:25.560 --> 17:29.560
the fuck was going on. I confused the hell out of everything. Then don't play, for the love of God,

17:29.560 --> 17:33.560
don't play the sequel because then they introduce time hopping into it. And it's just like, you'll

17:33.560 --> 17:37.960
go cross-eyed. Because now not only, but now, but this happened in the future and this happened in

17:37.960 --> 17:41.320
the past. And then when this happens in the past, it affects this in the future. And yeah, you'll

17:41.320 --> 17:49.240
go crazy. You'll go absolutely crazy. Anyway, all that joking aside, yeah, I'm really just trying

17:49.240 --> 17:54.360
to not like expect too much from the game and read too much in the story so that hopefully

17:54.360 --> 17:58.280
it will all kind of come together when the game comes out. Although I know people,

17:59.400 --> 18:04.200
and I feel the same way, is that I understand that Final Fantasy 15 has an anime behind it,

18:04.840 --> 18:08.040
right? There's that whole brotherhood, like an hour of YouTube.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.600
It looked cool. Yeah, I watched the 12 minute clip of it.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.880
And then there's the movie, but it's like, I really...

18:13.880 --> 18:15.560
So there's the movie and the anime?

18:15.560 --> 18:19.560
Yeah, there's both. There's a fully CGI movie as well.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.240
Yeah, it's a movie is what I saw at 12 minutes ago.

18:21.240 --> 18:25.960
Okay. Yeah. So there's also an anime. And there's all these side cell phone games and all this

18:25.960 --> 18:32.840
stuff. But my point is, is that I really hope that stuff is not required to understand the game.

18:33.400 --> 18:39.240
That stuff, if it's good, should enhance the game. And that's one thing that kind of bugged me about

18:39.240 --> 18:43.960
World of Warcraft sometimes is that like major things that happen between patch to patch. Well,

18:43.960 --> 18:48.520
if you wanted to know what happened, you have to read the book. And it's like, I don't want to

18:48.520 --> 18:53.960
read the book. I don't want to read. Like I'm playing a video game. Show me. That kind of stuff

18:53.960 --> 18:58.120
is very frustrating. So I hope that doesn't happen in Final Fantasy 15. But we'll see.

18:58.840 --> 19:05.480
Anyway, also should be pointed out, Final Fantasy 15, they are going to be getting a day one patch

19:05.480 --> 19:09.320
after all. I thought the delay was to prevent a day one patch. I thought that was the whole reason

19:09.320 --> 19:15.720
they pushed it back. Well, it was to, I mean, they're going to fix everything, but then it's

19:15.720 --> 19:20.280
always fixing stuff. So I don't, maybe they'll reduce the size of the patch. Maybe. I'm thinking

19:20.280 --> 19:24.840
the day one stuff is an enhancement patch or what they're calling the crown update. And they're

19:24.840 --> 19:29.880
saying it's going to add features to the game to make up for forcing everyone to wait longer for

19:29.880 --> 19:36.120
the game to come out. So there's an improved camera for narrow areas. Something, the weight

19:36.120 --> 19:40.600
mode feature gets expanded a little bit, uh, which is the whole fact that you can actually

19:40.600 --> 19:46.280
set the game to pause. So that's not so fast. And I guess, yeah, I'm only candy. I know. Right.

19:47.400 --> 19:53.400
Like old basis. It's. I like the turn-based system. I don't know what all the haters were,

19:53.400 --> 19:58.040
you know, hating on the turn-based system, but I love it. And that's why I liked loss Odyssey,

19:58.040 --> 20:03.320
because it was the turn-based system. Yeah. It was fucking awesome. Yeah. Um, a monster flute

20:03.320 --> 20:08.920
that will summon monsters, more fish and more recipes. And you can upload pictures

20:08.920 --> 20:14.040
that prompto takes directly to Facebook and Twitter for all that social media hype.

20:16.200 --> 20:20.680
Does every fucking game need to have like fishing and fucking selfies and shit in it? I mean,

20:20.680 --> 20:25.720
come on now. What I thought was also interesting is that, uh, is he a character that you control?

20:25.720 --> 20:29.960
Because that'd be pretty awesome. If, if I think it's just an AI character, this is one of the

20:29.960 --> 20:34.200
bros. Right. I understand that, but it'd be awesome if it was just, you know, he's AI

20:34.200 --> 20:38.520
controlled. He's taking pictures of shit is, you know, that would be kind of cool. That would be

20:38.520 --> 20:42.440
like, uh, that would be like the dude who comes down in random moments and earthbound and says,

20:42.440 --> 20:48.440
now say fuzzy pickles. Uh, anyway, uh, Hajime Tabata also went on to say, uh, Hey,

20:48.440 --> 20:53.160
I know that copies are out there circulating early basically and say, you know, stressing

20:53.160 --> 20:58.200
everybody worked really hard on this. Please don't spoil the game before the game is actually

20:58.200 --> 21:03.640
on sale. The direct quote is we may be unable to anticipate the spoiler videos and such that

21:03.640 --> 21:08.440
appear as a result of this. We hope that everyone looking forward to final fantasy 15 can be very

21:08.440 --> 21:13.960
careful. We are also doing our best to prevent the circulation of leaked videos to those who

21:13.960 --> 21:18.120
received the game early. Please be considerate to those looking forward to the official release of

21:18.120 --> 21:23.880
this title. Now it says to me, and I will say this upfront, I know nothing about 15's plot,

21:23.880 --> 21:27.320
but this all says to me, somebody dies and they don't want you to know who.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.280
Well, I think, I mean, people want to get the video out there first because

21:32.280 --> 21:35.480
that's the YouTube hits and that's money. And you know, it's all about that.

21:37.400 --> 21:43.320
Anyway, uh, looking at some of the chats in our, uh, uh, chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Um,

21:43.320 --> 21:49.400
Akuma JP says, Prompto, he is AI. So, huh, interesting. Uh, and Akuma JP says, it's not

21:49.400 --> 21:55.160
required the, uh, additional stuff. Uh, but you will have more fun if you know the history and

21:55.160 --> 22:00.040
why or how they go to war. Yeah, I'm fine with that. In fact, you know, I kind of want to see

22:00.040 --> 22:04.360
the anime and movie cause it looked cool. Just like the first 12 minutes, like pretty awesome.

22:04.360 --> 22:11.080
Um, I don't know. I mean, I'm interested. I just like the demo. Sierra Lee didn't do it for me,

22:11.080 --> 22:15.240
which is unfortunate. I mean, I got an idea of what the game was, but like, I still didn't

22:15.240 --> 22:20.040
understand what the game is and stopping and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, ha ha ha,

22:20.040 --> 22:27.560
Rob, you're so cute in believing delay excuses. Well, look, I, what can I, I mean, I, I think,

22:27.560 --> 22:31.800
you know, and in the back of my mind, I always kind of thought it failed certification. That's,

22:31.800 --> 22:35.160
that's the real reason I got to it failed certification. Then they had to delay it,

22:35.160 --> 22:38.920
but we don't have proof. Nobody's saying that. So I can really only,

22:39.560 --> 22:44.760
I can really only just have that leap of faith and, and trust what they say. But believe me,

22:45.000 --> 22:50.680
I understand your cynic perspective in that regard too. So every single patch update,

22:50.680 --> 22:55.320
just like Minecraft needs to have like removed Sephiroth. Cause you know, they always like to

22:55.320 --> 23:01.640
add Sephiroth into these games is like an added bonus. Akuma JP also says, has she made to bottom

23:01.640 --> 23:07.320
made crisis core and final fantasy zero. Of course somebody is going to die. So that's just,

23:07.320 --> 23:11.240
that's what we do now. That's right. I have another final fancy game. I don't play. I completely

23:11.240 --> 23:16.360
forgot. I bought that for the demo of final fantasy type zero and all that type zero.

23:16.360 --> 23:23.000
Whoops. Yeah, that gave me an impression on me. All right. And yeah, as Joe and a mat says,

23:23.000 --> 23:27.320
no one is showing the receipts for why there was a delay. So we just have to take their word for it.

23:27.320 --> 23:30.360
That's right. And they're not going to come out and say, yo, we failed certification or,

23:30.360 --> 23:33.880
or Hey, we had this major game breaking. They're going to have a guest character.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.800
Eric's going to show up all of a sudden she gets run through with a sword again. Sephiroth there.

23:37.800 --> 23:42.520
It's like, ah, you know, it's this all over. Well, you know, in the car you can listen to

23:42.520 --> 23:48.600
final fantasy, greatest hit tracks. So hopefully they have like, uh, the, the one winged angel

23:48.600 --> 23:51.880
that you can actually play in the car while you're driving around. Cause I don't know about you,

23:51.880 --> 23:58.920
Loki, but I do that anyway in my own car. I think I would probably like, cause I don't remember the

23:58.920 --> 24:03.640
demo. You have to fight the behemoth or whatever. Just run that over with the car. Just like drive

24:03.720 --> 24:08.920
right into that sucker. Doesn't the car fly? Just drive straight through his forehead. Yeah.

24:08.920 --> 24:13.640
Well, I'm really, really looking forward to final fantasy 15. I have to decide like how much of it

24:13.640 --> 24:18.040
do I want to stream? Because I, I realized like everybody's going to be streaming it probably,

24:18.040 --> 24:22.360
especially on Tuesday when everybody gets the game. But I think, I think I probably will do a

24:22.360 --> 24:27.720
bit of streaming just, especially in talking to Bobby, uh, just before we went live tonight. Um,

24:27.720 --> 24:33.560
he kind of said, I'm waiting to see some of the early streams to see like what the options really

24:33.560 --> 24:38.440
look like or what the combat really looks like, um, type of thing. So, um, for that reason,

24:38.440 --> 24:42.600
I'll probably do at least a few streams the first couple of days of the game, but I don't know,

24:42.600 --> 24:46.680
I don't know if I could stream all 70 hours or whatever it's going to take me to beat it.

24:46.680 --> 24:51.160
I won't be streaming shit because there's not enough bandwidth in the house to do Netflix and

24:51.160 --> 24:55.640
fucking play the game. And sometimes there's not even enough. Yeah. To do both of those. I mean,

24:56.840 --> 25:01.160
for some stupid reason, like even though like it's streaming over my network,

25:01.160 --> 25:07.800
I can't, I have a fucking gigabit internet, you know, within my home network. Right. That's not

25:07.800 --> 25:12.360
enough to stream the fucking shit to my laptop. That's literally sitting four feet away from the,

25:12.360 --> 25:18.760
you know, well not four feet, six feet away. Wireless though? Um, yeah, I've been doing

25:18.760 --> 25:22.680
a wireless, but I've got a, you know, um, what's automatically going to be like that one gigabyte

25:22.680 --> 25:27.640
gets slashed to whatever the wireless can handle. So I have wireless AC, so it should be able to

25:27.640 --> 25:33.720
handle that. Yeah. Maybe you got a lot of noise or something. Who knows? Um, all right. Anyway,

25:33.720 --> 25:37.320
uh, so I think that's all I really want to say about Final Fantasy 15. Obviously there'll be

25:37.320 --> 25:41.000
a lot more in this coming week. It's going to be a big week in games. I mean, this week's been a

25:41.000 --> 25:45.480
little, so now is the VR thing included in this or is that something that's coming later? That's

25:45.480 --> 25:50.040
lame. You know what else comes later? The patch for the PS4 pro that is not going to be out at

25:50.040 --> 25:54.440
launch that comes later. Don't care. Don't have, well, obviously you don't care, but I do have a

25:54.440 --> 25:58.760
PS4 pro and I was kind of looking forward to that increased frame rate since, you know,

25:58.760 --> 26:05.080
that's the one perk I get on my non 4k TV. So I'm a little disappointed. That's not going to be

26:05.080 --> 26:09.640
their launch day, but I'll probably still be playing by the time that patch hits. So it will

26:09.640 --> 26:14.760
be kind of interesting to see the before and after, if nothing else, there is that. So, um,

26:16.280 --> 26:21.160
anyway, uh, let's move on. I want to get into the other gaming news for this week and how was your

26:21.160 --> 26:25.480
gaming week? Uh, so let's get into our gaming week. So what types of video games you have been

26:25.480 --> 26:31.000
playing this week? Loki, what have you been playing? So I played, um, on Sunday, I had played

26:31.000 --> 26:35.800
a little bit of Watch Dogs 2 and actually got to try some of the online because I didn't realize

26:35.800 --> 26:40.840
that they had shuts or turned on some of those services. So, um, ironically enough, I want to

26:40.840 --> 26:46.440
say it was Dungeon Buster that jumped in. Um, it was done. I don't remember who was it. I think

26:46.440 --> 26:54.360
it was Dungeon Buster that, um, jumped in and, um, we played some co-op and that was fun. It had

26:54.360 --> 27:00.520
lots of chaos. So, um, definitely enjoying that. However, I didn't really play much of Watch Dogs

27:00.520 --> 27:06.520
2 because I've been purchasing things on the PlayStation store thanks to their like Black

27:06.520 --> 27:12.840
Friday, um, deals and stuff like that. So I ended up picking up Skyrim because Skyrim dropped to

27:12.840 --> 27:20.200
half price and then, you know, I wanted it for half price. Um, honestly, can't really tell the

27:20.200 --> 27:25.640
difference from the PlayStation 3 one. I mean, it's really, well, I mean, I, I didn't actually

27:25.640 --> 27:31.960
didn't have the PlayStation 3. I had it on a PC, but it's not, the change is not that noticeable.

27:31.960 --> 27:36.520
I mean, I know that they added more like foliage and stuff in the draw. This instance is longer,

27:36.520 --> 27:39.880
but it's not like, Whoa, this looks incredibly better. It's just like, yeah, this looks like

27:39.880 --> 27:46.840
Skyrim. But mods are fun. I'm having fun with mods. Um, but I mean, it's basically, it's playing

27:46.840 --> 27:53.960
like I do on PC. Um, so yeah, I mean, I don't know. It's going to waste a lot of my time though,

27:53.960 --> 28:00.520
unfortunately. Um, what else did I do? Um, they have that cool skin that came out now that I don't

28:00.520 --> 28:05.320
know if you picked it up for Rez, the, uh, the new background. No, I forgot to grab that. I should

28:05.400 --> 28:08.920
have. It's fucking awesome. Is it still up? I hope so. I don't know. It was free though.

28:08.920 --> 28:15.400
And for Rez's 15th, 15th anniversary. No, that can't be 15. Is it? No, I think it is. Yeah. I

28:15.400 --> 28:20.280
think it's like 15. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, go check it out. Um, it's free. It might be more. It might

28:20.280 --> 28:25.880
be more actually because no, it can't be 20. It's gotta be, but yeah, the Dreamcast was out nine,

28:25.880 --> 28:31.240
nine 99. So that, that would make sense. 2001 for Rez. That makes sense. Cause it was on PS2 as

28:31.320 --> 28:37.640
well. Right? Yeah. 2001 makes sense for that. You know, let's see here. So, and then

28:39.080 --> 28:45.720
what else did I play? I, yeah, it was dungeon monster. Yes. Okay. So, um, I also played,

28:47.240 --> 28:52.760
what else did I pick up? I purchased the, a couple more VR games cause they were on sale.

28:52.760 --> 28:59.880
So I picked up track mania cause track mania was down to like 15 bucks. So I was like, dude,

28:59.880 --> 29:03.400
I can't pass it up for that. Plus it has the VR mode. I haven't got a chance to try that yet

29:03.400 --> 29:08.760
because the problem with that is, you know, the setup required for that. It doesn't work really

29:08.760 --> 29:17.480
well when other people are trying to watch TV. Um, and then I picked up, I don't remember the

29:17.480 --> 29:22.280
other game was called now, but quick interjection while you're thinking Rez's release date was

29:22.280 --> 29:31.400
November 22nd, 2001 in Japan. It came out in the US, uh, in, uh, January of 2002. Yeah. Bound was

29:31.400 --> 29:36.760
the other game I think I got. Um, that was a VR game. So I checked that out and, or I haven't

29:36.760 --> 29:42.360
gotten to check that, but I did purchase as well, but mainly Skyrim. I've been playing a lot of

29:42.360 --> 29:47.240
that. It has been crashing by, I attribute that to like the 20 plus mods I have running on it.

29:47.240 --> 29:54.040
So that's fine. And I'm kind of okay with that. Um, I don't know. It's fun. It's got all the

29:54.040 --> 29:59.000
updates to it. I, you know, one of the things with Skyrim, I like a lot of the enhancements

29:59.000 --> 30:04.200
that people have made. Like there's, um, one of they've got better quest directions. So it'll like

30:04.200 --> 30:09.880
give you, you know, precise, here's what you need to do to finish this quest stuff. And the markers

30:09.880 --> 30:14.280
are more updated and stuff like that. So those enhancements really make the game kind of fun,

30:14.280 --> 30:18.120
kind of disappointed that it disables your trophies, but I understand because you can

30:18.120 --> 30:22.600
totally cheat your way through the whole game. But, uh, I really played for trophies anyways.

30:22.600 --> 30:26.440
Um, Fallout 4 was the other one I downloaded mods for, but I haven't gotten a chance to play that

30:26.440 --> 30:31.320
yet. Um, just because I'm too lazy to actually pop the disc into the machine and try it out.

30:31.320 --> 30:35.560
That's really lazy. But I did, I did pre-order Final Fantasy 15. So that should be unlocking

30:35.560 --> 30:40.600
for me at nine o'clock on Monday. Nice. I may, I may not get to play tomorrow night. I may have

30:40.600 --> 30:45.400
to wait till Tuesday cause I'm at the mercy of Amazon shipping. So I may not actually get it

30:45.400 --> 30:50.600
till Tuesday, but that's fine. If I miss a few hours, I'm not going to scream and cry about it.

30:50.600 --> 30:56.360
So it's fine. Yep. So I think that's everything. I mean, aside from, you know, Ingress, I did try

30:56.360 --> 31:01.720
Pokemon just to see the updates and stuff and the, you know, the near by features kind of nice,

31:01.720 --> 31:06.040
I guess. I still don't understand where things are, but it's like, at least I know it's near

31:06.040 --> 31:14.360
this Poke stop or something. Um, I mean, it's all right. That's it. All right. Um, my gimme week,

31:14.360 --> 31:18.680
I've been continuing on in Pokemon moon. Um, still playing that a little bit. Uh,

31:18.680 --> 31:22.600
Shane also helped me out because, you know, he went straight through the game and he's

31:22.600 --> 31:27.160
already beat it. And so he got me, uh, some of the starters. So now I have every starter

31:27.160 --> 31:31.880
in my Pokemon party. So that's kind of fun, uh, getting to play the game like that completely

31:31.880 --> 31:35.880
unbalanced, uh, for me, but that's okay. It'll give me incentive to get through the game,

31:35.880 --> 31:40.280
uh, and play through that more. Uh, we did tape a Poke stop podcast over the weekend,

31:40.280 --> 31:43.880
so that'll be up very soon. All right. When you guys are probably hearing this,

31:43.880 --> 31:48.520
uh, so you can hear more about that on that. Um, but other games I've been continuing on and

31:48.520 --> 31:54.040
Final Fantasy 14, of course, cause I play a lot of that game. Uh, also I got to see, I didn't play,

31:54.040 --> 31:58.920
but I got to see the classic Nintendo system because I was at, um, Flaco Jones's place for

31:58.920 --> 32:02.840
a little bit yesterday. Um, you know, he has one and so his kids were playing it.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.520
So I got to see that and, you know, I saw the, you know, the interface is pretty slick. I'm

32:06.520 --> 32:11.560
going to give it that because it seemed very seamless to like save and load, uh, save points.

32:11.560 --> 32:16.040
And, you know, you really could switch between games. Now you mentioned the old Nintendo things.

32:16.040 --> 32:20.840
I, my kids were bugging me because they couldn't decide what they wanted to watch.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.840
So I decided to play some mega man too. They show them what video games look like. So I played,

32:24.840 --> 32:31.400
uh, through a few stages of that and it's pretty hard. Yeah. Right. Games got harder at some point

32:31.400 --> 32:37.240
we got older. Um, so yeah, I, I enjoyed the system, but again, you know, yes, I do believe

32:37.240 --> 32:42.120
the picture quality was a little better and I can see that. Um, but I'm still kind of like,

32:42.120 --> 32:48.760
I just, I have a lot of these games on virtual console. And again, that cord, I know we have

32:48.760 --> 32:52.040
a story coming up on it a little later in the show, but the length of the cord is pretty

32:52.040 --> 32:57.080
ridiculous. Uh, I don't, I don't see how that would work in many living rooms though. The

32:57.080 --> 33:02.360
way Flaco had it set up work though, they had like the, the mini NES was kind of like on a chair

33:02.360 --> 33:06.040
and then they would have the chair right next to their recliners that the cord would reach.

33:06.040 --> 33:10.040
So it kind of worked the way they had it, but it just, it was stupid. It wasn't the most

33:10.040 --> 33:15.240
convenient thing. It's a stupid cost saving. Well, how much did you really save on making that cord?

33:15.240 --> 33:19.240
Like what did it kill them to make it Bluetooth or something where he could just be wireless,

33:19.240 --> 33:22.360
like have the classic controller wireless, would it have killed them?

33:22.360 --> 33:27.320
I just don't use the classic controller for it. I mean, yeah, it's just a little silly,

33:27.320 --> 33:31.720
little silly anyway. Uh, so I got to see that, but I didn't get to play it. Just disclaimer there,

33:31.720 --> 33:35.480
but it was nice to finally like actually see this device we've been talking about

33:35.480 --> 33:42.040
on the show for a few weeks. Um, and then, um, I played, um, let's see, um,

33:43.160 --> 33:47.240
gosh, not really a lot else that I can think of just continuing on with Pokemon and the

33:47.240 --> 33:52.040
online stuff, just waiting for Final Fantasy 15. Um, Overwatch, I guess would be the other

33:52.040 --> 33:56.360
big thing. That's it. Um, cause I did buy something on the Black Friday sales and, uh,

33:56.360 --> 34:01.960
Overwatch on the PlayStation 4 is what I bought. Now I already had Overwatch on PC and I was very

34:01.960 --> 34:06.520
adamant that I didn't want to buy it on a second platform just because it's the same game. But of

34:06.520 --> 34:11.320
course I got suckered in by the sale and it was like, I do want to play with my friends who are

34:11.320 --> 34:17.800
on PlayStation 4. So I just bought it on PlayStation 4. Uh, actually I bought it on Amazon

34:17.800 --> 34:22.120
because Amazon was price matching and it was like, well, I would like to have the physical disc. Um,

34:22.120 --> 34:26.680
so I bought it there for like 35 bucks or whatever. And I have been able to play some

34:26.680 --> 34:31.560
matches online. There was a one night it was me extra Shane and Flaco were all playing some

34:31.560 --> 34:35.400
matches and that was a lot of fun. So, you know, it's not like it was money wasted. Uh,

34:35.400 --> 34:39.320
but it's kind of sucks. I'm having to go through the leveling up experience again, but

34:39.320 --> 34:43.800
it's not like I got that far on PC anyway. I'm just, I'm just not very good at Overwatch

34:43.800 --> 34:47.240
and I'm okay admitting that. I'm just, I'm really not that good at it, but it's still,

34:47.240 --> 34:51.480
it's still fun to fly around and fire rockets even though everybody else is way better than I am.

34:51.480 --> 34:55.880
But, um, yeah. So that was my experience with Overwatch. So that was my gaming week.

34:55.880 --> 35:00.520
So we're going to get into the news for this week. Sorry, Brad from Pod Culture and chat over

35:00.520 --> 35:06.760
at live.vognetwork.com says, uh, Sky, you got to get it for the Xbox one. No, I draw the line. No,

35:06.760 --> 35:12.360
we're done. I'm sorry to the Xbox one owners and fans out there, but I can't. Maybe when it comes

35:12.360 --> 35:17.640
down to 10 bucks, but maybe when it's 10 bucks, I'll finally get it on Xbox one. I would rather

35:17.640 --> 35:22.680
they just figure out the cross play thing. I understand why they don't want to do it between

35:22.680 --> 35:27.640
a PlayStation or Xbox and PC because of the whole keyboard and mouse versus controller thing,

35:27.640 --> 35:35.080
which is dumb. They've actually done some balancing different on PlayStation four because

35:35.080 --> 35:41.000
of it like Torbjorn's turret and Symmetra's things don't hit for as much damage as they do on PC

35:41.000 --> 35:47.000
because they admit that people can't aim as well on PS4. Then add keyboard mouse support. Wouldn't

35:47.000 --> 35:51.960
that be nice? Wouldn't that be so difficult with USB ports in the front of your stupid console

35:51.960 --> 35:56.200
support or Bluetooth? I mean, you've got both of those built into both consoles. So what the fuck

35:56.200 --> 35:59.960
is the problem? I think, I think they are worried that the keyboard mouse people would kill the

35:59.960 --> 36:06.280
controller people. And I don't know, but anyway, but at least let the Xbox one and the PlayStation

36:06.280 --> 36:11.800
four be cross play. I thought, I thought people were starting to play a little nicer in that

36:11.800 --> 36:16.040
regard. What we have rocket league is now available on all across all platforms, right? I think so,

36:16.040 --> 36:21.320
or it's getting there. They say it's going to be. So why can't we have this? Hopefully they figure

36:21.320 --> 36:27.960
that all out before, before long enough. Let's see. SSG100 Matt says the keyboard mouse versus

36:27.960 --> 36:32.440
controller argument is BS. Controller players have gotten just as good, if not better than

36:32.440 --> 36:36.520
their keyboard mouse players. Yeah, it just, it really just all depends on what you're used to.

36:36.520 --> 36:41.240
Like I, I'm not here to argue one is better than the other, but certainly I am really used to

36:41.240 --> 36:47.800
keyboard mouse in Overwatch at this point. But it's, it does work both ways. Like when I play

36:47.800 --> 36:53.400
Halo, I have to be, and you guys all love it when I talk about Halo. When I play Halo, it has to be

36:53.480 --> 37:00.280
on a controller. It feels weird on a PC to me. Like just because that game is like an Xbox or

37:00.280 --> 37:06.440
an Xbox 360 game, it is a controller game. I can't play it on PC. It feels weird. So anyway,

37:07.560 --> 37:12.440
anyhow, that's enough for my gaming week. Uh, I don't really have a lot of housekeeping tonight,

37:12.440 --> 37:16.200
so I'll just plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And we're also on Facebook,

37:16.200 --> 37:22.360
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. Uh, we're going to get into some news for now though.

37:22.360 --> 37:26.360
Talk about that with you guys in our chat at live.vognetwork.com. So Loki, what's up first?

37:26.360 --> 37:31.080
So holy cow, they've decided to actually do an update to No Man's Sky and it's actually a pretty

37:31.080 --> 37:37.160
sizable free update. It's called the foundation update. It brings the game up to 1.1 and with it,

37:37.160 --> 37:42.920
it adds a lot of new features, new game modes and you know, bug fixes. So one of the major things

37:42.920 --> 37:47.560
that they added to it is, um, the beginning of base building. So you're actually going to be

37:47.560 --> 37:53.800
able to create your own bases on planets and yeah, it's pretty cool. Um, you can even create

37:53.800 --> 38:01.160
like farms in there. Um, some other cool stuff that they had, uh, with the base building. Um,

38:01.160 --> 38:06.680
like I said, the farming, you can cultivate crops. Um, you can hire farmers and specialists to

38:06.680 --> 38:12.840
research technology, stuff like that. Also, um, you can, the new game modes,

38:12.840 --> 38:16.200
where they go along with it, they have basically broken up now the three game modes.

38:16.200 --> 38:22.440
So there was a normal mode, which is like a normal, like exp, exploration type thing,

38:22.440 --> 38:27.640
creative mode, which allows you to explore the universe without limits. And you can build a

38:27.640 --> 38:32.760
large base. Does that mean it turns off those fucking sentries? I would love that. I would

38:32.760 --> 38:37.240
love that too. I'm going to find out. Um, and survival mode, which is, um, much more

38:37.240 --> 38:44.280
challenging, even less inventory slots. No, I'm actually speaking of inventory slots, which is

38:45.080 --> 38:53.320
a relief. Um, they've actually made it now where you can stack up to five items per slot.

38:53.320 --> 38:58.360
So it actually allows you to, you know, fix, you know, build a store, a lot more stuff on,

38:58.360 --> 39:03.080
on your person or in your ship. Um, along with storage, they've also added the ability to

39:03.160 --> 39:09.000
purchase, uh, freighters. So you can purchase a freighter and you can store your items there.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.200
You can actually teleport or transport your items to the freighter and store cargo there. Um,

39:15.320 --> 39:21.720
there's new technology to research. Um, they've redone the UI as well,

39:21.720 --> 39:28.360
um, to kind of help along with all that stuff. Um, just also fix some of the, um,

39:29.080 --> 39:34.840
you know, anti-aliasing motion blur, just like a whole bunch of stuff.

39:34.840 --> 39:41.640
There's no small update. No, not at all. So, um, you know, that sounds, it looks pretty awesome.

39:41.640 --> 39:46.040
So I may have to go check out the game now, you know, being that this is pretty sizable.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.640
I mean, it's kind of what Alan and I were both saying this morning when we heard about this

39:49.640 --> 39:52.920
update as I was kind of like, well, I really need to get the disc and put it in PlayStation

39:52.920 --> 39:56.280
four and see what these changes are all about. And then Alan was saying the same thing cause

39:56.280 --> 40:01.880
he owns it on PC. So, um, kind of interesting that this, this sort of showed up out of nowhere.

40:01.880 --> 40:05.320
I mean, I know they did a blog post what yesterday or the day before,

40:05.320 --> 40:09.320
but that was really the first time we've heard from hello games in weeks,

40:09.320 --> 40:13.960
which was kind of a controversial decision of its own for them to go completely radio silent.

40:13.960 --> 40:17.320
Yeah. They're also saying you can build like a base camp as well. So you can build

40:17.320 --> 40:22.280
like a essential equipment on field or in the field on planet. They said, uh,

40:22.280 --> 40:28.120
you can play safe points anywhere in the world for like survival mode, uh, automated harvesters

40:28.120 --> 40:35.160
to gather resources. Um, waypoints communication terminals will allow explorers to leave subspace

40:35.160 --> 40:43.880
messages for others to find. Um, yeah, I mean, it sounds pretty cool actually. Although it was

40:43.880 --> 40:48.600
like the base building stuff, I'd almost make, it seems like you'd not want to leave your planet

40:48.600 --> 40:52.200
that you're on at that point, you know, you're building a base there. So I don't know.

40:52.200 --> 40:56.520
Yeah. That's well, I guess you can build teleporters to go back to your base. So as

40:56.520 --> 41:01.080
long as the teleporter is two way, so you don't like lose your progress wherever you're at in

41:01.080 --> 41:06.120
the world. And that sounds like it would be, um, pretty cool. Yeah. And I think with the stacking,

41:06.120 --> 41:09.720
you know, like it sounds like they've solved a lot of it, the inventory problems like, you know,

41:09.720 --> 41:14.760
with the freighters and with your bases and doing the teleporting and stuff like that. And plus

41:14.760 --> 41:21.960
you being able to stack your inventory, hopefully that'll solve some of the things that were kind of

41:21.960 --> 41:27.560
annoying. Yeah. But yeah, definitely those recon drone things that are fucking, you know, killing

41:27.560 --> 41:32.600
you for mining stuff that needs to be addressed. So hopefully that's one of the things I didn't

41:32.600 --> 41:37.560
read through all the patch notes, but maybe that creative mode or whatever. Cause I don't give a

41:37.560 --> 41:41.320
shit. There there's no fucking story. We know that already. So there's no fucking story to worry

41:41.320 --> 41:47.560
about. So just play casually. I think that'd be a lot better than who gives a shit about survival

41:47.560 --> 41:53.080
mode. Uh, let's see. Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, I want to

41:53.080 --> 41:57.960
know the mechanism of how you get back to your home base when you're millions of miles away.

41:57.960 --> 42:03.880
Space teleportation protocols. It's gotta be something like that. Um, yeah, let's see here.

42:05.240 --> 42:09.480
Um, yeah, what basically they said, um, when you claim your home planet by finding an

42:09.480 --> 42:15.480
uninhabited base or creating your own, um, you basically going to construct your shelter using

42:15.480 --> 42:20.040
like a modular structure. They said you could recruit alien life forms. You can use the

42:20.040 --> 42:25.320
terminus teleporters and the space stations to teleport, uh, to and from your base at will.

42:25.880 --> 42:31.400
And you can expand your base with storage stockpile, you know, resources and whatnot. Um,

42:32.120 --> 42:38.520
yeah. Uh, and in chat, they're pointing out vid power says no man's sky was $20 on Amazon on black

42:38.520 --> 42:43.000
Friday. Crazy. So it's interesting cause they're pumping out all these features and you know,

42:43.000 --> 42:47.080
the game is going to be a lot cheaper for people to jump into. Now also knows that it's discounted

42:47.080 --> 42:51.160
right now on PlayStation network, but I couldn't see for how much cause I already bought it when

42:51.160 --> 42:55.320
it came out. It's probably a similar type of reduction. Uh, the, uh, one other thing I want

42:55.320 --> 42:59.400
to mention with the update that caught my eye was the communication hub thing where it sounds like

42:59.400 --> 43:02.920
you're going to leave like communication beacons for other players. So it sounds like they are

43:02.920 --> 43:07.240
trying to bridge that gap a little bit where they kind of got caught in the whole, like,

43:07.240 --> 43:10.600
you're really not going to be able to see other people. Cause like the two people that were

43:10.600 --> 43:14.200
streaming tried to find each other and they couldn't. Right. Yeah. So, but now it sounds

43:14.200 --> 43:17.720
like you could leave mess. Again, I'm just inferring this from the patch notes. I don't

43:17.720 --> 43:21.720
know what it really is, but it sounds like you can leave these calm mess. Are they going to be

43:21.720 --> 43:25.560
able to find your base and stuff as well? Because is it just going to be, is it going to be

43:25.560 --> 43:29.640
persistent on this other person's game or is it going to be just in your own? Is it going to be

43:29.640 --> 43:34.280
notes like it is in demons souls or dark souls and like that? That's what I'm curious about. Like

43:34.280 --> 43:39.320
leaving those messages behind. I don't know. Uh, anyway, uh, joining us on the show here,

43:39.320 --> 43:43.400
uh, walking in as a guest, he can do it cause he lives here. Say hello everybody to Alan.

43:43.400 --> 43:47.880
Hello. Hi Alan. How are you? I'm good. I saw you were commenting on the show and I,

43:47.880 --> 43:51.160
I was hoping you were going to sit in for a little bit anyway. So I was just like, get in here,

43:51.160 --> 43:57.080
make your comments live. Seeing the stuff about No Man's Sky kind of makes me want to start over.

43:57.720 --> 44:06.200
Um, cause I mean, I, I don't want to say I got that far. I mean,

44:06.200 --> 44:11.080
I had a good 20 or 30 hours on it. I mean, I had a ship with like 20 some slots out of the

44:11.080 --> 44:20.760
max of 40 or whatever. So I was doing pretty well. But the problem that I had with the original game

44:20.760 --> 44:26.040
was they wanted you to keep looking forward and explore at the expense of everything else.

44:26.040 --> 44:29.800
You couldn't really make your way back to a planet that you visited before that you really

44:29.800 --> 44:37.880
liked. You couldn't even set a waypoint really for a shop on a planet you are currently on

44:37.880 --> 44:41.240
cause the planets are huge. You can explore them for literally dozens of hours. It's one of the

44:41.240 --> 44:45.640
first stories that came out when the game was launched. So it's like, Oh, I need to sell all

44:45.640 --> 44:51.000
this crap. And I know that I've been to at least two different depots on this planet and I haven't

44:51.000 --> 44:55.080
left the planet. I can't make my way back to those depots because I've been explained for so much.

44:55.080 --> 45:00.680
Like there's all this quality of life stuff that I want to see them fix before they put in the

45:00.680 --> 45:06.360
whole like build a base element. Maybe that stuff was included. I don't know. I didn't look through

45:06.360 --> 45:09.960
the patch notes that deeply, but I know they have like the save points, but good question.

45:09.960 --> 45:13.800
Do they have something where you can build something to call your ship? Cause like,

45:13.800 --> 45:17.880
well, they have that already. Some of those deep, well, you have to find a depot that has it.

45:17.880 --> 45:21.880
You know what I mean? But can you maybe build one of those on demand? If you can build a base,

45:21.880 --> 45:26.280
the fact that you could not name, cause you had to like, let's say you found a ship that was a

45:26.280 --> 45:30.840
huge upgrade, but you had to basically rebuild it. Cause it was a, it was a wreck rather than

45:30.840 --> 45:38.040
one you bought at a space station. You have to go run around and put all of these materials into it

45:38.040 --> 45:42.760
to like restore, you know, everything about it, but then you can't give it a name. It's like,

45:42.760 --> 45:46.920
guys, what are you thinking? You could like, you can name the planets and the little

45:47.720 --> 45:54.920
chicken donkey grub dinosaur poopy head things and the plants and the little crickets that all

45:54.920 --> 45:59.400
look the same, but you can't name the ship. It's like bizarre. That's a good point,

46:00.280 --> 46:03.640
but you are going to check this out. Thanks to the update. Yeah. I kind of want to see,

46:03.640 --> 46:09.000
cause there were some mods, uh, for no man's sky PC that were like quality of life stuff

46:09.000 --> 46:15.080
to like made the way points that you could set bigger. And one that made the, um,

46:15.880 --> 46:21.240
like if you were on a planet that had like 15 different life forms, the last one or two were

46:21.240 --> 46:26.760
always the hardest to find because it was like, they only come out at night when it's stormy and

46:26.760 --> 46:31.960
it's raining. Like those are the types of conditions. And then one tiny cave. Yeah. Yeah.

46:31.960 --> 46:36.680
And I was like, I want it. Cause you, you get, you get a fair amount of credits if you can ID

46:36.680 --> 46:42.840
all the planet, all the animals on a planet. So I had a mod that kind of increased the spawn rate.

46:42.840 --> 46:47.800
So instead of having to look for four hours, that's not an exaggeration.

46:47.800 --> 46:51.720
Instead of having to look for four hours, I would just have to look for like 30 to 45 minutes

46:51.720 --> 46:56.040
for the last week. Have it where at least you can scan it like, Oh, new species discovered,

46:56.040 --> 47:00.680
you know, and have it kind of highlight where it is in your scans. So at least you can kind of,

47:00.680 --> 47:04.040
Oh, okay, there it is. You know, instead of like, Oh, Hey, there's something. Oh,

47:04.040 --> 47:06.680
I've already found that. Oh, Hey, there's something else. Oh, I already found that one

47:06.680 --> 47:11.480
as well. You can get it to show the red dot. Like if you, let's say there's a hill and there's a

47:11.480 --> 47:15.560
bunch of animals on the other side of the hill. If you use your scanner to look for minerals,

47:15.560 --> 47:19.320
you'll see green and red dots and red means it's an animal you haven't seen before.

47:19.320 --> 47:24.760
That was in the base game. Oh, well that wasn't explained very well in the base game either.

47:24.760 --> 47:28.360
But the thing, the thing that's frustrating though, is that it could be like, let's say

47:28.360 --> 47:35.400
there's a goat with one horn and then a goat with two horns. It's still considered the same

47:36.120 --> 47:40.680
species. So it doesn't count as a new, like you'll, you'll be like, Oh, you ID'd this

47:41.560 --> 47:45.720
different flavor of the same animal, but it's not the one that you're looking for.

47:45.720 --> 47:49.480
Cause you'll see a red dot and it's like, I found it. Oh my God. And it's like, no, it's just

47:50.520 --> 47:56.680
a goat worm. That's kind of stupid looking. It's like his cousin. You found his cousin,

47:56.680 --> 48:02.840
but you're what you're looking for is like a bird or something. Yeah. So there's all that stuff. I

48:02.840 --> 48:07.240
don't, I don't know. It is. It is. I still think it's a really trippy, relaxing game.

48:08.280 --> 48:14.280
Once they patched it on PC. So that actually ran well, it's really beautiful. The planets it

48:14.280 --> 48:18.840
generates. Um, not to backtrack too much, but before we get to the next story, I kind of want

48:18.840 --> 48:23.800
to ask you a little bit because I know you extensively mod your Skyrim game. Yes. So you

48:23.800 --> 48:28.600
probably heard Loki's comments earlier about what his experience is. They have a mod to re-enable

48:28.600 --> 48:33.480
official steam achievements. There's a mod to undo the mod. Right. But I'm playing a PlayStation

48:33.480 --> 48:38.440
four, so. Oh, that's right. Oh, I keep forgetting the console. Steam's not a big deal because steam,

48:38.440 --> 48:43.160
I think you could add mods to the steam workshop and it never would disable the anything. It would

48:43.160 --> 48:47.000
just, you do whatever that you want. Steam workshop, which has mostly been abandoned.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.560
The community, the mod community is still on nexus for the most part for the PC platform.

48:51.560 --> 48:56.840
But, um, there is no integration with workshop for special edition yet. So if you go to steam

48:56.840 --> 49:03.320
workshop for Skyrim and you click install, it's going to look for the OG Skyrim, which I think is

49:03.320 --> 49:09.160
very silly. Yeah. They're mod system leaves a little something to be desired, but I do like

49:09.160 --> 49:13.480
that even works on PlayStation four. It's kind of cool with PlayStation four. So what you do,

49:13.480 --> 49:16.280
you can go to their website. Cause I thought that was the only way you could do is go to their

49:16.280 --> 49:21.400
website and you can browse the mods and say, okay, mark this one, mark this one or whatever.

49:21.400 --> 49:24.920
And then you go into your game, go in the mods and you download them, but you can also actually

49:25.000 --> 49:29.080
search for them as well through the mod menu in the game. So you can go in the main menu,

49:29.080 --> 49:32.840
look at the mods, they'll show you the top mods or popular ones and the ones you have,

49:32.840 --> 49:35.960
you know, marked, and then you can download those and I'll show you which ones you have installed.

49:35.960 --> 49:39.320
They'll give you the order that you have them installed because some need to go before the

49:39.320 --> 49:43.800
other ones in order to not overwrite certain things or something like that. And so you have

49:43.800 --> 49:48.200
a lot of control over it and they're really small downloads because you can't add assets to the

49:48.200 --> 49:55.880
PlayStation four cause fucking Sony. Um, so it's really fast to get it working. It's just, um,

49:55.880 --> 49:59.160
you know, a lot of times I'll have to like look at them like, what is that mod that I marked?

49:59.160 --> 50:03.880
What does that do? You know? And we're like, Oh, we'll be like, Oh, this is a chest with stuff in

50:03.880 --> 50:07.560
it. And it's like, okay, where was that chest again? It's like, I gotta find, gotta remember

50:07.560 --> 50:13.400
where this is. Um, so I don't know. It works pretty well from what I've seen, but I'm,

50:13.400 --> 50:17.880
you know, very limited because I can't do assets cause I don't have that on Xbox one.

50:17.960 --> 50:23.320
I don't have an Xbox one. Yeah. Um, I imagined the load order cause like if

50:23.320 --> 50:27.080
mods step on each other's toes and just the tiniest bit, it's like, make sure you load

50:27.640 --> 50:34.600
this mod after this one and this one so that this one gets priority. And on PC there's a program

50:34.600 --> 50:39.880
called loot, which is load order optimization tool. And it will read through all the plugins

50:39.880 --> 50:44.920
and take all, take care of all of that for you. And I can't imagine on console having 30 or 40

50:44.920 --> 50:49.880
mods and being new to mods in the first place because I mean, you know, PC mods Loki, but the

50:49.880 --> 50:55.640
average console user that's never owned a gaming PC isn't to be like, Oh, you need to sort the

50:55.640 --> 51:00.920
order that you load these in. That's kind of like a power user thing to me. Right. Thankfully,

51:00.920 --> 51:05.080
all the mods that I get are really small. So like there'll be just adding more magic spells or

51:05.080 --> 51:09.240
something like that. And so it's not necessarily something that's going to affect a lot of, they

51:09.240 --> 51:13.960
don't really interact with each other too much. And so I've lucked out there, but there are some

51:13.960 --> 51:17.720
where like, Oh, if you're loading this on there, you need to make sure this is at the bottom or

51:17.720 --> 51:23.640
this is lower than this. So, I mean, it kind of at least explain that for you, but, um, yeah,

51:23.640 --> 51:28.440
I mean, it still crashes. I've had a crash about four times already. And it just, it's usually when

51:28.440 --> 51:33.560
it's loading dialogue, it's kind of weird. And I had an animation mod that I loaded up for Rob

51:33.560 --> 51:37.480
and I said, Hey Rob, look at this. And I casted a spell on my follower and he started to twerk

51:38.280 --> 51:43.080
like actual twerking. And you were like, you were like, you're like uninstall, uninstall steam,

51:43.080 --> 51:47.080
uninstall Skyrim. This is what you spend all your mod time doing. This is, this is when I see you

51:47.080 --> 51:51.400
in that, that, that big chart where I'm like, are you doing work right now on a Saturday night? And

51:51.400 --> 51:54.600
you're like, no, this is the mod management thing. And I'm like, it looks like work.

51:55.320 --> 51:59.000
So, and uh, yeah, I'm like, that's what you spend all your hours. And then I casted another spell

51:59.000 --> 52:03.240
where they legit do Michael Jackson's thriller dance with like the twitch of the neck and then

52:03.240 --> 52:08.360
the arms go out and then shuffle, slide foot, the whole thriller dance. And I was like, it's

52:08.360 --> 52:14.200
animation mod. I just cast a spell on him and I reload my save blocked reported. Yeah. Anyway,

52:14.200 --> 52:18.760
um, well, another system that you might get to play with Skyrim mods on, it sounds like it's

52:18.760 --> 52:23.400
going to be the Nintendo switch. Obviously I'm taking a big leap there, but here's what really

52:23.400 --> 52:29.480
happened this week is that obviously we've seen that Skyrim is there in the switch teaser video.

52:29.480 --> 52:33.640
A lot of people spotted Skyrim there and said, Oh, does this mean Skyrim is on the switch?

52:33.640 --> 52:40.360
They showed it like five times. Yeah. Like maybe not saying anything. It's like, Oh, come on.

52:40.360 --> 52:44.840
Well, but what was interesting and what happened this week is that Todd Howard from Bethesda

52:44.840 --> 52:51.240
spoke to a gaming publication, a new one called Glixel, uh, talking about the, uh, Skyrim footage

52:51.240 --> 52:55.960
that was on the switch. Uh, and you know, they asked, what do you think of the switch? And,

52:55.960 --> 53:00.280
uh, Todd Howard said, I love it. I got to play it. I'll tell you. Well, maybe that's an NDA thing.

53:00.280 --> 53:06.120
One of the best demos I've ever seen, probably the best demo I've ever seen at E3. Uh, and then,

53:06.120 --> 53:10.440
uh, was it a Nintendo game? I mean the device itself. I think it's really smart what they're

53:10.440 --> 53:13.960
doing. We're definitely going to be supporting it. It's the first time we've done something on

53:13.960 --> 53:20.360
Nintendo. If you don't count the old NES stuff home alone or where's Waldo. Don't worry. Nobody

53:20.360 --> 53:25.800
counts that stuff, but then can you really bring Skyrim with you on the go? And the answer is it's

53:25.800 --> 53:33.080
the same game on the TV and on the other screen. Oops. He didn't say that it wasn't happening or

53:33.080 --> 53:37.960
that we haven't announced Skyrim on it yet. He gave an answer that said, it's the same on the TV

53:37.960 --> 53:43.880
and on the portable screen. So kind of, kind of confirmed something we pretty much already

53:43.880 --> 53:49.560
assumed. I was going to say, I don't know if it's a mystery or mystery because it was literally in

53:49.560 --> 53:56.680
the, yes, but Nintendo came back right after that and said, none of the games you see should

53:56.680 --> 53:59.640
be considered an announcement or anything like that, you know? And I think they're speaking

53:59.640 --> 54:04.520
more of their first party stuff, but yeah, I think most of us were like, okay, we know Skyrim is on

54:04.520 --> 54:08.840
this thing. But one thing I wanted to say with all this is that, I mean, it's not like Minecraft and

54:08.840 --> 54:15.000
the Ouya. Yeah. This is okay. This is one of those things where it's like, is this necessarily

54:15.000 --> 54:21.640
a good thing though? And I think I said this when the footage was first unveiled, is that Skyrim is

54:21.640 --> 54:27.560
kind of last year's news. And I understand that a lot of you are still into it and really play it

54:27.560 --> 54:32.920
and so forth. I'm not like trying to be disrespectful. It's 2011's news. Exactly. Yeah.

54:32.920 --> 54:39.880
It's news from a long time ago. This was part of what hurt the Wii U. This was a big part of what

54:39.880 --> 54:45.720
hurt the Wii U, is gaming companies thought, oh, we can put a year old game on the Nintendo console

54:45.720 --> 54:50.920
and people will buy it. And they didn't because for most people, the Wii U was the secondary

54:50.920 --> 54:56.760
console, if any console, to the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360. They could launch it though. And it would

54:56.760 --> 55:03.000
really only be a six month old title because it's going to be, you know, it's Skyrim remastered.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.400
So it's remastered. It's not that old. And honestly, I mean, yeah, it's old, but it's still

55:07.400 --> 55:11.800
entertaining. It's a long ass game. It's very good value for your purchase. I'm not saying it's a bad

55:11.800 --> 55:16.440
game or anything by that means. I mean, it will, it will be something that definitely is, oh, it'll,

55:16.440 --> 55:21.240
to see a game like that in Nintendo's lineup will definitely make it. It'll fill the void until

55:21.240 --> 55:26.520
Skyrim, you know, the next Elder Scrolls game comes out. Yeah. But I just, you know, again,

55:26.520 --> 55:33.080
I hope Bethesda is working on something else, something newer as well, and not going to judge

55:33.080 --> 55:39.320
the Wii, or not going to judge the Switch by a game that's five years old finally coming

55:39.320 --> 55:44.040
out on a Nintendo platform. Most of the people that are buying the Switch probably already have

55:44.040 --> 55:49.880
played Skyrim one place or another. That's just, that's just my biggest concern. Or what are they

55:49.880 --> 55:56.280
going to do with Skyrim that hasn't been done before? Make it portable? Obviously that's going

55:56.280 --> 56:00.920
to be the big thing, but is that going to be enough? Maybe, maybe for some people. I don't know, if it was

56:00.920 --> 56:05.720
Mass Effect 3 you'd be buying it anyway, so. That's different and you know it. It's not different, it's

56:05.720 --> 56:10.520
exactly the same. I didn't actually buy Mass Effect 3 right away. Remember, I didn't buy it on Wii U till

56:10.520 --> 56:16.920
it was $12. So, you know. Well, if they come out at $29.99, which is what I purchased it at for the sale,

56:16.920 --> 56:23.320
I think that's a pretty good deal. I think that'd be a really easy sell. All right, well, I, we'll, we'll see

56:23.320 --> 56:28.680
what happens with Skyrim on the Switch now that we practically have confirmation that it's happening

56:28.680 --> 56:33.560
short of. I mean, that's pretty exciting because I, you know, I don't know. That'd be a game I'd play on

56:33.560 --> 56:38.920
the Switch if I picked one up. I'd have to see what else is coming out for, but I mean, I like

56:38.920 --> 56:44.760
the idea because my laptop just doesn't run it very well. I mean, it runs it okay, I guess, but

56:46.120 --> 56:50.120
it would be nice having that screen and everything. Some support in our chat over at

56:50.120 --> 56:55.880
live.vognetwork.com. Brad from Pod Culture says, what isn't Skyrim on at this point? Well, a Nintendo

56:55.880 --> 57:02.040
platform would be the answer. Dark Tetsuya says, hell, I'm at least considering Skyrim on Switch.

57:02.040 --> 57:07.240
And Dungeon Buster says, as much as I love Skyrim, there are a lot of other RPGs to get into

57:07.240 --> 57:13.000
nowadays. Dark Tetsuya says, what if they did what Bayonetta did and add some Nintendo themed

57:13.000 --> 57:17.960
exclusives? And I'm just thinking like, that just seems like it would be really out of place. I've

57:17.960 --> 57:23.880
seen that and it's not pretty. In a Skyrim game. I guess I'm sure, I'm sure Alan could tell you about

57:23.880 --> 57:28.120
the total conversion that they have for like, you know, the Mushroom Kingdom stuff. Have you seen

57:28.120 --> 57:35.720
that for Skyrim? Oh, um. I know, I've even heard of this. It doesn't look good. Yeah, I think

57:35.720 --> 57:42.840
there's also a Minecraft conversion where Skyrim looks like, yeah. But I'm just like, what Nintendo

57:42.840 --> 57:49.000
stuff would go into Skyrim? Like not Mario, maybe some Zelda stuff, maybe Fire Emblem or something

57:49.000 --> 57:55.000
a little more. Skyrim had the Portal 2 crossover mod where the space, where the space companion

57:55.000 --> 57:59.400
that was funny fell and you just put him in your house and he was like space, I'm gonna go space,

57:59.400 --> 58:06.280
and then you could have a giant knock him into space. Like that's the only tie. And then I

58:06.280 --> 58:10.440
remember you showing me that. That's like barely a helmet out of, that's like barely any content.

58:11.480 --> 58:15.720
I mean, you pick a lot of mushrooms in Skyrim. So yeah, just put red and white mushrooms in there.

58:15.720 --> 58:21.400
That's ridiculous. How about roll a million goombas down a hill instead of cabbages? Yeah,

58:21.400 --> 58:27.800
that would be worth it. All right, moving on. Loki. All right, so this is a game that's been out for

58:27.800 --> 58:33.880
a while now and I wish we'd get mod support on PlayStation 4 as well. Saints Row 4, they're

58:33.880 --> 58:39.480
finally getting official mod support with the same workshop. So you'll be able to download mods

58:39.480 --> 58:43.960
through that instead of the roundabout way that they have right now. But they have had mod support

58:43.960 --> 58:48.920
for the game for quite a while now. Actually Saints Row 3rd and even Saints Row 2. But now

58:48.920 --> 58:54.200
this will be a slightly easier way to do it and you can check that out. And they've also, I guess,

58:54.200 --> 58:59.160
have it on sale. I mean, they always have it on sale. It's been all over the place. In fact,

58:59.160 --> 59:04.760
I think I just recently uninstalled it on my PlayStation 4 because I need to make room for

59:04.760 --> 59:13.080
Final Fantasy 15. But yeah, I would like to play mods on the PlayStation 4. So what mods can we

59:13.080 --> 59:17.240
expect to see besides nude mods? Because that I'm sure is the first thing that'll be out.

59:17.240 --> 59:22.600
Well, let's see. I'm trying to think what they had on like just the non PC stuff. They had like

59:22.600 --> 59:27.240
tweaks for some of the games to make them not so difficult. Like the mini games, some of them are

59:27.240 --> 59:34.040
kind of, you know, frustrating. So they have those. They have adding some of the stuff that was in

59:35.320 --> 59:41.400
Enter the Dominatrix. So there's like some added stuff you can add there for that. They had

59:43.080 --> 59:50.040
I'm trying to think what else. Like different companions you can get. You can do new cars.

59:50.040 --> 59:57.560
I mean, they have all sorts of crazy stuff for it. Different weapons. I don't know. Yeah,

59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.200
yeah. There's new mods and, you know, make your breasts extremely large mods and stuff like that.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:09.640
Old goody. Maybe, maybe Alan will find some mods where they can dance and twerk and do thriller.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.600
They already do that. They do the Carlton and all sorts of stuff. Yeah. Saints Row four. They

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:20.440
already do all that stuff. I would like a new Saints Row game. I'm not a huge fan of four and

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:30.200
wasn't enter. Um, was it gotten the hell was all right or out of hell. Um, but I would like a new

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:36.440
Saints Row game for better or worse. I don't see why they won't do one. They will eventually. I

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.280
just don't know what it's going to be. It may not necessarily be Saints Row five. It could be a

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.880
reboot. Well, they've got that one game that volition is working on now. That's not Saints

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.640
Row, but it's got some Saints Row elements in it with all the superheroes. Yeah. With all the,

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:56.600
like, yeah, that now looks okay, but I want an actual Saints Row game. I liked Stoppy's comment

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:02.360
in chat over at live.vog.network.com. I was about to say Saints Row feels like one massive mod

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:09.160
turned into a game. It kind of does. It is. Yeah. For me is basically a massive mod on three. I

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:17.800
mean, I don't know. It was just in Gata out of hell was kind of a reskin of four. I mean, I don't

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:23.880
know. All right. Well, moving on to a story about Ubisoft and the way that they plan to approach

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.280
DLC in the future. Um, there was an interview with gi.biz where the vice president of live operations

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.640
and Blondeljuin, I hope I said that name right. Um, talking about some of the recent things that

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:42.120
they've learned from a game like Rainbow Six Siege about how DLC for, you know, other Ubisoft games

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:47.320
should work going forward. Uh, in, uh, for those that are not familiar with Rainbow Six Siege,

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:53.560
um, you only have to pay for content in the game, which customizes characters or buying new ones.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.360
The maps themselves end up being free, which isn't always the case in other online shooters

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.360
where you have to pay for the maps. Um, some quotes here from again, the VP of live operations

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.880
monetization is something we have to be very careful about. And my team is in charge of that

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.880
and making sure we find the right balance. If it's not adding something on top of the actual

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.520
experience of the game, then it is no good because you'll be asking for money for the wrong reasons.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.600
Also, if the content is compulsory for the gamers, it's no good as well. It wouldn't work.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:25.160
It is a way to deliver more fun to gamers, but they have a choice to go for that extra fun or

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:30.200
not. No more DLC that you have to buy. If you want to have the full experience, you have the

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.040
game. And if you want to expand it, depending on how you want to experience the game, you're free

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:39.000
to buy it or not. The way we monetize Rainbow Six is that people are happy about the new characters

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.520
and they can customize them with weapons and charms. But even if they don't do it,

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:48.280
they'll have the exact same experience of the other gamers. So, um, kind of a common theme

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.000
we're seeing in a lot of, uh, games these days is that a lot of the stuff they're tending to sell,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.760
especially in games that really focus in the online realm. I mean, this goes from everything

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.360
from like in the MMO space, World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 to something like Overwatch,

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:08.600
is that a lot of the things that they sell on top of the base game is cosmetics. It's new skins,

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:15.080
it's new pets, it's new, you know, shinies, but it's nothing that's going to fundamentally change

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:20.360
the game. Uh, again, Overwatch being an example of that. When they release new characters like Sombra

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.280
or they do a new map like Antarctica, it's out there for everybody. They don't charge for that,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:29.320
but they figure they'll make money off those loot boxes for people that must have that Sombra

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.000
introduction where she hacks somebody else's play of the game, which is actually really funny if

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.520
you haven't seen it. So, um, I guess I, I think that's a good thing. I, I, you know,

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.920
I kind of liked that idea that I'm not going to be paying more money for something that's,

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.520
should be a part of the main game, but the cosmetic stuff. All right. If it's something

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:52.200
I'm into, cool. Otherwise, yeah, you know, take it or leave it. So, all right, moving on.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:59.960
All right. So, uh, with the steam sale this time, they introduced the steam awards. So it's

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:05.080
basically a way to nominate certain games for different categories. Um, so some of the

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.360
categories that they have, uh, the test of time award, the I'm not crying, there's something in

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:17.480
my eye award, the just five more minutes award, the whoa dude award, the villain most in need

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:23.720
of a hug award, the game within a game award, the I thought this game was cool before it won

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:32.040
an award award, uh, the best use of a farm animal award and the we didn't think of everything award.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.960
Um, there was also one I saw that was like the most, um, what was it like they're saying like,

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.720
uh, need of a sequel or something like that. Cause I know people have been nominating

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.800
half-life to episode two for that kind of stuff. I'm wondering if I think you can actually make

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:53.080
your own award. That's where that's happening. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, that, yeah, you can

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.920
participate that now they're in the steam autumn sale. Um, that's going to be running through the

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:03.320
29th. So a couple more days on that. I don't know. Is it just me or does it all feel kind

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:08.120
of really uninspiring? Like, I don't know what it is. Like the steam, the steam sales used to

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.960
be really awesome. Like the last one I remember that was really cool was the one with the little

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.360
mini game with the robots that was the cookie clicker type game. That was cute. I mean,

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.800
it wasn't their best, but it was cute. And they had some other stuff, you know, before that,

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:25.400
that was kind of cool. But this one just feels, I don't know, like, Oh yay. Another awards thing.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:30.680
And especially awards that are completely like ridiculous. You know what I mean? Like nothing

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:37.080
really, you know, of substance, it just feels very bleh to me now, granted. I don't think the

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:42.440
autumn sale is supposed to be one of their biggest sales, even though black Friday is like, but, but

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:47.240
we're what less than a month, probably tell the holiday sale, which will be their big one. So

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:52.600
that's why I'm kind of like, all right, maybe I'm judging this too harshly because usually there's

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.480
nothing with the autumn sale if memory serves me right. Any of their big stuff would be taken away

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:02.280
from it a little bit. Cause there used to be a lot of, you know, um, interest in these sales

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:07.160
is because now they don't do the rotating days with different deals. It's just all at once. And

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:11.080
so you kind of take a look at it and you're like, eh, where it's like, he wants each day.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.000
It keeps you coming back to the store and keeps you, but then people also complain,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.160
Oh, I missed what I was looking for. And you know, I, and so I see that side of it,

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.600
but at the same time, yeah, when you, when you put it all out there all at once like that,

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.720
it's kind of like, Oh, okay. Well, this was, you know, this wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.640
Yeah. Cause you know, you don't, you know, that it's not just not going to get any better than

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:37.080
that. Uh, SSU 100 Matt saying, uh, the autumn sale was always just a tease for the winter sale.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.240
And I suppose that's true. I suppose that's true. Vidpower says, why don't they just call the autumn

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:45.960
sale their black Friday sales since it only takes place during most of black Friday weekend. That's

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.360
a good question. Why don't they just call it what everybody else called it? Um, let's see. Uh,

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:55.080
stop. He says, I do like how alien isolation is getting nominated for the villain and most

01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:00.440
need of a hug award. I'm sure I'm sure the online communities like Reddit and Twitter and all that

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:05.560
stuff are coming up with these ridiculous ideas for nominations that we'll probably see win.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.200
Cause otherwise there's so many games on steam. I can't imagine really goat simulator should win

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:16.360
for best use of a farm animal. That was a good point. I think I nominated like stardew valley

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.240
or something, but you're right. Goat simulator is a good, good call. Maybe I'll have to consider

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.720
going back and changing my answer. Uh, one game that I've been very, I have to admit,

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.240
I've been very tempted with during the black Friday sales. So I just haven't,

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.800
I haven't pulled the trigger on buying it yet, but I'm very, very tempted on street fighter five.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.400
Cause you know, the street fighter five has been getting some deep discounts during black Friday,

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.960
uh, and street fighter five, you know, some people are wondering like, is this is, you know,

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:47.480
how long is this going to go on? Did the game flop? You know, cause I don't think it's sold

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.680
and we've reported on this before. I don't think it's sold as strongly as they'd hoped in the

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.680
beginning. Um, you know, are they gonna, are they going to move on to street fighter six

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.760
or something else? Well, that doesn't seem to be the case because, uh, in an interview that

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:04.440
Yoshinori Ono did with Japanese magazine Famitsu, uh, he's basically saying that the company is

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.960
still planning ahead to support the game as far as 2020, uh, saying that there's still work to

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:16.040
be done to solidify street fighter five as an e-sports title. Um, so yeah, saying that they're

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.840
going to continue to support this through 2020. And we're very likely to see more about this plan

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:26.520
at the PlayStation experience because the Capcom cup is happening with the PlayStation experience,

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.720
which is this coming weekend. I can't believe, Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's like already here.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.120
A buddy of mine was really trying to get me to go. And it's like Anaheim is the type of thing

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.520
that I could road trip him back in a weekend, but I'm just like, Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:46.920
It's just, I don't know if I could do it. I just, I'm just tripped out at this point from all the

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:51.640
different and I have magfest coming up in a few weeks. So, uh, which I can't believe that's what

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:56.200
like six weeks away is magfest. So it's, you know, I got all this other stuff going on, but I know

01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.120
the PlayStation experience are going to get a lot of news out of that, uh, including whatever,

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:06.440
probably the future of street fighter five looks like, which probably new characters,

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:12.440
new stages. I'm sure we'll see plenty of that. Yep. Loki. So another thing that's coming around

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:18.760
the corner is, you know, the game awards, um, and the game awards, well, they've got a category this

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:26.440
year. That's the best fan creation. And with that, they had four nominees, but now it's actually

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.960
whittled down to two titles and a couple of these have been pulled. The two tiles have been pulled

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:39.720
Pokemon uranium and project AM2R or for those who don't know what AM2R is, it's the, another Metroid

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:49.720
2 remake and, um, kind of coincidental that both of those are Nintendo titles and had cease and

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:56.760
desist against them. So, um, thanks Nintendo for ruining half of those, uh, nominations.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.400
The other two though, who's a big sponsor of the game awards, by the way. Uh, yeah. So the,

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:08.360
the other two titles that aren't left, um, to be nominated for brutal doom 64 and end reel,

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.960
the shards of, uh, order, which I have no idea what that is based on. I know why, I mean,

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.280
I know what doom is, but I don't know if the other game is a fan game of surprise,

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:23.880
not any Sonic fan games there, because that's what I was thinking was that, that, um, 3d one

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.080
look kind of cool. That was the first thing I thought is that when I was like, okay, well,

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:31.720
Nintendo doesn't support these fan remakes. I was like, well, I'm surprised there's no Sonic remakes

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:36.040
in there because Sega is supportive of that stuff. And we'll probably love it if a Sonic game won

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.560
this award. So, uh, that did kind of surprise me, but obviously it's probably too late to replace

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.040
a nominee. Like I don't think you could fairly do that. Um, but that does kind of suck that those

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:51.800
two got pulled. I mean, I understand. No, I don't understand. I mean, come on. I just say,

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.880
I understand how it happened. I'm not saying I understand why it happens because it's fucking

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.440
Nintendo. I don't understand that. I don't like their approach, how they take, you know, not only

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:06.200
people promoting their games. Like I think the whole Nintendo thing with YouTube and how you

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:11.240
have to be like a, you know, an official, you have to pay money to do that. So I think that's

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:17.960
fucking stupid. It's such a backwards way to think as a company, I think. And that the kind

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.200
of that stuff right there just really kind of gives me doubt on, you know, all this awesome

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.800
stuff that we think is going to happen with the Switch because yeah, a lot of this potentially

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:30.360
could be awesome because it's done on other platforms, but Nintendo also likes to fuck

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:37.240
things up for some reason. They like to do things their own way. And I'm, I don't know. I'm, I don't

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:44.120
like it. Uh, vid power and chat wants you to know Loki enderall is like an unofficial expansion

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:49.160
pack to Skyrim. So, I mean, that's kind of cool. Like an Uber mod for Skyrim, basically.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.800
There's a bunch of those now. Yeah. There's the forgotten city. There's moon path to elsewhere,

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:59.480
like full voiced campaigns that are hours long. Wow. Yeah. That's pretty cool that people build

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.720
that. So that's cool that at least one of that, one of those is getting recognized. So it'll be

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.280
that or doom. See now the Switch, here's how you, I heard how you make the Skyrim on the Switch

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.920
fucking awesome. You, you allow that mod support and you allow it with the, you know, the new

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:18.760
media along with it. So not this PlayStation four way of doing things, but I'm talking like

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:26.600
X-Box one or PC that'll get you some mileage on that game. We'll see, uh, stopping and chat. I'm

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.840
talking about, you know, Nintendo's a lockdown on this. Stop. He says, Mark my words, the

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:36.120
Switch's equivalent of the share button will be a relinquish all rights to Nintendo button.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.600
I'm very curious. You know, a lot of people are assuming there's going to be a share button of

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.520
some sort on the Switch, you know, because that's basically where we're at now with games is the

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:51.240
very social element, but how much control is Nintendo going to put on that? I'm very curious

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:57.640
to see. I think it's stupid. And you know what? The answers will be here in January. You know

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:03.080
what? And it's, it's, I hope that the Switch does well, but you know, if the Switch doesn't do well,

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.960
that might least maybe consider have them consider re you know, changing their stance on that stuff.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.960
If the Switch doesn't do well, Nintendo may be done with hardware. Uh, I'm fine with that.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:20.920
They may be done with home hardware. Yeah. I mean, they're not leaving there. There's always going

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:27.240
to be a 3DS. Nintendo still has a lot of cash in the bank, but if the Switch also tanks in the way

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:33.640
that the Wii U did, um, I'm not so sure Nintendo will have another chance to do the home market. So,

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:39.160
but we'll see. I mean, who knows? I mean, Nintendo could also, I mean, you look at something like the

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.120
classic NES doing very well. So maybe Nintendo will milk the nostalgia thing for a few years.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:50.360
Who knows? Who knows? To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:56.600
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, chalk. But anyway, speaking of milking nostalgia,

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.600
something we love to do here at Orange Lounge Radio every week, we take a trip down memory lane

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:07.640
with a segment we call the classic game of the week. And usually Dark Sakura walks in here every

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:13.000
week to pick a game that she thinks is worthy of being in the archives of a classic video game

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.720
that, hey, you kids should drop all your, drop your fancy Final Fantasy 15s and play this instead.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:25.640
But unfortunately she's sick, but, uh, we brought in a special guest commentator here this week,

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:32.120
Alan, to choose a game for us instead. So Alan, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:37.720
The classic game of the week is Rock and Roll Racing for the Super Nintendo and Genesis

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:42.120
by Silicon and Synapse Studios, now known as Blizzard Entertainment.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:51.560
There you go, a little loading screen here. This game, uh, came out in June of 93,

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:57.080
uh, was a ton of fun. I know in particular, Rob, the conventions that we used to go to in our youth

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:02.120
group where we would hook a, I mean, when I say we, I mean, the group of people I was with,

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.760
we didn't know each other back then, even though we were at these same events. We hooked up a NES

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.280
to the hotel TV and we played Rock and Roll Racing, I think for like two and a half days

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.600
straight. The NES was just never turned off. Like we just played it and played, which is,

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.600
which is what you do when you're 14. Which said convention was always Black Friday weekend,

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.280
so good timing on your part. You gotta wonder if they're still using the same

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.080
hotel and everything for that all these years later.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:36.840
So, um, this game was published locally by Interplay Entertainment back before, um,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:45.080
Blizzard was really its own juggernaut. Uh, the playable characters in it, or for what the game

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:49.640
is, it's obviously, it's a racing game that's very combat oriented, maybe a little bit more

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.760
combat focused than Super Mario, which of course has Super Mario Kart, which does have a combat

01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:04.360
element. Um, it has four or five licensed songs in it. Um, I believe in 2013 or 2014 on the

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:10.440
battle.net site, you can play a demo of Rock and Roll Racing, but the licensed music has been

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.360
MIDI-ized because of course those licensing agreements have long since run out and they

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:23.800
don't want to, um, you know, pay to license Bad at the Bone and Johnny Gun and all that stuff again.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:34.520
Uh, the playable characters are Cyberhawk, Ivan Zephyr, um, Cyberhawk is kind of like a

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:42.360
weird sort of Batman clone. Uh, Ivan Zephyr looks like Chewbacca. Jake Badlands is like a cyberpunk

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:49.320
with like the Mohawk. Uh, Katarina Lyons is a cat girl. Damn furries always ruin everything.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:56.360
Stop it. Uh, no, I'm kidding. Uh, Olaf, Olaf the Stout is from the Lost Vikings. That was

01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:03.560
Blizzard's Easter egg is that he was in there. Right. Um, and Snake Sanders kind of looks like

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:09.400
the sort of blonde Gaston, like Dudley Do-Right type character. And then there was Tarquin,

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:15.400
who looks like the gay elf from Drawn Together. So which of these characters will be the next hero

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:21.720
in Overwatch? That's, yeah. Uh, this is a franchise that, and actually reading up about

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:28.760
this game, I didn't know that it had, um, they aren't really official sequels, both in name

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:35.480
and the fact that Blizzard didn't, um, create them interplay, put them out saying this is an extension

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.720
of this rock and roll racing IP. But I, I don't remember much about either one of them. But this

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.360
character, by the way, looks straight like an orc right out of Warcraft. Yeah. Or Slimer. He looks

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:49.720
across between orc and Slimer from Ghostbusters. Yeah. Wow. Um, one of the fun things about this

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:56.280
game is that it had compressed voice narration for, so Tarquin takes the lead, um, or she's

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:01.160
gonna blow when your car's about to blow up. And at the time, obviously, when it was still

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:08.120
kart gaming, you know, this was, I remember, I'm trying to think of when this came out in relation

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:12.200
to Super, Super Metroid, which had, you know, the, the galaxy is at peace, that was over part

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:18.040
at the beginning. So hearing voice that didn't sound like total garbage in a kart game was still

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:27.160
kind of undiscovered, um, territory. So that element of it was awesome. Uh, it played really well.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:36.760
No real kart stutter or frame rate lag. Uh, you could buy upgrades for your car. I believe the, the

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:42.840
most expensive car that you could get was like a hover car. Like it was on a, um, it didn't have

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:49.480
wheels. It sort of glided, but that wasn't the best car. The best car was this, the, um, this,

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:57.400
the second to best, which was the, uh, the one with, uh, like triangular, like treadmill wheels,

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:04.920
because it could make really sharp corners. Uh, so yeah, you can hear the, the, um, announcer

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.840
through the YouTube. Let me see if I can find the soundtrack for it. I was just to say real quick,

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:17.320
um, one of the thing about this game is that it's basically RC Pro-Am. Yeah, it was originally,

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.960
um, let me find it here. Was it supposed to be a sequel to ours? I mean, actually it was,

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:32.360
it was, um, specked out and budgeted to be an RPM racing sequel. Oh, interesting. But then some

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:41.960
point halfway through that interplay got all of the licensed music. And from then it became,

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.520
um, Oh, let's put Olaf, the Viking in this let's create, let's create the whole like

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:54.200
galaxy racer outer space thing. So yeah, it was originally specked as being a sequel to RPM

01:19:54.200 --> 01:20:00.440
racing, but then through development, it became a entirely separate and probably I'm not familiar

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:05.000
with RPM racing. I imagine it was a classic, but there's just so much style to this game.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.520
And it's sort of strange to me that, well, I mean, Blizzard also had Blackthorn, I think,

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.600
which is a game they made when they were a baby company that has absolutely like,

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:19.320
they haven't touched that IP. They probably never will. That style of game doesn't really sell

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:25.960
anymore, but this is something from their vault that they don't necessarily deny exists, but you

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.840
really have to dig for the fact that they made this at Blizzcon. I don't know if they still do

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.600
it, but they used to do it at Blizzcon. They would have a Blizz arcade type of thing that was like

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.000
their classics that you could play a Blizzcon and this game would always be there hooked up

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.120
as would, you know, the other stuff you mentioned, uh, lost Vikings, especially their older stuff.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:48.280
But yeah, I don't, I don't see Blizzard revisiting this anytime soon, but I guess you never know.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:55.480
Also lost Viking has Easter eggs and I think vanilla. Wow. There was that. What, what was the

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.920
old them? They show up. Yeah. You're right. I think it, yeah. Old war, I think is the name

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:04.840
of the instance that they show up in. Yeah. So they're there. And also of course,

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:11.320
one or more of the Vikings are in Heroes of the Storm. So the lost Vikings gets all of the credit

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:17.160
as being the vintage Blizzard game, but rock and roll racing is also, um, one of the, one of the

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:22.040
things in there. Um, a sequel to the original rock and roll racing was made for the 32 bit PlayStation

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:28.120
console by interplay. The game was sold in Europe as rock and roll racing to red asphalt. I've

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:34.680
literally never heard of this. I found, I found that out while reading up on what my classic pick

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:41.800
was. Yeah. I don't think it was a very good game from what I heard. Um, released December 16th,

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:48.600
2013 a motor rock is a game that was developed and published by yard team on steam. It featured many

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.200
elements, including art assets from the original game and some additional content.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.000
It was originally named rock and roll racing. 3d development was started in June, 2009,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.040
and it had an Indiegogo campaign. It was pulled from the steam store due to copyright infringement

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:08.040
from Blizzard because of course it was, um, it's for a fan project to just like, be like,

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.680
Oh, this is a sequel to the game. And a ton of like of assets are taken wholesale from the

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:20.200
original. It seems a bit silly. Um, but apparently since, uh, then yard team sells a game steam keys

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:30.200
through their website. So I may have to check that out. Um, and I still cannot find in this.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.400
You'd think I would have discovered it. Like I would have had it prepped before it was my

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:37.240
turn to talk about this, what the soundtrack was, but it was the, um,

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:48.200
um, bad to the bone born to be wild playing right now. Did it have the spy Hunter song theme song

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:52.920
in it too? Johnny, I'm trying to think, I feel like it did. Peter gun is the Peter gun is the,

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:57.800
yeah, that song. Yeah. So it did kind of get repetitious, but the game was so fun because

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:02.120
it was only the same three or four songs over and over again. And the voiceover announcer also was

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:10.120
kind of repetitious, but the game play was so smooth and fun and incredible that, you know,

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.920
when you were 14 playing this game at four in the morning, it was, it was a good old time.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:20.440
And I recommend if you were into combat based, I was like, why, when did Samuel L. Jackson get

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:25.560
into the game? Sorry. I had an ad pop up and I got it. I changed browsers today on the studio

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:30.360
computer, so I haven't been able to do all the ad blocking stuff. And I know twisted metal was

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:35.160
its own beast, but if you're really into those combat, like racers with a heavy combat element

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.920
where you're shooting missiles and cars, and it's really not even about who races the best,

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:45.160
but who can get the best shot in to blow up your opponents and just take the lead. Definitely check

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:50.680
this game out. So I found the song list for you. Okay. To the bone born to be wild highway star

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.480
paranoid and the Peter gun theme. Yes. Yeah. I think paranoid was a fit. That's black Sabbath,

01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:01.960
right? Yeah. So yeah, um, for this Ness and Genesis came out June, 1993 rock and roll.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:08.520
Awesome. Great pick. Thank you. Uh, there it is your classic game of the week. Rock and roll

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:13.080
racing. Dark soccer. I would have approved if she was here. Actually I swore up and down. She'd

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:17.640
already picked it, but I think we just had a side discussion of it one time when the blizzard thing

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:22.600
came up in the battle net, uh, and they were doing the whole revival. Cause I know that dark Tetsuya

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:27.720
is on it. He's probably already updated the Wiki right now with this game. I searched for blizzard.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.760
I searched for rock. I searched for racing. It was not there. It's not there. It's not there. Yeah.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:36.040
Yeah. No, I I'm always surprised that she'll find some games. She's like, can you believe I've never

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.120
liked silent Hill last week? Like really? She never done silent Hill before. Oh, cause she's

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.920
done two, three and four, but she's never done the original. So there it is anyway. Yeah. Lots

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:49.160
of classic games. You know, we're up to over 400 classic games. This has been, this segment has

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.400
been going since episode two 50 classic game of the week was not always here on the show.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.320
Um, it was the website of the week. Uh, yeah. And then it was something else before that.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.440
It was advice column that this one comes from the podcast days, not the original original life.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.840
There's five show. So yeah, it was the advice column. Then the website of the week and now the

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.880
classic game of the week. Um, and yeah, this one's been going strong since episode two 50. So yeah,

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.720
over 400, I would say unique classic games of the week, but there have been a couple repeats

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:22.120
on accident. She has accidentally repeated a game a couple of times, but it's still not a bad track

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:28.520
record for over 400 episodes. So anyway, uh, let's see a dark to see a giving credit where credit is

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.920
due that AJ mix actually does a lot of those updates. Uh, Alan, just so you're aware on the

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.200
Wiki anyway, uh, we're gonna take a quick break. Uh, when we come back, there's plenty more orange

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:43.160
lounge radio to come, including rapid fire news. What's in stores this week and some more news and

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:48.600
your calls at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. We will get to all that when we come

01:25:48.600 --> 01:26:00.200
back with more of orange lounge radio right after this. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:07.480
radio live tonight with episode number 667 for this November, the 27th of 2016, our show already

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:14.680
in progress. Um, Alan has retired, uh, to back into his, uh, office to go play some more Skyrim

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.840
or whatever game he's working on, but we thank him for sitting in on part of the show. He might

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.680
come back a little bit later. He did a good job of the classic game of the week. Um, I wish I'd

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:29.240
waited to do this on air, but during the break, I realized that Loki had yet to have crystal Pepsi

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:35.960
since the 1990s. And, uh, it, the crystal Pepsi came back in stock all of a sudden on the Amazon

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:42.360
pantry on black Friday. So I had a pretty substantial coupon because my PlayStation pro

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.920
I was in Chicago when the pro came out. Right. So I just had it shipped normal speed. So they

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:51.240
gave me a pretty good coupon for pantry. So long story short, I ordered and I had to get like an

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.280
eight pack of crystal Pepsi to, to get delivered here, uh, to, to get any of it. Cause Alan had

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.720
never had it either. So he finally tried it last night. And during the break, Loki had some crystal

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:05.000
Pepsi for the first time. Was it, was everything you remember from the nineties? Um, I don't

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.960
remember it being very good in the nineties and this is okay. It's just, um, uh, it's kind of

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:17.640
disturbing not seeing it caramel colored. Um, and it's just also, it's like, it's like how you

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.520
imagine diet, you know, when they replace the sugar with like sweetener, except they replaced

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.960
it with like more sugar or something like that. And so it's like incredibly sugary sweet. Like,

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:33.480
I feel like drinking this, I'm still going to do it is going to make me sick later to my stomach.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.320
Well, that's sick to myself, but like, it's going to be like, oh, I'm going to,

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.920
yeah, sugar coma. That's cool. Like I can be awake.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:46.680
Drink it slowly. Um, I would think maybe that's going to be a great mixer for something like,

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.400
uh, vodka or something that might be a place to use that. Then it's going to be like completely

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.720
clear alcoholic drink. That'll get me messy. Um, well, no, not vodka, but like, you know,

01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:02.440
staying awake. Um, I've been trying to work on, I went back to working on, um, my car game again,

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.400
so hopefully since everybody's been bothering me about, um, where'd you beat the car game?

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.120
Like someone to work on something else. It's like, fine. There you go. So I went back to

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:16.760
working on that again. Um, but I got to rebuild everything. It's going to be from scratch. So

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.000
yep. Uh, Brad from pod culture says guy, Hey, geek cuisine is our thing. Sorry. Sorry. My

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.600
friends over at pod culture, but just, I just tell them that like, I totally forgot I should

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.680
order a case of surge because that's really, that was my thing. I don't remember that at all. I

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.600
remember having it back in like high school, but I don't, we had it. Remember I used to, well,

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.840
cause I had gotten a job at Qs are cause I played laser tag and honestly got a job there for the

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.160
free games. Cause they give you like 20 games a month for free or something like that. Plus you,

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.160
whatever you want. So that was why I worked there for like minimum wage. Uh, but yeah,

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.600
search machine there. And so I used to get surge all the time, you know, playing keys,

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.960
art and stuff. And I love that stuff. It's so good. But then they'll make it anywhere.

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.000
That's the other nineties thing. I want to make a comeback as cues are, I'm sure you,

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.640
you much more than me. Oh yeah. Unfortunately that's never going to happen just because,

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:07.320
um, does it still exist? Like it does still exist. It's the, the closest location to us.

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:12.120
I think they have one Vacaville things still going and then conquered is the other one. Um,

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:18.520
those are the two closest in Pleasanton, but it's just a lot of the, unfortunately the,

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.440
like the people that own, like the Qs are franchise originally like the rights to

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.080
everything. They sold it off. And then like, there's a guy named will low who had like 300

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.800
packs from all these different clothes locations. And I think those have been sold off, but they

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:36.680
have another company now in the UK. I want to say that's making the parts again for those. Um,

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:40.760
I honestly thought it was like the best laser tag that they had out there. Cause I played quite a

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.480
few of them and I thought that one was the most fun. There's a lot of like, well, they're not

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:49.320
indie, but they're like other systems. Then they just, they don't call them. It's like,

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:54.840
branded the same one of the bowling alley golf land has one. There's a specific laser tag place

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.920
in Carmichael, the laser castle thing. Yeah. They've got lots of like these systems where

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:03.080
they just rebrand their own laser tags thing. But Qs are, was more of like a franchise that

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:07.080
was like across the world. So that was like, well, none of these still have Qs are locations

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:11.400
like in the UK and Australia and stuff like that. And now I feel too old for Qs are like,

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:14.600
I don't want to play against a bunch of teenagers. Really good exercise. I would be doing it

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.720
honestly. Like if it was still around, I would probably be doing that every weekend. Um,

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.200
cause it's fun. I had a lot of fun with it. See, you know what, this is where I'm missing out.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.200
I should, I should have an Amazon referral link for the show because now all these people in

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:32.040
chat are like, Hey, the crystal Pepsi is still on prime pantry. I gotta get, and now they're

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:36.680
sharing a link with you for surge is apparently there on Amazon. I know it's on Amazon. I just,

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:43.160
I'm not ordering it cause I don't need a case of surge. I mean, try explaining that to the wife.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:47.000
I don't need to explain to the wife. I've got like, I've got two cases of like

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.400
red bull at my desk at work. So that's fine. That's true. I mean, whatever. And I'd surge

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.640
is good, but like the new, the, the new one that they have now is not the exact same as

01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:01.560
the old one. It's slightly different. Um, flavor wise. So that's unfortunate. If it was exactly

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.480
the same, it'd be pretty awesome. But I would say crystal Pepsi is very similar. It's not the same.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.960
Yeah. From what I remember, like soda is different in a can versus a bottle. It is,

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:15.000
and I've had it in a can. I have had the last time I had crystal Pepsi and I only tried it once was

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.640
in a can. I was like, Nope, don't like that. I liked it when it was. Um, so I had it in a can

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.880
in, um, surge. I used to always get it in a bottle, but yeah, you're right. It does taste

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.520
differently. I Pepsi is Pepsi is actually good pretty much in anything except I think the fountains

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:32.200
actually the weakest for Pepsi. Whereas Coke tastes the best out of a fountain, especially

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:36.360
a fountain that doesn't, you know, regulate the amount of carbonated water versus syrup and has

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:41.560
way too much syrup. Yeah. Or even those Coke 360 machines, they get all like the, like little

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:46.600
citrusy flavors in there because it's all mixed together. Yep. That's good. All right. Anyhow,

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:51.400
we can talk about soda all night, but we got to get back to video games with some rapid fire news.

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.760
Loki, what do you have for us? So we've got our first taste of what's going to be coming out for

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:59.640
games with gold in December and it's actually a pretty awesome lineup. So, um, for Microsoft

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:09.400
on the Xbox one, you're going to be getting, um, let's see here, uh, sleeping dogs. That's

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:15.560
going to be like the definitive edition and then also outlast. And then on three 60,

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:21.320
you're going to be getting a via backwards compatibility, burnout paradise and Outland.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:27.560
So that's a pretty fantastic lineup right there. Burnout paradise and sleeping dogs. I mean,

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.040
yeah, that's a pretty killer lineup. Burnout paradise. I'm really looking forward to having

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:37.880
on backwards. Fantastic. No word on what Sony has available yet, but it's probably not burnout

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:43.400
paradise and it's sadly, there's no backwards compatibility stuff that is really hurting them.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:50.040
I think. Um, cause it's just, I mean, there's great games coming out each month and just Sony,

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:55.320
I don't know. I'm just getting less impressed each month with the stuff that comes out for free,

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:00.040
though to be fair, I don't play most of it anyways, but I would play burnout paradise again

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:05.320
because I have it on PC. Um, speaking of games coming out again, there's, um, going to be a

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:10.840
rerelease of Lego city undercover for other consoles. Cause remember Lego city undercover

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:14.840
was one of those Wii U launch titles. I think it was launched actually may have been after launch,

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:20.680
but close to launch, um, that only came out on Wii U and it was originally being shown off as

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:26.360
a grand theft auto Lego game, which it kind of spun off into something else, but certainly looked

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.840
exactly grand theft auto with the same HUD and everything. Um, but now it's going to be coming

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:36.680
out on PlayStation four and Xbox one and on the switch and that should be coming out, um, probably

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:41.560
next year, but I will definitely pick that up cause it looks awesome. I never did pick it up on

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:45.880
Wii U and that might be one I had to pick up on the Wii U, but I may wait. Yeah. I think there's

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:49.320
a lot of people that are probably in the same boat issue where it's like, wow, I really wanted

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.800
to play that game, but eh, I didn't really want to play it on Wii U. I think it's just hasn't

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:59.480
come down in price. Maybe it has. A lot of Wii U stuff hasn't. That is unfortunate. Like I,

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:06.040
I don't know. I, I, I saw when I was at Toys R Us over the weekend, I saw that super Mario

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:12.920
all stars on Wii. They still want 20 bucks for that. 1999 for a, for a basically a virtual

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:18.120
console release on a Wii disc, which that game actually was never on virtual console because

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:22.760
they can charge 20 bucks for it and people will pay it. Yeah. Which is funny. Well, yeah. Cause

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.440
yeah, it's actually, it's not funny at all. Yeah. Cause it's super Nintendo games, which they charge

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:31.080
way too much for anyways. It'd be charging like what? $10 for eight bucks, eight bucks,

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.680
maybe nine on wheels. I don't remember. Ridiculous. I understand. Don't get me wrong.

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:41.080
These are great games, but you long ago made your money back on this shit and it's fucking stupid.

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.760
They should be selling those virtual console games. Like they do the fucking humble bundles

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.080
because you know what? Like there's a lot of games out there that I may not purchase, but

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:53.960
I would fucking build up a library of like, especially like these sales that come on.

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.040
I buy a lot of stuff that I honestly don't play on the PlayStation or, but I purchase it because

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.120
it's so cheap. And you know, there's a lot of stuff like virtual console. They could be totally

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.040
taking advantage of that, but they're fucking greedy because they're like, well, our games

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:11.160
are quality and they should be sold for this amount. Yeah, you're right. Your games are good,

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:15.880
but you know what? Those games came out decades ago and you made your money back

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:22.440
so many times on that. It's fucking stupid. Well, maybe a lot of copies are still on the shelf,

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.560
so maybe, uh, maybe the folks will speak on that and get it a discount on that.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:33.240
Dark Tetsuya says in our chat room, I don't know if I need Mario all stars that badly.

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:37.080
All I need to do is buy Super Mario Brothers 2 and already have all the virtual console

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:42.040
additions anyway. Well, to be fair though, and to be fair, the Super Mario all stars

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.000
remakes were really good, especially the original Mario and Mario 2 turned out really good as well.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.760
Mario 3 didn't have a lot of changes cause it was already kind of the newer game, but, um,

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.880
and I can't remember if the all stars they're selling in stores also has Mario world on it

01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.040
or not. Cause remember that was the thing. There was Super Mario all stars plus world

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:04.440
was a packing. I don't think so. Yeah, it probably isn't probably isn't anyway. Uh,

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.560
speaking of retro friends, if I remember correctly, that was one of those games that

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:13.480
they dumped someone had dumped the disc and it was literally like a 30 megabyte ROM. It was stupid.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:19.320
Anyway. Um, speaking of retro franchises that keep coming back, uh, some new trademarks have

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:24.520
been filed by Bandai Namco and these trademarks were filed in Europe and two of them have to do

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:32.600
with Pac-Man. There are two new Pac-Man trademarks for Pac-Man, cash rush and Pac-Man and leprechaun.

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:36.680
One sounds like a slot machine and one sounds like a mobile game. That's what it sounds like to me.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.880
I wouldn't say cash rush sounds like it's a slot machine.

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.400
Slot machine or a ticket redemption or something like that. It's probably not

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:47.960
going to be what you think. I doubt these are new console games or anything like that. Although,

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:51.320
I mean, to be fair, I mean, we kind of roll our eyes at these, but.

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.000
Or cash rush could almost be like a lottery, you know, like a lotto.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.840
A lotto ticket or something. Who knows? Uh, but I was gonna say like, you know,

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:03.720
to be fair, like Pac-Man championship edition deluxe plus, and I really like championship

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:07.240
edition too. I know a lot of people didn't, but I still thought, found a lot to love in that.

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.280
So a lot of actually the Pac-Man, I even like Pac-Man 256. Like a lot of the Pac-Man titles

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.360
lately have been pretty cool. So, you know, I guess don't knock until you tried it.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:23.400
Uh, there were also some trademarks, uh, for skies unknown, uh, the precious 12 and fortune gears,

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.200
but we don't know exactly what those could be. Those could be literally anything. So,

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:32.040
but there they are, some trademarks. That's why we put it in rapid fire news because everything

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.040
else is pretty much speculative with that. Uh, something that is a little more certain,

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:41.800
in fact, almost too certain is Ubisoft giving away 30 days worth of giveaways.

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:46.200
If you sign into Uplay and go to the 30 day site, you can start looking at some of the fun little

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:50.360
giveaways that they're giving away. And some of it is a little silly, like greeting cards for

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:55.560
Just Dance or something like that, but they are also as part of this giveaway, giving away

01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:00.680
copies of PC games through Uplay. Like you can actually get Rayman or, you know, some of the.

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:04.120
Well, they have the 30, was it like the 12 months that they were doing that too?

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:09.000
Yeah, but now, well now they're doing the 30 days of, of Christmas as well. Uh, or the 30,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.880
30 days of giveaways. Cause you know, you can't really say Christmas, but anyway, um.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.240
Why does Nintendo own Christmas?

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:20.040
Uh, maybe, uh, all that stuff aside, if you want to know what they're giving out, well,

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:24.680
good news. It's all already leaked anyway, because the source code for the webpage had

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:30.760
all the giveaways listed in it. And it was leaked to Twitter. Now Ubisoft has since updated the

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:35.320
page and who knows, maybe they'll try to shuffle some things to make it play out a little

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:40.360
differently, but we kind of know now what's going to happen. So that's what's going to happen.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:45.000
Uh, those PC games to talk to you about, there's going to give away some PC games as well as some

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.760
of the other stuff. So, um, there you go. Let's talk about what is coming out in stores this week.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.800
Loki, what's in the US.

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:57.080
So this week we've got Blade Shield on HTC Vive, um, Dark Master or Darksiders,

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:03.320
uh, War Master Edition on PC. Steins Gate Zero on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:09.320
Final Fantasy 15 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Watch Dogs will be coming out on PC.

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:15.480
Townsman on PC. Apollo Justice, Ace Attorney on iOS.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:26.040
Maze on PC. Rad Rogers, World 1 on PC. The Dwarves on PC, Mac and Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:35.400
Fury on Xbox One. Little Briar Rose on PC. Steep on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.960
And finally, Super Mario Maker for 3DS. Oh, okay. 3DS. All right.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.640
Uh, going over to Japan, a little game called Final Fantasy 15, I think has people's attention.

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:52.120
They're getting that on Tuesday, which is usually our release days, but, uh, usually I don't think

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:56.200
Tuesday is a release day in Japan. So they are kind of shifting things to coincide with us,

01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:01.080
uh, so that that way it's a worldwide release. So they are getting that. Uh, I would usually think

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.000
a week that a Final Fantasy game is coming out, there would be nothing else, but believe it or

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.960
not, there are still some releases in Japan this week on the usual, uh, Friday, December 1st is

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:14.920
going to see, I guess these are rereleases Biohazard 4, 5, and 6 are all coming out from

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:20.040
Capcom in Japan. Uh, so that is something to look forward to on PlayStation 4, the crew ultimate

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:24.520
edition as well. Dragon Quest Builders moves into the ultimate hits collection and we'll get a

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:30.280
release there. Uh, and then also God Eater 2 Rage Burst. I think that's also a price reduction. So

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:35.560
a lot of these are just, uh, titles that are moving into greatest hits or some type of like

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:41.400
remaster or whatever, but Watch Dogs 2 gets its release in Japan on December 1st. So you do have

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:46.680
that to look forward to as well in Japan. Now I'm looking at some of the other consoles. The 3DS

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:53.240
has All Common Rider, Rider Revolution comes out on December 1st. Also Mario Maker for 3DS also

01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:58.120
arriving in Japan this week. Uh, there's also some new amiibo from the Legend of Zelda series to go

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.120
with that. The Toon Link and all that stuff is out this week. Although, um, yeah, I guess this

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:08.200
is a new like Legend of Zelda series, uh, and not like just a rerelease of the Super Smash

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:14.840
Brothers ones. Uh, there's also Digimon Universe is out this week on the 3DS. Uh, lastly, taking

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.840
a look at the PlayStation Vita, uh, this week there is a new model. There's a silver and a

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:27.000
metallic red PlayStation Vita. Uh, Dragon Quest Builders gets its, uh, rerelease price reduction

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:34.040
as well on the Vita. Uh, and then Digimon Story also on the Vita. And Katamari Damacy,

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:40.920
no Vita, gets a rerelease, a welcome, welcome price. And Taiko no Tatujin V version also getting

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:46.280
that same rerelease. So it looks like you get a lot of, uh, like price reductions and repackagings

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:51.400
things moving into like best hits type collections in Japan this week. Uh, how about the UK, Loki?

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.880
Um, the UK, we've got Final Fantasy 15 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Watch Dogs 2 on PC.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:03.880
And, um, finally, let's see, Gravity Rush 2 on PlayStation 4.

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.920
Uh, and thank you to, uh, Dark Tetsuya in chat reminding me, oh yeah, they did announce this

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:12.520
during a Nintendo Direct some time ago. And now I'm, now I'm remembering this again. Uh,

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.640
there's also the 8-bit link in the style of the NES original version and a Twilight Princess 1

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:21.720
too. That's right. So that's all in Japan this week. So I imagine it must just be around the

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.400
corner for us. I know your release date thing doesn't track Amiibo, but I can't imagine it's

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:29.480
not also releasing here real soon. Probably. Probably another way for Nintendo to make a

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:35.720
little bit of money going into the holiday. So let's get into, excuse me guys. I'm still getting

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:41.160
over that cough. Uh, let's get into the mailbag of which I think we have like one email this week.

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:46.760
So we're going to get into tonight's email. Um, where's my email music? Here it is.

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:57.880
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungelaungerator.com is the place to

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:03.000
send us an email and we will read your emails here on air. And this is the only email I believe

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.040
we have this week, which I think just missed the cutoff for last week's show. I think it came in

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.360
during the show. So I'm going to read it now. Uh, this is an email from Reddertainment who says,

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:18.120
uh, dearest denizens of Potopia. That time of year has come again. That time of year when my parents

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:22.840
start to bug me about what I want for Christmas. Since I'm an adult, who's pretty good at buying

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:27.320
his own thing. I don't have any ideas for what my parents can get me for Christmas. Do any of you

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:34.840
have any ideas? No, my parents won't buy me anything gaming related. Don't ask why it's just

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:39.320
that way. Reddertainment. Well, if they're not going to get you anything gaming related,

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:45.880
I don't know if this is the show to be emailing to be fair. What else do you like Reddertainment?

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:51.160
Ask them to give you an Amazon gift card. Yeah, yes. Actually, that's not a bad idea.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:57.160
Ask for gift cards for Amazon, Toys R Us, Target, and then you can go buy video games.

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:02.520
Huh? I think you just have to outsmart them a little bit Reddertainment. That's how you're

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.600
going to get the video games. I don't know. Are you into Legos? I was looking at Legos at Toys

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:10.200
R Us the other day. There's a lot of fun sets. They're so expensive, but there's not all of them.

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.920
Now they finally have a, they released like a generic set for Toys R Us. That's just like,

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:19.960
here's a variety of blocks in different colors for like 60 bucks for a ton of blocks. You know what

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:26.360
else came back from my childhood that I was not prepared to see at Toys R Us? Domino Rally.

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.040
You remember that? Domino Rally's back. I think you should buy that for your kids.

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.320
Provided the little one won't try to eat the dominoes. No, he won't eat the dominoes,

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:38.920
but here's what'll happen. And this is just like with any of the blocks that they have.

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:42.440
They will throw them around the room. They'll land on the floor. They won't pick them up off

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.160
the floor. And my cat will knock them under the couch. Cause that's what she does. Or they'll

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:50.360
throw them under the couch and then like, Hey, why not under the couch? I'll get them out from

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:54.360
under the couch and they'll do it again. All right. Uh, since, since we're not very good at

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.640
coming up with ideas for entertainment, one thing we love to do here at, uh,

01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.160
orange on radio, we crowdsource to our chat room. So here's some ideas for your

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:05.480
entertainment from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, SSJ100 Matt suggests

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:12.440
crystal Pepsi. Um, let's see. SSJ100 Matt also suggests a puppy or a wife. Um, I'm sorry,

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:18.920
a puppy or a kitten. And Akuma JP said, get a wife. That's actually like a wife with a W.

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:23.000
Don't. Don't if you don't have to.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.080
Raygenator suggests a hooker. Uh, Akuma JP suggests a Monoprice 3d printer.

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.280
I would love a 3d printer. 3d printer might be fun. That's actually,

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:37.640
I would love a 3d printer. There you go. So there's something, then you can 3d

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:41.560
print all the gaming things. I would want to build a 3d printer, but they never have a build

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.560
base. It's large enough for me. And I haven't found any instructions on how to make larger

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:51.480
3d printers by combining, you know, some of those hotbeds and stuff, but yeah,

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:55.960
I would love a 3d printer. All right. So there it is. Uh, some suggestions from our chat, uh,

01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:04.040
over at live.vognetwork.com. All right. Let's move on with more show. We're going to get back

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:11.160
into some news, right? Loki. Yes. Um, so Sony's got some stuff coming to the, or some surprises

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:16.920
coming, I guess, to the PlayStation experience. Um, they have a full list of games, but there's

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:22.680
also some unannounced panels as well. So some of the stuff that they're bringing, um, like Ace

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:27.080
combat seven looks pretty cool. And especially that's possessed some VR as well. Um, a lot of

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:33.800
games are already out already, like Batman Arkham VR bound. Um, let's see if there's anything else

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:42.280
that's really kind of stand out ish. Um, full throttle remastered. I didn't realize that was

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:46.280
being remastered. That's kind of cool. So that's something that's going to be coming. Uh, grant

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:53.880
there's no sport. Uh, there's a new hot Sunni Miku game project diva future tone horizon zero

01:46:53.880 --> 01:47:11.320
dawn looks pretty cool. Um, let's see. Uh, new hog two. Let's see. Uh, there's the evil seven.

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:18.360
Yeah, it looks pretty cool. Um, lots of PlayStation VR stuff, um, Sonic mania. But, uh,

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.640
one of the things that hopefully will be there, and this is of course a huge rumor is, um, which

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:27.240
by the way, I just want to say, I think has already been disproven just so you know. Okay.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.920
Well, I hope it's undisproven, but, uh, the thought was maybe during the whole Capcom cup,

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:37.640
they're going to make an announcement for a new game. And the hopes were for Marvel versus Capcom

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:43.320
four. I would love to see that, but I don't think that's going to happen. And apparently that,

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:50.840
yeah, as you mentioned has been disproven. So. Womp womp. Yeah. I'd heard about the whole, uh,

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:56.760
Marvel versus Capcom rumor. And you know, the, the reaction from some of my friends I was with was

01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.440
didn't, didn't, weren't there a lot of issues with licensing and Marvel versus Capcom three

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.680
towards the end. So it seemed very unlikely that a four would, would actually have, you know,

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.160
they could work that stuff out. I mean, I don't know. Um, it would be a place to announce that I

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:16.360
would think, but, um, maybe not. We'll, we'll have to see. I like surprises though. So I would even

01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:22.120
be fine if you can't do a Marvel versus Capcom game, maybe like a guest character for, you know,

01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:26.680
street fighter or something like that. I don't know if they're going to do that though. Um,

01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:32.360
but yeah, so too bad. Well, there's some announcements at least we know,

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:37.800
so hopefully we can expect some surprises. All right. Well, moving on to talk about,

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:43.400
Ooh, I like this. Dartetsuya says maybe we'll get Capcom versus SNK three. Oh man. I would,

01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:47.480
I would be so here for that. If that happened, I would be so excited. I'm not really. I could

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:53.960
see cause you know, SNK seems to be pre-opened that kind of stuff. So maybe, maybe SNK would

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:59.080
be developing it. Although I preferred Capcom's version back in the day, but you know, I'd,

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.480
I'd still be excited if that was an actual thing that happened. Uh, anyhow, moving on to something

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:09.400
we were talking about earlier in the show, the NES classic additions controller and why it's so

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:14.440
darn short. Um, apparently, uh, you know, some research has been done on this issue and the,

01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.640
the issue with this is, uh, the communication protocol that is used, uh, is that apparently

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:26.040
this is a high speed chip to chip communication, but the length, I guess, uh, for this communication

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:31.800
to actually work is the length basically that the cord is at right now. Uh, why didn't they do a

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.120
thicker cable? Well, it would have been more expensive and I guess less practical when we

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.440
talk about more expensive because I guess $60 for this system may have already been pushing it. I

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:45.000
don't know. Uh, but there's also talk about extension cables saying that they work, but

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.240
they're pushing the limit of the protocol and you might get communication errors, but you just may

01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:54.200
not notice them while you're playing. Uh, why didn't Nintendo just use something else? Well,

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.800
because if that was the case, then they would have to make new controllers for the mini that

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:03.240
weren't necessarily compatible with the Wii and the Wii U, which I guess I'm with that.

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:09.000
Exactly. It's like, who gives a fuck? You know what you could have done? You could have made the

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.960
fucking original NES controllers. Hey, imagine that you can make an NES controller and it just

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:20.200
fucking works because you build the port in there. I don't understand why they had to have

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:24.840
compatibility with the Wii U and the Wii in the first place. I don't understand why this can't

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:30.120
just plug into the Wii remote, just like the classic controller does. And I've never had a

01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:33.960
problem with virtual console or any of that. So I don't buy any of this shit. What kind of, what

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:38.760
kind of fucking chip to chip protocol only works at two fucking feet away? But, Oh, those additional

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:42.920
V that's really pushing it. That's a bullshit right there. That's just, it's technology from

01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:50.760
1982. That's why it's technology from 1982. No, fuck that. And you know why that doesn't make any

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:55.720
fucking sense? Because technology from it was analog. Okay. It was analog fucking stuff that

01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:00.120
they had working there and they had eight foot cables on the original NES controller.

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:05.400
So, Oh, and now it doesn't fucking work. I don't think so. It's just a bullshit excuse. I'll tell

01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:10.360
you why, what they probably had standard size, size cables, because those two foot cables were

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:15.240
meant to be plugged into a Wii remote that was wireless anyway. So they didn't need to have

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:19.880
an eight foot long fucking cable. And then the, or the key parity between their other accessories,

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:24.040
maybe they had some sort of internal guidelines that they have to do for these stupid accessories.

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:28.520
That's why the cable's that long. It's not because of fucking, Oh, the chip can't fucking

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.280
handle it because that's stupid. Then use a different chip or use a fucking chip that you

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:37.480
had in fucking eighties because that shit works just fine. It's a whole bunch of nonsense and

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:45.240
bullshit. I use, you know, usually guys, I'll try to, I'll try to nudge Loki on some of these

01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:49.400
rants, but this one I kind of agree with because if the extension cables worked just fine,

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:53.560
I'm sorry. There was a potential that it could look, you know, it might not work.

01:51:54.680 --> 01:52:00.680
I don't think so. I think it's dumb. Yeah. All right. Well, let's move on Loki,

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:04.280
calm down and go to the next story. This is so stupid. Like just say, listen, we,

01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:09.320
it was too expensive to have the longer cords. Just keep it that we want the cost of the system

01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:15.320
doubt. It was too expensive to have longer cords or like we wanted the ensure compatibility with

01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:20.600
the, we, um, you or the, we, and so because you know, all of our accessories have a certain cord

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:25.480
length, that's why you may give a fucking honest answer instead of trying to bullshit us with this.

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:31.720
That's the worst part about it. I just, I hate fucking PR responses is what I hate.

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:36.040
So Pokemon goes gotten some updates lately and this is actually kind of interesting stuff.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:38.920
They're really trying to get players back into the game. So one of the things that they added

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:43.800
was a new Pokemon. So you can actually catch Ditto now. And Ditto is kind of a unique character

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:48.520
obviously because with Ditto, you're actually not really catching Ditto. You're catching something

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:52.520
else and it ends up being a Ditto. And then what's kind of cool is when you actually take Ditto and

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:58.600
fight him, um, against other Pokemon in the gym, it'll turn into those Pokemon. So it's kind of

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:05.560
neat to see that unique gameplay with Ditto. I caught a Ditto here at the house. It was a Rattata.

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:11.160
But, uh, yeah, yeah, I'll have to play a little bit more to check it out. Also, if you're interested

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:16.120
in checking it out again, you'll be happy to know that they're doing a double XP in Stardust event.

01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:20.840
So it's going to be running between now and November 30th. So you got a few more days left

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:26.760
of that. So go check it out. And along with that, they've also expanded the, uh, nearby

01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:32.520
in sightings features. So now instead of just having, you know, this no distance whatsoever,

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:36.360
it's kind of giving you like pokey stops that things are nearby, kind of like what they were

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:41.240
doing in like San Francisco for a long time. But now it's kind of expanded outwards. If you live

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:48.200
west of the Mississippi. Right. Sorry, New York. So, um, yeah, apparently it's available now. Um,

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:53.720
you know, west of the Mississippi and, uh, except for Hawaii and Alaska and America and then British,

01:53:53.720 --> 01:54:00.200
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Mentoba, um, in the western half of Ontario, Canada,

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:04.520
and all of Australia. I don't get why they're rolling out, whatever.

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:11.400
Well, my hope is, is that that was pretty quickly after they expanded the San Francisco Bay area

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:16.040
part. So maybe you guys will get this the right. And when I say you guys, the East coast will get

01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:23.160
this like in a matter of a week or two and not much more. So I hope for you guys, I hope so.

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:29.800
Oh, all right. Have you, have you played much Pokemon go Loki since this, that changes?

01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.960
No, I turned it on the other day and that's when I found out that they had updated the

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:37.560
nearby thing. Um, cause I was trying to see if there was like, maybe it did a nearby,

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:42.440
but then I turned it right off. Yeah. We caught a Charmander here and actually

01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:46.120
we must live in a Pikachu nest because Pikachu shows up all the time. In fact,

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:50.120
I just brought it up to see if maybe there was one available and sadly there's not,

01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:56.440
but there is a 429 EV available right now. It's a pretty good, uh, pretty good CP roll for an EV.

01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:01.640
So I might try to catch that there to try to evolve it later. We'll see. Anyway. So I'm still,

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.560
I'm still doing the Pokemon go thing, but then again, you know, I also still play a lot of

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:09.480
Ingress and all that other stuff. So I'm just, I'm a fan of location-based gaming. What can I say?

01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:15.080
Oh, there we go. Back to my, back to my three day streak by catching that EV. I'm proud of myself.

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:21.400
All right. Moving on to a story about Xbox One and, uh, you know, I got to admit as much as I

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:27.880
enjoy the Xbox One and it's got a lot of great games, the UI still feels clunky to me. And that's

01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:32.200
certainly because of the fact that it was designed for the Kinect where if I had a Kinect, it might

01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:37.240
feel less clunky. Uh, but a lot of people like myself don't have the Kinect anymore. So things

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:43.000
like snap mode feel a little strange. Like I just, I, I realized some of you might think I'm weird,

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.280
but I just cannot get used to it on the controller. It doesn't feel right to me.

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.640
Well, Xbox One, they might get rid of it. But the reason doesn't have to do with people like

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.880
me bitching. Uh, the reason why this might happen is because the snap mode is based around the

01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:02.040
windows 8 dashboard system. Uh, and of course, obviously things have upgraded a little bit since

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:07.320
windows 8. Uh, so apparently according to a report from windows central, uh, Microsoft is looking

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:12.440
into a system that will replace snap mode with something more picture and picture, which is more

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.240
compatible with the universal windows platform apps. So unfortunately don't know a lot more

01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.720
about it besides that. Uh, but if any UI alterations are coming, they're probably going to

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:27.240
come next year around the same time. We start to learn more about project Scorpio and whatever the

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:33.800
real name is behind that, which I'm sure we will learn all about at E3 2017. But, um, look, you

01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:37.640
don't, do you have, I don't think you have an Xbox one, right? That's the one you don't have.

01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:41.080
No, I don't really have to worry about the whole snap. It's, it's a little weird to me.

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:47.640
It looked weird. Like again, it's kind of sad, but it's true. Like the best UI that Microsoft

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:54.040
ever had was the original 360 interface. It really was. Yeah. And it's kind of sucks that now it's

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.920
just like, it's too convoluted. Sorry. That doesn't mean there aren't some great games on

01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.680
Xbox one, but it's just the UI is kind of, I want to get an Xbox one. I was, I almost

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:06.280
picked a couple up, you know, but I'm just still going to wait a little bit longer. They will come

01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:11.960
down to price even more. And especially next E3, you know, I mean, I don't, I don't know if I

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.240
really wanted a Scorpio because I don't either really see what the gains are from that. Just,

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:22.680
I don't know if it's going to be worth it for the price, but we'll see. Well, again, isn't the

01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:27.640
Scorpio supposed to be kind of like a pro where the games will still work on Xbox one, but they're

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:34.040
all supposed to scale up because it's like the windows, uh, windows 10, I guess where it scales

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:39.960
everything. Right. Right. We'll see. I mean, I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. Uh, just a couple

01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.480
more stories for you guys. Then we're going to open up the Skype line at orange lounge radio.

01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:46.840
We're almost to the end. Believe me, I told you it was lighter news week. So we may finish a little

01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:50.600
early tonight. I don't know. It just depends on calls. So the console version of Minecraft is

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:56.120
getting quite an update. Um, so they're going to bring almost all of the PCs additions, um,

01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:02.040
to the consoles with the holiday update. And so with that, they're going to have the, um,

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:06.760
some of the things they're adding, the Altria wings, um, that I guess allow you to

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:14.120
fly and glide the amplified terrain and cities, uh, dragon's breath, potion ingredients, and

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:20.440
more also they're including, um, new UI, uh, new mobs items, blocks says effects.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:29.320
And, um, I guess Altria, the, or they'll find, I guess you'll find the ultra in the end. Um,

01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:34.280
but yeah, I mean, God, I've, it's been so long since I played Minecraft in cities. I have no

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:38.680
fucking clue what that is. Um, I'm interested to see, I know they have like these new cabins

01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:43.640
and stuff on the PC version with the illagers, um, wonder that's coming in later on, but it's

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:48.280
nice to see the consoles kind of catching up. Um, and then also hopefully mod support soon.

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:53.000
Cause I know that they do have that on the pocket edition, uh, where you can do like some sort of

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.600
like basic mods with that. Be kind of cool to see that on console as well. I was telling my son

01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:02.520
about this cause I'm like, Hey, I'm all, they're going to be doing an update for the Wii U version

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:06.600
pretty soon. You got to check it out. Cause he plays it every week. So he was checking out

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:12.200
actually, uh, this week, the, um, Chinese mythology skin that they have on there. Cause they have all

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:17.080
these like free skins and each one has its own world with it. And what's kind of cool. I don't

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:22.760
remember those being free on like Xbox 360 and stuff, but for whatever reason, a Wii U they are.

01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:30.040
And so, um, yeah, like the massive, he's like been in the mass effect one before and the Skyrim one

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:33.800
and, um, but the Chinese mythology one was pretty cool. I liked the music in that. So

01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:37.880
looking forward to it. I'm sure my son's looking forward to it more than I am.

01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:41.000
Yeah. I love that these console versions of still getting updates all this time.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
I really need to go back and play again because it's been a long time for me too.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.560
I there's a lot of like, I don't think there's a lot of, um, it's still too kind of like open ended

01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:54.600
as far as what you need to do in the game. I think it'd be cool if they have like, you know,

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:59.240
a little bit of the monster, um, was it monster quest builders type stuff in there, you know,

01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:02.280
a little bit of like that where you can actually build like a village and there's a little bit of

02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:06.360
questing around that. That would be kind of cool if they add that in the Minecraft. Um,

02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:11.960
but I don't know, that's pretty cool. All right. Well, last but not least tonight,

02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:17.240
a story about origin. That's right. EA's online store platform, which we haven't talked about

02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:22.120
in quite a while. I can't imagine why. Um, but anyhow, EA has made some updates to the origin

02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:28.280
store, uh, with some new features and that is to add items to your wishlist and the ability to gift

02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:33.720
games and DLCs to other users. Both of them just went live just in time for black Friday,

02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.080
uh, which I think they're having a sale. That's still going, which by the way, you know, it's

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:41.080
as much as I throw a little casual shade at origin now and then they have made a lot of

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:44.920
improvements since the early day when we used to really bag on them. And the fact that, um,

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:50.040
the Mass Effect trilogy is available for like 19 bucks. I think it's either $19.99 or it's $24.99,

02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:53.720
which is a steal for those three games. Uh, so, you know, just a cheap plug for that there. If

02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:57.800
you've never played the games, if X for happens to be listening out there. Cause he's, he even just

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:00.440
wrote a tweet earlier tonight that said, I'm thinking about getting into Mass Effect cause

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:04.760
Robin Shane wouldn't shut up about it this weekend. Uh, anyway, but what's interesting

02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:09.080
though, is that despite the fact that they're finally adding these features, which seem like,

02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:14.200
kind of like, Oh, aren't these kind of normal for stores? Uh, well, apparently they do have

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:20.600
limitations. For example, you can only gift already released content, not pre-orders and

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.520
that includes DLC. Well, I guess that is reasonable. You can only give something that's

02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:30.520
already out, but you can only gift EA published games, not third party content. You can't get

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:37.240
virtual currency. You can't gift bundles that have virtual currency. Uh, and you can only gift to

02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:42.680
friends in the same country as you. I think that's good, especially with all the things that they've

02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:48.440
had via the EA hacks with the whole FIFA cards and stuff. I suppose I'm kind of okay with that.

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:51.640
Okay. All right. That's a good, that's a good perspective. I wasn't thinking about that,

02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:57.000
but you know, steam does have the ability to gift across different regions and so forth, but

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.280
steam has also had not rampant, but they've had some problems in the past with, you know,

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:05.880
some hacking and so forth, you know, kind of the same type of exploits about, you know,

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:10.520
giveaways and certain games and what like selling those in the marketplace for lots of money. Right.

02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:16.680
So, yeah. Well, anyway, maybe it's a little explanation as to why EA's system is a little

02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:21.320
more limited. Anyway, that is going to do it for the news this week. Uh, but we are now going to

02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:26.280
open up the Skype line for you guys to have your say. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:29.800
is the place to be. If you want to give us a call to talk about anything we've talked about so far

02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.880
tonight and your perspective on it, or maybe something we missed that you're really passionate

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:38.040
about. Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or if you prefer to do things

02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:43.720
old school, you can 1-877-GAME-OLR, but I think most people are on Skype these days.

02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:50.600
Uh, we are getting a call on the line, so let's get to it. And hello there. You are on Orange

02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:55.880
Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Strelok. Hey, Strelok, buddy. How you doing? Uh, not too bad.

02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:00.360
What's on your mind tonight, my friend? Uh, not too much. I wanted to talk a little bit about,

02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:05.000
uh, Pokemon Sun and Moon. Oh, please do. How are you enjoying Pokemon Sun and Moon?

02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:14.280
Um, a lot actually. Uh, I was afraid that, uh, I didn't intend on buying it at first because of the,

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:20.760
uh, removal of the whole grid, uh, system. Right. And so our listeners remember, if they haven't

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:25.880
heard a call from you before, you are a blind gamer. So sometimes these accessibility things

02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:31.320
are very important. Um, so, uh, yeah, getting rid of the grid system where you would, you know,

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:37.160
be able to, when you move up, down, left, right, you kind of know where you are based on how many

02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:44.280
times you press the button. That kind of goes away in this, right? Uh, yeah, but it's actually,

02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:51.960
see, I was envisioning, like, if you guys remember Lumiacity from X and Y,

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:59.960
and how much of a mess that was like to, to move, I was kind of imagining something kind of like

02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:08.360
that. And it's actually not, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's not easy, like, particularly to,

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:16.760
or as easy to move around, um, as it was previously, but it's, uh, still doable

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:21.080
and I've been able to progress. So. About how far in the game are you right now?

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:25.880
Um, not too far at all, just cause I haven't played a whole lot, but I'm,

02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:32.280
uh, just got to the, the big city on the first island where you can,

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:39.960
um, change your, customize your character and stuff. Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And,

02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:46.280
uh, about to fight Team Skull for the first time. It takes a little time to get there. I mean,

02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:50.440
the beginning of the game's kind of long. So, uh, yeah, a lot of, a lot of cut scenes. There is,

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:53.240
there's a lot of stuff that goes on in the beginning of the game, but, you know,

02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:56.680
it's kind of, it's kind of the same as most Pokemon stories is that, oh,

02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:01.240
we just moved to this new town and now I'm going to leave for a long time to go catch Pokemon.

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:10.440
It's kind of the, what I think is interesting is that, um, your character in, uh, Sun and Moon

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:17.720
actually comes from Kanto, which is the region of red, blue and yellow. Yep. So it's kind of

02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:24.360
a nice nod to, you know, being it being the 20th anniversary game. Well, that and the fact that,

02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:29.800
you know, you have the remakes of the gen one Pokemon that show up as well. You know,

02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:36.680
they have the Alolan forms, um, that are there, which apparently, uh, the gen one originals are

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:42.280
in the game. You will see them when we open up the Pokemon bank and all that stuff. So yeah,

02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:47.560
you will have the possibility of Alolan Raichu for, uh, fighting, you know, gen one Raichu.

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:52.760
That's, that's going to happen. Um, but, uh, you know, there's a lot of the throwbacks to gen one

02:05:52.760 --> 02:06:00.360
with also a red and blue are characters in the game. Yeah. What I like too is about the Alolan

02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:05.560
forms is their, uh, typings are different too, which is pretty interesting. Definitely mixes

02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:11.080
the game up a little bit. Um, any, any favorite Pokemon early on, or maybe from things you've

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:15.640
seen, uh, in trailers or, or, uh, you know, heard about online or whatever. Um,

02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:24.120
I don't know. The, uh, starters are pretty cool. The starters are pretty cool. Um, I, at, uh,

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:29.480
Toys R Us this weekend, I wasn't prepared to see this. They had the stuffed animal versions of the,

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:35.320
uh, starter toys, but it's, but no, they were gigantic instead of being like the little sized

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:39.800
ones. Yeah. I already have the trio that you can get a GameStop, which are more little size.

02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:45.320
These were gigantic. So they're like carnival. Yeah. They're like carnival sizes. We're like

02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:50.440
the Litten Litten's head is as big as my own head. I swear. There's a, uh, for those that would want

02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:55.400
to check it out, um, on, on my Instagram, which I think is public, I don't know. Uh, but I actually

02:06:55.400 --> 02:07:00.200
posted a picture of me with this huge Litten. I'm sure tiger clock and dig up the link for you guys

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:06.920
to put it in chat. Um, but yeah, you can actually see this thing is like as big as my face. So nice.

02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:14.360
Um, but yeah, so, uh, but they were 75 bucks each. Yeah. For, for something that size. Right.

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:21.080
So they were, they were huge and we're so funny. You didn't even have to like play, you know,

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:26.440
$600 worth of skee-ball to get them. Yeah. $75 doesn't seem so expensive when you put it that

02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:31.480
way. Um, and a lot of my friends on Facebook were asking where's Popplio? And I said, I'm not

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:39.640
letting that thing in the picture cause I'm so rude. I'm so rude. But guess what? I have

02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:48.040
all the starters right now in my Pokemon party, including Popplio. Yay. Speaking of, uh, not

02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:54.440
gaming related, but did you hear about that whole thing that came out? It was either earlier this

02:07:54.440 --> 02:08:01.800
year or maybe last year with that guy that was trying to like sue a carnival because he spent

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:07.480
like thousands of dollars trying to get a, like one of those stupid bananas or something like

02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:13.480
that. Uh, well, if the game was rigged so he couldn't win at all, there might be a case,

02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:19.000
but otherwise, uh, there's a certain risk reward. I think you kind of know going into it. I mean,

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:24.120
he would have to prove that it was completely faulty for him to have any merit.

02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:29.480
Yeah. Yeah. I think the guy was just salty cause he spent a bunch of money and

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:34.520
that's what it sounds like. You gotta be careful with those carnival games. Uh,

02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:38.360
you don't ever assume you're going to win anything more than a little piece of shit.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:42.520
Like what, what are the little, little crappy prizes they give you like spider rings, spider

02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:48.360
rings, spider rings, erasers, erasers, and spider rings and, and, uh, Tootsie rolls.

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.320
That's going to be about the extent stickers. That's going to be about the extent of what you

02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:57.080
win. Yup. Well actually it was, yeah, we spent like about $10 at one of these arcades and we

02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:01.240
got, they were playing the ticket machines and one of the things that they got were stamps. Like

02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:05.480
my kids got stamps that like a soccer ball or football and those things are a piece of shit,

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:10.840
but they love them. They like kids eat that crap up because they was like, Ooh, a stamp. I could

02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.240
stay myself. Yeah. Then they, then they stamp everything. They stamped the walls, then they

02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:19.960
stamp dinner plates and stuff. Usually just themselves. Um, but, uh, also what was I going

02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:24.280
to say with that, that whole thing? Um, Oh, around one, uh, cause they have a ton of claw

02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:29.480
machines there around one. I have seen grown adults, uh, no different than you or me drop

02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:34.120
so much money into that to try to win like a little Kirby or something like that. I could

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:40.120
just imagine being there or just spending all the money, uh, trying to win. I can't really talk

02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:45.240
because I will do the same fucking thing in record keeper trying to go after a specific relic.

02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:52.280
I guess it happens to the best. We all have our weaknesses. All right,

02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:55.720
Sturlock, my friend, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but keep enjoying Pokemon. All

02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:59.960
right. Yeah, definitely. I'm looking forward to, uh, I'm also looking forward to, uh,

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:08.680
final fantasy 15 colon dude. Where's my chocobo. Me too. I hope, I hope the story is as in depth

02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:14.760
as other, other episodes. I I'm just been really trying to avoid spoilers to, to, uh, keep it,

02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:21.240
keep it a surprise. Yeah. Should be interesting. Games been in development for 10 years,

02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:26.200
just 10 years. You know, no biggie. All right, my friend, take care. All right. All right. Bye. Bye.

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:30.200
Yeah. That's the other thing that makes fun. Uh, one eight seven seven game,

02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:34.200
OLR or username on Skype, orange launch radio. That's the other thing that makes this final

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:39.240
fantasy 15 such a big deal is that, you know, we've been waiting 10 years, 10 years for this

02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:44.920
game. I mean, the E3 where this was announced was like one of our first E3s that must've been

02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:49.240
the Paris Hilton year. The, the year I called the Paris Hilton E3. That was the one where the, we,

02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:54.680
the, we, it was the last big E3 before they clamped down to the airport. That was the E3

02:10:54.680 --> 02:11:00.280
where, uh, final fantasy versus 13 was announced. If I remember right, you went that year, right?

02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.560
We went to the square Enix theater and they had like all the different trailers, right?

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:08.680
Um, that was our big appointment was we got to sit and watch a bunch of, a bunch of trailers,

02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:14.520
but it was great that the presentation, so yeah. Um, wasn't that, was that the year that

02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:24.120
they announced 13 and then, and 14, uh, was it that year? Uh, or was it the year before,

02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:28.360
or was it 2009 when that happened? No, I feel like that was the year.

02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:35.080
2006 was the year they announced all of them, but I don't think the game actually showed up until

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:41.960
like 2009, I think was the year that they announced final fantasy 13 was coming and 14.

02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:50.200
And that was a big like, Ooh, ah moment. And that was the first E3 back at the, uh, convention

02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:56.280
center after the two down years. So, yeah, everybody thought he made a mistake when he

02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.280
said Final Fantasy 14 was going to be coming to PlayStation three. We all thought he meant

02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:05.320
13 verses, but then Nope. They showed that trailer that Nope, it is really final fantasy 14

02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:11.080
online. And I just remember, I know I started like, I started like scream crying in like

02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:15.880
Sony's booth because I wasn't at the, but uh, Sony's booth, you could just walk in and watch

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:20.440
the press conference. And when I saw that I just was like, like hyperventilating tears because,

02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:25.480
you know, I'd played so many hours of 11 and then for that game to come out and for it to be so

02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:34.120
fucking bad. So, so bad when it first came out, but thankfully they fixed the, the, they can come

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:38.920
back from that. The no man's sky can come back from the mess that it is. That's right. Diablo

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:43.640
three came back from its original release. That's just, that's the world of games we live in now.

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:47.960
If Final Fantasy 15 sucks when they release it, you know what? Yeah, they'll just patch it next

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:56.040
year. They're not going to kill the Final Fantasy brand that easy. Uh, Dungeon Buster in chat says

02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:01.880
the good old Fabula Nova crystalis constellation of Final Fantasy 13 games. Yeah. Of which type

02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:05.480
zero was the other one, right? It was originally supposed to be a mobile game and they kind of

02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:10.440
sorta like it ended up being on the Vita and then they did the PS4 release and all that. That was

02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:17.560
also part of the 13 trilogy or 13 Fabula, none of it, which seems to tie together with anything.

02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:20.520
Yeah. Right. None of them seem to tie together with anything. I don't think Final Fantasy 15

02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.440
supposed, but I mean, they've had a decade. They probably changed the story to really separate it

02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:33.160
from 13. Yeah. My thought was a lot of those stories were tied into, uh, maybe what we got

02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:39.160
in 13 two and lightning returns, which I still always want to call 13 three. All right. Uh,

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:43.400
one more shout out for calls orange lounge radio on Skype or the old fashioned way one eight seven

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:49.320
seven game O L R. Um, any last minute stories you want to bring up? Logie? It's been kind of

02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:52.520
a slow. I don't know if there's a lot else. There was a, um, one thing we didn't mention,

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:58.440
there was a majora's mask fan film. You can go check out. It's animated. Some guy worked on it.

02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:04.920
Um, so it's called majora's mask, a terrible fate. So go check that out on YouTube. Um,

02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:11.720
that's pretty cool. That's sadly it. All right. Well, I don't see the phone lighting up. I think

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:16.200
we probably have a few less live folks tonight because of, uh, some folks traveling back from

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:21.960
the holiday weekend. So we're going to go ahead and, uh, wrap it up. Um, and, uh, call it a night

02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:26.200
here at orange launch radio, but thank you guys as always for your support. Thank you for downloading

02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:30.040

02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:03.560
tweet us twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, but that is pretty much going to do it for another episode of

02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:08.760
oral are, uh, Loki enjoy the crystal Pepsi and a good luck with programming. Oh, you really did

02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:15.480
almost finish. I'll enjoy. Yes. All 58 grams of sugar in this. Uh, and, um, yeah, have a good week.

02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:20.280
We'll see you next time. Any closing thoughts for our listeners tonight? Um, I'll try working on my

02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:25.160
game some more, but no guarantees because I have Skyrim. And so, you know, that is distracting.

02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:31.960
It's very tempting. And to just waste hours of time, which is basically doing the same quests

02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:36.680
I've done over and over and over again. It's just like, but it's funny because there's so

02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:42.440
many of them. I forget what they are half the time. So, well, I will not be promising any work

02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:48.280
on a game of mine because I know final fantasy 15, of course. Yeah, that's coming out tomorrow.

02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:52.440
Yep. Uh, that's, that's pretty much that, but I, I will look forward to seeing you guys potentially

02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.920
on a live stream or, uh, you know, I do have the PS4 pro, you know, one advantage of the PS4 pro

02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:01.400
it does stream at 60 frames a second. I was looking at a extra with streaming

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:05.640
Overwatch and it looked great. So I'm excited to do some streaming in a 60 frames a second.

02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:10.760
That'll be fun. So, uh, thank you guys very much for, uh, downloading and checking out the show.

02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:15.160
Um, I don't really have a final thought besides that. I'm looking forward to Final Fantasy 15

02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:22.040
and, um, you could, I guess a cheap plug for my Twitch stream over at Rob Roberts, um, which I

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:26.120
Loki, you, do you ever stream anymore? I think I have your name. I think you Loki OLR on Twitch,

02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:30.920
right? I think I have you set up. I don't even remember what my login is to be honest.

02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:35.880
I'm probably not. I don't, I don't tend to do that because if I'm playing games,

02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:41.560
it's most likely my wife's watching Netflix or something or, or even then, um, I don't

02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:47.080
talk over anything. Cause if I have a headset on, my voice is loud. It wake up the wife awake

02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:53.400
up or like they're watching TV. That's just irritating. So I, the last time I was able to

02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:58.040
even play online games with a headset was in the garage and I'm not doing that. Fair enough. Fair

02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:01.800
enough. All right, well that is going to do it. Uh, for another episode of orange launch radio,

02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:05.880
have a great gaming. Those together are going to play Final Fantasy 15 this week. Uh, enjoy it.

02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:09.800
I hope it's great. I'm hoping with you guys, for those that are playing other games this week,

02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:14.440
have fun. Uh, and we will see you in seven days for another edition of orange launch radio to

02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:18.360
talk about the game awards and to talk about the PlayStation experience. It's going to be

02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:21.000
a busy week next week. We will see you then in seven days. Good night.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.680
or bog network, but you know, they were all still true.

02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:58.680
See you next week.

02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:26.680
Okay.
