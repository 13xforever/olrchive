0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	28000	This week we're doing the Time Warp back to 2006 when Nintendo's hottest new console was nowhere to be found, the NES Classic Edition. Also, OLR was only 4 years old back then. Stay tuned for more news from a now-teenaged OLR right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and Time Warp indeed. We are not live tonight with episode number 665 of our show.
45000	61000	For this, a special Wednesday edition, November the 16th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me once again, reunited without the use of radio magic and it feels so good, say hello to DarkSakura or Tami Summers.
61000	66000	We're definitely Time Warping back to 1938, 1939.
66000	72000	Yes, I know there's a lot on everybody's mind this week, but we're just going to try to play some video games instead.
73000	76000	If I could live in several different video game worlds, I would be pleased.
76000	90000	Which world would you want to live in? I think, even though I'll probably get a lot of crap from Shane for this answer because I don't know enough about it according to him, I would want to live in the world of Pokemon. I would. What world would you want to live in? Video game world.
91000	101000	It's actually pretty hard to say. I mean, because, I mean, maybe like a hundred years pre Reaper Mass Effect, maybe, you know.
101000	103000	So you have a nice, a chance to live a nice life.
103000	105000	So I can die before that's done, you know.
105000	107000	A nice full life before, yeah, that all starts.
107000	112000	Or, or even I would say maybe post Inquisition Dragon Age.
112000	114000	I see BioWare fangirl to the very end.
114000	120000	Oh, maybe. Or I would just be a nice barmaid on Azeroth.
120000	122000	That works too.
122000	124000	I would be the barmage.
124000	128000	Would you, would you, would you work at the Goldshire Inn on the Moon Guard server?
128000	132000	No, because it has those fucking creepy kids. You know what I'm talking about.
132000	134000	I do. I know what you're talking about.
134000	135000	Oh my God.
135000	141000	Alright, welcome back. Sorry, I got to do some audio adjustment on the fly for Dark Soccer because it's been so long since you've been here live. We've missed you.
142000	147000	But welcome back. Quickly, how has your gaming month been?
147000	148000	What is up with my mic?
148000	150000	It's just super sensitive tonight.
150000	152000	No, it's actually like weird.
152000	154000	Oh, it's like falling apart in there or something?
154000	156000	Maybe. Hi, Mike. I'm nice to you, pet, pet, pet.
156000	159000	We'll figure that out. Just don't swing it around too much. We'll, we'll operate on it.
159000	161000	I'll swing my thing where I wanna.
161000	169000	No, I'm, it's been interesting because I've had some voice problems.
169000	170000	Yeah.
170000	173000	And, which I sound okay right now, but.
173000	175000	Do you? No, you sound fine.
175000	184000	Girl. So, but like I'm on like a big work restriction where like I have to spend 10 minutes every hour just not talking.
184000	189000	And it's, it's made my life interesting. It's made me learn to listen a lot more.
189000	190000	Interesting. Alright.
190000	194000	So forced silence. Everyone should try it.
194000	195000	Well, I hope you feel better.
195000	196000	Thank you.
196000	205000	And don't, you know, it's, it's great to have you back here on the show though, where luckily since we have several people to share the responsibility here, you don't have to talk nonstop for an hour, which is nice.
205000	210000	You're, you're no Bobby Black Wolf, but I would encourage you to join us sometime.
210000	212000	I'm glad, he's hairy.
212000	216000	I would encourage you, encourage you all to join. What's wrong with that?
216000	217000	Until Dan, I was going to shave him.
217000	218000	There's nothing wrong with that.
218000	219000	I mean, like shave his back.
219000	220000	Alright, anyway.
220000	223000	Just to see if he would notice, like if he woke up with no hair on his back.
223000	238000	OMG. Anyway, you can usually listen to us live Sunday nights, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com immediately after the very handsome Bobby Black Wolf and his show, which you're on.
238000	239000	He is handsome.
239000	246000	But we're not live this week. As mentioned on the show previously, I was out of town last week over the weekend.
246000	250000	So we're giving you this kind of podcast only special bonus show.
250000	256000	Usually I would introduce about now Techmaster Loki, but sadly, Loki couldn't be here tonight.
256000	261000	And, you know, as tempting as it is to make a joke about can Loki and Jamie be in the same room right now?
261000	262000	Like what's going on?
262000	266000	Actually, Loki had a family emergency he has to deal with. He had to bow out this morning.
266000	269000	So our thoughts are with what's going on.
269000	270000	I was just going to say reasons.
270000	273000	Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't want to, you know, it's not my place to disclose.
273000	277000	He's fine. Wife's fine. Kids are fine. It's something else.
277000	278000	That's all I can really say.
278000	279000	Reasons.
279000	282000	So hopefully he'll be back Sunday.
282000	289000	I would really be sad if he missed a huge landmark episode like Sunday Show, which is episode 666.
289000	294000	However, the reality is real life first, family first. We all know that.
294000	297000	So fingers crossed and all that stuff.
297000	303000	However, joining us in studio at last minute notice, which I really appreciate.
303000	308000	Say hello, everybody, to somebody else who we haven't heard from in a while on this show due to work
308000	312000	and the environment and place where he works. It's Alan is back.
312000	313000	Hello.
313000	316000	Hi, Alan. No, not Shane. It's Alan.
316000	317000	Oh, right.
317000	318000	How are you, Alan?
318000	319000	I'm good.
319000	323000	Good. Happy that the elections are over since you work in that polling and all that stuff?
323000	324000	Yes.
324000	326000	Yes. So.
326000	333000	I'm happy that the election is over because of my work schedule, not for any other reason.
333000	337000	Right, right. I wasn't trying to set you up for anything there, but it's nice to have you.
337000	340000	It's nice to have you back on the show this week.
340000	344000	So you're going to help step in and do some of the stories that Loki was going to do for us tonight.
344000	348000	And how's life been treating you recently?
348000	349000	Good.
349000	353000	Yeah. Oh, let me ask the question that came up with Dark Soccer and myself at the top of the show.
353000	357000	If you had to live in any video game world, what video game world would you want to live in?
357000	360000	Possibly Skyrim.
360000	361000	Yeah.
361000	368000	It's fresh on my mind and the version of the game that I had before the special edition, all the dudes were basically like naked.
368000	371000	Like they were technically wearing uniforms, but.
371000	375000	So you don't want to live in Skyrim. You want to live in modded Skyrim.
375000	376000	Yes.
377000	378000	Absolutely.
378000	381000	Alan Alchemy's head cannon Skyrim.
381000	386000	Do you have the Skyrim where the dragons come out to the Macho Man song?
386000	388000	Because they have Macho Man's face.
388000	391000	I thought it came, but they actually came out to the Village People's song.
391000	392000	Oh, yeah.
392000	394000	Instead of roaring, it would say, oh, yeah.
394000	396000	Oh, okay. I thought it actually came out to the song.
396000	398000	There was also a Tommy the Tank Engine mod.
398000	400000	Yeah, that's right.
400000	402000	Is that a part of your Skyrim head cannon?
402000	403000	No.
403000	404000	Because I would want to, oh.
404000	405000	No.
405000	408000	The world of Skyrim is pretty brutal. You got to have something to lighten it up a little bit.
408000	409000	Yeah.
409000	411000	That's why you roll cabbages down the hill.
411000	414000	I could probably mod it. I could probably find a mod to put like Taco Bell in it or something.
414000	417000	There you go. No, that would be Shane's Skyrim head cannon.
417000	420000	It would be the Taco Bell in every village.
420000	424000	What about what Jamie's suggesting, the 5,000 cabbages rolling off a hill?
424000	426000	Is that something that would exist in your Skyrim world?
426000	427000	It could.
427000	428000	Okay.
428000	432000	Well, because if you have access to console, that means basically you're God, so.
432000	433000	Yeah, okay.
433000	438000	I would also want to live in Rezworld because it would mean that I was high as balls.
439000	442000	Is that from watching me play Rez the other night on PlayStation 4?
442000	443000	Yes.
443000	447000	Or you were playing Rez with the headphones on, which is the cruelest thing that you could do.
447000	448000	I'm sorry.
448000	452000	Because of that incredible music. And I'm like, ooh, he's playing Rez and I can't hear a damn thing.
452000	457000	It's more selfish. Let's get it right. It's more selfish because I wanted to be surrounded.
457000	464000	I wanted to be cocooned like Jasmine Masters in the experience of Rez.
465000	468000	But it was selfish because I wasn't going to share that with you by putting it to myself.
468000	473000	You weren't willfully inconsiderate. It was just a symptom of the true reason.
473000	474000	Yes.
474000	475000	Okay.
475000	480000	All right. Anyway, we'll get into our gaming weeks a little more specifically in a little bit.
480000	485000	We don't have a chat room tonight, sadly. Usually I would plug our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
485000	492000	But again, we will be back on 20 November with episode number 666 of our show live.
492000	496000	So if for some interesting reason this is your first episode of Orange Lawns Radio,
496000	499000	I realize this episode's a little different because we actually don't have the live thing going on.
499000	503000	But we wanted to do something a little bit special. We don't like missing shows.
503000	508000	But I will mention real quick before we get into our kickoff topic, I did spend the weekend in Chicago.
508000	513000	And I didn't get to spend a lot of time there, so it's not like I could meet up with all these different people and so forth.
513000	517000	And I wasn't really there for a gaming convention or anything like that.
517000	524000	Although I was there, well, I don't like to say I went to play Ingress because that wasn't the sole reason I went.
524000	532000	I went to Chicago to visit Chicago and Ingress was a good excuse to have something to do while I'm there.
532000	535000	But it was really about visiting my friends that were out there.
535000	541000	And I have some friends out there, several of the hosts of a show that used to be around Koopa Club live there.
541000	544000	And we became friends through the podcasting community and all that stuff.
544000	548000	So I was able to hang out with them and just really get to see Chicago.
548000	551000	And I had a great time. It was a fun city.
551000	556000	You really need to go, Alan. Next time, we'll go when there's not an election happening.
556000	558000	And I think you'd enjoy Chicago a lot.
558000	562000	Let's go like early February. Just like the worst part of winter.
562000	567000	Not during the winter. That's the one thing. I love Chicago, but I don't love the winters there.
567000	570000	That airport is cursed because you briefly had a scare.
570000	572000	Everybody gets delayed at O'Hare.
572000	579000	And actually, I learned that for transit, it's honestly easier to do Midway.
579000	581000	So, note to self.
581000	583000	The weather there is really Bucky.
583000	584000	Yes.
584000	586000	Bucky O'Hare.
588000	594000	Anyway, didn't really do a lot of gaming in the city.
594000	596000	Didn't do a round one or a Dave and Buster's.
596000	598000	I mean, it was just Ingress.
598000	601000	I've talked ad nauseam about that game and so has Loki.
601000	603000	So I don't know what else I want to say about the event.
603000	605000	We lost. I mean, that was that.
605000	608000	But I had a good time. It's not really about winning or losing because it was just meeting people.
608000	611000	And I met people from all over the country and had a really good time.
611000	615000	So, yeah, I really found a lot to love in Chicago.
615000	619000	You got to eat pizza flavored casserole. So that was good.
619000	620000	Yes. Yes.
620000	623000	That is authentic deep dish pizza. It was amazing.
623000	628000	They took me to a place in Chicago called Cheesy's, which like everything on the menu is like super cheese.
628000	634000	Like I had a grilled cheese sandwich, but instead of just grilled cheese, it actually had mac and cheese in it.
634000	637000	And I knew it was going to make me sick, but actually it didn't.
637000	641000	I did very well. I was ready for it mentally.
641000	642000	Prepared. Anyway.
642000	644000	All right. Enough about food.
644000	646000	Let's get into video games.
646000	650000	Although I suppose snacky foods like mac and cheese go hand in hand with games sometimes.
650000	653000	And things from the past, which is our kickoff topic tonight.
653000	658000	So a lot of the stories we're going to focus on this week are things that have come up kind of in the last week.
658000	662000	And then on our next live episode, we'll focus more on the stuff this week.
662000	670000	But obviously this is a big story that kind of continues to go on is the release of the NES classic, the miniature NES.
670000	677000	Right. And, you know, we've talked about this on the show before leading up to this, but these retro consoles have been doing very well.
677000	679000	Like Atari has had a new one.
679000	681000	I think they're up to what, like flashback seven or something.
681000	684000	They've had a new little Atari on the shelf every year.
684000	687000	It seems like of some type of flashback console Coleco.
687000	689000	There's one out there in television.
689000	691000	Sega is really big on these now too, right?
691000	698000	Like a target, you can get a Genesis or a handheld, but they didn't call it.
698000	700000	They didn't name it after the Sega handheld.
700000	703000	They just have like a handheld Genesis that you can get too.
703000	706000	Well, now Nintendo's getting in on this action.
706000	711000	And since there's not really a lot going on for Wii U this holiday,
711000	716000	granted 3DS has Pokemon, there's not a lot going on on Wii U.
716000	719000	This is kind of Nintendo's big thing for the holiday.
719000	725000	And it was released on Friday and it pretty much sold out instantly everywhere.
725000	730000	Like most Nintendo things tend to do these days, it seems.
730000	735000	Jason mentioned in the intro there, the Wii had this problem, right? Big time.
735000	738000	If you weren't camping outside back in 2006.
738000	741000	Remember 2006 Dark Soccer when we traveled around to all the lines?
741000	743000	What was it we gave out?
743000	747000	Orange soda as promo for the show. Some cheesy thing. Donuts.
747000	749000	Donuts is part of it. Maybe coffee.
749000	753000	I know that Kristin and I bribed our way into the Wii line with donuts and coffee.
753000	756000	No, they were great. It was just Kristin.
756000	758000	Maisie wasn't here for that, right? It was just Kristin.
758000	762000	But she was great in helping us go around and all that.
762000	765000	Yeah, I just had a great time.
765000	770000	Anyway, so there was that with the Wii.
770000	774000	And then with the Wii U, there was lowered supply.
774000	778000	It was a little harder to find, but I think because the demand for the Wii U wasn't as high,
778000	781000	it wasn't as big a problem. Just kind of depended where you were.
781000	784000	I remember when you got your Wii U, it was a week or two after release,
784000	786000	and you said, I'm going to open up the Target app.
786000	788000	No, it was the day of. It was the day of.
788000	789000	Oh, it was the day of.
789000	792000	But it wasn't like 6 a.m. camping out front.
792000	794000	It was like after brunch.
794000	797000	Yeah, we were out eating and you're like, I'm going to check the Target app,
797000	801000	we can find one within 30 minutes drive that just has one, I'm going to get it.
801000	803000	And they had like three of them.
803000	805000	Yeah, they did. So I ended up getting it.
805000	808000	So it wasn't as bad, but then Amiibo was a fucking nightmare.
808000	815000	So this has a lot of people asking, why can't Nintendo figure out this supply and demand thing?
815000	818000	And are they doing it on purpose?
818000	821000	And this question was asked around the time that Amiibo were launched.
821000	823000	Is Nintendo doing this on purpose?
823000	829000	Are they driving it up or are they, I guess, artificially, maybe in some way making demand
829000	835000	so that this becomes the hot must-have Christmas item that news stations are going to report on to get this thing more coverage?
835000	836000	What do you think, Alan?
836000	838000	Do you think Nintendo is doing this on purpose?
838000	845000	Or do you think Nintendo really just doesn't understand that there is an audience for this stuff?
845000	847000	I would say that it's on purpose.
847000	849000	Yeah, I think it's calculated.
849000	855000	I think they will figure out how many they think will sell and then kind of do exactly that amount
855000	859000	or maybe scale it down a little just so that it's like all profit.
859000	863000	Like they just move every single unit and they just be like, we'll catch up later.
863000	866000	What about you, Dark Soccer? You like to collect collectibles.
866000	870000	What are your thoughts on the mini NES or classic NES, whatever they're calling it?
870000	872000	Is this something you and Dan are interested in or?
872000	877000	We talked about it, but we have, I think we do have all of those games.
877000	879000	You have the real thing.
879000	882000	And we also have an EverDrive.
882000	886000	I just wanted it to sit on my desk because it's cute.
886000	888000	I mean, you wanted it as a prop.
888000	889000	I wanted it as a prop.
889000	890000	As a paperweight.
890000	896000	We discussed that the big problem with it has to do with the length of the wires on the controller.
896000	897000	Yes.
897000	898000	And that they're hardwired in.
898000	902000	It must be for like college kids in a dorm room because you have to play the thing on your lap.
902000	903000	Like it's crazy.
904000	906000	Well, I'm thinking it's designed for an office.
906000	909000	It's not designed for your living room. It's designed for your office.
909000	910000	That's my thought.
910000	913000	But look at the length of the ones on the original Famicom.
913000	915000	They were also hardwired in and pretty short.
915000	916000	Yeah.
916000	917000	So.
917000	918000	I guess that's true.
918000	922000	It's just, it's weird though that it won't support like wireless through the Wiimotes or something.
922000	925000	It's just, it's some of the, some of the decisions are really baffling sometimes.
925000	926000	Yeah.
926000	927000	Like the thing that gets me, here's the thing.
927000	932000	And I talked about this when the mini NES first came out is that I kind of felt like I don't need one
932000	937000	because we already have virtual console on the Wii and the Wii U.
937000	939000	So, I mean, what is this thing?
939000	944000	It's just basically virtual console with 30 preloaded games that will never change.
944000	946000	At least that's what they say.
946000	950000	And I don't think that thing suddenly has internet capabilities in it.
950000	955000	So I'm pretty certain that they're going to keep it at just the 30 games that are with it.
955000	958000	It's a power AC plug and HDMI.
958000	959000	That's it.
959000	960000	That's it.
960000	966000	But then I heard that, well, the emulation in these things is actually supposedly better.
966000	970000	The picture quality is going to be better than what you get on the Wii U and the Wii.
970000	976000	And to be honest, I don't know why, but that actually like it really bothers me that that's the case.
976000	981000	Because I'm kind of like, you can't be asked then to patch that into the Wii U,
981000	986000	give me that same software in the Wii U, whatever you're running on that $60 device,
986000	992000	put in my $250 device that I spent $5 a game for NES on,
992000	994000	whereas this other thing is $2 a game.
994000	998000	I don't know. There's a part of me that's just really irritated with this thing.
998000	1001000	But then of course there's the half of me that's like Jamie where I'm like,
1001000	1004000	but it is really cute and I kind of want one for that reason.
1004000	1011000	But I don't know. It would be a hate purchase. I'd hate myself after buying it.
1011000	1018000	If you're a Nintendo fan, I think the code of life you live by is fool me once, shame on me,
1018000	1022000	fool me 20 times, yay Nintendo!
1022000	1026000	That's so true though! Nintendo always gets a pass on this.
1026000	1028000	And like, when are we going to draw the line?
1028000	1032000	Like how many times have the people listening bought Link to the Past?
1032000	1034000	Probably six or seven.
1034000	1036000	And I'm honestly probably included in that.
1036000	1040000	I can't wait to buy a Zelda game. Which one? Oh, the old ones again and again.
1040000	1042000	Just buy them forever.
1043000	1049000	I don't know. I know people have been buying them and they've been having a great time with them.
1049000	1052000	And it is a really solid collection of games that's in it.
1052000	1058000	And to be fair, if you're not stocking up on virtual console games on Wii and Wii U,
1058000	1061000	it is only $2 a game versus $5 a game.
1061000	1063000	So in that regard, it's a pretty sweet deal.
1063000	1065000	So like, I get it. I'm not knocking it.
1065000	1070000	But I'm just, I'm kind of irritated that Nintendo's got one thing going on over here
1070000	1072000	and they got another going on in the Wii U.
1072000	1077000	And you fucking know. You know when that Switch comes out, they're gonna make you buy them again.
1077000	1081000	Now, I can only hope, fingers crossed, toes crossed,
1081000	1086000	that Nintendo's gonna do something like their upgrade program from Wii to Wii U
1086000	1089000	where it only costs a dollar or whatever it is.
1089000	1091000	Hopefully they do something similar for the Switch.
1091000	1096000	But then my question is, well, but what about the ones that we bought on the 3DS?
1096000	1100000	Because now you've got two ecosystems becoming one,
1100000	1104000	although Nintendo says the 3DS is still separate, blah, blah, blah.
1104000	1106000	You guys all know I don't believe that.
1106000	1110000	The fact that it was a dollar upgrade is still shady as hell,
1110000	1112000	but because that's more than what we're used to from them.
1112000	1114000	Because think about what Xbox does.
1114000	1119000	I mean, they are porting the games piecemeal, but you're still getting them.
1119000	1120000	That is very true.
1120000	1126000	At least I could justify the one dollar because it is a picture quality upgrade.
1126000	1129000	You do have the fact that you can play it on the gamepad.
1129000	1135000	You have just minor, minor features that, okay, a dollar is fine.
1135000	1140000	But if I had to pay another five dollars, I would have been very, very upset.
1140000	1143000	So I'm hoping Nintendo does something like that with the Switch,
1143000	1146000	that at least they charge maybe a nominal fee.
1146000	1148000	But I don't know.
1148000	1151000	Do they have a need to do Virtual Console
1151000	1156000	if now it's shown that the mini things can sell fine on their own?
1156000	1159000	Does the Switch even need Virtual Console?
1159000	1162000	I kind of think it'll have it anyway.
1162000	1166000	I had that day off, and it was around three or four in the afternoon
1166000	1168000	when I realized, oh, that came out today,
1168000	1171000	and I wanted to maybe just see, just like you in the Wii U,
1171000	1173000	if I could find one for the lulz.
1174000	1180000	But by then, I had decided that it was already too late.
1180000	1184000	Because between Walmart, GameStop, Target, Best Buy,
1184000	1187000	there are a lot of places where you could try to hunt the sucker down.
1187000	1191000	But I think if I had that crazy notion at like 10 or 11 a.m.,
1191000	1192000	I would have gone for it.
1192000	1195000	But at 4 p.m., it was like, no, it's gone everywhere.
1195000	1198000	Yeah. No, and I understand. I understand.
1198000	1201000	Yeah, I mean, and so it's one of those things where it's like,
1201000	1204000	well, maybe if I come into one sitting on the shelf somewhere,
1204000	1205000	maybe I'll buy it.
1205000	1209000	But at the same time, I've spent enough money on gaming lately.
1209000	1212000	Final Fantasy XV is out next week, or sorry, two weeks.
1212000	1216000	I mean, Pokemon Sun and Moon is out this week.
1216000	1219000	I mean, there's so much other stuff that's happening in gaming.
1219000	1223000	I don't know if I'm going to pick up on that NES Classic thing right now.
1223000	1226000	Maybe next year. Who knows?
1226000	1229000	I'd be very curious to see if they do a Volume 2
1229000	1232000	or what that's going to look like in 2017.
1232000	1233000	But we'll see.
1233000	1236000	Anyway, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks
1236000	1239000	and what kind of video games have you been playing this week.
1239000	1242000	Dark Sakura, it's been a while since we've heard of one of your gaming weeks.
1242000	1243000	How was your gaming week?
1243000	1246000	Fuck.
1246000	1248000	A little bit of Dragon Age.
1248000	1251000	A little bit, actually a lot of WoW lately
1251000	1257000	because now I think I just hit 865, no, 856.
1257000	1258000	It was the other way around.
1259000	1262000	I honestly still don't know if that's good, but I could do Mythic, so whatever.
1265000	1267000	I was playing some Animal Crossing, actually.
1267000	1269000	Well, the Happy Home Designer.
1269000	1273000	Danganronpa 2 because I've been playing just a little bit at a time.
1273000	1278000	Have you gone back and checked out the major update to Animal Crossing 3DS
1278000	1280000	with the Amiibo support and the stuff?
1280000	1282000	Apparently there's like 20 pieces of furniture
1282000	1284000	if you've done Happy Home Designer or something like that.
1284000	1285000	Really?
1285000	1286000	Yeah, make sure you check that out. If you missed that.
1286000	1287000	I might have to move back into my village.
1287000	1290000	Oh yeah, get your game card out and download the update
1290000	1292000	because they did a huge, even I checked that out this past week.
1292000	1295000	Now there's RVs that show up and there's a whole new currency
1295000	1297000	you get for doing quests in Animal Crossing.
1297000	1301000	Yeah, it was like a whole shit change, Joe.
1301000	1306000	And they fucking cleaned up all your weeds.
1306000	1307000	I know.
1307000	1308000	Fuck.
1308000	1311000	Isabelle was like, I hired a guy and they're gone.
1313000	1315000	Isabelle, get shit done.
1315000	1316000	Isabelle for president.
1318000	1321000	I support that over plenty of other things.
1321000	1323000	Over the orange Cheeto.
1323000	1324000	Yes.
1324000	1325000	Sorry, Cheeto Hitler. Sorry.
1325000	1326000	Anyway.
1326000	1327000	Anyway.
1327000	1330000	God, I played other stuff too.
1330000	1332000	Oh yeah, Dan did an Extra Life marathon.
1332000	1335000	So guess what the fuck I played?
1335000	1337000	You guys were playing random shit.
1337000	1340000	You had your Twitch thing going.
1340000	1341000	I remember tuning in at one point.
1341000	1343000	You guys were playing Street Fighter Alpha 2
1343000	1346000	on the Game Boy Advance through the GameCube thing or something.
1346000	1348000	It was like random fucking shit you guys were playing.
1348000	1353000	Dan was going for weirdness and then I busted out the Guardian Legend.
1353000	1357000	And I hate to say I suck balls at it now.
1357000	1359000	It's hard.
1359000	1362000	Yeah, a lot of these games we were good at when we were kids.
1362000	1366000	We go back now and we're like, fuck, no wonder our parents sucked at these games.
1366000	1371000	I got through, it took me four tries to get into the game.
1371000	1373000	You know, you have that intro thing.
1373000	1375000	And finally I felt like my skills were coming back.
1375000	1378000	And then I kept dying on the first level and finally beat it
1378000	1381000	because I realized I forgot to go get the other weapons I needed.
1381000	1382000	Right.
1382000	1387000	And so, but it was just like, I bet if I sat and played and played,
1387000	1390000	but I found something actually that I had to use rubber grips
1390000	1395000	on the edge of the NES controller because of my wrist.
1395000	1402000	And so it was interesting, but we also played, what else did I play?
1402000	1406000	We actually had Fantasy Zone, the Tengen Fantasy Zone going on.
1406000	1409000	Nice.
1409000	1411000	No, we played other things though.
1411000	1414000	Oh yeah, Dan played through The Legend of Zelda.
1414000	1415000	Just straight played through it.
1415000	1416000	Nice. The original?
1416000	1417000	Yeah.
1417000	1418000	Awesome.
1418000	1420000	It only takes like, what, an hour?
1420000	1422000	Did you guys raise any money for that?
1422000	1424000	Yeah, what about 250?
1424000	1425000	Oh, that's still really good.
1425000	1426000	Yeah.
1426000	1428000	I don't remember you guys doing a lot of build up to that or anything.
1428000	1429000	Is this really good?
1429000	1431000	Well, Dan was just saying, oh, just get me this off.
1431000	1434000	I was like, well, do you even have a Twitch channel?
1434000	1435000	I'll just use yours.
1435000	1436000	That's fair.
1436000	1437000	Okay.
1437000	1442000	So, but yeah, the next thing I think investment list is.
1442000	1444000	We have an Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channel,
1444000	1450000	and I need to remember to go in and set that up so it auto hosts you, me, or Loki.
1450000	1451000	I don't know if Loki has a Twitch.
1451000	1452000	I think he does.
1452000	1454000	I think he did something one time on it.
1454000	1456000	I think he's like my stream from his PS4 or something.
1456000	1459000	But I need to set it up so it's like you, me, Loki,
1459000	1461000	if any of us are ever streaming, it's on there.
1461000	1464000	And then, you know, some friends of OLR too,
1464000	1468000	like Xtopher and Shane or something, you know, set up some of them.
1468000	1469000	We used that Elgato thing.
1469000	1471000	Yeah. Oh yeah. I have one of those. It worked great.
1471000	1473000	That Loki loaned us.
1473000	1476000	Oh, I have like one of the cards in the computer now. Yeah.
1476000	1480000	But it was like maybe a 20 second delay, but it wasn't terrible.
1480000	1484000	And I'm thinking, I've actually been thinking about getting myself
1484000	1489000	a condenser mic anyway for stuff that we might record on the go.
1489000	1490000	Yeah, you should.
1490000	1493000	I bet a lot of people would get a kick out of that if you did more
1493000	1494000	streaming.
1494000	1495000	Yeah, we'll see.
1495000	1496000	Because I mean, other than that,
1496000	1499000	it's just going to be me streaming while going fuck this shit.
1499000	1501000	Fuck that shit. Fuck you.
1501000	1509000	Oh, I am foul now, especially fouler on doing stupid.
1509000	1511000	I mean, heroics are easy as balls now,
1511000	1517000	but doing anything that relates to Ayah Vajra, I will cuss.
1517000	1523000	I will cut every bitch in that game in my head and I will not be nice
1523000	1525000	about it. I will cut them with syrup.
1525000	1528000	No, not even serrated because that would be too easy.
1528000	1533000	I would cut them with spoons with little plastic Dairy Queen spoons
1533000	1537000	and break every single one of them breaking into their faces because I
1537000	1541000	hate that dungeon so much.
1541000	1543000	Is that the one with the big worm in the middle?
1543000	1544000	Yes.
1544000	1545000	Oh, God, I hate that one.
1545000	1547000	You want to know what, though, is stupid about that worm?
1547000	1550000	It's easier in Mythic and Heroic than it is in Regular.
1550000	1553000	Interesting. I believe it. I believe it.
1553000	1558000	Regulars are really oddly balanced. Really oddly balanced.
1558000	1560000	Heroics are easy as balls. They're easier for me.
1560000	1561000	Yeah.
1561000	1564000	And what's funny is that I didn't even realize that there was a hole
1564000	1566000	when I skipped over until I started doing randoms.
1566000	1572000	And it was like the one where you fight like Helia on the ghost pirate ship.
1572000	1574000	I don't think I ever did that one.
1574000	1579000	I did a pug for it earlier today.
1579000	1582000	And I said something that everyone just goes,
1582000	1586000	Oh, my God, you're right. Like, if this is based off of Norse mythology,
1586000	1591000	why are they using pirate terminology instead of acting like fucking Vikings?
1591000	1594000	And that was my WoW revelation of the day.
1594000	1596000	It's Warcraft. You have to suspend disbelief.
1596000	1600000	Yeah, but it was still pretty just random epiphany.
1600000	1603000	They should be Vikings, not pirates.
1603000	1605000	Anything else for your gaming week?
1605000	1613000	Uh, oh, yeah, I got really, really bored and played through and beat Regency Solitaire.
1613000	1617000	That is very bored. You have to be really bored.
1617000	1618000	Solitaire?
1618000	1622000	It plays like the fairy solitaire, where it's kind of weird
1622000	1624000	and you have to just match the numbers instead.
1624000	1625000	Still, though.
1625000	1628000	But Regency Solitaire, I was like, she has got to marry what's-as-fuck.
1628000	1630000	And I even hate like...
1630000	1632000	You were playing it for the plot, really?
1632000	1634000	You were playing solitaire for the plot?
1634000	1635000	I was that bored.
1635000	1637000	But I mean, I was just like, oh, whatever.
1637000	1640000	And then I was like, you know what, this actually is kind of a decent story.
1640000	1644000	I mean, but I don't like like the Regency era, like, you know,
1644000	1647000	Pride and Prejudice, not Pride and Prejudice, what am I thinking?
1647000	1649000	Pride and Prejudice is zombies.
1649000	1654000	No, um, who was the writer? God, I can't think of her name now.
1654000	1655000	Jane Austen?
1655000	1657000	Jane Austen, yes. I was never a fan of Jane Austen.
1657000	1659000	I mean, good writer.
1659000	1661000	Oh, I'm a big fan of Clueless, but that's about it.
1661000	1668000	Yeah, but still, you know, it's not my era of classic literature.
1668000	1672000	All right, only you can take your gaming Wii to classic literature.
1672000	1676000	We're going to move on, if you're good to go.
1676000	1679000	I reckon. Oh, yeah, Miitomo update.
1679000	1682000	Eh, Miitomo update can kiss my butt.
1682000	1684000	It blows my phone up at seven in the morning now.
1684000	1686000	Well, you can turn off notifications.
1686000	1688000	I'm yanking its privileges, that's for sure.
1688000	1692000	But I like the sending messages and decorating my room.
1692000	1695000	So now I have my Cullen poster and my Geras poster,
1695000	1698000	and I have the European Guardian Legend poster,
1698000	1701000	and I also have, like, some Danganronpa.
1701000	1703000	I'll have to come over and visit.
1703000	1704000	Come visit.
1704000	1705000	And steal your posters.
1705000	1706000	No.
1706000	1707000	All right.
1707000	1708000	Okay, I'm good.
1708000	1710000	Alan, how about you? How was your gaming Wii?
1710000	1711000	What have you been playing?
1711000	1713000	I'll just rattle off, like, the last month or two.
1713000	1717000	I was playing Overwatch to death forever and ever, hundreds of hours.
1717000	1718000	Overwatch forever.
1718000	1720000	Was? Have you broken up with Overwatch?
1720000	1722000	I barely play around a day now.
1722000	1723000	Really?
1723000	1724000	If even.
1724000	1726000	Even with Sombra just coming out this week?
1726000	1729000	It's really hard to get her, because even in Quick Play now,
1729000	1732000	there's only one hero allowed per team, which I understand for balance,
1732000	1735000	that way people don't do stupid stuff like six Bastions or whatever.
1735000	1738000	Okay, although the time we had six Torbjorn's, that was hilarious.
1738000	1739000	I'm sorry.
1739000	1740000	Yeah.
1740000	1742000	But, yeah, I haven't really tried her yet,
1742000	1744000	and I was spinning my wheels in the...
1744000	1746000	Build them up, pick them down.
1746000	1749000	I was spinning my wheels in the mud with the season two ranking.
1749000	1753000	I was, I peaked at about 2,300, and then the last month or two,
1753000	1758000	I've been just floating between 1,900, then I'll go up to 2,000,
1758000	1760000	get six really bad games in a row,
1760000	1764000	fall back down to 1,900, go back to 2,000, 1,900.
1764000	1766000	So it's not fun.
1766000	1769000	I was playing the hell out of Dark Souls 2.
1769000	1773000	I did my anniversary run of Half-Life and Half-Life 2 in the episodes,
1773000	1776000	or rather Black Mesa, the remake.
1776000	1780000	And then Mortal Kombat X finally got acknowledged by Warner Brothers
1780000	1783000	or NetherRealm Studios for PC,
1783000	1787000	because they just didn't touch it for a year or a year and a half.
1788000	1791000	So they came out with a huge quality patch
1791000	1794000	and also the XL content with Alien and Predator and Leatherface,
1794000	1796000	so I played that.
1796000	1801000	Then that made me go play story mode again in MK9 with Freddy Krueger.
1801000	1807000	And now I'm back fully into Skyrim Special Edition.
1807000	1810000	I knew that was a rabbit hole waiting for you to fall into.
1810000	1811000	Yeah.
1811000	1816000	And a lot of the really complicated mods
1816000	1823000	depended on this third-party extender for the scripting program.
1823000	1825000	Because there's a whole programming language, obviously,
1825000	1829000	with the creation kit that you can write in to make mods.
1829000	1832000	Well, the extender that allows for much bigger scripts,
1832000	1835000	because it's a 64-bit program, that hasn't been made yet.
1835000	1838000	So a lot of the mods are really pared down
1838000	1840000	and gone back to their roots.
1840000	1845000	It's difficult for your save to get corrupted,
1845000	1847000	whereas before, if you uninstalled a mod
1847000	1850000	and it left tons of scripts in your save and you didn't clean it,
1850000	1853000	you might have lost that career,
1853000	1855000	unless you put the mod back, and so on.
1855000	1859000	So Special Edition is in this really neat Renaissance period
1859000	1863000	where all of these great mods are coming back,
1863000	1866000	but in a stripped-down version.
1866000	1869000	The game runs great. It looks incredible.
1869000	1872000	I put some really awesome screenshots on my Twitter today.
1872000	1873000	Yeah, it looks really good.
1873000	1875000	I'll look over my shoulder sometimes,
1875000	1877000	and it looks really pretty on your computer.
1877000	1880000	So I've got to get that installed on mine at some point.
1880000	1882000	Use your Steam login or something to figure that out.
1882000	1883000	That'd be nice.
1883000	1884000	But that's it.
1884000	1885000	All right. Awesome.
1885000	1886000	I won't take up too much time.
1886000	1887000	No, don't worry about it.
1887000	1890000	My gaming week, I've been playing, you know,
1890000	1892000	I hate to say it, but a lot of the same stuff.
1892000	1894000	Still trucking along in Final Fantasy XIV,
1894000	1897000	although, you know, a lot of that now is just basically
1897000	1900000	grinding my later gear and getting the tomes and everything
1900000	1903000	and trying to do the Wonder's Tales books every week,
1903000	1907000	even though the randomness of that could be really infuriating.
1907000	1911000	Otherwise, I've actually been playing a little bit of Overwatch,
1911000	1912000	just casually.
1912000	1916000	I'll play a match or two a night, and that's still fun.
1916000	1919000	I think I might finally break and get that on PlayStation 4
1919000	1921000	with some of the Black Friday deals,
1921000	1923000	just because I know so many people that play it on PlayStation 4.
1924000	1929000	And I honestly feel like console might be better balanced for me.
1929000	1932000	Yeah, I've heard that it plays almost completely different.
1932000	1935000	Yeah, well, they had the free weekend a few weeks ago.
1935000	1936000	Remember that?
1936000	1937000	And I played that.
1937000	1938000	Yeah, that just happened, I think.
1938000	1940000	Well, there's one coming up this weekend.
1940000	1941000	Okay, that's what I'm thinking of.
1941000	1943000	Except Pokemon's happening this weekend,
1943000	1945000	so, you know, there's a lot going on this weekend.
1945000	1948000	But I probably will try it again, Overwatch,
1948000	1951000	because I also got a PlayStation 4 Pro,
1951000	1954000	and Overwatch is one of the games that supports Pro.
1954000	1957000	Now, I don't have a 4K TV,
1957000	1961000	so I fully expect that I'm not going to get a ton of stuff out of the Pro.
1961000	1962000	Bring it to my house.
1962000	1963000	I might.
1963000	1967000	I also, I mean, it's a really tricky scenario,
1967000	1970000	because we just got this TV.
1970000	1972000	I was going to say, not to reveal our business,
1972000	1976000	but you paid a nice chunk of change for the great TV we have,
1976000	1977000	and then to find out,
1977000	1980000	oh, there are these three features that we don't have on this year-old TV.
1980000	1981000	That's cute.
1981000	1983000	Yeah, so that part kind of sucks, so I don't know.
1983000	1984000	We have to kind of decide,
1984000	1986000	because Alan and I don't really have a need for a second TV,
1986000	1989000	so I have to kind of figure out, like, do we just sell that TV
1989000	1991000	and try to, you know, cut our losses?
1991000	1992000	What do we do?
1992000	1995000	But for the meantime, I still, you know what?
1995000	1997000	There are some things with the Pro
1997000	1999000	that some games will run at 60 frames a second,
1999000	2002000	like Final Fantasy 15,
2002000	2004000	and, you know, obviously there's going to be some support
2004000	2005000	of Mass Effect and Andromeda,
2005000	2006000	so I still kind of want to get it.
2006000	2008000	I kind of looked at it as getting a video card,
2008000	2010000	because I'm selling my PlayStation 4,
2010000	2012000	so I'm recouping some of the cost back.
2012000	2014000	So it's like upgrading your video card.
2014000	2017000	That's kind of what I looked at it as in getting the Pro.
2017000	2020000	So, but anyway, I still want to check out Overwatch,
2020000	2022000	because I want to see, you know,
2022000	2024000	just how that feels on PlayStation 4, you know, with that,
2024000	2026000	although I anticipate it's not going to be that much different,
2026000	2029000	but I'm excited to, like, try Sombra,
2029000	2031000	although I have the same problem as you.
2031000	2034000	I don't really get to use her in any match, because everybody is.
2034000	2037000	So now the question is, who's a good counter for her?
2037000	2041000	And apparently I'm hearing it's Winston is the best counter for her.
2041000	2044000	So you're now seeing a lot of Winstons show up,
2044000	2047000	whereas I rarely would see that character ever pop in.
2047000	2048000	He's very hard to play.
2048000	2049000	He's very hard to play.
2049000	2051000	I like playing him better than a lot of the tanks,
2051000	2053000	but yeah, he's hard to play.
2053000	2056000	But I guess he can zap her while she's invisible,
2056000	2057000	and that goes a long way.
2057000	2058000	Yeah.
2058000	2064000	Did you see the Sombra, was it Sombra?
2064000	2065000	I don't play the game, but...
2065000	2066000	Cosplay?
2066000	2071000	No, no, no, no. Exploit for private matches,
2071000	2073000	where you turn off the cooldown.
2073000	2077000	She apparently has this, like, jump thing that knocks her into the air.
2077000	2078000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2078000	2082000	She can throw, like, she basically throws a teleporter,
2082000	2084000	and she can teleport to wherever it lands.
2084000	2085000	Exactly.
2085000	2088000	So people were using it to get, with no cooldown,
2088000	2091000	to get to the top of the map.
2091000	2092000	Oh, okay.
2092000	2095000	And then get, like, a free view of everything,
2095000	2097000	or try to free fall into certain locations.
2097000	2098000	Oh, that's clever.
2098000	2099000	There's videos of it.
2099000	2101000	Wouldn't you be able to do that with Pharah?
2101000	2102000	No, it was Widowmaker.
2102000	2105000	You take one of the basketballs that are in the starting area,
2105000	2107000	and you get someone to knock it up,
2107000	2109000	and then you use your grappling hook,
2109000	2111000	and you just keep going up, up, up off the basketball,
2111000	2113000	and you could break the map, or break yourself on the map.
2113000	2114000	I'm really surprised.
2114000	2116000	I would think with Pharah, if you can remove cooldowns,
2116000	2118000	you could do the same thing with her boost.
2118000	2120000	Well, she is limited by her fuel, though.
2120000	2122000	Oh, and you can't change that.
2122000	2123000	Oh, interesting. Okay.
2123000	2126000	I mean, I noticed in just looking at some of the maps there,
2126000	2131000	if you, you know, can find a place that, like, would work sort of as a ladder,
2131000	2133000	but, I mean, does fuel recharge on its own,
2133000	2134000	or do you have to find it for her?
2134000	2135000	For Pharah?
2135000	2136000	Uh-huh.
2136000	2137000	It's just on a cooldown.
2137000	2139000	Yeah, it's a meter that recharges.
2139000	2143000	So you do it, like, ladder style, where you pause on your ladder,
2143000	2145000	and then see how high you can go.
2145000	2150000	But, I mean, actually the levels look really nice if it wasn't still, you know, expensive.
2150000	2151000	Yeah.
2151000	2154000	And I've, I don't have time for that.
2154000	2157000	Look, well, Black Friday is my suggestion,
2157000	2161000	because I think some places are going to have that down to 35 bucks on Black Friday.
2161000	2162000	We'll see.
2162000	2163000	So that's a little more reasonable.
2163000	2167000	But I know you have the motion thing, and it's a first-person shooter.
2167000	2168000	Don't forget that.
2168000	2169000	So that could be a problem.
2169000	2170000	Yeah, we'll see.
2170000	2172000	I don't know, I did okay with portal.
2172000	2173000	That's true.
2173000	2174000	Watch streams.
2174000	2176000	Well, but then you're not in control in the streams.
2176000	2177000	Maybe that's different.
2177000	2178000	Maybe.
2178000	2179000	All right.
2179000	2180000	Okay.
2180000	2182000	So I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week,
2182000	2184000	and I'm kind of coming up short right now.
2184000	2185000	I haven't played a whole lot else.
2185000	2189000	I have one thing to add, only because I haven't been on the show in so long.
2189000	2193000	I do live under a rock in that I had never heard of No Man's Sky until it came out,
2193000	2195000	and everyone shit the bed.
2195000	2199000	So I got on PC just to see, because I, again, knew nothing about it.
2199000	2204000	I played the hell out of it for a good month, month and a half.
2204000	2208000	It was really meditative and chill.
2208000	2211000	A lot of it is because the planets were beautiful,
2211000	2214000	and it was just a good way to just decompress.
2214000	2217000	And then one day I just stopped playing it, and I haven't touched it since.
2217000	2220000	And they haven't done any updates to really bring people back,
2220000	2222000	like I thought they were going to do.
2222000	2223000	Occasionally.
2223000	2225000	I don't think one's come through in a couple weeks,
2225000	2227000	but even through all of the radio silence,
2227000	2232000	I would occasionally get a patch once a week or twice a week,
2232000	2237000	little one or two meg patches, consistently from the release through about six weeks,
2237000	2242000	or whatever, through start of September or start of October.
2242000	2245000	So they were patching it, which kind of lends itself to the,
2245000	2250000	we're not talking to anyone because we're busy fixing this broken game that we released.
2250000	2253000	But yeah, nothing as far as features that I know of.
2253000	2254000	Okay.
2254000	2256000	All right.
2256000	2261000	Yeah, I think being in a bubble and not letting yourself fall into the hype too much
2261000	2264000	ended up being a really, really good thing for that game.
2264000	2266000	Because I don't follow E3.
2267000	2269000	Like, if Half-Life 3 was announced to E3,
2269000	2272000	it would take a good hour or two for me to find out about it.
2272000	2274000	Until I'm screaming about it, right?
2274000	2276000	Yeah, I would see it on Twitter.
2276000	2277000	Yeah, right?
2277000	2279000	I just found something that makes me super happy.
2279000	2280000	What's that?
2280000	2283000	The Kung Fu Panda director is working on an adaptation of Bone.
2283000	2285000	Oh yeah, I'd heard that on Twitter or somewhere.
2285000	2286000	The graphic novel?
2286000	2287000	I love Bone.
2287000	2288000	That'd be cool.
2288000	2289000	All right.
2289000	2291000	Well, I may as well share some happy news, right?
2291000	2292000	Yeah, that's true.
2292000	2295000	All right, well, we're going to share some gaming news right now with you guys.
2295000	2297000	I don't have a lot to say for housekeeping.
2297000	2299000	Just remember to follow us on Twitter at OLR,
2299000	2302000	and we're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook,
2302000	2306000	Google Plus as well if you're still trucking along over there.
2306000	2310000	And again, we will be back Sunday on our normal schedule
2310000	2313000	at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
2313000	2317000	Our next hurdle now that we've cleared Rob's Chicago trip is
2317000	2319000	what are we going to do during the holidays?
2319000	2321000	Because did you know this, Dark Saga?
2321000	2326000	December 25th, January 1st, January 8th, all Sundays.
2326000	2329000	You want to know what else?
2329000	2334000	Christmas through New Year's is Hanukkah.
2334000	2336000	Oh, is it? Great.
2336000	2339000	So we have Chris-ma-kah-nah near year.
2339000	2340000	Yeah, all of it.
2340000	2342000	All of it's happening all at once, so I don't know.
2342000	2344000	We've been throwing around some ideas.
2344000	2345000	What do you think, Dark Sakura?
2345000	2347000	Do you think, I know since, you know,
2347000	2349000	well, if December 25th is the first night of Hanukkah, though,
2349000	2351000	that might not be, that might not work out so well.
2351000	2353000	Because I was going to say, YOLO, I mean,
2353000	2355000	I know Loki won't be here, but he wouldn't mind
2355000	2357000	if we did a show with Adam on Christmas Day.
2357000	2359000	I would certainly not mind.
2359000	2361000	I don't think that we do much with the family.
2361000	2364000	Oh, wait, wait. No, I actually, I would be off.
2364000	2365000	Yeah, so.
2365000	2367000	Because work is usually open on Christmas Day.
2367000	2368000	We, but we, and we usually do a thing,
2368000	2370000	but we would probably be done in time.
2370000	2372000	So figure something out.
2372000	2373000	So.
2373000	2375000	I mean, unless they call me into work.
2375000	2376000	Yeah.
2376000	2377000	Then.
2377000	2378000	Don't quote us on that,
2378000	2380000	because the reality is there's the 25th, the 1st,
2380000	2382000	and then January 8th.
2382000	2383000	Guess what?
2383000	2385000	I'm at MAGFest in Washington, D.C.
2385000	2386000	Woohoo!
2386000	2387000	So I won't be here.
2387000	2388000	But guess what?
2388000	2389000	You know what?
2389000	2390000	We shouldn't do a Christmas show.
2390000	2391000	We should do a first day of Hanukkah show.
2391000	2392000	A first day of Hanukkah show?
2392000	2393000	A first day of Hanukkah show.
2393000	2395000	What about just a holiday show?
2395000	2397000	No, Christmas gets way too much,
2397000	2398000	and we need to reclaim some.
2398000	2399000	You know what?
2399000	2400000	Festivus for the rest of us.
2400000	2401000	No.
2401000	2403000	No, it's the, it's Orange Lounge Radio Day.
2403000	2405000	That's what we're going to be celebrating.
2405000	2406000	A holiday for us.
2406000	2407000	Why?
2407000	2408000	Because it's us.
2408000	2409000	Right?
2409000	2410000	Yes.
2410000	2411000	Alright.
2411000	2412000	Anyway.
2412000	2414000	I'm still, I actually, I found two shirts.
2414000	2416000	I'm trying to decide which one I want.
2416000	2419000	One of them says Happy Holidays.
2419000	2421000	It has a piece of bread on it.
2421000	2423000	And the other one says Happy Hanukat.
2423000	2424000	I like that.
2424000	2425000	So, I don't know.
2425000	2428000	Don't you think December 25th should be Orange Lounge Radio Day?
2428000	2429000	It's Decemberween.
2429000	2431000	It's Decemberween.
2431000	2432000	Alright.
2432000	2433000	I guess some folks would argue,
2433000	2435000	no, that should be 20 November because of your roots,
2435000	2436000	but I don't know.
2436000	2437000	I'm coming.
2437000	2439000	I'm coming for Christmas.
2439000	2442000	Well, it's coming for you.
2442000	2443000	Alright.
2443000	2445000	Screaming.
2445000	2448000	You think the deviants have killed Christmas.
2448000	2449000	You ain't seen nothing yet.
2449000	2450000	Alright.
2450000	2453000	Anyway, let's get into some actual gaming news that has happened.
2453000	2455000	While we've been gone, Allen,
2455000	2457000	you have something to start us off with tonight.
2457000	2458000	Yes.
2458000	2460000	In Grand Theft Auto Online,
2460000	2463000	they released a new adversary mode called Deadline,
2463000	2468000	and in Deadline, you can use the Tron bicycle.
2468000	2469000	Like, it's...
2469000	2473000	I don't know how they did this because Disney...
2473000	2476000	Grand Theft Auto is not really a property Disney would license to,
2476000	2478000	but maybe it's the guy who...
2478000	2481000	Because it's not actually a Tron bike, right?
2481000	2484000	It's just something that looks like a Tron bike.
2484000	2485000	Wink, wink, nudge.
2485000	2486000	It's like, yeah, I was going to say,
2486000	2489000	maybe they changed the handlebars and, like, said,
2489000	2491000	okay, it's not copyright because we changed this one thing about it,
2491000	2492000	but it's...
2492000	2495000	It's when they do those pornos and they'll say, like,
2495000	2498000	a blank parody type of thing, you know?
2498000	2500000	Like, I don't know, what are...
2500000	2501000	I don't even know it's important.
2501000	2503000	Like, the slut of the rings or something.
2503000	2505000	It'll be a Lord of the Rings parody.
2505000	2506000	Wink, wink, nudge.
2506000	2507000	That type of thing.
2507000	2508000	Yeah.
2508000	2509000	So these things...
2509000	2510000	Or the Lord of the cock ring.
2510000	2515000	These things are 90% identical to a Tron.
2515000	2517000	I think, oh, you're sitting more upright.
2517000	2519000	You're not completely like...
2519000	2520000	Because, you know, on the Tron bikes,
2520000	2521000	they're completely like Superman.
2521000	2522000	It's semi-recumbent.
2522000	2523000	Yes.
2523000	2524000	Yes.
2524000	2525000	That was me.
2525000	2527000	And I just started an ad on my phone.
2527000	2528000	Oh.
2528000	2529000	Good job.
2529000	2530000	I'm sorry.
2530000	2533000	So if you order it now, there's a limited offer.
2533000	2534000	This came out a week ago, though,
2534000	2536000	so I don't know if it's still valid.
2536000	2539000	Oh, through November 21st, there's still time.
2539000	2543000	You can get a Nagasaki logo t-shirt for your in-game avatar.
2543000	2544000	That's cool.
2544000	2547000	And the mode of...
2547000	2550000	You leave a trail of light behind you that stays there,
2550000	2552000	and it's basically the last man standing.
2552000	2555000	You try to cut people off and get them to slam into your wall.
2555000	2558000	You know, Loki sent me a tweet the day this was announced and said,
2558000	2561000	this is how I'm going to get you to finally play that fucking game.
2561000	2562000	And I'm like, you're probably right.
2562000	2564000	But it's GTA Online, not 5.
2564000	2566000	I'd still check it out.
2566000	2568000	You don't have to play a monthly fee for online, right?
2568000	2569000	No, I know.
2569000	2571000	But I thought the game that he was desperate to get you to play was...
2571000	2573000	Honestly, Grand Theft Auto 4.
2573000	2574000	Any of it.
2574000	2575000	Which I've played and beaten.
2575000	2579000	It's a really downer game.
2579000	2580000	But yeah.
2580000	2582000	I think as far as Loki's concerned, any of it, to be honest.
2582000	2583000	Yeah.
2583000	2584000	Probably make him happy.
2584000	2585000	All right.
2585000	2587000	We'll ask him when he gets back.
2587000	2588000	What else happened this week, Darzagra?
2588000	2590000	I have some big news for you, right?
2590000	2594000	Oh, so many Mass Effect Andromeda things.
2594000	2598000	They introduced the crew, which I'm waiting for one to be called peanut butter.
2598000	2600000	Or jelly, sorry.
2600000	2601000	So they have peanut butter jelly time?
2601000	2604000	They have PB, who's somebody.
2604000	2605000	But it's...
2605000	2606000	Sorry, right?
2606000	2607000	Yeah.
2607000	2610000	Who is supposed to be just kind of a bit of a badass.
2610000	2615000	But it's supposed to take place between Mass Effect 2 and 3.
2615000	2618000	Well, at least the beginning of the story does.
2618000	2622000	And the writers are siblings and everything.
2622000	2623000	It's just...
2623000	2624000	That was cool.
2624000	2626000	But I'm trying to find the last thing.
2626000	2630000	Other than that, the only thing that I know is that there's a new race.
2630000	2635000	Who look vaguely Prothean anyway, because just about everything that they create
2635000	2638000	kind of has that same head.
2638000	2640000	The big, poofy head in the back.
2640000	2649000	It's supposed to be a more, I guess, robust morality system in there.
2649000	2657000	Where you have different types of responses based on heart head, professional or casual.
2657000	2664000	And so it's supposed to lead to more interesting directions with how people judge you in game.
2665000	2670000	Also, it's supposed to be a more nuanced romance system, things like that.
2670000	2672000	And multiplayer.
2672000	2674000	Yeah, I'm excited they confirmed multiplayer.
2674000	2677000	Although it sounds like they're really gonna cash in on multiplayer.
2677000	2679000	Like they did last time?
2679000	2681000	Like that super deluxe edition.
2681000	2684000	Well, speaking of multiplayer, I still need to go back and check this out.
2684000	2689000	But on N7 Day, they made Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 backwards compatible on Xbox One, finally.
2689000	2690000	They did that.
2690000	2691000	Which is exciting.
2691000	2695000	So I want to go back and play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer on Xbox One.
2695000	2696000	I think that would be super fun.
2696000	2699000	But when I went to go do that, my Xbox was like,
2699000	2701000	you have a seven gig update to download.
2701000	2706000	And I was like, God, can't you download overnight when I'm sleeping?
2706000	2710000	That's what the Wii U does. Let the Wii U have its own gimmick.
2710000	2714000	The Sony does that too, but that's a PlayStation Plus gimmick.
2714000	2715000	It had the update anyway.
2715000	2720000	Well, also thanks to a couple of leaks, one of them being from Best Buy,
2720000	2728000	that they have a dynamic cover system where if you say that you're hiding behind a rock,
2728000	2731000	the rock that you're behind could get destroyed.
2731000	2735000	So lots of blowing up things and particles and stuffs.
2735000	2737000	Oh wow, okay. That's gonna be different.
2737000	2743000	And that it's actually, in fact, a very similar comparison has been The Last of Us.
2743000	2746000	And then we have a jet pack. We finally have a jet pack.
2746000	2750000	And they'll be using them to go to places they shouldn't
2750000	2753000	because somebody will mod it so that jet pack has unlimited fuel.
2753000	2754000	Right?
2754000	2757000	That's the first thing Dar Sager is going to be looking into.
2757000	2759000	How can I fly around and see everything?
2759000	2762000	Well, you know I do that shit anyway. It's so much fun.
2762000	2766000	You know what struck me as interesting about the whole story in the setup?
2766000	2767000	You kind of mentioned it really quick,
2767000	2769000	but I think it's something that's really interesting to me
2769000	2772000	is that you have the rider or the brother and sister, right?
2772000	2773000	You have a brother and sister.
2773000	2776000	Whereas in the original Mass Effect trilogy,
2776000	2780000	there was a very distinct male shepherd or female shepherd.
2780000	2782000	They were the same person.
2782000	2785000	Yes, they were, but it's like, but now in this one,
2785000	2790000	my point is, if you were male or female, you had that representation.
2790000	2792000	The other sibling is also out in the...
2792000	2793000	Exactly. And that was it.
2793000	2797000	There was no other half or whatever.
2797000	2800000	But in this game, if you're going to go with male rider,
2800000	2803000	you're not eliminating female rider.
2803000	2805000	She will still be there and a part of the story,
2805000	2807000	as well as vice versa, obviously.
2807000	2809000	So that's very interesting to me.
2809000	2811000	I reckon if that's kind of like, well, I mean,
2811000	2813000	while it wasn't throughout the whole game,
2813000	2818000	at the start of Fallout 4, you had both characters together.
2818000	2822000	You know, I sat and designed both of them because that's what I do.
2822000	2826000	Of course, you know, spoilers, one of them dies still.
2826000	2829000	Yeah, you can spend hours in the character creator,
2829000	2831000	especially if you have mods designing your spouse,
2831000	2833000	whether it be the husband or the wife, and be like,
2833000	2835000	I have my hot couple. This is me.
2835000	2837000	The other one is who I'm married to.
2837000	2839000	And then they're like, they're dead.
2839000	2842000	We're going to steal your baby.
2842000	2843000	All right.
2843000	2845000	Have fun being frozen.
2845000	2848000	All right. So I'm super looking forward to Mass Effect.
2848000	2852000	More gameplay. They said, when are the game awards?
2852000	2854000	They're soon, right? They're probably like in a couple of weeks.
2854000	2856000	So that's when we actually get gameplay.
2856000	2858000	I'm excited to see gameplay.
2858000	2860000	I'm sure Dark Soccer is excited to see gameplay.
2860000	2863000	I want to see the interface because they've been very good at hiding that.
2863000	2865000	They have not shown the interface at all,
2865000	2867000	so I'm very curious what that's going to look like.
2867000	2870000	So many questions will be answered soon.
2870000	2872000	One question I'd like to have the answer to is
2872000	2877000	when are Generation 2 Pokémon going to show up in Pokémon GO
2877000	2880000	to try to lure people back to the game?
2880000	2884000	Well, apparently, it may be a little sooner rather than later.
2884000	2887000	A new update to Pokémon GO, which showed up on Android devices,
2887000	2889000	and I think iPhone's got this too eventually,
2889000	2891000	was version .45.
2891000	2896000	And inside the APK, which is basically the package file
2896000	2899000	that goes on the phone that the game comes out of,
2899000	2904000	there were actually new Pokémon, the 100 new Pokémon
2904000	2907000	from 152 through 251.
2907000	2912000	That's Chikorita through Celebi are now actually in the game data.
2912000	2914000	I don't think that means graphics.
2914000	2916000	That just means in the game data.
2916000	2919000	But I do think graphics of Ditto showed up.
2919000	2923000	So that's telling me that Ditto will probably be the first Pokémon
2923000	2925000	that they either do as an event,
2925000	2927000	because now Pokémon GO has been doing more events recently.
2927000	2929000	They did a Halloween event.
2929000	2931000	They did an increased drop thing recently.
2931000	2933000	So they may do the event in-game,
2933000	2935000	but Ingress has an event right now,
2935000	2938000	so maybe Pokémon GO is sitting out while the Ingress is doing the double AP,
2938000	2940000	which is going on right now.
2940000	2943000	Or if it's going to be a live event.
2943000	2947000	We still fully know Niantic plans to do Pokémon GO live events.
2947000	2950000	Whether they're staffed to handle it, I don't know.
2950000	2952000	But we'll see.
2952000	2955000	So that could be something that that comes from.
2955000	2958000	I'm not sure if they can follow the Ingress model,
2958000	2960000	because imagine if kids, there's an event,
2960000	2962000	and it's like an hour's drive away.
2962000	2964000	Let's say they do...
2964000	2967000	Because the Ingress, it's like three or four cities in the whole country.
2967000	2970000	So let's say they do several cities per state.
2970000	2973000	You're going to have kids that parents can't take them to
2973000	2976000	for whatever this is, where you have to be there
2976000	2978000	if they follow the Ingress model,
2978000	2980000	and the kids will have a total meltdown.
2980000	2984000	Ingress does have a van that they take around the country.
2984000	2986000	Didn't we go to one? I don't remember if you went.
2986000	2988000	I have not been, but you've been once or twice.
2988000	2990000	Yeah, I went. Okay, so you didn't go that night.
2990000	2993000	But they have a van tour thing that goes around,
2993000	2995000	and maybe that's how they do it,
2995000	2997000	is they have to literally take the Pokémon on tour.
2997000	3000000	And they're only going to be able to do this at very large parks.
3000000	3004000	You can't play in the middle of downtown like you do Ingress
3004000	3006000	with kids and people on the street and stuff.
3006000	3010000	It's going to be big parks, like Chicago as an example.
3010000	3012000	It will have to be Millennium Park or something,
3012000	3015000	like a huge park where they can do this.
3015000	3018000	That's really the only place that's going to be set up for that.
3018000	3021000	I'm very curious to see how the live events turn out.
3021000	3023000	But anyway, we'll talk about this
3023000	3026000	whenever we're able to do a new Pokéstop podcast.
3026000	3028000	But with Sun and Moon coming out this weekend,
3028000	3030000	Shane's basically said, don't call me.
3030000	3033000	We'll see. We'll see what we get around to doing that.
3033000	3035000	Shane was talking about his Pokévacation.
3035000	3037000	Yeah, he's taking six days off to play Pokémon.
3037000	3039000	Yeah.
3039000	3041000	Is he getting four copies of the game,
3041000	3043000	two in English and two in Japanese?
3043000	3045000	Last I heard, yes, that was his plan.
3045000	3047000	Oh, I was kidding.
3047000	3049000	No, he is...
3049000	3051000	I knew he was getting an English and Japanese.
3051000	3054000	He's getting two of them digital and two of them physical.
3054000	3056000	Gotcha.
3056000	3058000	He said he may cut it back to three,
3058000	3061000	but there's some type of double dual edition thing or something he wants.
3061000	3063000	I don't know.
3063000	3065000	I'm getting one copy of the game. One.
3065000	3068000	And you know what? If there's Pokémon in the other game that I don't have,
3068000	3070000	you know what I'll do to get them? I'll trade for them.
3070000	3073000	That's what you did in Pokémon back in the day.
3073000	3075000	Or I'll just say, Shane, you have 5,000 Pokémon.
3075000	3078000	Shane can't trade like that, though, because he doesn't have any friends.
3078000	3081000	Stop. He's not here to defend himself. Be nice.
3081000	3082000	All right.
3083000	3088000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
3088000	3090000	use the passphrase, train.
3090000	3095000	Let's travel back in time to a time when you didn't buy four copies of a game
3095000	3100000	because you were probably begging somebody for money to buy the game.
3100000	3103000	Or you were mowing the lawn or gardening or something.
3103000	3106000	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3106000	3108000	Or stealing from a convenience store.
3108000	3110000	And Dark Soccer is here.
3110000	3113000	She's back with no radio magic. She's here to...
3113000	3115000	We've had to fill in a few weeks without you.
3115000	3117000	Because I was, like, dead.
3117000	3119000	Well, I hope the picks were worthy.
3119000	3123000	I picked it because it's unique, and then I found out it's not as unique as I thought it was,
3123000	3128000	but for a while it was exclusive to a system that people hardly remember existed.
3128000	3133000	Well, it must be because I heard it's the 15th anniversary of Halo this week,
3133000	3137000	so you finally did it. You finally picked Halo for the classic game of the week, right?
3137000	3139000	I'm going home.
3139000	3142000	No, you're not. You're here forever.
3142000	3143000	Bitch.
3143000	3145000	What is the classic game of the week?
3145000	3147000	Al Khazar, the Forgotten Fortress.
3147000	3150000	And this game has very little audio.
3150000	3152000	It bleeps and bloops.
3152000	3156000	I will still leave it up in the background so you can hear some bleeps and bloops,
3156000	3159000	but there's not a lot.
3159000	3161000	Besides Dark Soccer and meowing.
3161000	3164000	Just like the piercing internal speaker on an old IBM computer.
3164000	3166000	Pretty much.
3166000	3168000	Oh, here you go.
3168000	3170000	There you go. There's some music.
3172000	3175000	I had Chipotle earlier. I'm sorry.
3175000	3179000	An abrupt record scratch right there that you would hear on an old Atari system.
3179000	3180000	Anyway, Al Khazar.
3180000	3182000	It's an action-adventure game.
3182000	3186000	It actually very much resembles Legend of Zelda and Dungeon Master,
3186000	3191000	and it came out in 1985 for the Coleco Adam,
3191000	3196000	which was also the first computer that I ever owned for the record was Coleco Adam,
3196000	3199000	which kind of sucked, but hey.
3199000	3208000	It was downgraded later on for a Coleco Vision only version that came out later.
3208000	3211000	So for the longest time, it was only on Coleco systems,
3211000	3214000	specifically the good version being the Coleco Adam.
3214000	3220000	And it was done by, not specifically by Activision,
3220000	3222000	but by one of their designers.
3222000	3227000	I just realized for the record, this clip I'm using is the Coleco Vision version.
3227000	3230000	Sorry about that. That's probably why the bleeps and bloops are more bleepy and bloopy.
3230000	3232000	Yeah.
3232000	3236000	But, Rob, you will be happy to know it was ported to the Commodore 64.
3236000	3238000	Well, thank God.
3238000	3240000	Yeah.
3240000	3245000	Anyway, the goal is to get to the main castle, Al Khazar,
3245000	3249000	by going through different castles, enemy castles,
3249000	3251000	until you can retrieve the stolen crown.
3251000	3253000	So you start off on a world map.
3253000	3257000	Okay, this is an important question, because this is something I'm noticing about this game.
3257000	3260000	This is important, because it's very Dungeons and Dragon-esque, right?
3260000	3264000	There's torches, and it's a dungeon, and you've got castles.
3264000	3267000	But the weapon he's using is a gun.
3267000	3269000	It could be a wand.
3269000	3273000	No, it's a gun. It looks like a fucking gun, like the graphic and everything.
3273000	3275000	It's a gun with bullets.
3275000	3279000	So it's like, we're going back to medieval times, or I'm going to get medieval on your end.
3280000	3282000	They have guns in Warcraft.
3282000	3285000	I guess, no, but this doesn't look like-
3285000	3287000	I call it a boomstick!
3287000	3289000	No, this is like a fucking, like, gun.
3289000	3291000	Okay.
3291000	3293000	Can I finish?
3293000	3295000	Gun.
3295000	3298000	Actually, Gun was the last song I was listening to in my car.
3298000	3300000	Churches.
3300000	3302000	Tim Gunn, make it work.
3304000	3306000	That's Peter Gunn.
3306000	3308000	Anyway.
3309000	3313000	Anyway, you have a world map, and it's got 22 castles on it.
3313000	3319000	And your goal is to move through each of the castles until you get to the main fortress on the right-hand side of the map.
3319000	3322000	Each castle has different rooms, it has traps, it has floors.
3322000	3326000	The maps change every time a new game is started.
3326000	3330000	And you've got different difficulty levels, like beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert.
3330000	3336000	You also have different items that you can get, such as a pistol, gun, rob.
3336000	3338000	You can also get a grappling hook.
3338000	3342000	And you have a little map to help you, you know, remember where you are.
3342000	3345000	You do have traps, you have enemies.
3345000	3349000	You know, if you get too much damage, you lose a life and you die.
3349000	3352000	There are no continues in the game.
3352000	3356000	The only way that you can save is on the Coleco Adam version.
3356000	3362000	And good luck at that, because the Coleco Adam was notorious for erasing shit.
3362000	3364000	Just sayin'.
3365000	3368000	Okay, pause. Rant time.
3368000	3371000	The Coleco Adam ran-
3371000	3373000	I'm literally pausing the bleeps and bloops for this.
3373000	3379000	It's power through the printer that connected to the tape deck.
3379000	3381000	Yes, it used cassettes.
3381000	3387000	And if you had a power surge, like hello me living in Alabama, it would power surge through your cassettes.
3387000	3389000	And you know what happened? Erase.
3389000	3392000	It burned the cassettes, or magnetized, yeah.
3392000	3394000	Yeah, demagnetize them.
3394000	3402000	So, I found, like, packs of the Commodore 6- not Commodore 64, what am I saying- the Coleco Adam cassettes.
3402000	3409000	And in the box and everything, it's like, I don't know if I can sell these, because I don't know if they're demagnetized or not.
3409000	3412000	So I put them on eBay, I said, good luck, bitches.
3412000	3414000	Anyway.
3414000	3418000	The game is also one of the earliest adventure games to have a demo mode.
3418000	3423000	So it actually gives you a demo, you wait for the title screen for about 30 seconds, it goes into demo mode.
3423000	3430000	And believe it or not, there is an earlier version of this that was initially created for the Apple II.
3430000	3440000	For all of its various versions, apart from the Apple II version, Coleco Adam, Coleco Vision, and Commodore 64, it also was ported to the MSX.
3440000	3442000	And that's it.
3442000	3444000	Alright.
3444000	3446000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
3446000	3448000	Alcazar. Algazam.
3448000	3450000	Alcazar, The Forgotten Fortress.
3450000	3454000	It's very Zelda-y.
3454000	3458000	I would almost say, like, oh, I wonder if Zelda was inspired by this, but no, the years don't work out.
3458000	3460000	I mean, they probably came out nearly at the same time.
3460000	3464000	So, in fact, maybe Zelda was even a year or two earlier.
3464000	3466000	But yeah, still really cool looking.
3466000	3468000	Yep.
3468000	3470000	Alright, good choice for the classic game of the week.
3470000	3472000	Let's get back right into it.
3472000	3474000	We're not going to do a break tonight, we're running right through.
3474000	3478000	It's going to be a shorter show since it's something we're taping mid-week.
3478000	3480000	But let's get into a few more news items.
3480000	3482000	Alan, what else do you have for us tonight?
3482000	3484000	I'll try to make this quick.
3484000	3494000	Final Fantasy XV, when it is released in a couple weeks, is supposed to run allegedly between 40 to 50 frames per second, depending on what's going on.
3494000	3507000	It's been announced via Active Time Report that in December, for the PlayStation 4 Pro, they're going to drop a patch that should take the whole game up to 60 FPS sustained.
3507000	3517000	And 60 FPS, of course, is the magic number for, I guess, the true gaming experience for hardware people that fap over graphics or whatever.
3517000	3524000	Well, 60 frames per second, too, isn't that when the picture starts getting that fake look almost? Like it's too real?
3524000	3525000	Yeah.
3525000	3529000	That whole type of thing? So that's going to be great.
3529000	3531000	So that is happening in December.
3531000	3536000	And then, let's see, is there a date for when this is coming out?
3536000	3546000	Anyway, Square Enix has partnered with Machine Zone for a Final Fantasy XV franchise mobile MMO.
3546000	3555000	Machine Zone, or MZ as they go by now, are the makers of Fire Age Game of War and Mobile Strike.
3555000	3562000	We actually did a story on Fire Age Game of War that I think I reported on when I guested.
3562000	3569000	After they did the Kate Upton model campaign when she was in their commercials, they also had Mariah Carey money.
3569000	3571000	Oh god, yeah, that was them?
3571000	3578000	Yeah, so they'd be like, Mariah Carey, do you want a cape for a video game? Fuck no, here's how much money we'll pay you. Okay.
3578000	3585000	That game after the Kate Upton campaign was making a million dollars a day in microtransactions.
3585000	3591000	So it's them. So they know what they're doing. Typically, Squeenix is used...
3591000	3595000	So now there's only one degree of separation between Mariah Carey and the Final Fantasy franchise.
3595000	3599000	And she didn't even have to sing the song at the end of the game to do it.
3600000	3604000	Who's the one that did Record Keeper and the other one that are supposedly really good?
3604000	3609000	DNA? That's who Nintendo's partnering with for things like Super Mario Run and whatever else they've got up their sleeve.
3609000	3615000	Yeah, so they're not going with them. They're old standard. They are doing it with Machine Zone.
3615000	3625000	And yeah, Mobile Strike and Age of War or whatever are consistently top five games.
3625000	3631000	And they've gone to the top five or top three and stayed there on both the Apple and Google online mobile stores.
3631000	3636000	And the spokesperson for Mobile Strike is Arnold Schwarzenegger, if you've seen those commercials.
3636000	3637000	Oh yes, I have.
3637000	3642000	So those games are all the same company and they're going to be making the 15 equivalent mobile game.
3642000	3646000	I wonder what celebrity they'll get for those commercials for this game.
3646000	3653000	And as far as when it's going to come out, I'm not sure if there's a date. Just Google it.
3653000	3655000	I'm thinking David Hasselhoff.
3655000	3657000	Oh God.
3657000	3663000	I don't know. I'm trying to think. Who's a celebrity that's kind of like way past their time in the spotlight?
3663000	3671000	They'll get the Backstreet Boys and just put gel in their hair because practically the crew that you play in 15 is a boy band anyway.
3671000	3678000	So just get like NSYNC minus Justin Timberlake and put them in a black convertible on a green screen and be like,
3678000	3682000	Kirkpatrick, take out your Android.
3682000	3687000	No, didn't you see they're going on tour because it's coming to the new arena thingy we have here.
3687000	3692000	It's the Backstreet Boys, whatever, boys to men. Cool. Right.
3692000	3696000	But then do you know who they just added to that tour? Paula Abdul.
3696000	3700000	And like the 12 year old little gay and me was like.
3700000	3709000	Because it's it's all fun and games when you're in your 20s and you see those monsters of rock like State Fair of like foreigner and.
3709000	3711000	Or when you're me and you see the Spice Girls.
3711000	3715000	Or or like Journey and or whatever, like some Led Zeppelin cover band.
3715000	3722000	But now the ones that are coming up is like I think they had like a triple header of Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson and like Garbage.
3722000	3727000	And it was like 90s goth like festival. And I'm like, that sounds so fucking good.
3727000	3736000	And it's like, how old am I that we have these three bands that are teaming up to play, you know, the vacant lot behind Shakey's.
3736000	3743000	My mother messaged me and said, New Kids on the Block are touring.
3743000	3750000	The same woman who bought me my sheets. Who is your favorite of the new kids?
3750000	3758000	Back then, honestly, it was Joey. The gay one, right? Was Joey? No, that was John.
3758000	3762000	Jonathan Knight. Oh, I can. He just seemed the one I'd want to hang out with.
3762000	3768000	I see. But I thought that Joey was kind of cute. Jonathan Knight had that nasty song, too, and he had his comeback.
3768000	3773000	All right. Anyway, so the mobile. Oh, yes. Final Fantasy 15 mobile game. Yes.
3773000	3780000	Well, I was just the only thing I was going to comment is that, you know, that's that sounds really exciting and will be a cool little like thing for this for the series.
3780000	3785000	But it's like, my God, there's Final Fantasy 15 spinoffs everywhere.
3785000	3791000	It seems like it's everywhere like that. And that's not the first mobile game for Final Fantasy 15.
3791000	3799000	I already have one on my phone that's like a pinball type game that they put out for 15. Brave Exvius, which I think is their latest release.
3799000	3808000	Damn it. This article had what rank it is. It's currently number 46, which I imagine is not very good for a new game.
3808000	3819000	I imagine Record Keeper has kept its momentum better than Brave has. So they could use MZ support on that.
3819000	3825000	Well, I just, you know, it's very interesting how much they are saturating with Final Fantasy 15.
3825000	3831000	They really want to make sure they get their money back on this game. But this could be a make or break game for the franchise, I guess.
3831000	3841000	Well, I'd rather have them do freemium games, as awful as that sounds, than have them charge $20 for a Final Fantasy 5 ROM for like the 10th time.
3841000	3847000	Oh, yeah. Or that horrible, but I didn't like the Final Fantasy 5 remake on the phones. I didn't like that at all.
3847000	3853000	Yeah. Well, I think they realized, oh, these won't sell because they're bad and they charge too much money for them.
3853000	3858000	Yes. Good. Good. All right. Anyhow, Dark Sakura, we got one more from you, right?
3858000	3870000	Yeah, you do. Well, two of my favorite franchises. Well, the producers of one of them wants to marry it to another one.
3870000	3884000	The producer of the Tekken, let's say the more recent Tekken series, Harada Katsuhiro and the designer Michael Murray,
3884000	3890000	were asked before about what their favorite fighting game franchises were, and one of them mentioned was Samurai Showdown.
3890000	3897000	And it came up again very recently at the King of Iron Fist 2016 North American Tekken 7 finals.
3897000	3904000	And asked again, the quote from Harada was more than still talk of the possibility of a collaboration.
3904000	3910000	We would like to buy the rights and make ourselves a new Samurai Showdown title and put the franchise back on the map through our vision.
3910000	3913000	It's a distant dream, but a dream.
3913000	3917000	Yeah. How long has it been since the Samurai Showdown game?
3917000	3926000	Samurai Showdown 5 was the last official one. And I think it was also, if I, I may be wrong, but I think it was also the last official Neo Geo cartridge release.
3926000	3931000	Interesting. Well, that'd be cool. I think that would be a franchise that would be fun to have come back.
3931000	3932000	Yeah.
3932000	3937000	Yeah. I'd be into that. Well, one more story for this little special show this week.
3937000	3944000	And that has to do with another kind of retro franchise, Super Mario Brothers, specifically number three.
3944000	3950000	Apparently there was an interview that happened on the Japanese Nintendo website with Takashi Takusa,
3950000	3959000	who actually talked about that Super Mario Brothers 3 originally was going to have an overhead perspective rather than a horizontal one,
3959000	3965000	which is kind of the more, the style we're used to. But can you imagine if Super Mario Brothers 3 had been an overhead game?
3965000	3969000	That would have been kind of like, like a Zelda type game. That kind of, that would have been very interesting.
3969000	3976000	But apparently the plan actually would work. So in this interview, not only is Tezuka there, but Miyamoto is there too.
3976000	3982000	And as part of this, Miyamoto said, he said, I want the game to be viewed from a little bit above,
3982000	3988000	but having a clear indication of where you're going to land after jumping was a key part of the original Super Mario.
3988000	3993000	Viewing everything from above made it very difficult to tell how far you were from the ground.
3993000	3999000	So I told Mr. Tezuka, this will take forever. And Tezuka does a laugh in response and said,
3999000	4007000	in fact, there are still remnants of the top down view in the final game from before we switch to the horizontal view.
4007000	4014000	And the interviewer calls out the black and white checkered floor and they admit that, yes, that is one of the relics of the overhead view.
4014000	4021000	And my thought was the overhead map probably came from that too a little bit, but that's just my, you know, thought.
4021000	4027000	Nothing concrete on that. But it is interesting that all these years later we did get, like, Super Mario 3D World,
4027000	4033000	which is an overhead per se, but it definitely, you know, is a little more like tilted up.
4033000	4037000	So that way, you know, but it has the 3D to help lend that perspective to it a little bit.
4037000	4042000	And obviously the additional processing power that the NES didn't have probably helped fix a lot of those issues.
4042000	4047000	But I just thought it was really cool that, you know, Super Mario Brothers 3 started out as something completely different
4047000	4053000	and then turned into what it is now, which many would argue is the best Mario game.
4053000	4060000	Although there's always going to be that Mario Brothers 3 versus Super Mario World debate that we're not doing tonight.
4060000	4063000	Yes, Star Shocker?
4063000	4065000	I like Super Mario World.
4065000	4067000	Yes, I knew it. You couldn't resist.
4067000	4073000	I'm surprised that this made it to the point where there are assets to be hidden in the actual cart
4073000	4078000	because just listening to how they're describing it, I'm surprised that it...
4079000	4084000	I would imagine it pittered out during like the storyboard, like not even a proof of concept.
4084000	4088000	Like they decided this is too much work. So the fact that they had assets is surprising to me.
4088000	4091000	Have either of you ever watched Beta64?
4091000	4093000	Is that like a YouTube thing?
4093000	4094000	It's a YouTube channel.
4094000	4095000	Yeah, no, I haven't.
4095000	4102000	Beta64 is actually really cool. It's one of my favorite channels because, you know, I like to dig around and play around in places.
4102000	4114000	But they go through things like E3 coverage, test copies, photos and magazines, and try to reconstruct the design cycle of a game.
4114000	4118000	Oh, like what it looked like before and how it really ended up.
4118000	4121000	Interesting. I'd like to see the episode on No Man's Sky.
4121000	4127000	I don't know that they've done that, but as I recall, I think they did do one for Super Mario World.
4128000	4135000	In fact, I know they did one for Super Mario World, but I'd like to think that they did one on Super Mario Brothers 3, or if not, then it's been requested.
4135000	4143000	But the ones they did on Star Fox 2 was amazing, especially since Star Fox 2 now has been given...
4143000	4152000	The final release copy is still in the possession of the designer who doesn't have the right to re-release it, but it was finished.
4152000	4159000	And someone's actually gone through and done a finalized version and put it out on, you know, Protocarts.
4159000	4166000	But I mean, I'm just saying as an example, you know, they're pretty resourceful when it comes to finding that type of information.
4166000	4168000	So it'd be worth it to see if they've done one.
4168000	4169000	Yeah, cool.
4169000	4171000	I'm a big fan of Beta64.
4171000	4178000	Yeah, I'll have to check that out. I like that type of hidden stuff you weren't supposed to see, vault type stuff.
4178000	4183000	There's that one website that has all that type of stuff too, and I can't remember the name for the liveme, like, Forgotten Stuff.
4183000	4184000	I don't remember what it is.
4184000	4189000	Doctor Tsuruya posts links from there all the time about new things that are found, like, in games.
4189000	4195000	This is where not having a live audience tonight is hurting me, but we'll talk about it maybe on Sunday show.
4195000	4202000	But yeah, those are, like, it has, like, all the stuff that, you know, they deleted from games and hidden things.
4202000	4204000	I like that stuff. It's interesting.
4204000	4211000	Alright, well, we are getting ready to wrap up, but before we do, I mean, usually we would take phone calls at the end of the show,
4211000	4216000	but since we're not live tonight, we can't just do that tonight.
4216000	4217000	You know, the phone's ringing, Rob.
4217000	4218000	Hello?
4218000	4220000	Sit!
4221000	4227000	Just imagine if you called, like, DarkTekTsuruya or TigerClaw and is like,
4227000	4232000	alright, can you just sit on hold for the next hour, and then they'll be like, I need you to look this up really quick.
4232000	4234000	Like, we just have to sit on Skype.
4234000	4238000	No, you don't get to listen to us record. We're just gonna cut over.
4238000	4241000	We should just call one of our people randomly.
4241000	4242000	One of our people randomly.
4242000	4243000	Let's do it!
4243000	4246000	Oh, no, I did that once. We did that at an early OLR, and I'll never do it again.
4246000	4247000	Why?
4247000	4253000	Because we woke some guy up or something who was in, like, a horrible mood or something, and I swear that guy stopped listening because of it.
4253000	4257000	Let's call Dan.
4257000	4259000	We're not gonna call Dan. We're gonna get to the mailbag.
4259000	4261000	Fuck.
4262000	4267000	Every week, you guys email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4267000	4273000	And DarkSakura enthusiastically jumps into the mailbag and finds some emails to read here.
4273000	4281000	And you know what? Since she's back this week after, you know, what, like, six weeks not being here, I'm very happy to put her to work.
4281000	4284000	So DarkSakura, read some emails.
4284000	4286000	Do your job, DarkSakura.
4286000	4292000	Okay, I'm... I just caught some keywords in here, but I'm still gonna read it.
4292000	4298000	So, um, this... I wonder if these are... Okay, never mind.
4298000	4300000	Because I'm reading them sort of secondhand.
4300000	4303000	Anyway, um, the first one comes from Robert M.
4303000	4312000	And it says, quick clarification, the Six Flags food service, we were having to wait an hour and a half in line for basic meals.
4312000	4314000	Still not relevant to this right now.
4314000	4321000	Oh, that was a follow-up from last week's show, since you weren't here. He had talked about this whole experience, and we were kind of... Okay, anyway.
4321000	4326000	I suppose the carnival games of old would, in fact, be the redemption games of today.
4326000	4336000	Note, forgive my use of the term dongless, as opposed to anatomically-inexplicit. It just seemed funnier and more direct.
4337000	4347000	I've been having serious issues sleeping for the last few weeks, partially from general anxiety, undiagnosed, and partially from excessive caffeine, due to lack of sleep perpetuating the cycle.
4347000	4349000	And I've been browsing YouTube nearly all night.
4349000	4359000	Late last night, while browsing Let's Play-type videos, I came across the Rooster Teeth guys looking at a prototype release of a gladiatorial game on the HTC Vive called GORN.
4359000	4368000	Where the player battles various numbers of cartoonishly muscular naked dongless warriors with fists, flails, shields, swords, bows, and so on.
4368000	4381000	The game features a fair amount of blood and dismemberment, with an audience of blocky heads that are clearly from the silly physics-based Wolfenstein 3D game, if you've seen that one.
4381000	4385000	I'm not really sure if this is the same developer.
4385000	4390000	Overall, it's very much the vibe of Ridiculous Game presented semi-seriously.
4390000	4399000	I do see a later build of the prototype gives gladiators armor and basic leather briefs to break away plate mail and helmets.
4399000	4404000	Wait, so this is nudity and violence we're talking about? Because I'm kind of sold.
4404000	4408000	More like no genitalia nudity. It's Ken doll.
4408000	4411000	And more blood and bruising.
4411000	4417000	I'm sorry, I'm looking at something. Of course I had to dig up a YouTube. I doubt it's the same one.
4417000	4422000	But I'm actually watching somebody play this game and it looks fucking ridiculous.
4422000	4425000	Are you watching this, Talon?
4425000	4428000	It's like a 3D Choniki.
4428000	4430000	It's not even that. It just looks...
4430000	4434000	We have a winner. Raise your arms in victory, peasant.
4434000	4437000	I think you'd laugh at this, Darasaga.
4437000	4439000	Okay, well let me finish what you mean.
4439000	4440000	Okay, sorry.
4440000	4445000	Giving it a slightly more serious feel, even the gladiators still look like a wrestler from Looney Tunes.
4445000	4450000	I imagine what I've seen in the... Is it the Veve or the... It's the Veve.
4450000	4451000	It's the Vive.
4451000	4453000	Vive. Vive. That's so weird.
4453000	4458000	This could be more than a little overwhelming. I encourage you to look up Gorn.
4458000	4461000	Looks interesting if obviously unfinished.
4461000	4463000	That's from Robert M.
4463000	4466000	Well, yes. By your recommendation, I'm looking at this now.
4466000	4471000	It does look very plain. There's still a lot of fluff that they could put into this.
4471000	4474000	I really don't know what the audience for this game is.
4474000	4477000	If they're going to sell this beyond the WTF factor.
4477000	4479000	They need to pad those guys.
4479000	4484000	But the WTF factor is very strong with this. So, congrats, I think.
4484000	4487000	Congrats.
4487000	4489000	Sorry, they just knocked the guy out. It's funny.
4489000	4490000	Alright, next email.
4490000	4492000	This is so stupid.
4492000	4493000	Yes, I'm closing this YouTube now.
4493000	4494000	Hello, LR.
4494000	4495000	Hello.
4495000	4498000	Some people might have been confused about the reasons for my email last week.
4498000	4500000	Especially me since I didn't hear it.
4500000	4502000	Specifically, my calling out of Shane.
4502000	4504000	I don't actually dislike Shane.
4504000	4506000	And in fact, I find him to be quite entertaining.
4506000	4511000	But during episode 663 when mailbag had been empty for the second week in a row.
4511000	4515000	Rob specifically suggested that we write emails ranting about Shane.
4515000	4517000	I did. I did.
4517000	4519000	Okay, now it makes sense.
4519000	4522000	See, I don't even remember what my ass said a week ago on this very show.
4522000	4527000	I have to message Dark Soccer on Twitter. Did I do that?
4527000	4529000	What episode did that happen on? I can't remember.
4529000	4531000	I'd be like, bitch, I don't know.
4531000	4532000	Yeah, I know, right?
4532000	4534000	So this was just before the 2-0-2 mark.
4534000	4537000	And I happen to be quite good at following directions.
4537000	4539000	How are those receipts?
4539000	4543000	If you go to episode 663 and check the two hour and two minute mark.
4543000	4546000	You said this. This is why I'm fucked.
4546000	4548000	It's Red Shirt. It's Red Shirt guy for O.L.R.
4548000	4550000	This is why I'm fucked when it comes to politics.
4550000	4554000	Because, you know, somebody's going to dig up some clip of something stupid I said
4554000	4556000	when I was drunk on a particular show.
4556000	4557000	Or, you know.
4557000	4560000	We only have to be extra careful about that with the fur now.
4560000	4563000	Well, that's neither here nor there.
4563000	4568000	But, you know, just in general, I'm really surprised and I shouldn't encourage this.
4568000	4572000	But I'm really surprised somebody has a strung together, like a clip of things
4572000	4575000	where like I said something in one episode and then said the exact opposite thing
4575000	4577000	like three weeks later. Because I know it's happened. I'll fully admit.
4577000	4579000	But opinions change.
4579000	4582000	I am sure there's an early episode of O.L.R. where I said
4582000	4584000	I don't really like Mass Effect whatsoever.
4584000	4587000	Like I tried playing Mass Effect and it wasn't very good.
4587000	4589000	Right? And we all know that my opinion on that changed.
4589000	4591000	I think that did happen.
4591000	4593000	I think I did it too.
4593000	4596000	Yeah, because I remember playing it and I wasn't like super into it.
4596000	4598000	But then when I give it...
4598000	4600000	And this happens all the time with different types of art.
4600000	4602000	Like sometimes you'll see a movie a second time and you're like,
4602000	4606000	Oh, this is... I just must have been in a bad mood when I saw this the first time.
4606000	4608000	Or music. Huge thing with music, right?
4608000	4611000	Haven't you ever listened to an album and the first time you were like,
4611000	4613000	Well, whatever. And the second time you listen to it you're like,
4613000	4614000	Okay, this is really fucking good.
4614000	4617000	Okay, get this. I have been...
4617000	4620000	However many decades broken up with this guy,
4620000	4623000	I still can't watch The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
4623000	4624000	The Disney movie?
4624000	4625000	The Disney movie.
4625000	4628000	Well, the good news is it's one of the lesser Disney movies.
4628000	4629000	Yeah, but still.
4629000	4630000	Yeah, I know.
4630000	4631000	I saw it in the theater right after.
4631000	4632000	Yeah.
4632000	4635000	With him and other friends.
4635000	4637000	I mean, he's married. He's got kids. It's all fine.
4637000	4640000	But I'm just saying it was just that emotional impact of the moment.
4640000	4641000	Sure.
4641000	4642000	It's hard to do it.
4642000	4643000	Sure.
4643000	4646000	There's certain songs that remind me of X's to this day.
4646000	4649000	I mean, it's just the way it is.
4649000	4653000	Now at the same time I have certain songs I listen to on repeat because they get me mad.
4653000	4656000	I actually have one.
4656000	4658000	Well, what song gets you mad?
4658000	4660000	Daughters of the Chaos by Luscious Jackson.
4660000	4661000	Interesting.
4661000	4663000	It's not my angry song.
4663000	4665000	It's my fired up song.
4665000	4670000	Well, I always tell people if I'm listening to Tori Amos, something's wrong.
4670000	4672000	Something is really wrong.
4672000	4674000	So look out.
4674000	4675000	Yeah, no, no, no.
4675000	4680000	If I bust out the Tori Amos, you need to take me out and feed me because I'm depressed.
4680000	4681000	It's intervention.
4681000	4682000	And food will make it better.
4682000	4684000	We'll fill your face with noodles.
4684000	4685000	Yes.
4685000	4686000	Noodles always make it better.
4686000	4687000	Noodles always make it better.
4687000	4691000	Anyway, I don't know how we got here from YYR's email, but I think it had something
4691000	4692000	to do with how forgetful I am.
4692000	4693000	But anyway.
4693000	4694000	Receipts.
4694000	4695000	Yes, receipts.
4695000	4698000	I hope that you guys are recovering from the election.
4698000	4699000	No.
4699000	4700000	No.
4700000	4703000	At least it is over.
4703000	4705000	It's not gonna be over.
4705000	4707000	It seemed like it went on forever.
4707000	4709000	Which it is.
4709000	4710000	Which is bad.
4710000	4713000	Because, yeah, damn right it's bad.
4713000	4717640	It's this one time I saw it out on TV saying I should call my doctor if I have an election
4717640	4720000	lasting more than four hours.
4720000	4721000	Oh well.
4721000	4724600	I bet he wrote that email before the election even finished just to make that fucking joke.
4724600	4725600	I bet that's-
4725600	4728000	Wednesday, November 9th.
4728000	4729000	Oh.
4729000	4732000	Lots of love, Aaron YYR.
4732000	4735320	No, it's not over.
4735320	4737800	I am not saying this in jest either.
4737800	4740800	It's fucking not over.
4740800	4742880	Put on your hard hats.
4742880	4745000	Put on your marching boots.
4745000	4746800	We got work to do.
4746800	4751880	And we got a lot of video games to play to get the fuck all out of it sometimes.
4751880	4752880	Fuck yeah.
4752880	4753880	Anyway.
4753880	4756840	Why do you think I've been playing so much WoW?
4756840	4762360	I'm doing the fucking 80 Soul Shard Illidan quest right now.
4762360	4764440	I'm like, okay, okay.
4764440	4768240	Dear Blizzard Activision assholes.
4768240	4771720	First of all, happy 12th anniversary of World of Warcraft today.
4771720	4775120	Thanks for the fun history quiz.
4775120	4776200	Happy dozen.
4776200	4779600	They should celebrate with a dozen donuts.
4779600	4782040	I should celebrate with a dozen donuts.
4782040	4787760	Here all about the 12th anniversary of WoW on the next Horde house.
4787760	4788880	Coming on the 20th anniversary.
4788880	4789880	Coming never.
4789880	4790880	Coming never.
4790880	4791880	Never say never.
4791880	4792880	Never say never.
4792880	4793880	Never say never.
4793880	4803400	But, this is a really obvious grasp for time because they must have been so ill prepared
4803400	4804400	for the patching.
4804400	4810080	They should have just left that quiz, the quiz, quest for when the patch comes out and
4810080	4816680	just had it be like 40 so you don't have to spend two months farming those pieces.
4816680	4821320	At least they have it now that you can do it on heroics and not on just mythics.
4821320	4822320	But fuck.
4822320	4826360	There's only so many times I can run Darkheart Thicket.
4826360	4832320	Don't give me a new quest every time I'm done with it to do the same damn thing.
4832320	4838440	But at least there's always something to do unlike Final Fantasy 14.
4838440	4840880	It's now as funny as I feel the exact opposite.
4840880	4845000	As I log into WoW and I'm like, I guess I'll pick flowers because I'm kind of not interested
4845000	4846000	in the end game content.
4846000	4850160	But then I log into Final Fantasy 14 and I'm like, ooh, I've got wondrous tales to do or
4850160	4855480	I've got roulettes to run or so it's not going to work with me.
4855480	4857720	I think it just depends on what you're into.
4857720	4858720	Coke or Pepsi.
4858720	4859720	All right.
4859720	4860720	Anyway.
4860720	4863120	But you still have to go run things with me.
4863120	4869080	I've got four more days to do it and thus I get thirty thousand gold in the next four
4869080	4870080	days.
4870080	4871080	We'll see.
4871080	4872080	I'll give you 20.
4872080	4873520	That's you should buy your own month with that.
4873520	4876340	I have like one hundred and twenty, one hundred twenty thousand.
4876340	4877340	My God.
4877340	4878640	How are you making money in that game?
4878640	4879640	Starlight Rose.
4880120	4883680	Oh, is that really what they sell for like three hundred a pop.
4883680	4884680	OK.
4884680	4885680	One sells for three.
4885680	4888920	Yeah, no, I was trying to gather that was trying to do that in the fell fell something
4888920	4893280	that I'll work is the daily sells pretty well to sell where it's not quite a daily, but
4893280	4895840	you get like a seed to plant and you can grow more.
4895840	4898520	No, you can collect like one a day somewhere.
4898520	4899720	I sell the seeds.
4899720	4901160	You make a ton of money off those.
4901160	4902720	Just make a ton of money off the plant to you.
4902720	4903720	Yes, that's true.
4903720	4904720	All right.
4904720	4907800	Anyway, I think I think those go for like six hundred a pop.
4907800	4908800	So anyway.
4908960	4909960	All right.
4909960	4911840	Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
4911840	4916360	I hope you enjoyed this special, shorter, but still fun episode number six hundred sixty
4916360	4917360	five.
4917360	4920040	I want to thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to the show tonight.
4920040	4923240	If you like what you heard, please tell a friend or five about the show.
4923240	4927240	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only
4927240	4932400	if the voices are here to use them and the voices will be back live this Sunday with
4932400	4934300	episode number 666.
4934300	4935300	We made it, Jamie.
4935300	4936300	We have a treat.
4936300	4937300	We made it.
4937300	4938300	I know I'm excited.
4938300	4941780	We've taken off the podcast because it sounds different.
4941780	4942780	Yes.
4942780	4944540	There's gonna be a lot different next week.
4944540	4946100	Devil's food cake in the studio, hopefully.
4946100	4947100	Oh my God.
4947100	4948100	That's what I want.
4948100	4949100	That's how we celebrate.
4949100	4950100	You know what we're talking about.
4950100	4951340	What are we going to do for episode 66?
4951340	4952700	We eat devil's food cake.
4952700	4953700	There's the celebration.
4953700	4954700	I love it.
4954700	4957180	I'm down for that.
4957180	4960020	I got the day off, OK?
4960020	4961020	That's great.
4961020	4962020	It is great.
4962020	4964300	Y'all should come to the bar with me like the night before.
4964300	4967300	Should I cancel the order then for the three live chickens because I figured we'd just
4967300	4969420	kill them.
4969420	4971220	That was every D&D game every week.
4971220	4972580	I've got that down to a science.
4972580	4973580	All right.
4973580	4979720	Anyway, no, no, we don't need the live chickens, but we do need chicken strips.
4979720	4981780	Just saying we do need chicken strips.
4981780	4983740	Anyway, that's going to do it.
4983740	4987780	A nice five star review, of course, on a site like iTunes or Google, wherever you found
4987780	4989980	this show is going to go a long way as well.
4989980	4992620	Before we wrap up, of course, we have to get everybody's final thought.
4992620	4995780	Alan, thank you for filling in, even though it was a shorter show tonight, but it was
4995780	4996940	great to have you back on the show.
4996940	4999100	And I say that because I'm completely biased.
4999100	5000100	Yeah.
5000100	5001520	So thanks for having me.
5001520	5002520	You're welcome.
5002520	5004660	But, you know, you can kind of invite yourself on whenever you want.
5004660	5005660	Oh, I do.
5005660	5007980	I'll just walk up and snatch the mic out of your hand.
5007980	5010220	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
5010220	5011220	I like pizza.
5011220	5012220	I'm going to make a pizza.
5012220	5013220	Sounds good.
5013220	5014220	P as easy.
5014220	5016220	I was saying that.
5016220	5017220	All right.
5017220	5024520	Anyway, my final thought tonight is I'm excited for Pokemon this weekend and the Overwatch
5024520	5027800	free weekend and lots of games ahead.
5027800	5028800	Yay.
5028800	5029800	Yay games.
5029800	5031560	And Dark Soccer, last but not least.
5031560	5032720	And you'll be here next week.
5032720	5034400	You get two Jamie shows in a row.
5034400	5038800	And then we're only going to lose you for what, like two more weeks and you're back
5038800	5039800	full time, right?
5039800	5041600	Like December 10th or something was your first show back?
5041600	5042600	11th?
5042600	5043600	Something like that?
5043600	5044600	No, it's the 18th.
5044600	5045600	Oh, okay.
5045600	5046600	So maybe three weeks.
5046600	5047600	Yeah.
5047600	5048600	All right.
5048600	5049600	But something like that.
5049600	5050600	But you'll be back full time soon.
5050600	5051600	Yeah.
5051600	5052600	But in the meantime, give us a really good final thought.
5052600	5053600	I got to pee.
5053600	5057160	I guess that's what we get.
5057160	5058160	Anyway.
5058160	5059480	Thank you guys very much for listening to the show.
5059480	5062320	We'll be back live on Sunday.
