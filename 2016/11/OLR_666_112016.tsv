25280	54160	Hello my fiends out there on the internet.
54160	61840	Welcome to a very dark Studio N7 and another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
61840	66160	This is episode number 666.
66160	68760	Say it forward, say it backwards, it's all the same.
68760	79240	Episode number 666 of Orange Lounge Radio Live for this 20 November 2016.
79240	86800	You see, this is what the year 2016 does to nationally recognized nerd holidays such as
86800	88360	20 November.
88360	91880	It flips them to the land of the upside down.
91880	100760	Where myself, Rob Roberts, is sitting right now with my co-hosts, I'm Cersei Nightshade.
100760	106600	Somebody has gotten out the Ouija board and summoned without the use of radio magic live
106600	118680	to the studio DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers.
118680	125480	Welcome back from the land of the working and lost and tired DarkSakura.
125480	130360	And also joining us in studio, I will still meet you for that crap, I don't care what
130360	132160	episode it is.
132160	138000	And also say hello in studio to the one and only Satan Master, Loki.
138000	139000	Hello.
139000	140000	Hi Loki, how are you?
140000	141000	I'm fine.
141000	142000	Welcome back to the show.
142000	143000	Yes.
143000	148840	I know you missed our little show mid-week, but I hope everything's better, so.
148840	151640	Yeah, I mean, it's fine.
151640	152640	Awesome.
152640	160360	Alright, so here we are, episode 666 as mentioned of our show, and a number of a show that we
160360	162200	never thought we'd actually get to.
162200	163200	I think.
163200	164200	What was that, Loki?
164200	166800	I was just saying that I'm still disappointed we missed so many shows, because originally
166800	171160	it was supposed to land on my birthday, and that would have been fantastic, but it's just
171160	173720	not meant to be, apparently.
173720	177680	Well, even the devil needs a vacation once in a while, Loki, but.
177680	183240	No, the devil's doing other work right now.
183240	186520	Devil's been busy interviewing people all weekend.
186520	192240	But here's the thing, we never thought we'd get this far, but here we are, the true episode
192240	197800	666, which I think got back on episode 66, I think we joked, the show would have to be
197800	203000	going for like 14 years for us to get to an actual episode 666, and there's been joke
203000	205080	episode 666s.
205080	211080	Our old pal, Travis Donovan, who did the show Understation Live, he filled in for us one
211080	215400	night when we weren't here live on one of our many excursions, like E3 week or something
215400	219680	like that, and he was with his buddy that he used to do Understation Live with, Bresl,
219680	225440	or whatever he goes by now these days, and they did like episode 666, but now, so now
225440	231120	there's two realities of an episode 666, so we've had to take the stranger things approach.
231120	237000	So is this like the true Back to the Future 2 reality, or is this the Biff Tannen reality?
237000	240960	I'm gonna leave that for y'all to decide at the end of the night, that's what I'm gonna
240960	242040	say right there.
242040	246480	But you guys are there in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, where we do tape live
246480	252160	every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, or should I say 666 o'clock Pacific, nine
252160	257440	o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and as we talked about on Bobby
257440	262880	Black Wolf tonight, I do wanna mention here right at the top of the show, a very big congratulation
262880	270840	to Bobby Black Wolf for getting engaged this past week while he was off on a cruise around
271600	273960	wherever they were, the Caribbean I think it was, because you mentioned there was a
273960	278560	show, the Pirates in the Caribbean, because they were actually there, so congratulations
278560	286080	to Bobby and Jennifer on that, very, very, very excited for them.
286080	293000	Looking through chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Ikuma JP in chat says, why 666
293000	300400	always has to be dark, 666 can be lollipop-y, I like that word, lollipop, I wanna lollipop,
300400	306800	our soccer, get me a lollipop, I gave you pineapple soda, that is, that is, it was sweet,
306800	314280	it was sugary, like a lollipop would be, I didn't lick it, but I drank it, anyway, let's
314280	321120	see, also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Maya is in our chat saying episode
321120	326740	666 will be comprised entirely of our host acting out chic tracks, I think you're chic
326740	332860	tracks, I'm not sure exactly what, oh, like the asshole jack chick, oh, that used to write
332860	339020	those, you're going to hell, oh, oh, oh, oh, that was a deep joke, that was good, you're,
339020	343620	you're not Southern Baptist, you're going to hell, that's like the little article in
343620	347220	the newspaper that says, warning, all these people are going to hell, and it's like all
347220	355180	the coolest people you know, yeah, what's that, Darsara, just to let you know, there
355180	362340	is some weird apocrypha, post biblical apocrypha created, that indicates that 666 is some
362340	366460	mystically bad number, that it's apparently going to be tattooed on everyone's head during
366460	371380	the rapture, even though there's no actual reference to it in what is considered the
371380	377300	Christian Bible, and how do we know it's not 999 upside down? Because that would be a sale,
377300	383380	999 are you out of your mind? That's exactly how many NES classics they actually made,
383380	390260	by the way. But I would assume that the number six, anyway, has a similar negative connotation
390260	396040	to the number four in Japan, without the reference to death. So are you saying that we missed
396040	401940	an opportunity to do all this cheesy, over the top, scary shit way back on episode four?
401940	406340	We could have, if we had been a little more culturally sensitive. I see. Well, everybody,
406340	411700	from here on out now, you'll just have to look forward to episode number 4444, because
411700	416540	that will be the next landmark evil episode. How about that? Four fours. And so what year
416540	421700	would that be in? We'll be dead. We will be about 70 years old when that episode happens.
421700	428740	No, that would be even more than that. You have to go, like, daily. And for Ikuma, that
428740	434460	is the closest parallel I could think of to illustrate kind of how unlucky the number
434460	440420	is. If it's the closest thing I could think of. Alright, I do want to get into video games,
440420	446140	but since tonight is a little bit of a quote unquote special episode, I actually thought,
446140	451180	you know, it's funny that there was the comment earlier about why can't 666 be lollipop-y?
451180	455980	I thought, actually, we could start maybe with something a little bit more positive,
455980	462140	just because I think everybody expects something negative and scary. And Loki brings us plenty
462140	466300	of that when we get into Nintendo news later. But I thought we'd take a minute to talk about,
466300	470900	especially because considering today is 20 November. And I know a lot of listeners might
470900	474220	not understand the significance of that and why we were trying to make such a landmark
474220	478660	show happen on 20 November. But remember that Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Dark Soccer,
478660	483420	and Loki, we all met playing a little video game known as Dance Dance Revolution at the
483420	487460	arcade, you know, when people still hung out at arcades regularly. Well, that's coming
487460	491420	back a little bit, depending on where you are. But anyway, we all met, you know, playing
491420	495760	DDR and getting into that community and established friendships there. And in the early days
495760	501280	of Orange Lounge Radio, Orange Lounge, by the way, one of the bands actually in DDR
501280	505960	that does songs for, and when I say DDR, I really mean the whole Bomani family, Beatmania.
505960	511080	I'm simplifying things for people who might not have been around back then. But where
511080	516320	was I going with that? DDR was back in the day, we were all playing together. Oh, and
516320	519360	Orange Lounge Radio was one of the bands in, or excuse me, Orange Lounge was one of the
519360	525560	bands in DDR. So we took the name as a Beatles tribute band might call themselves
525560	530680	Yellow Submarine, or an ABBA tribute band might call themselves Bjorn Again or Mamma
530680	535840	Mia or something. But anyway, so we took a name of one of the bands and, you know, Lounge
535840	541140	was to give that talk radio atmosphere. So really, I mean, this show happened because
541140	545760	of DDR. So it's kind of funny that today being 20 November, that's kind of recognized as
545760	553000	a music gaming holiday, because one of the first songs you play in DDR or Beatmania,
553000	560200	because it's a beginner level song, is 20 November. And that was a song by DJ, what
560200	566080	was his name, DJ Nagureyo? Nagureyo. Nagureyo was his name, and that actually was his birthday.
566080	571240	So that's funny as that we turned the dude's birthday into a Bomani holiday, but you know,
571240	577040	a lot of the people who really nerded out on music games 15 years ago, if you can believe
577040	581120	that's how long it's been, kind of adopted that as the unofficial holiday. So here we
581120	586600	are. So now we get a landmark episode and that. But the reason I state all of that is,
586600	591320	you know, we've come a long way here at Orange Tons Radio. Not a lot of podcasts have hit
591320	598260	666 episodes. I don't know of any weekly show that has. I certainly know of multi-week shows
598260	601560	and daily shows that have hit that type of number, but I don't know of any weekly shows
601560	606040	that have hit 666. So you know, we've been doing this for a while. And I thought it's
606040	611600	kind of like a nice thing to start the show off tonight. I thought I'd ask you guys, what is the
611600	616200	positive influence that doing this show has had on your life? Like, what is the, what are the good
616200	621320	things that have come of doing Orange Tons Radio? And I would even, you know, for a change, turn
621320	625480	that over to our listeners as well in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Like, I'm not looking
625480	629860	to inflate our egos too much, but it is a special landmark episode. I'm very curious, you know,
629860	635840	what is, what has the show done for you out there? So, Jamie, ladies first, you're back after a
635840	639840	break. What has Orange Tons Radio done for you? What is, what does the show meant to you over the
639840	646920	years? I have something to do on Sunday. It's a thing to do. I made a lot of good friends. That's
646920	653760	a big one. I certainly got a lot more confidence for speaking out. And even with a few negative
653760	660840	experiences, it's taught me how to let a few things go like water off a deck's back and, and
660960	666320	how to get my revenge. I mean, how to, how to properly mitigate damage on social media. How
666320	674680	exactly have you gotten your revenge? I'm a little concerned now. Maybe it's coming. What? I'm trying
674680	682240	to remember exactly how the quote goes, but, uh, always fear, always fear the patience of an angry
682240	689960	man. Or, and, and fear it double when it's a woman. Fear the, fear the anger of a patient, of a
689960	695360	patient person. That's it. Fear the anger of a patient person. Okay. All right. Loki, what about
695360	700560	you? What is, what is OLR meant for you? I know you're not usually a feelsy person, but try me
700560	709360	here. Um, I get to vent. Or at least I get to talk about video games. Cause like, if I tried to do
709360	715080	that outside of the show, except, you know, when I'm hanging out with, you know, friends that are
715080	722400	also gamers, which is very rare. Um, most people are just like, kinda, it's goes over the head.
722400	727480	Like you even try to explain like the basic stuff to them. Like, Oh yeah, I got PlayStation VR. Yeah.
727480	734840	That's trying this stuff out. Then it's like, I don't care. What's a VR? Is that a car? What's
734840	741280	a VR? Sony made a car, PlayStation car. It's like my, my dad called me yesterday. Cause they're
741280	749400	thinking of getting, um, the other grand child, a VR headset for his phone. And I'm like, well,
749400	753360	what kind of phone does he have? Cause that makes a difference. You can buy a headset. It won't
753360	759800	fucking work if your phone is old as shit. And apparently his phone is, might be old as shit. So
759800	766000	I was like, maybe you find out what phone he has first and then go buy it. So, cause they're, Oh,
766000	775520	$15 VR is just everywhere. It's $15. It's not $50. So OLR is basically giving you a place to talk
775520	781160	about video games when, when the quote unquote real world won't let you do that. Yeah. Especially
781160	785240	the wife, the wife doesn't like hearing about video games. Like I say anything to her and she's
785240	792800	just like kinda, I don't know. The mark of the beast shows up. It's hard enough. Like my God,
792800	798160	like we, like I've been using like the stupid streaming box, the boxy, it's like super old as
798160	803360	shit. And it's for Netflix and it stopped working because it's old as shit and it doesn't, it's not
803360	808760	supported anymore. It's all web based and their shit's all broken. So we have to use the PlayStation
808760	815480	4 now. And that was such a fucking just bitch fest because it's just like, my God, I have to
815480	820400	use the controller. I don't know how to turn the console on. I'm like, push the button, push the
820440	826520	button, just hold it down. It will turn the fuck on. And then like, and then seriously, it's like
826520	831400	she keeps leaving it on and I'm like, turn the console off when you're done with it. Don't just
831400	835200	leave it on because she leaves the controller there to drain all the battery out. So when I want
835200	840440	to go play a game, I can't fucking do that without tethering myself to the console. And so finally
840440	846840	she's like, I learned how to turn the console off today. I'm like, good for you. I mean, like, I've
846880	853960	been only showing you like 80 times how to do that and fine. Thanks for actually doing it now. I
853960	858920	mean, I don't know. So that's how, that's, that's what speaking, like we went out with other, other
858920	863680	parents last night and they're gamers. So like for her, she likes talking to them about other stuff,
863680	869280	but like I was talking to them about games. Funny, actually the guy, you know, this is totally local
869280	877440	bullshit, but like the guy actually played Ingress a bit. Um, not so much, but his home portal also
877440	882440	happens to be Marty's home portal. And he told me some stories about like, Oh yeah, there's this guy
882440	886320	like kept on like, I stopped playing it because there's this guy that kept on like seeing that,
886320	891520	you know, I was, you know, stalking him and like he kept threatening about stuff. I'm like, well,
891520	896520	where were you at? Oh, it's in Folsom. There's this, this trail behind my house. Don't be too
896520	900880	specific, but yeah, it's like, you know, this trail behind my house and I'm like, Oh, was it
900880	906480	this guy? And he's like, yeah, that's who it was. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I mean, it's,
906480	911320	it, I don't really get to talk to a lot of people about games outside of the show. So, so orange
911320	915920	lawns radio in a way is a safe space for gamers. Is that, is that what we're going to complain
915920	920320	about on the internet? And that's still the same audience, but you know, it's hard to complain in
920320	927200	140 characters, you know? I, I think my, my answer is, is kind of a combination between you
927200	932600	guys is like, certainly this has allowed me to have a platform for something that I started in
932600	936440	college, but didn't really see through to the end. Cause you know, in college, I had a college radio
936440	941380	show and I was doing that weekly and you know, that's at one point what I was studying to do in
941380	944480	college. I'm sure I mentioned this on the show before, but originally I wanted to be a weather
944520	951720	man, believe it or not. And I, after interning at a local station, I kind of decided it actually
951720	955560	wasn't like broadcast journalism and all that stuff actually wasn't what I wanted to do at all,
955560	960160	because I just didn't really, I don't think I had the competitive personality for it. And you know,
960160	963080	trying to get into radio and that too, it's like the same thing. It's like, it's just,
963080	967400	it's just too competitive. And now, you know, in a way, thank gosh, I didn't really get into that
967400	971520	because radio has kind of been hurting a little bit, at least the traditional model because of
971560	975960	satellite, because of internet, because of, you know, the fact that people get their music in
975960	981200	other places at this point. So in a way, I'm kind of thankful that I have this to have a platform
981200	987600	for that, which I was interested in, but I wasn't interested in the industry. So this has kind of
987600	993560	allowed me to have a place to feel that out on my own terms in a way. I mean, obviously this is a
993560	998800	collaborative effort with my co-host, but you know what I mean? Still, I feel like I'm in a driver's
998840	1003000	seat, if nothing else, when it comes to this show and the other podcasts that have spun off of,
1003000	1008720	of doing this show. So I think for me, big time, like this has been a great platform and, you know,
1008720	1013000	also it's kind of Dark Sakura says, even though you kind of joke like, oh, it's something to do
1013000	1019680	on Sunday in a weird way, every Sunday, there's not OLR. I'm kind of sitting there going, I should
1019680	1023000	be doing OLR right now. Like it doesn't matter. Like it's like something in my biological clock.
1023000	1027160	Like even if I'm in the East coast or, or like a couple of weeks ago, I was in Chicago, sure enough,
1027600	1031880	eight o'clock comes around Chicago time. I'm looking at it going, I should be doing OLR right
1031880	1033560	now. But I'm not.
1033680	1034960	I sit at work going.
1037480	1042120	I know, but your thing is temporary. And we already have a return date for you, right? December
1042120	1042600	18th?
1043400	1051480	Right. Although there is a chance that I may be here next Sunday. Because I am doing a day trade
1051480	1055200	with somebody at work, but it's for an earlier event with the sisters.
1055360	1056920	We'll take whatever Jamie we can get.
1057960	1061760	Well, and I will explain that reference to people later anyway.
1062560	1067880	Stoppy in chat wants to know, a weatherman, is that how the name Sky was born? No, funny, but no.
1068160	1073440	That's just a name I had online forever back in DDR Freak. I'll give you the short spiel.
1074200	1080440	Originally, a name I had picked online was Green Sky, because A, I like the color green. B, it was
1080440	1083560	one of those things where like, if the sky was green, that would be different but cool. And that's
1083560	1087160	kind of what I think I am, different but cool. That's like 18 year old me talking, okay, so it
1087160	1090400	was a little different back then. But that was, you know, so that was kind of the name I picked
1090400	1095080	for myself. And so that's actually where my like, my gamertag comes from, and where all that comes
1095080	1100280	from, except the fact that Green Sky with SKY was usually taken on all these websites. So I had to
1100280	1105920	spell it S-K-I-E. And then at one point, I just dropped the green and it was just Sky. So that's
1105940	1111120	what it was. But now, it's funny, because now all these years later, I don't like it. I kind of
1111120	1114560	stuck with it. But I think I mentioned this before, if I could get the Twitter account Rob
1114560	1119200	Roberts, I'd be on that. I would give up my four letter Twitter name, if I could get that one. But
1119200	1123560	since I can't, because some spammer has it, no matter how many people reported it to Twitter, I
1123560	1129400	can't get that to get freed up. I just keeping Sky because it's four letters and it's, it's somewhat
1129400	1133600	easy to remember, even if people think it's ski all the time, which is, which is fine, whatever.
1135440	1138460	Going to chat, I want to see what the chatters have to say, because you guys have some really
1138460	1141660	awesome things to say. And then we'll get into our gaming weeks. I know some people are like,
1141660	1146980	isn't this a video game show? Yes, we've done 665 episodes of video game talk. We can take a moment
1147220	1153100	to talk about other things. Let's see. Sturlock in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, in all
1153100	1157100	seriousness, I'm really glad you guys made it this far. I haven't been listening as much as I used
1157100	1159660	to, but I'm still a huge fan and always will be.
1159660	1161780	That's okay. I haven't been listening as much as I used to either.
1161780	1168300	That's fine. Yeah, we're only, we're only listening about half the time. No, I, and I understand
1168300	1174340	that's the way it is. You know, people, people make this a thing that they do every week, but then
1174340	1178940	something else comes up and they fall out of the habit. It's fine. Like, we have guests. They used
1178940	1184220	to be here like every week in the early weeks of the show that I haven't heard from in years, or
1184220	1189100	I'll hear from once in a while. Like, I'm thinking people like DDR Angel. I know she's still out
1189100	1194060	there and I see her on Twitter and stuff. She's been doing a lot of YouTube stuff lately. Like
1194060	1199340	Anita I see on Facebook once in a while. She used to come here all the time. I miss Janae. She used
1199340	1202940	to be here a lot in the early episodes. But Janae has littles.
1203500	1209340	Yeah. Well, she married and I can't remember what his username was, but he used to come to the show
1209340	1216460	all the time too. She married him. Dark child? Dark cloud? That sounds right. Yeah. They got,
1216460	1221660	by the way, y'all, they got married like years ago, but you know, that's just, that's just neat
1221660	1226060	how that kind of all works out. I wonder, I don't think they met because of OLR, but you know,
1226060	1231980	you got to wonder what kind of people maybe met because of this show. Let's see. William Murderface
1231980	1236700	says, I've been listening for over 10 years at this point and y'all have always been a point of
1236700	1242140	funny and insightful normalcy. Did somebody really use the word normalcy to describe this show?
1242700	1243500	Climate, I guess.
1246380	1252620	I guess so. I guess that's a very good point that I can return to during tough times. So thank you.
1253260	1258540	You're welcome. Thank you for being here. SSJ100Matt says, the show gave me a great sense
1258540	1262300	of community early on when I started listening. I have met and made friends with a lot of good
1262300	1267180	people. It's kind of like coming home to family once a week for dinner, drinks, and laughs.
1267180	1270700	I love that because that's exactly what I envisioned the show would be all these years
1270700	1275820	ago is that, you know, after playing DDR, we would all go to the cafe that was right in front
1275820	1280620	of golf land and talk shit about video games. And so now it's just a, it's a virtual cafe.
1281660	1287980	Cafe, cafe, cafe. Immortal King says, has been a show that's kept me informed and entertained.
1287980	1292940	It has broke the news of FNG live, has put out its own website. Oh, is it talking about this
1292940	1297500	show? We're talking about all games maybe. And introduced me to Bobby Black Wolf, Travis and
1297500	1302220	Jessica and Pod Culture. Oh, maybe because that's the point of a network is when all these shows
1302220	1307500	are networked together, you start to meet other, other people, you know, and, and through, through
1307500	1312380	these types of things. And, you know, obviously not just VOG network where we are now, but certainly
1312380	1316620	we spent a good chunk of time at the all games network and they were fabulous and are fabulous.
1316620	1321580	And, uh, Orange Launch Radio was its own network for a brief period of time in the early days. So,
1321580	1328620	you know, and we tried to be pretty fabulous there too. So anyhow. Whew. All right. Um,
1330140	1335260	let's see. Dark Tetsuya says, oh, sorry. Rama says, didn't Dark Tetsuya meet his now wife through
1335260	1340780	OLR? Uh, Dark Tetsuya says she was a friend of Angel's, but yeah. And, uh, we're still working
1340780	1344860	on it, but yeah, I don't, I don't think they, are they married? If they were married yet, I would,
1344860	1351180	I actually somehow missed that. So congratulations if that's the case, if not, oops. Anyway,
1351340	1355500	but I know they, they have a relationship if nothing else. So, um, that's fantastic.
1356140	1363660	Anyway. Um, golly golly. Uh, okay. Dark Tetsuya says working on it. Okay. That's great. Uh,
1364540	1370380	Rageinator says, OLR switching from live 365 to all games got me into listening to the live
1370380	1376700	internet radio and started me on listening to Black Wolf. Um, that's, that's awesome. Uh,
1376700	1379820	you know, that's the part, that's part of networking is being able to, uh,
1379820	1386540	inner, inner work with other shows. Uh, let's see. This is a very random question, but I'll
1386540	1392300	entertain it in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, uh, Barb in chat says, which is appropriate
1392300	1397100	considering we're in the upside down tonight, uh, says, please give us some behind the scenes tea
1397100	1403900	from GamerX. Who got the most tail? Um, well, I can tell you that I touched a few butts.
1404700	1410620	I can tell you that Xtafer was the only one that went to GamerX East. So y'all draw your
1410620	1414300	own conclusions. Cause I know he went out there for the East coast one, which sadly,
1414300	1418140	you know, I really wanted to go and I wanted to support it, but it just, it wasn't enough notice
1418140	1423980	for me. And hopefully we'll get a good six monthly time next time. Um, let's see, uh,
1423980	1428220	one more here and then we'll get into gamer chat. Uh, Akuma JP says, I listened quite early
1428220	1433500	originally to survey what gamers want, but now it's become kind of like listening to my friends
1433500	1437260	talking about their weekends. Well, that's, that's awesome. We're glad you guys have stuck
1437260	1442300	around as long as you have. Thank you so much. Even recent listeners or longtime listeners
1442300	1448220	really, really, really appreciate it. So anyhow, let's get into some actual gaming talk, video
1448220	1453180	games, and how was your gaming week? Dark soccer. I know we just checked in with you a few days ago
1453180	1457260	during our special episode, which by the way, a lot of positive feedback on the taped episode
1457260	1461020	midweek. A lot of people were very surprised to get an OLR on Wednesday, even though I thought
1461020	1464700	we said we were going to do that, but still a lot of people very pleasantly surprised.
1466140	1470300	We'll have to do it more often. What do you guys say? Three shows a week from here on out.
1471020	1475260	Just kidding. Just kidding. I don't want to lose my goals. All right. Uh, dark soccer,
1475260	1478860	how is your gaming week? What video games you've been playing this week? Um, well, I did my
1478860	1483740	Overwatch, although I haven't played it yet. I just bought it cause I'm tired of being left out.
1483740	1488700	I was crying in my blanket fort that I've been hiding in since the last Tuesday. Um,
1488700	1493980	and I ran out of my box of wine, so I had to find something to play. Um, I've been playing well.
1494620	1501500	Um, and also, um, after you told me about the animal crossing update that I totally didn't
1501500	1510700	fucking know about, I am charging my DS. I've removed a happy home designer finally from my DS
1510700	1516380	and I'm not fucking playing Pokemon. Well, that's unfortunate. Yeah. Cause I'll be getting,
1516620	1519660	yeah, there you go. Thank you. I was like, cause I'll be getting into that in a minute.
1520860	1527180	That's okay. I've got new animal crossing to do and bless you, Isabel. Bless you, Isabel for
1527180	1531500	president. Cause the bitch hired somebody to clean all my weeds. That alone. Where can I get
1531500	1536540	an Isabel in real life? Right? Where can I just get my own village in real life? Like fuck all
1536540	1541820	y'all. This is Jamie country. Y'all can't come here. It's Jamie country. Remember in the early
1541820	1546380	days of OLR, we were going to have a Fort and I believe there was, I think it started because
1547660	1552060	I actually think ironically enough, that was a DDR angel thing because I remember on some of the
1552060	1557180	road trips we took, cause she lived out in North Bay. You had to drive by this place cause it was
1557180	1560780	kind of out in the, out in the country somewhere. You had to drive by this place that looked very
1560780	1565580	scary. And like this guy had it all boarded out and it was like, keep out. We always used to joke
1565580	1569500	that it was somebody's Fort that had basically seeded from the rest of the union. And I think
1569500	1575100	that's where the talk of the OLR Fort started. We could though do like what the, what was it
1575100	1581260	called? The dominion of sea land or something out, out off the coast of somewhere off England.
1582220	1589260	Where they took just like an old abandoned water structure and made it a country. We should do
1589260	1594940	that. If the Pope can do it, I can do it. If the Pope can do it, you can do it. All right.
1595500	1600300	Uh, I'm assuming that's it for her gaming week. So Loki, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1600300	1605100	Um, I did play a few things. I, I picked up watchdogs too. So I've been playing that a
1605100	1609100	little bit. Um, can't say if I like it more than watchdogs one because I purchased watchdogs one
1609100	1614700	when I first got my plays before still haven't played it. So that's fine. And then the watchdogs
1614700	1620380	too is okay. I like it. Um, the story's interesting. The, you basically like a group of
1620460	1626780	hackers. It's more of like, I don't know. It, the, some of the, like the parody stuff that
1626780	1630780	they're doing, like that, the steel, like the first few missions, I had to steal a car. It
1630780	1635500	was like kind of a Knight Rider kit type cars. So we had to steal that and that was pretty funny.
1635500	1640060	Um, there's one he had to take down almost like a Scientology type thing. That was kind of cool.
1640060	1644460	Um, I don't know. I'm enjoying it. I think it's somewhat interesting, I guess. Um,
1645420	1650220	play more cluster trucks still really hard. Um, I've been playing that a bit more. I downloaded
1650940	1655740	the demo for, um, track mania again because I want to try out the VR on that, but I still haven't
1655740	1661020	gotten a chance to do that yet. Um, I did play some more ingress this week a little bit. Um,
1662700	1672460	and let's see what else. Um, I think that's honestly it. I mean, I, I don't know.
1672460	1679260	I went back to working on it's time of the car again just because, and ironically enough,
1679260	1685900	as I mentioned before, you know, sitting on toilet, you know, you come up with ideas about
1685900	1690380	like how to fix things. And like one of the problems I didn't like about the original game
1690380	1696460	that I made, like I had this, this whole shooting stuff and just didn't driving and shooting and
1696460	1701340	aiming. It's just, it was too hard to do all at once and it wasn't very fun. But then I came up
1701340	1706380	with a control scheme that would work for that and I liked that a lot. So I'm going to kind of
1706380	1712220	go that route and go back to what I originally wanted to do is kind of like a more of a bigger
1712220	1718300	scope on that. The problem is, you know, once again being motivated, but I'm kind of getting
1718300	1722940	started and just kind of writing down some ideas right now and just, you know, fleshing out what
1722940	1726860	I want to do as far as engine wise goes and everything and rebuilding basically the whole
1726940	1733260	thing. So hopefully something because of that. So speaking of building and all that, I saw a game
1733260	1739500	that made me think of you, that would be a game that's totally up your alley. And actually I think
1739500	1743180	Dark Sakura to some extent would really get a kick out of this too. I haven't played this game yet,
1743180	1747740	but I just noticed it was on Twitch's like top games. I was on the Twitch like top games thing
1747740	1751340	and I saw this game and I was like, what the hell is this? It's a game called Planet Coaster.
1751340	1755340	Yeah. Have you heard of this? Yes I have. I've heard of it but haven't played it. Yeah. It just
1755340	1759660	seemed like when I looked at it, I was like, this shit's too complicated. Like the menus,
1759660	1762460	there's like a million things to do, but this looked like something that would be like right
1762460	1769180	up your alley, Loki. Yeah. I mean, it's like a theme park type game. Way better than, you know,
1769180	1774060	Roller Coaster Tycoon World or whatever than the last one is now. But yeah, it looks really cool.
1774060	1779420	I was watching some stuff from Ollie43 today. They were showing off some different maps that
1779420	1784060	people have made and stuff and it looks really cool. It's just, I don't know if I'd want to pick
1784060	1787660	it up right away. I mean, cause you know, I'm trying to stay away from games that are big time
1787660	1792780	sinks. Like I've been really wanting to pick up Skyrim, but I know how much of a time sink that's
1792780	1796620	going to be. And I really am trying to focus on actually working on stuff and even Watch Dogs.
1796620	1800300	I'm like, as a person, I'm like, damn it. Like, why did I pick this up? Cause now I'm not going
1800300	1804780	to be able to work on my like game stuff as often. I'm like, I got to play this since I did pick it
1804780	1810620	up. I am enjoying it a bit. I don't know. It's just, that's why I'm trying to stay away from
1810620	1819420	stuff. And then the final fantasy, you know, 15, I mean, I'm trying, I know there's going to be
1819420	1823820	somewhat of a drought after this. So, you know, I'm hoping that after these games come out, then
1823820	1827100	there'll be a while before I purchase anything else. Jamie, did you have something you were
1827100	1831020	trying to add there on Planet Coaster? No, it just was making me think about how people take
1831020	1835340	those games and like do like the death coaster. Well, my favorite. Yeah. Go on YouTube. And
1835340	1839260	there's some YouTubes where they'll yeah, they'll do the roller coaster tycoon where like the thing
1839260	1846060	goes off the tracks and then it goes in slow motion and plays Adele. And I haven't laughed
1846060	1850300	as hard in a very long time as like when I saw one of those videos. No, I mean like the actual
1850300	1858380	suicide coaster that was invented as a form of, um, what's the word I'm thinking of? Assisted
1858380	1863660	suicide. Euthanasia. Euthanasia. Thank you. It was meant to be a fun way for someone to die.
1864620	1870540	Because I'm not, I just like the way it's phrased. It's for real. It's for real because
1870540	1874940	when you hit like the first loop, you hit it at such a velocity that it makes you pass out.
1875660	1879660	And then like the next loop breaks your neck or something. Yes, but does it play Adele?
1880540	1887180	It can. If we can have Red Hot Chili Peppers on California Screamin', we can have Adele on
1887180	1891340	the death coaster. Okay. Fair enough. I'm going to find this now. You have to see this thing.
1891580	1895420	I don't want to see it. Not if somebody's writing it. That's creepy. They haven't built it. It's
1895420	1899820	all theoretical. Oh, okay. But it's supposed to be. But they built it in Planet Coaster.
1899820	1904620	People have built it in those games. Okay. I think that sounds like a whole bunch of fan wank.
1904620	1907500	Honestly, like anyone's going to build a death coaster like that. I mean,
1908300	1912460	you never know. You never know. I mean, that's what like Big Mountain Thunder was for.
1913340	1917740	Stoppy and Chad says assisted suicide coaster. I think that would be just strapping yourself to a
1917740	1921980	chair and throwing yourself off a building. It has a wiki. It's the euthanasia coaster.
1921980	1925580	Oh my God. This is too much. All right. Look, I want to talk about my week. Look,
1925580	1929180	you guys are getting way too sadistic. So I'm going to change the topic.
1929180	1931500	Let's just put America on the euthanasia coaster.
1932700	1938540	I'm changing the topic to Pokemon. Yay. Yay. Pokemon. Cute. Happy. Fuzzy wuzzy.
1939340	1944380	I have been playing the shit out of Pokemon Moon. Probably not as much as some people. In fact,
1944380	1951180	I know not as much as some people, Shane. But I'm a good like six hours in on Pokemon Moon.
1951180	1956540	I just got to the second island. I've cleared the first trial and then the first because they don't
1956540	1961740	have badges anymore. But I think it's measured. I think the equivalent is Z crystals because after
1961740	1966940	the trial and the Kahuna battle fights you do, you get like Z crystals. So I have two Z crystals
1966940	1972380	and I just went to the second island and that's where I'm at right now. And that took me a good
1972380	1977740	like six, six and a half hours of gameplay to get to. I'm also very slow. And I also spent a lot of
1977740	1983260	time because I was like, okay, this dude told me I could catch a fucking rock rough at this
1983260	1987740	particular location. Why isn't a rock rough fucking coming up? And just for some reason,
1987740	1991660	it took me that long. And A, I didn't know if it was in the cave or it was out back behind the
1991660	1997740	cave. And spoiler alert, it's out back behind the cave. So don't spend your time in the cave
1997740	2003340	looking for rock rough. But anyway, so yeah, I spent time on things like that. But I've been
2003340	2008300	having a good time with Pokemon Moon. I gotta say this. It's definitely one of the, it's had one of
2008300	2014540	the strongest impressions of most Pokemon games because I really feel like they've made so many
2014540	2020060	quality of life improvements. Like for example, the fact that the moves will tell you what they
2020060	2025260	do on the bottom screen when you hit the L and the A button, that's huge because I don't have to
2025260	2029820	remember anymore. What the fuck did this thing do? Or I have to look it up online. It turns out
2029820	2033100	it's the exact same thing as another move somewhere else. It's just a different type.
2033100	2038540	Like that is huge. The fact that you will get told what moves are effective and super effective and
2038540	2044460	not effective against a monster, as long as you've fought that Pokemon at least once,
2044460	2048780	then the second time and beyond, it'll tell you like it'll have the built-in strength and
2048780	2053180	weakness chart, which I know some of you might think is cheating, but at the same time, how many
2053180	2058460	people either A, had that chart committed to memory, or B, would bring it up when they needed
2058460	2064540	it, like me. So I think it's just a convenience that's built into the game finally. I love that
2064540	2068940	they replaced the bikes with rideable Pokemon because the bike thing, especially when there's
2068940	2072940	multiple bikes, just it was a pain in the ass. You had to go back to trade your bike, blah, blah, blah.
2073500	2078780	I like the ride rideable Pokemon thing instead. So the only thing I don't like so far, here's the
2078780	2084460	thing I don't like. I do not like how the little shits can call for help. That is a really annoying
2084460	2088940	mechanic because it feels like there's nothing you can do to prevent it. Granted, maybe I'm not far
2088940	2093820	enough in the game yet. Maybe there's a move where one of your Pokemon can like sprinkle the
2093820	2098700	battlefield in fog or something so that that Pokemon cannot call for help. But it seems a
2098700	2103260	little unfair because when the Pokemon calls for help, it does not take up that Pokemon's move for
2103260	2108620	the turn. It's something that they can do at the very, very, very end of the turn. And then so it
2109500	2114300	another Pokemon might show up. So suddenly you're in a two on one battle. Now, granted, I know the
2114300	2119660	Pokemon X and Y had those five on one battles, but at least you kind of knew that from the start.
2119660	2123820	And generally the levels were like way lower and that whole sort of thing. So I'm, I got to say,
2123820	2127980	I'm not a big fan of the call for help thing right now, because it just seems a little bit like
2127980	2131740	the deck is stacked against you in those situations. I just don't like being able to be
2131740	2140220	better prepared for that. And I wish, or I should just say, I feel like this kind of encourages the
2140220	2145740	use of items more than in prior Pokemon games, which maybe isn't such a bad thing. Like maybe
2145740	2150780	that's the way the game kind of forces you to up it up, up it up a little bit. But I don't know,
2150780	2155660	I just, I just not a big fan of that because again, I just feel like it's so hit and miss
2155660	2159340	when the Pokemon is going to do it, if it's successful and then there's nothing you really
2159340	2165340	do to stop it. So that's when you need to start packing some heat, like a gun. Exactly. It's like,
2165340	2170460	fuck you other Pokemon. Yeah. I wish your trainer is in the battle with you now. I wish you could
2170460	2174940	carry a gun, but you can't or a big stick. Yeah, I know he can't do any of that, but you can use a
2174940	2180780	Z move. These really ridiculously over the top animation that are super moves. There's really,
2180780	2184780	it's it's to replace the mega stones and it's right. I'm just going to use the Z stick and
2184780	2192540	bash that fucking Pokemon in the head. Uh, uh, let's see, uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
2192540	2198700	William murder face says no more HM slaves. Yay. Yes, that is true. They got rid of all that crap.
2198700	2203980	Thank God. That was so stupid. How you'd have to have like a zigzag zoom or something that is only
2203980	2210780	there to know cut and surf and like all the things you need to move around. Now, thanks to the
2210780	2215980	rideable Pokemon. It's all built into that system, depending on what Pokemon you're writing is what,
2215980	2223740	uh, like former HM you will have. They still have the TMs where you can teach a move like fault
2223740	2228700	swipe, you know, which is kind of an essential thing for catching Pokemon. Although hot tip,
2229500	2235820	if you don't forget, if you just got Pokemon moon, save your gay or son, of course, save your game,
2235820	2240540	quit out to the title screen, check the internet right now, because there's a Munchlax.
2240540	2246940	It's the preform of Snorlax. Uh, there's a Munchlax available, uh, right now on the internet that will
2246940	2252220	get added to your inventory. And the Munchlax has a move that will reduce the hit points to one
2252220	2256780	without killing it that you can actually get before you even get fault swipe. So just a little pro tip
2256780	2261500	if you didn't realize that giveaway was going on. So, so yes, I've been spending time with Pokemon
2261500	2266140	moon. And, uh, I think it's great. I'm sure there's a lot of people that are like, well,
2266140	2271020	Rob, I've missed, you know, five generations worth of Pokemon games. Am I going to get into
2271020	2275100	some Pokemon sun and moon? And obviously I would say, yes, you don't have to play the
2275100	2280060	other adventures. They don't have any real continuity between them. I would say the only
2280060	2286620	generation that this game has any sort of ties to well, I take that back. I take that back because
2286620	2292300	a there are Pokemon from all the generations that show up and B there are some references
2292300	2297420	like Shane was telling me that one of the gym leaders from generation five shows up in this
2297420	2301180	game. So there are some, but like, they're not things that are going to like change the game.
2301180	2305740	It's more like fan service-y things, but yes, red and blue, the original Pokemon games,
2305740	2311420	which are kind of all the rage again because of Pokemon go in a way or were over the summer. Um,
2311420	2316060	I think are the ones that tie in the most to this game because you've all heard about the Alolan
2316060	2320940	forms. So it's like you have these generation one Pokemon sort of re-imagined that show up
2320940	2325900	everywhere. So that's kind of cool. And then yeah, the characters red and blue show up and, uh, yeah.
2325900	2329580	So there's just, there's some cool little references, but again, like even if you've never
2329580	2334620	played a Pokemon game in your life, I don't think that you're going to miss anything or, or something
2334620	2342380	like that by, um, by just jumping right into this. Again, the games don't have that much continuity.
2342380	2346940	So, so yeah, that's, that's that I've been playing a lot of that. I was playing Overwatch
2346940	2350780	quite a bit because of the free weekend that was going on on PlayStation four. In fact,
2350780	2354940	I ended up just buying the damn game on PlayStation four because it's 35 bucks. A lot of
2354940	2360700	places right now. I think it's online is 35 bucks. Amazon is 35 bucks. Uh, the black Friday sales are
2360700	2365420	coming up. It's going to be 35 bucks in a lot of those places. So, um, yeah, I just, I bought a
2365420	2369100	copy of Overwatch on PlayStation four so I can play with my friends there. So yes, now I have
2369100	2375420	that game in two different places, but whatever. Um, I guess if I bought Mass Effect three on
2375420	2380620	multiple consoles, I can buy that too, which reminds me one other game I played this week.
2380620	2387180	I played Mass Effect three on Xbox one, thanks to the backwards compatibility. Just remember,
2387180	2392460	you have to download the entire game once you put the disc in, and then you're going to have to go
2392460	2398300	back and download all the DLC, including the online pass, if you want to play multiplayer.
2398300	2402460	So just be ready for all those downloads. That's why it took me about a week to finally play Mass
2402460	2407820	Effect three on Xbox one, but I did it and it looks great. And I'm so, so, so ready for
2407820	2414060	Andromeda and especially the multiplayer. Woo. All right. That's it for my game a week. That's
2414060	2418380	all I'm going to mention. So let's move on. Uh, special announcements. I don't really have a lot
2418380	2423900	tonight. We'll be back next Sunday. Uh, we probably, we're, we're going to have something
2423900	2428700	going on during the holidays. That's the only thing coming up because, uh, Christmas and new
2428700	2435020	year, both fall on Sundays this year. And then January 8th, I happen to be at magfest, which I'll
2435020	2438620	see you guys there. If you're going to magfest 2017, I finally bought my flight just this past
2438620	2442780	week. So, uh, definitely, definitely going to magfest. Very excited to check that out.
2442780	2449580	Uh, so see you guys there. Um, so there's that, uh, otherwise, um, yeah, we'll be here
2450220	2455260	next week, week after that dark soccer will be back with us full time sooner rather than later,
2455260	2460300	which is great. Uh, and of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and Facebook,
2460300	2464940	facebook.com slash orange launch radio, all the great places to follow us on social media.
2464940	2471340	Let's discuss some news with our chatters. What's going on on this 666 week of our show Loki?
2471340	2478300	Well, of course it's gotta be more switch rumors. And so this kind of like obvious duh
2478300	2482380	is saying basically that the Nintendo switch is going to be supposed to be getting a,
2482380	2488060	a special version of, uh, Pokemon sun and moon called Pokemon stars. I think of like
2488060	2493260	kind of one of the combined games that they do. Um, and that's supposed to be in development and
2493260	2498300	I guess we'll launch in 2017. The other rumor I saw, which I was trying to find links to earlier,
2498300	2505420	but couldn't find it was, uh, that Zelda's delayed to later in 2017. Oh, wouldn't that be
2505420	2508940	in that? And here's the other thing that they're going to be launching with two Mario games.
2508940	2512300	One is going to be a traditional Mario game. One is supposed to be a crossover with
2512300	2520540	rabbits from Ubisoft. So like Mario RPG with rabbits, which is wait, Mario RPG, Mario RPG.
2520540	2526780	Oh, samples if that's the case. Well, but Mario RPG would not, I mean the original Mario RPG was
2526780	2531420	a square game, so there's going to be a lot that changes if suddenly Ubisoft's developing it.
2531420	2536700	Right. And I thought the rabbit was just kind of done. Like, I don't know. I'm just kind of
2536700	2541500	tired of them. I'd rather it be another square Enix, Mario RPG. I'd be all over that. But
2541500	2544860	that's still an interesting partnership if that pans out to be, those are the other two,
2544860	2548940	but yeah, it's something, I mean, this makes perfect sense. I mean, if you're trying to sell
2548940	2553500	a console and you're going to launch Pokemon on it, yeah, why not? Well, it's in line with
2553500	2557900	other rumors. We've heard previously about the fact that there is a Pokemon game on the switch.
2558540	2565660	And I, although Pokemon stars sounds a little fan-ish, you know, like if...
2565660	2570540	It'd probably be like Pokemon Dawn or something like weird like that, you know.
2570540	2574060	I almost thought you said Pokemon DONG is what I thought you said right there.
2574060	2576940	Pokemon DONG, have to touch them all.
2578780	2582940	By the way, there is a mode in the new Pokemon games where you pet your Pokemon and you cure
2582940	2587740	them of your status afflictions. So when you guys say Pokedong, my mind goes there
2587740	2595340	because I'm sick. I'm a sick person. But anyway, I think that's actually in the
2595340	2600780	name of the legendary Pokemon that's hidden on the hidden island is DONG and anus.
2603020	2608540	Anyway, I would love to have a Pokemon game that's playable on the television.
2609340	2613340	And I'm not talking about the whole like Game Boy Advance on the GameCube and all that stuff.
2613340	2618220	I'm talking about like the, you know, one thing that really struck me about Pokemon
2618220	2621820	Moon in the opening was that it's kind of a cinematic style opening.
2621820	2625500	Well, that is the kind of, I mean, the 3DS one looks pretty nice. You know,
2625500	2629020	Sun and Moon looks really nice. But like, can you imagine like when it's actually just
2629660	2634300	strictly the Switch? I mean, they may still do 3DS because the numbers will be out there.
2634300	2638940	But like, you know, you're going to have a specific Switch version that will be even much
2638940	2645260	nicer because it's been a long time since they had a console Pokemon game. I mean, God, have they?
2645260	2649980	I don't think they've ever, not a mainline Pokemon game. There's been plenty of like
2649980	2654940	Pokemon Stadium and, you know, there's been other like spinoff Pokemon games, Pokemon Snap,
2655500	2662060	right? But there has not been a true mainline Pokemon game created for a television console.
2662060	2666860	The only way to do it is with Super Game Boy or one of those types of things. That's really the
2666860	2672940	only way to do it. Which by that time, you know, the technology is so aged and the handheld by the
2672940	2676860	time the Super Game Boy is out, like you feel like you're just playing a handheld game on your TV.
2676860	2681980	You know what I mean? And the graphics were a real step back from where they are now. But I think,
2681980	2686540	you know, something like Pokemon Sun and Moon is going to look really good on a television.
2686540	2689660	So that, I think, I think that'd be really cool. I hope, I hope it is true.
2690220	2694780	Yeah. It would be another way to push that Pokemon bank as well, because you know,
2694780	2697020	that's the only way you're going to be able to get your Pokemon from the
2697580	2702060	3DS games is through that Pokemon bank. I don't know. I'm interested to see what
2702060	2710060	they say in January, I guess. Same, same. Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2710060	2715500	DarkTetsuya says, I was hoping it was called Pokemon Eclipse, you know, Sun and Moon.
2716380	2724620	And JD in chat says, Sun, Moon, star fits with tarot cards. Oh, I didn't. Okay. So maybe.
2724620	2727260	So when are we going to have the high priestess and the magician?
2728380	2731740	Maybe, maybe they're gym leaders or excuse me, trial, trial captains.
2732460	2737260	Since we, we mixed up the formula a little bit and anything is possible though in Pokemon stars,
2737260	2743340	that's for sure. All right. Loki, would you check out Pokemon stars on the switch?
2743340	2747020	No, I'm not a Pokemon fan. You wouldn't, you wouldn't give this one a try?
2747020	2751820	I'm just not that interested, not enough to buy the game. I'd check a demo maybe, but I'm just,
2751820	2755580	I never got into Pokemon. And unfortunately, I mean, the most I've gotten in the Pokemon
2755580	2760060	was with Pokemon Go and I'm really not into that anymore. Even with the daily bonuses,
2760060	2764540	it's just, it's so, there's no game there and it's really boring now. It's, I just,
2764540	2769740	there's no point to it. Yeah, Niantic hasn't amped that game up as fast as I was really hoping. And
2769740	2773980	I'm not just talking about like second generations, but like the, the stuff that people really want,
2773980	2779100	like trading and battling, like that stuff really needs to happen by the end of the year.
2779100	2784940	There's just like the gym thing is stupid. There's no point to it. And that's, that's kind of the
2784940	2790700	main aside from like collecting Pokemon. But even then once you have them all, it's kind of nothing
2790700	2796380	left to do. Yeah. Well, anyhow, of course, now that the news, the Nintendo switch is out there
2796380	2801660	and it's everywhere, this leads to people trying to take advantage of the hype machine for something
2801660	2806700	like this for their own personal gain. There's some stuff that's been spreading around the
2806700	2811900	internet, places like Facebook, cause you know, I've never heard of fake things spreading on
2811900	2819900	Facebook before. But anyway, apparently there is a fake Nintendo switch beta registration program,
2819900	2824700	and you put in your email and you get your invitation code. But of course, if it sounds
2824700	2832300	too good to be true, it probably is. In fact, some investigative sorts went and put in like
2832300	2839020	a fake email in there and got an email that said, prepare for revolution. Congratulations. That's
2839020	2844540	not a typo. You are eligible to join the Nintendo switch beta program. You are chosen, which means
2844540	2848540	you can get into the Nintendo switch beta. You will receive the Nintendo switch beta hardware,
2848540	2854860	which includes one system, one docking station, two switch controller, left and right, HDMI cable,
2854860	2860220	one power adapter, as well as instruction booklet. Below you will find a code to redeem. Please note
2860220	2865100	this code is specific for your account. So don't share this with anyone. And then of course the
2865100	2870140	code is just a bunch of garbage. And that's as far as people have taken it. We don't know how
2870140	2874300	far the scam goes, but you've basically given your email to somebody that knows you will fall for
2874300	2880380	easy things. So just a reminder, and I know most of you guys know this, but just remember
2880380	2886220	if something is too good to be true, it probably is. If there were to be some weird Nintendo switch
2886220	2892860	beta program, and let me tell you, there won't be. When has Nintendo ever baited hardware like that?
2892860	2898940	When have they needed to? They don't need to. You know how Nintendo betas this stuff?
2898940	2905100	By only releasing five of them per store when it comes out. That's the beta test. The beta test is
2905100	2910700	will you be lucky enough to pre-order this so you can get one day one. There will not be a beta test
2910700	2915900	so don't fall for it. Please like at least understand now that Nintendo has been releasing
2915900	2923340	consoles that have been short have shortages since 2007. By now they would have fucking understood
2923340	2927740	you know supply and demand for their stupid consoles. They're doing it on purpose now to
2927740	2932460	drive up demand. It is on purpose. It's not oh we didn't under, we didn't anticipate it.
2932460	2936700	Bullshit. It is fucking to drive up demand. You can't be that ignorant for that long.
2936700	2945100	So heads up, the smarter scammer, just an FYI, first off you're a scammer that's listening to
2945100	2949100	this show. Go fuck yourself and turn it off. The show isn't for you. We do this show for free.
2949100	2955020	I don't do this show for free for people to be assholes. But if a scammer out there wanted to
2955020	2962140	be smarter about it they would do a program for a early pre-order or be the first to pre-order
2962140	2967020	because everybody knows that's the shit that you really need to get in on because of what you just
2967020	2971740	said. And that's where the massive rush is going to be is who can get their pre-orders in fast
2971740	2976540	enough for one of these Nintendo switches. Because it's going to be you versus the um
2977340	2981580	people that resell them for a higher value. Scalpers. It's going to be you versus the scalpers.
2982140	2986220	Well you know how they could avoid that is releasing an adequate supply of the fucking
2986220	2993980	system. I know it's such it's such a wild concept but yes that's what you fucking need to do.
2993980	2998860	If please now if there happens to be gaming journalists that listen to this show I know
2998860	3003020	there's a couple of you out there if any of you happen to be going to the Nintendo event that
3003020	3009420	they're going to have in January you need to ask Nintendo what are they going to be doing to ensure
3009500	3015180	that there's enough stock on launch day. Because I want that question asked sooner rather than later.
3015180	3020060	I want Nintendo on the hot spot for that because I want to see what their answer is. Are they going
3020060	3024060	to give a legit answer or are they going to say something like oh well you know we're really
3024060	3029180	trying to work with our suppliers to ensure that there's enough to meet the demand but you know
3029180	3033900	if there's some fucking cold water answer they're not going to do it because it's for them all the
3033900	3038620	like news of people lining up for that console stuff makes it seem like it's you know the got
3038620	3043020	to have thing if you see it sitting on store shelves and people are like well maybe they don't
3043020	3049100	want it you know it's stupid but like you know even with the little NES mini I mean there's
3049100	3054940	hardly any hardware in there and they still couldn't fucking pull that out. Now here's here's
3054940	3060380	the the most important thing and I want us I want us all to make a pact all right listeners you guys
3060380	3063820	us here in studio I want everybody to put their hand in the center because they're going to make
3063820	3068940	a pact and now Jamie is going to slice uh put a slice with her knife and everybody's finger so
3068940	3077340	this is a blood patch okay this is a blood pact do not under any circumstances buy a switch from
3077340	3083500	a scalper we all agreed on that do not fucking support scalpers if you don't get the system day
3083500	3087900	one then you didn't get the system day one and you'll just have to wait until Nintendo decides
3087900	3094300	to fix the artificial shortages do not support scalpers under any circumstances
3095100	3101020	or Jamie will not give your back your blood is this understood well I wasn't gonna give it back
3101020	3108860	anyway uh vid power chat says blood pact how fitting for episode 666 orange right says suicide
3108860	3114780	coasters blood packs yep it's 666 all right I'm glad we didn't disappoint tonight but don't you
3114780	3122780	disappoint me by supporting a scalper understand don't you disappoint rob or next time Jamie's
3122780	3126940	taken off the whole finger and then you're not going to be able to use that switch understand
3127660	3134380	I'll take off your your little finger yakuza style all right I'll wear them on a chain not really
3135020	3139020	I'll just probably like feed them to a shark or something because feeding fingers to sharks is
3139020	3144700	cool uh jd and chat says I didn't realize we were playing trivia murder party oh just you wait
3144700	3151100	the party's just getting started um let's see uh Maya asks has switch been confirmed to be region
3151100	3156780	free yet uh nothing has been yes very little that's been confirmed at all pretty much if it
3156780	3161900	wasn't in that trailer it's not confirmed uh there's rumors and we can bring out our wheel
3161900	3167980	of plausibility uh however we don't know until January at this point the only rumors I care about
3167980	3174380	is the album did you happen to see the youtube streamer or twitch streamer I think that was
3174380	3179820	trolling everybody with oh look I've got a switch prototype and it was 3d printed sure buddy sure
3179820	3184860	well he three printed one it looked pretty cool oh I saw this stuff on twitter and stuff and
3184860	3189660	everybody that was calling him out on his bullshit and you know hey guess what that guy probably got
3189660	3196460	how many more subs through that whole fucking fakity stuff but um so so he did yeah he has a
3196460	3201100	how-to video on how he did and everything he you know messed up on the font but you know he was
3201180	3206620	trying to get it out of that in a certain amount of time so and how many people fell for that if
3206620	3211420	you're subbed to that guy you should go unsubscribe because you're just supporting that stuff just
3211420	3217180	saying anyway uh let's see uh stop he and chat says the lettering on the buttons look like it
3217180	3225180	was taken off a cereal box uh and ssj100 matt says don't support scalpers or you will never
3225180	3229580	get to hear halo be the classic game of the week well you'll never get to hear that anyway
3230220	3236060	because it's not happening all right what is happening another news story dar sagra

3461180	3465740	it has well good thing there's that whole you know what it'll be like what the first level
3465740	3470540	free and then buy the rest that'll be share where i'm not a huge fan of the new super mario brothers
3470540	3474780	art style that's like my least favorite out of all the like stuff that they have in mario maker
3475420	3481580	i like the older stuff yeah i kind of like stupid and cartoony i'm sorry i like doing the old stuff
3481580	3487340	too especially a mario maker but i i certainly don't dislike the new uh supervisor it could be
3487340	3493260	so much better like look at like wario wears um shake it or whatever or wario uh land shake it
3493260	3497900	or something like that where it's all hand-drawn cell stuff like that would be fucking fantastic
3497900	3503180	let's get a hand drawn you know so kind of the look a lot of the paper mario goes for
3503980	3509820	sort of i mean a little less like papery but like i don't know even super paper mario is pretty
3509820	3515980	awesome but i just don't like that new super mario brothers art style all right fair enough everybody
3515980	3521420	has an opinion all right well uh moving on to a different large company and something that's
3521420	3526860	been developing with them this week uh ea you know ea obviously a big maker of video games lots
3526860	3532540	of big stuff out there and uh right now they're really trying to um make some rules when it comes
3532540	3540220	to streaming games and youtube channels uh they want their partner streamers and youtubers to
3540220	3546620	disclose that they're paid for sponsorships it's a new program that's called supported by ea and
3546620	3553260	they are requiring that folks use logos that very clearly say supported by ea to make things clear
3553260	3561260	when something is uh being supported by ea um so uh yeah anytime i guess they get like what travel
3561260	3566460	just like they get traveled to an event or something that's fantastic yeah no i i think it
3566460	3570780	is good i'm not like trying to shade or anything like that i do think it's uh it's really good i
3570780	3575340	think a lot of this like first came out of germany or something like that well also i mean it's it's
3575340	3579820	just um building on top of what existing laws they have in place already i mean you have to
3579900	3584540	disclose that by law but normally it's within like the comments and stuff and i think you're supposed
3584540	3589580	to disclose it also maybe in your video but they have very specific rules and this is you know nice
3589580	3595900	to see support behind that yeah and uh wb games got in trouble for this a while ago if i'm not
3595900	3601260	mistaken because the whole uh shadow of mordor thing that they had actually paid influencers
3601260	3606700	money to do positive videos about the game and apparently the federal trade commission got in
3606700	3613740	and said uh there's not proper disclosure here so this is probably a step for ea to prevent that
3613740	3619260	same thing happening by basically saying hey if we gave you any perks you need to make that clear
3619260	3627420	so that the warner brothers thing doesn't end up happening to us as well so uh yeah i i i agree
3627420	3631740	that that's a good thing and that whole kind of type of transparency thing uh i think it's good
3631740	3636700	to know i think it would be interesting too um the people that don't have that sponsorship and
3636700	3641660	that sort of thing like you know what what do they say and what do they end up doing so well in the
3641660	3649980	case of wb um the ones that didn't basically agree to those terms they got blacklisted from getting
3649980	3655500	a copy of the game unless they were going to do one of those positive uh wow you know a positive
3655500	3660780	spin things they get or they'd get a code later or something like that yeah that's that is shady
3660780	3664620	and that shit needs to stop like even like bethesda bethesda is guilty of this too where
3664620	3670620	now they're doing it um where they're not providing review copies until after the product
3670620	3675340	comes out right right so i mean even though bethesda i'm kind of on the fence with that
3675340	3679420	though there's a part of me that's kind of like in a way especially in the environment we live
3679420	3683020	in now where everybody's a critic because of twitter and facebook and stuff like that
3683020	3689740	like in a way i kind of i kind of get it like but at the same time i also understand it can
3689740	3694460	be a little shady because they encourage all these people to pre-order and especially with
3694460	3698860	a lot of bethesda games they can be very buggy when they come out and so by not having the copies
3698860	3703420	out there in advance you don't know what the bugs are or if the game you know is even playable or
3703420	3709020	some audio issues if you're on like xbox one but i think people kind of have to challenge themselves
3709020	3715260	do they need to have the game day one if there's honest concern about these sorts of risks
3715260	3721660	hmm it's tricky subject i don't know what do you think about the whole fact that bethesda doesn't
3721660	3726140	doesn't give out the codes anymore are you kind of for that or eh well a lot of offensive games
3726140	3730140	i kind of already made a decision if i'm going to purchase it or not beforehand and you know
3730140	3734380	them i kind of have an idea of what the quality would be like if it was ubisoft doing that
3735180	3741260	thing yeah i'd be very concerned by that because they're all over the place so i mean that's
3742060	3747580	i guess bethesda should be held to the same level of you know scrutiny i don't know with
3747580	3752620	skyrim it remastered it wasn't such a big deal because it's basically the the game's already
3752620	3757420	been out there for a while i mean you know i know their games are buggy in an entertaining way of
3757420	3762540	course but like if there's something really bad about it like the whole audio issue where they
3762540	3768140	like you know compressed to hell on you know two of the three platforms that's kind of a bad thing
3768780	3774540	i guess well but then you have something like doom which a lot of people would assumed would be bad
3774540	3780460	because yeah a lot of those remakes aren't so hot the beta and i don't think they really did codes
3780460	3784780	in advance either for that well it turns out doom's probably one of the better games that's
3784780	3789660	been released this year well that's an excuse so that's it i know i think that just empowered
3789660	3795020	bethesda to do this is what that whole thing has taught them oh well there's a lot of companies
3795020	3801180	that get empowered by things that they think are great ideas ea and their stupid online pass or
3801180	3806300	all this like crappy dlc like especially in overwatch is equally the blame for this you know
3807100	3813180	this trend now where these pay to you know these games that have microtransactions in them you know
3813180	3819340	this loot crate bullshit that is just some terrible game practice right there that it's
3819340	3824780	like okay i paid sixty dollars or thirty forty whatever paid an amount of money for this and
3826380	3831820	for what this random lucha oh it's optional but you're it's it's presented to you all the time
3831820	3835900	it pressures you into a started that to be fair with mass effect of all things is really the
3835900	3838860	first place i remember seeing that i'm sure it was in another game it's probably been a
3839740	3845580	valve let's blame valve counter strike go um there's you know even payday two i know has
3845580	3849420	something like that but with as much as i love mass effect and i have it on all those consoles
3849420	3857100	and everything never once did i buy a box never once it's just i don't know it's even like hall
3857100	3862540	of duty now is doing it's like come on well activision and blizzard i mean i guess same
3862540	3868780	company now or same ish companies so i'm not surprised i don't know uh rage nator in chat
3868780	3873820	says i very rarely get games on day one anymore hell i can count on one hand how many steam games
3873820	3879100	i've pre-ordered i only pre-ordered due to bonuses free dlc ost's are an extra game well
3879100	3885100	that's those bonuses are how they get you sometimes i'll tell you all right anyhow uh let's
3885100	3890060	move on and uh dark soccer what do you have for us before we get to the classic game of the week
3890060	3896140	well i'm sure everybody knows by now that um we've had a big delay with the new persona game
3897020	3903660	boo hoo there's a lot of salty people about that yes boo hoo well are you saying that a triple a
3903660	3913180	game got delayed in 2016 or now 2017 and no one is surprised get out get out out look i i realize
3913180	3919420	persona has their fans big time and they're they're salty about this but welcome welcome
3919420	3927980	to modern gaming i mean is there a triple-a game that hasn't been delayed lately because
3927980	3932780	i'm not ones that didn't look like shared i have like shitty problems i'm struggling to think of
3932780	3939020	one in the moment anyway sorry well well here's something to make everybody happy the greatest
3939020	3944860	monster series of all time digimon is coming out with digimon world next order and it's going to
3944860	3951820	be released on time so far um basically you there's a big digimon that's released out in
3951820	3957980	the world and you have to go take care of it you're the only one it's up to us and uh
3958940	3963500	yeah i mean it's just more digimon world i mean you remember the original digimon world that came
3963500	3970460	out on playstation one um when they release uh next order it's going to have a soundtrack for it
3970460	3975740	um for a pre-order and you actually get a soundtrack for the original digimon world for
3975740	3982860	your pre-order and you get an item that lets you evolve your uh partner digimon into a megamon
3983020	3991660	who is like badass so it will be out in europe on january 27th and in north america on january 31st
3993260	3997740	all right uh loki what do you have for us all right so this is kind of cool um
3997740	4003820	now not only a game that i'm interested in but nba 2k17 they're doing something interesting with
4003820	4011420	some connectivity with fitbit so there's a part of the nba 2k series where you have this my player
4011420	4015900	is basically your own you know basketball player that you're kind of taking through these leagues
4015900	4021500	and everything and creating you know your own custom player basically um what they're doing
4021500	4027260	fitbit though is if you register your fitbit in the game you can actually sync the data um from
4027260	4034860	it and if you've reached 10 000 steps within the last day you get a plus five to all your attributes
4034860	4041260	for the next five games so it's kind of a bonus for doing exercise which i think is pretty cool
4041420	4048540	that's neat yeah so that's something that they're going to be starting on november 25th yeah there's
4048540	4052940	um you know i kind of like games that will kind of incentivize the whole fitness sort of thing i mean
4052940	4058940	even the nintendo 3ds kind of has this built in i think it's kind of not super used as well as it
4058940	4062780	could be but it gives you the coins you get for walking around i mean you have to have the big
4062780	4067740	bulky 3ds in your pocket but you still get the coins for walking around and doing stuff and then
4067740	4075340	you can use those coins in a lot of the like internal games and some of the uh external games
4075340	4079260	use those as well like i want to say the final fantasy explorers was last game i remember that
4079260	4084860	actually used those coins for stuff so um yeah i like that i like the whole like incentivizing
4084860	4089740	fitness sort of thing and it's optional right you don't have to do it you want to be lazy you can
4090540	4097180	but it's just something to add a little extra which is nice speaking of adding
4097260	4103500	something a little extra there is a brand new video game out there that contains fully rendered
4103500	4112300	penises and vaginas that's right not only do we have violence on episode 666 but we have nudity
4112300	4118140	so grand theft auto 5 nope it's well something that some may say was inspired by the grand
4118140	4126140	theft auto series it is watch dogs 2 that's right watch dogs 2 contains penises and vaginas now not
4126140	4131100	that they i don't believe they're like typically on display but they're just they're things that
4131100	4137500	are rendered there um some there's actually some like naturalists in the game that are fully
4137500	4141340	oh of course because it's san francisco of course so of course there's naturalists out there even
4141340	4147660	though i think at some point the city did finally ban it but like not in certain places or certain
4147660	4153500	times type of thing like there's a bunch of rules around it so anyway but anyway my point is if you
4153500	4161180	want to see a really low res low quality not that great penis or vagina you can see it inside uh
4161180	4168860	watch dogs 2 uh now apparently actually it went so far as to somebody actually uh like a character
4168860	4174060	i guess you could kind of just see the certain way but you could see you could see her vagine on full
4174060	4180380	display in the game and uh somebody actually used the share feature to share this to their page
4180380	4184140	because that's what you do on playstation 4 right you share your accomplishments so somebody was
4184140	4191900	like hey i found this and posted it to their uh ps4 share wall and they got a temp ban by sony
4192620	4198220	for posting nudity using the share feature i'm sorry that's in the game yes which left a lot
4198220	4205180	of people scratching their head but sony this is a game that you approved and is on your platform
4205180	4209980	and this person did not do any lead hacks or anything it just happened that the you know
4210220	4215660	it just showed oh hello there so i thought i'd share it with my friends um now after all the
4215660	4220380	you know twitter and the the noise that went in behind this because a lot of people you know i
4220380	4225020	can't imagine why a story like this got reported on everywhere but it did and so the guy got the
4225020	4230860	ban reversed obviously and ubisoft has come out since and said uh yeah we're gonna be patching
4230860	4237980	that out like oh well they're gonna be patching that one one specific npc to have clothing but
4237980	4245660	not all of them oh interesting so that one specific npc they said was the issue huh all
4245660	4251660	right apparently uh let's see uh in chat over at live dot vog network dot com tiger claw says
4251660	4257980	that's not the only game with penises there's a game on steam called genital jousting i have
4258620	4264140	yes i haven't seen that game but i heard it got banned from twitch this week because twitch
4264140	4270220	doesn't like i can imagine twitch does not like the vagine or the oh yeah that's or any of that
4270220	4274380	so basically general jousting i'm not really sure the whole gameplay part because i did watch
4274380	4278860	i've seen trailers for it and i watched uh jim sterling play it and he wasn't really sure of
4278860	4283820	what the actual what you're supposed to do in the game this is basically you've got these dicks
4283820	4289420	and these dicks have an asshole in between their testicles and so it's all about sticking your dick
4289420	4295340	into another asshole and yeah and so it's that and you can dress up your dicks and then like
4295340	4302300	after each round or whatever like it comes and like it's just it's ridiculous like you seriously
4302300	4308860	should watch the trailer if you haven't watched it yet just to get an idea this is gonna be great
4308860	4313980	for a podcast jamie are you doing this with me you know watch over here don't blink the consent
4313980	4324540	oops i like how you can apparently dress up
4334700	4342220	no um i'm not looking at it anymore this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen in my entire
4342220	4345420	fucking life and i've seen a lot of his own existence
4350780	4352140	i've seen a lot in my life
4365900	4366940	that's not okay
4372220	4379740	what the fuck is this called genital jousting this is why we can't have nice things
4381420	4387980	this is why gamers have a reputation i'm not looking anymore i can't it's too bad that that
4387980	4393900	hasn't hit the mainstream news outlets you know yet they can't show it on tv so that's not on
4393900	4401180	console and then they definitely can't show that on tv so pc pc is no man's land so yeah maya and
4401180	4405580	chat over at live.vongnetwork.com says these noises are vivid yeah you guys didn't even have
4405580	4411660	to see and be thankful in a way it was full of splorch noise i mean like yes the noises tell you
4411660	4418860	all you need to know it was it was disgusting i should show that to my mother i don't understand
4418860	4423500	where the dash hounds have anything to do with it they're wiener dogs but like do you shove the
4423500	4430620	wiener dog into someone's eyes no no no not okay not okay shut it red card penalty
4431260	4434300	bite the dicks i mean what i don't understand where they play there
4436220	4440140	and then they won fuck the planet so that was interesting anyway i don't know how that started
4440140	4447420	with watchdogs 2 and ended up with that because they're dicks anyway oh by the way uh apparently
4447420	4453260	uh part of multiplayer in watchdogs 2 also got stripped out the seamless multiplayer currently
4453260	4459100	inaccessible it was supposed to be fixed by launch but it wasn't so they're working on it
4459980	4463660	please look forward to it coming soon the features that we advertised
4465660	4471820	and i know that we haven't talked about how about that assassin's creed remaster oh my god all i see
4471820	4476860	were those pictures on twitter and i was like what did they remaster did they get did they get that
4476860	4482780	woman who retouched the photo of jesus to do the remaster like what in the world that guy looked
4482780	4490140	like alissa edwards it's like that's not that that's not like someone draw that name as paint
4490140	4495820	i mean i i don't know i don't even know like if you're gonna remaster the game you're supposed
4495820	4499580	to and this this goes for the silent hill remasters that happen a while the what the two
4499580	4504460	and three uh or is it three and four it was two and three right where they did the whole new voice
4504460	4509980	cap it wasn't that good no one that could anyway let's take a trip down memory lane shall we
4509980	4516300	let's go back to a time when there was no patches if your game sucked when it launched then it
4516300	4521980	sucked forever it's the classic game of the week and dark soccer is back doesn't need radio magic
4521980	4529260	or anything she's here dark soccer with this being episode 666 i know you picked a good one i did so
4529260	4537020	what is the classic game of the week i on purpose kind of on purpose i picked it on purpose but i
4537020	4542060	kind of not on purpose saved it but i figured this is a perfect time good play the music rob
4542780	4553740	i'm working on it well hello i picked silent hill i've done every other good silent hill game
4553740	4561740	except for silent hill so yes so um if you don't know what silent hill is then
4562380	4564460	get your head out of somebody else's ass
4566460	4568540	which was what they were doing in genital jousting
4571100	4577260	but it is a survival horror game it's not like the i mean it's got jump jumpy scares in it and
4577260	4583980	things like that but i don't even put it so much as the same category as like resident evil because
4583980	4591100	this has a lot more of a psychological drama to it i think um but it was developed by team
4591100	4598460	silent and tokyo um it is the first of course silent hill game it came out in north america
4598460	4607100	on january 1999 and then um in japan and europe later on in the same year it has a third person
4607100	4615740	view um real time 3d environment so that's where the fog came from they basically used fog and
4615740	4623020	darkness to um uh prevent like the draw in that you normally would get in that first generation
4623020	4630860	of playstation game if you want a good example of draw and just play daytona on the saturn just
4630860	4639580	saying anyway um and uh the main character is not anyone with any kind of special training or
4639580	4649180	anything he's just a guy a guy named harry he's missing his adopted uh daughter and uh he's
4649980	4657500	looking for her in silent hill where he finds out there's cult shit and so um you get uh five
4657500	4663580	different possible endings based on how you play the game and what you do and special things that
4663580	4674380	happen um it was really one of the best games of its genre um it was just really high credits when
4674380	4683180	it came out um there have been uh many adaptations of it as well we've even had um a visual novel that
4683180	4691020	came out in 2001 in 2006 we had the movie silent hill which it was faithful enough i mean
4691580	4698860	changing the protagonist and everything but um it had the feel of the games very well i should say
4698860	4702300	and then of course a reimagining of it called silent hill shattered memories that we don't talk
4702300	4711020	about um and then of course uh the second game silent hill 2 came out in 2001 so um it has a lot
4711020	4717340	of you know puzzles in it um you've got you know to survive the things that are trying to stab you
4717340	4723340	in the legs you know the little evil children and um you get different melee weapons and firearms
4723340	4730460	and uh you know you've got a health bar you can refill your health um you also have a little
4730460	4735500	portable radio that it will start playing a lot of static and let you know when enemies are nearby
4735500	4740540	and to me the first time i can play in that game and hearing that static and static sounds just
4740540	4746860	kind of freaked me out anyway but i was like holy shit what's this going on especially because like
4746860	4752140	the rest of it was really quiet but then again i mean you've also got you know akira yamaoka doing
4752140	4759260	the music i mean that right there such a unique style he's got and it really very well fits the
4759260	4769100	game um so as far as um the um design of it now this i didn't know is that uh yamaoka actually
4769100	4774700	requested to compose the soundtrack the original composer quit and he asked if he could do it
4775340	4781660	that's cool um but team silent um was made up of staff members from uh the konami computer
4781660	4787740	entertainment tokyo group um and they wanted they actually wanted to make a game that would
4787740	4795740	be successful in the us so they get used uh uh hollywood-like uh atmosphere in the production so
4795900	4802460	um basically without going into um too much more about it because i mean this is a game
4802460	4810380	that everyone should have played um they basically gave them as much artistic freedom as they could
4810380	4821660	um and said just do it make it happen so um as far as um there's actually quite a bit about this
4821660	4829260	one here um the different um uh mythology though that the series created was i mean
4829820	4834060	people have actually just sat and tried to draw you know where do they get their inspirations
4834060	4842860	from some of it came from certainly from judeo christian um uh mythos but uh very very
4843580	4849500	interestingly um you know there's also the characters in the games had their names taken
4850140	4857420	from um other characters in popular culture um including um alyssa came from the lost world by
4857420	4864700	um uh sir arthur conan doyle um and uh from uh louis carroll's alice's adventures in wonderland
4865260	4871900	um there were uh real life people like cheryl mason came from uh the actress cheryl lee
4872620	4879260	just spelled differently and uh lisa garland came from judy garland michael kaufman is
4879260	4886460	a combination of um two of the troma studios producers you know what troma did right oh like
4886460	4892060	tromio and juliette the toxic avenger the killer tomatoes and all that i don't know that troma did
4892060	4896780	kill tomatoes oh i thought they did no they did their big one was they did they did okay but i
4896780	4904700	know their biggest one was the toxic avenger um uh but the other the other big thing is um and this
4904700	4909340	is you know things that came up to me afterwards is that they actually took a lot of symbolism
4909340	4915900	from kabala so it's kind of interesting it seems kind of a popular place to take stuff from but
4915900	4925420	we'll see um but anyway um going back to uh its release um it was really hard for it to pass
4925420	4932940	sensors outside of japan like the gray child monster um it had to go through uh two different
4932940	4939500	design changes and for the us and four for europe before it was approved by sensors it was just
4939500	4944540	supposed to be knife wielding nude children but they said that it was a little too graphic and
4944540	4949580	might be a bit much well i think what they turned them into is actually a little creepier the
4949580	4956940	faceless gray larger children with the huge head um in the european version the gray child was
4956940	4963980	replaced by um the mumblers which were also um later on in the game in north america um
4964780	4969660	and also in uh the end of the european version the gray child monsters are there as
4970300	4979180	transparent silhouettes um but yes silent hill came out january 31st um 1999 in japan on march
4979180	4984940	4th in europe on august 1st and it was also included in the japanese silent hill complete set
4984940	4991820	in 2006 um it was available for european playstation network and ps uh sorry playstation
4991820	4999420	network download for ps3 and psp um on march 19th and that was in europe and then two days later
4999420	5005900	the game got taken out because of unforeseen circumstances it came out in the u.s um for psn
5006460	5015580	on september 10th 2009 so there have been adaptations of the story um there was a game
5015580	5022300	boy advance version that was titled play novel silent hill and it only came out in japan in 2001
5022300	5029580	and it was a game book style visual novel that told the story through uh text and um you would
5029580	5035340	every so often you know do puzzles and you know try different things and you also have the an
5035340	5041340	option when you beat the game of playing through as sybil the officer from the game um and then
5041340	5047900	there was a another third mode um that was there too but i don't remember much about it because i
5047900	5052140	like looked at that game for five seconds and i couldn't play through much of it because i couldn't
5052140	5060140	read it very well um there was of course the movie silent hill um which was i loved it and
5060140	5067580	the the music was still done by yamaoka so it was great and it was faithful to its source material
5068220	5075020	and then there was silent hill shattered memories which was developed by climax studios um it was
5075020	5083420	it was special it wasn't bad i don't think it was great it was basically um
5086860	5093020	having to do with the character being in therapy and reliving the events so um silent hill um
5093820	5104540	got an 86 of 100 um by metacritic and uh while it's been um compared to resident evil there really
5104540	5110700	are kind of night and day this one's to me also a little bit edgier you know it it hits the mind
5110700	5117180	in a certain way it reaches into the psyche as opposed to just oh big ugly scary dog thing
5117980	5130940	oh stars that was three um and also it has been listed by ign as the 14th best playstation game
5130940	5137260	to ever be released couldn't they have just given it lucky 13. why did they have to do 14 come on
5138060	5147740	come on so this is also the game that gave us the alien ending fucking weird

5357340	5364060	supposed to be coming out in a couple years here um apparently there is um he talks with
5364060	5372220	steve correll as the role of steve in the minecraft movie so um you know that it's possibly
5372220	5377980	he may be playing steve or somebody else um but he is in talks you know to be working with the movie
5377980	5386700	um that'd be fucking hilarious i mean after all it's being directed by um rava mcgalley which
5386700	5393180	you know it's always sunny in philadelphia and you know writes that and directs as well um so
5394140	5402380	just that combination sounds fantastic so i look forward to that 2019 unfortunately is when it's
5402380	5408460	but our may 2019 is when it's scheduled to be released all right and then if you want to get
5408460	5415500	some uh free game on um there's a little indie game that was made based off of doom called mini
5415500	5422140	doom and what's kind of cool about it though is it's a metroidvania take on doom it's even got the
5422140	5427180	music and sound effects from doom in there and it looks pretty fun so if you want to check that
5427180	5433260	out you can check it out on the website's page which or the ab studio the game studio which is
5433260	5443660	calvera studio that's calavera dot studio slash en slash games slash mini doom and check it out
5443660	5447820	it's free and it's small download it play it enjoy it will it fit in your pocket
5447820	5454540	it could possibly fit in your pocket maybe he is kind of small but yeah it looks pretty neat
5454540	5459260	i kind of watch some gameplay of it and you know it's got all the classic characters in there and
5459260	5464220	everything and just you know the same sound effects i think just instead of making their
5464220	5469900	own sound effects just straight over them from doom but hey why not so go check it out that sounds
5469900	5476540	fun uh we've got award season starting and uh yeah it's that time of year where we give out
5476540	5482220	awards to all sorts of video games and the golden joystick awards just happened this past week
5482220	5486220	i don't i know this is overseas this is something they do in the uk but is this
5486220	5490620	loki you know what organization puts this on is this a magazine i thought for i was having
5490620	5495660	confused with you when i saw this i was like thinking game developer awards but i was like
5495660	5501660	oh wait you know and then it's like wait jeff kealy show no no that's the game awards that happens
5502220	5505420	later on so i don't remember which organization puts us out but
5506060	5509420	all right well everybody's going to be given out but all i have to say is there's way too
5509420	5515580	many nominations for no man's sky uh let's see so the bet well actually i don't see no man's sky
5515580	5521820	winning any awards on here actually as it should uh the the best original game went to overwatch
5521820	5527580	uh let's see the best indie game went to fire watch uh let's see and laura croft was inducted
5527580	5533980	into the hall of fame uh the creator of stardew valley was given a breakthrough award uh pokemon
5533980	5539660	go the handheld mobile game of the year and the ultimate game of the year was dark souls 3
5540300	5547500	was the the i which i guess is their best picture oscar there so uh dark souls 3 which uh i'm i'm
5547500	5551740	surprised but i haven't exactly played that game really either because i get so infuriated very
5551740	5556700	rapid fans yeah yeah so uh i know that i know that series has its fans so maybe i'm missing something
5556700	5560780	i would have just assumed overwatch is going to win everything this year but maybe i don't
5560780	5564540	know final fantasy 15 maybe i don't know but it's still too early for final fantasy 15 just like
5564540	5569500	there's no nominations for um the game awards i think for final fantasy 15 i think i'm not
5569500	5574940	positive but oh really oh really because maybe because nobody's had a chance to play it yet
5574940	5578780	because it got released too late but i always thought they still somehow the game awards is
5578780	5584780	i know the golden joysticks does not so i don't think those final fantasy wasn't nominated for
5584780	5592700	anything on that but you know next year will be cool too all right uh let's see and funny in chat
5592700	5597180	yyr says it's really something to hear loki's complete reversal on no man's sky he was so
5597180	5602140	gung-ho about it before it released times certainly changed we hit the nail on the head my friend it
5602140	5606780	released exactly there was there's a lot of people that had issues with with what turned out i don't
5606780	5611180	i still think it could be made better with vr that'd be pretty fun yeah i'd go back and check
5611180	5615420	it out i don't think it's as horrible the game as most people are making it out to be however i
5615420	5618940	don't think it's going to be a game of the year it's it's a game that gets born very fast yeah
5619580	5625820	uh also hey how about some music game news to go at 20 november it's not a konami game but i'm sure
5625820	5631260	a lot of you follow this series anyway it's dj max and dj max respect is going to be coming out
5631260	5639180	for the playstation 4 in july of 2017 that was announced at g star 2017 by neo wiz games uh that
5639180	5649580	will cost you a 49 900 k korean money in south korea uh gonna have over 140 songs 40 new songs
5649580	5655180	from across dj max portable dj max portable 2 and songs from other dj max titles to be download
5655180	5659740	content arcade mode mission mode online mode gallery mode and so forth now it should be
5659740	5665500	pointed out this is going to be the dj max that involves the falling notes that you hit with
5665500	5671180	buttons on your controller like left right up on the d-pad square triangle circle it is not
5671180	5677900	touching the screen elite beat agent style like the dj max was on the psp like psp technica yes
5677900	5684460	so um just just so you know it's different type of dj max but that's more in line i think i think
5684460	5688380	there were dj max games on the psp that were very similar to that so that's what you're going to be
5688380	5693020	getting on the ps4 so i'm sure i'm sure a lot of you music game fans will be into that and checking
5693020	5701740	that out next year dark sakura well we do have some uh other little news about uh some zelda stuff
5704380	5711340	computer to bring up the page now okay there we go so um there is an escape room
5712140	5718860	game coming out called defenders of the triforce and it is a uh
5719820	5726060	a group puzzle story event that's being hosted in eight different cities in the us
5726060	5731580	looks like a real world one so basically different teams are going to come together in the area and
5731580	5737420	solve puzzles and items and definitely recover the triforce so the experience will be in san
5737420	5745500	francisco phoenix seattle chicago los angeles san diego houston and new york you know these escape
5745820	5751740	room things these are the things that shane was raving about when he was uh doing the um like the
5753100	5758220	trips and stuff he was he was uh doing these escape rooms and spoke very highly of them so
5758220	5761500	don't they have like a resident evil one coming out or silent hill or something like that i think
5761500	5766300	it's resident evil i would do a silent hill one yeah well and i'm sure like most things nintendo
5766300	5770540	there won't be enough supply to match demand especially if they did like you know only eight
5770540	5777100	cities or what have you so and in other news what the mass effect is coming out on vinyl
5778060	5784940	the album and i needs them i needs them uh the for the whole trilogy or just the first game for
5784940	5789020	the whole thing oh that's pretty cool i'm sorry those aren't gonna fit in your playstation 4 or
5789020	5793180	xbox one so that's good that's completely useless unfortunately you haven't seen me try
5793820	5804060	um and they are an orange red white and uh black albums and uh one for each game i just need to

5882220	5886220	which begs the question because they already did a remaster on weu so is that the same fucking thing

5914380	5920540	following week as well damn that final fantasy 15 see it really should have come out this week
5920540	5926220	because you know then all that time off now i have to wait yeah that's all right i gotta play your
5926220	5932380	backlog yeah they're backlog yeah all right traveling to japan time let's uh check out what's
5932380	5935980	over there actually it's pretty quiet in japan this week at least on the playstation 4 i think
5935980	5940300	that's because final fantasy 15 you know we are ramping up getting closer to that but there is a
5940300	5945180	pretty big release uh sengoku musou sonata maru comes out this week in japan that's what dynasty
5945180	5949820	warriors right that's just what they call it over there um so that is a release on the playstation
5949820	5955020	4 then the playstation vita is getting that same release because playstation vita still gets a lot
5955020	5961020	of releases and actually a lot of releases on the vita this week uh traveling stars id rebirth and
5961020	5967020	code realize shukufuku no mirai comes out here's the thing that is really silly if you think about
5967020	5973420	it and this is consistent week to week there's more releases coming out even in the us on the
5973420	5979820	vita than there are in the 3ds right i know right and yet no support for like what the hell sony
5979820	5985100	come on like step it up i understand that you're kind of like oh it's never never gonna win
5986060	5990700	so step it up i mean you have so many games coming out all right well speaking of the 3ds
5990700	5996620	uh it's no slouch of a week over in japan uh we do have some games coming out on the 3ds including
5996620	6003260	rpg sukuru fest comes out this week i'm not sure if this is like a design your own rpg game it's
6003260	6006780	what it kind of looks like to me based on the screenshots is that it's like kind of like because
6006780	6009980	it's a very kind of basic rpg but then one of these screens kind of looks like it might be like
6009980	6015820	a make your own type of thing but that is out this week in japan was it called again um you
6015820	6022780	asked that when i just closed it rpg sukuru fest it might be rpg maker i want to i thought they
6022780	6028300	were doing like no that was thinking i i think there's one that's coming to mobile well then
6028300	6034380	there's also ikatsu stars my special appeal comes out this week on the 3ds and that looks to be
6034380	6039180	another one of those idol style games where you you know kind of you can tap the buttons and to
6039180	6043580	the beat and then play barbie dress up with your characters and everybody loves those uh and then
6043580	6052060	lastly on the 3ds this week uh tetsudo nippon rosen tabi aizu tetsudo hen comes out this week
6052060	6055900	and this looks to be one of those train simulator games on the 3ds which unfortunately we don't
6055900	6060140	really get any of those here but i gotta say just looking at some of like the pictures here it looks
6060140	6063740	it's very it's a pretty looking i think that's where steam comes in handy because i'm pretty
6063740	6068300	sure they've got all the simulators on steam i'll have to i'll have to check out some of those
6068300	6072380	because yeah this this actually looks like it might be kind of neat but yeah it's not
6072380	6077740	something that i would have to get pretty i missed the densha de go series i need to get misty's
6077740	6081660	opinion on this because she's the biggest train fan i know but these these games we need a vr
6081660	6086300	train game i bet they've got that oh i bet they do have something like that they've got to like
6086300	6092940	at least one of those experiences or something like that i swear that um i yeah when i saw like
6092940	6099340	an imax i want to say i saw like an imax movie randomly where the hell was i was it seattle
6099340	6104140	or something i saw an imax movie that was like a train and it was trains going across canada
6104140	6109500	and it was this whole documentary about trains or was it canada or was it i don't even remember was
6109500	6112780	obviously this is a while ago that i saw but i feel like it was it i feel like it was when alan
6112780	6117100	and i were in seattle we saw something at the imax like the science the pacific science center or
6117100	6122140	whatever it's called there and it was like a train imax movie but it was i mean it was very pretty
6122140	6127180	obviously as you would expect the other fun one i like is the uh video that was one one of those
6127180	6130940	train simulator games where i think you can make your own tracks where they did train drifting
6130940	6134940	where they have the back wheels on like different tracks in the front wheels no that'll be eurobeat
6134940	6138380	in the back yeah that only works if you play eurobeat and it would have eurobeat in the back
6138380	6143580	okay good good train drifting it's awesome you gotta seriously watch i want to see the fast and
6143580	6148380	the furious but it's about trains and it's about the california bullet train that they're never
6148380	6152140	gonna fucking build even though what that was approved in what 2008 they're never gonna fucking
6152140	6162300	build it anyway uh dark sakura hey we've missed you doing the uk releases the united kingdom is
6162300	6166620	happy to have you back dark sakura i wish they would take me this country's broken
6167580	6171420	um well they're i don't know they're pretty there's issues over there too to be i like that
6171420	6177420	one meme that's like and now you know brexit happened it can't get worse than that and us is
6177420	6186380	like hold my beer yeah maybe i need to go take that train across canada for real just kidding
6186380	6191900	i would never run away from my problems i would i'm the type to stay right here and make a lot of
6191900	6196460	noise i'm very good at making noise dark sakura i'll make noise but also though occasionally
6196460	6201980	running away from your problems leads to disneyland that is true and in chat uh akuma jp is
6201980	6209820	asking rob is visiting japan too you know i hadn't been planning on it but well fuck it why not i
6209820	6216060	was telling hubby that i'm actually very considering very much considering um

6223500	6229180	trip to new zealand that he's planning and how he's not going to come back yeah i'm like great
6229180	6233580	why don't i lose a friend too in 26 well actually that would be 2017 but wouldn't that just be the
6233580	6243420	icing on the cake anyhow hey you saw the 22nd we have pokemon moon and pokemon sun yay on the 24th
6244620	6252940	beat the beat rhythm paradise for wii u that's it well we're gonna beat the beat on a few new
6252940	6257660	news articles here uh and then we'll get to the phone calls better than beating the meat
6257660	6262380	orange lounge radio we already talked about the game um oh we need to get to the mailbag actually
6262380	6267900	we had a last minute email that came in uh dark sucker i forwarded it to your um address yes

6280140	6286860	it yeah rage nader but in the absence of no other emails to read if we didn't get this one late
6286860	6294940	breaking yeah rage nader we're gonna read this one from rage nader this one's from yyr kidding
6294940	6301020	kidding kidding kidding kidding this is from rage nader i like the idea of crediting emails
6301020	6310380	to different people hi folks rage nader here just a short last second email every so often
6310380	6316300	a game or series of games comes along that we end up becoming a fan of this is so tiny
6316300	6321820	god i'm just gonna put it up to my nose but for whatever reason that game or series dies out a
6321820	6328060	developer folds the rights a holder loses interest in publishing it etc that being said if you have
6328060	6332860	the ability to do so what ip would you buy up inject a new life into and publish new entries
6332860	6337580	for for me it would be the socom franchise but i'd have it published on pc and console
6338460	6342700	how about silent hill i was gonna say easiest oh i was gonna say easiest fucking question i've
6342700	6345660	ever been asked but i thought jamie would take my answer but apparently she's not
6345660	6349820	what you're gonna say silent hill yeah because it's been shit after four
6351660	6355740	fair enough uh i'm gonna make you wait loki what would you pick what rights to the game
6355740	6359100	would you buy oh i know what this is because you've been saying it for years
6359740	6364620	what rights would i buy i mean god i don't know i mean it could be a couple things uh
6365260	6369020	i'd either do dance dance revolution excite truck there you go that was the answer i was thinking
6369020	6376780	or saints row because i could do some kick-ass things with saints row saints
6376780	6380300	rose not exactly dead though i don't think those rights are being given up anytime soon
6383180	6390220	i don't know about that and then my answer dark socra will be this little game that was on the
6390220	6396540	nes many years ago the guardian legend it was a small series guardic wasn't that great no guardic
6396540	6401020	was kind of like the only reason people know of guardic is because of the guardian legend that's
6401020	6407180	seriously all it is so uh yes we need a new game now here's the funny thing now jamie you've been
6407180	6412220	out a few weeks so you may have missed this um the other game i would have suggested is blaster
6412220	6417020	master but it's somebody did it somebody bought the rights the japanese company bought the rights
6417020	6421500	they're making a new 3ds game that is a retro style but it's gonna have some new stuff that
6421500	6424860	you would have missed would it cost for us to get the rights for the guardian legend
6424860	6431820	i i don't know but i'll bid five dollars i've got ten fifteen dollars right dollars for the
6431820	6437260	guardian legend you want to help on a dollar all right sixteen dollars the guardian legend
6438300	6442380	maybe we should make this a kickstarter go fund me let's do it let's do a kickstarter
6442380	6445900	our first kickstarter orange lounge radio buying the guardian legend
6448460	6452940	i've come on compile you can let us have it i've never turned to kickstarter for anything
6452940	6458700	but this might just do it this might just do it uh anyway uh dungeon buster says orange
6458700	6463900	lounge legend i just uh who has the guardian legend ip didn't we track it down at one point
6463900	6467980	and i thought we did i know it was originally compile um because it was made by compile
6467980	6474540	somehow i went to see this title which would be square enix right fuck i want to say well
6474540	6479020	actually all we have to do is find the people who are doing the reimagining and then see who sent
6479020	6486540	them the cnd great question someone was in a reimagining yeah it looks pretty neat um the
6486540	6495660	internet of course somebody was doing something hey bloodhounds of vog look for us all right
6496220	6501020	this is biad by the rights for doa extreme beach volleyball and just turn it to straight porn
6501020	6505820	because that's really what everybody's hoping it goes to now dark barbie's for boys this is a great
6505820	6511100	idea from dark tetsuya because we probably could get this license for 16 i'd resurrect rock
6511100	6516540	revolution but bring in more guitar freaks draw media crossovers and fix up that interface
6516540	6521740	can we can we buy the rights to rock revolution maybe should we send konami a letter i'll offer
6521740	6527740	you 16 for all the rights to rock revolution i don't know i saw like a thing today randomly
6527740	6531260	you know i was like hey i'm going to work on my game which meant i'm turning on youtube and
6531260	6536620	totally not working on my game and so one of the random videos that came up was someone playing one
6536620	6542380	of those uh i don't know what you'd call like a pipe instrument it's basically um like the
6542380	6546380	blue man didgeridoo no not the didgeridoo like the blue man group they have a bunch of things
6546380	6550940	made of pvc pipe at different lengths and they are hitting them with you know like spoons or
6550940	6556540	something like that and you know makes kind of like a techno synth sound type thing let's make
6556540	6563420	that into a music game why not why not all right there you go rage nater hope you enjoyed the
6563420	6569420	answers to your question if you want to send us an email do it participate at orange lounge radio
6569420	6576700	com do it now getting back into some news well actually i just found a facebook page for a
6576700	6584220	skinner ks who's working on another guardian guardian legend remake so yes but is it official
6584300	6587820	or is it a fan remake it's probably a fan remake but we'll see what i'm thinking
6588780	6596060	all right in the meantime let's get back into some other news with loki all right so in case
6596060	6603420	you weren't aware there is a sequel to swap note out now for your 3ds it's called swap doodle
6604220	6612700	and it's out on the 3d se shop yeah so apparently um you get less you can get lessons to draw
6612700	6621740	characters for 299 and yeah apparently you can swap doodles with swap pass and stuff how much
6621740	6627820	to get lessons to draw genital jousting well come on everybody knows how to draw penises i mean
6627820	6636860	that's that's easy that game is literally time to penis the game it is like it zero it's zero time
6636860	6642220	the penis and we're done all right i i had no idea that a sequel to swap note was out so swap doodle
6642220	6647740	but you can download swap doodle for free but it's just the other stuff in it is pay money right
6647740	6652140	so nintendo shuts something down and then brings it back years later but with microtransactions
6653820	6662220	how nice of them sounds legit moving on uh hey let's talk about pinball let's talk about pinball
6662220	6667740	tables that don't actually exist except in the minds of zen studios but that's cool because
6667740	6671820	then studios make some good they should totally make real pinball tables they they should and
6671820	6676300	these would be some good things to maybe make them have any kind of ironic going from like a digital
6676300	6682300	pinball company to making like actual pinball tables well here's the cool thing is that they're
6682300	6687420	they're going to be reimagining for their next tables they're bringing bethesda properties so
6687420	6691900	it's kind of a team-up of sorts and they're actually going to be making a fallout pinball
6691900	6699100	table a doom pinball table and an elder scrolls 5 skyrim pinball table and that was all in a press
6699100	6704620	release that came out from zen uh no news on when uh but just that they do have the rights and that
6704620	6709740	they are adapting these properties to pinball so i would assume at some point within 2017 because
6709740	6713020	it's not like they have to write the engine or anything they probably just have to you know come
6713020	6717100	up with the ideas which are probably already being worked on and then actually put them into tables
6717100	6722220	so that's pretty cool uh i would play a skyrim pinball table hell yeah and doom and fallout
6722220	6726940	pretty good choices as well so and i'm sure they'll have some of the music and all that stuff
6726940	6731500	so that'll be really cool dark soccer you're the pinball fan do you but you don't do you play a
6731500	6736940	lot of the e pinball or digital pinball like fake tables you don't really play a lot of that right
6736940	6744620	so much dan does a bit um he got into zen pinball for a little bit and then um but most of the time
6744620	6749580	he i think both of us just prefer to have it on a real thing i know i used to love that stuff
6749580	6754780	like pinball dreams and epic pinball and all those like 90s great pinball games dan dan's
6754780	6760940	big one was pin maim for a while yeah yeah they do like they you can put that on a tv and lay the tv
6760940	6768060	down face down that's something i could do with my old tv well now it is they've got the um shit
6768060	6776460	what's it called uh the ultra the ultra pin oh yeah yeah but not the same not the same as a
6776460	6780940	real table i understand ultra pin was an interesting concept i tried to play black knight on one
6780940	6787180	and it just it you need to have the feedback you have to feel the table yeah uh by the way going
6787180	6792380	to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com some folks stepping up to the challenge uh dungeon buster
6792380	6798940	says us copyright notes iram as the holder but nothing else after that so i guess they may still
6798940	6803740	hold the rights to the guardian legend compile made it but it could be the case where iram as
6803740	6813500	the publisher owns the ip and they're into pachinko now so 16. let me do some digging
6814460	6818780	all right uh by the way of speaking of the pinball tables stop he says i'd pay for a
6818780	6824060	fallout pinball table with a glowing green ball um so i'm sure they'll do some silly
6824060	6829100	effects and stuff uh vid power says real pinball is very difficult to be good at i'm amazed when
6829100	6834300	i watch good pinball players you know i know vid powers from vegas and i or at least last time i
6834300	6838220	checked he was uh and that's one of the things i'm sad i didn't get to do when i was in vegas
6838220	6841740	as i was planning to go to that pinball museum that they have there but i just i never made it
6841740	6846540	over there i was just too busy with the convention oh darn i'll have to go back to vegas who darn
6847500	6851340	anyway uh dark sakura i know you're you're putting your research hat on but how about
6851340	6860460	one more story for us i reckon um well if you are fans of uh guardians of the galaxy well guess what
6860460	6868700	there's going to be a uh game come out by uh uh telltale with marvel um that should be out in 2017
6869340	6878620	um that actually the uh the saga uh after a strike has actually been uh what revealed this uh to
6878620	6887340	exist um because the uh it was listed as um one of the games uh that needed to be negotiated for
6887340	6895500	voice acting rights so but the game is to be sexy and authentic whatever is the sequel to guardians
6895500	6902060	in the galaxy next year or the year after i know one thing next year next year so this would be
6902060	6907740	appropriately timed for something like that yeah i don't know i'm still kind of salty about
6907740	6912460	guardians now because of tower of terror oh yeah i can't write it yeah i'm a little salty about
6912460	6917900	that too i got to admit that's just well it's stupid fault it's disney's fault but for being
6917900	6924700	dumb well disney owns marvel thou though i mean i don't know i i understand that the the uh twilight
6924700	6931020	zone is not the ip that it used to be but it's just like now now i understand it could be yeah
6931020	6935580	exactly it could be and now i just understand why older people have the get off my lawn mentality is
6935580	6940140	that we just i like guardians of the galaxy i just don't think they need a ride for it
6941020	6946300	yeah every ip like all your popular ip's don't necessarily need rides i mean no one's gonna be
6946300	6951420	like oh man i gotta go just killing the ride that guardians of the galaxy right no one is saying
6951420	6956860	that no one i i think there'll be some people that want to check it out i but it's weird is
6956860	6961020	it going to be the same shit where it just falls is that it yeah the the ride essentially is not
6961020	6965180	changing but all this all the skin the theming and all that stuff is changing but that was like the
6965180	6970460	best part of the tower of terror was that whole like story or whatever the the that was the only
6970460	6976060	part i liked yeah for sure it was awesome but i i'm gonna try to give it a chance but i'm just
6977020	6983020	everything i love disney destroys gets it's hard to hard to love after a while but i haven't been
6983020	6988060	dar sakra there was a time here on olr where you and i were obsessed with disneyland we were going
6988060	6993020	multiple times a year every year and now it's like i haven't been i i want to say the last
6993020	7000300	trip i took was when i went to like my last e3 with bobby i got poor yeah it's just it's money
7000300	7005580	yeah it is it's got really expensive way too much to get in for sure for sure all right
7006060	7011660	anyway sorry not to tangent too much but it happens uh meanwhile loki one more story we're
7011660	7015820	gonna open up skype line soon guys uh orange lounge radio all one word on skype but first
7015820	7020300	loki so this is pretty cool and i'd be kind of curious to see how well this works um but they
7020300	7027340	showed off a new um they launched a new thing for the htc vibe called google earth vr and it's a
7027340	7033500	free app on steam you can check out and allows you to fly around the planet now i'm not sure
7034060	7037660	how detailed it is i mean some of the screenshots or the video they're showing
7037660	7041740	it looked like is pretty detailed but i'm not sure if it's like specific areas that are these
7042380	7047100	this detailed or if it's everything i have a hard time believing that's everything but
7047900	7053900	it looked cool so if you got a vibe go check it out i really want to check this out this sounds
7053900	7059500	awesome actually i love that it's free and the fact that you know there's all these different
7059500	7064220	i mean all these pictures kind of exist i mean even if you do the street view on google you
7064220	7069100	can kind of rotate things around in a 360 degree view anywhere anywhere that the google car has
7069100	7073260	been basically it doesn't probably have that level of detail that you're talking about
7073260	7079260	but they probably did send photographers out to get high res and better detail of these places
7079260	7083900	that people would would really want to visit yeah i mean it looked cool so i mean get that
7083900	7087740	definitely check it out yeah if you have that i really want to check that out except i don't
7087740	7091100	have a vibe and i don't know if i can spend that kind of money to get one so i'm just gonna have
7091100	7096380	to really hope that my pal bobby blackwolf brings us to dragon con because i know he has a vibe or
7096380	7100140	hopefully at some point in the next few months you know some more people i know here locally
7100140	7105340	will have one i want to check this out but that sounds really cool and it's free yep can't be free
7106140	7112940	does google even run ads or anything on it i guess not it's crazy no all right well speaking of free
7112940	7118060	everybody's favorite operating system linux you know they try to install linux on everything they
7118060	7122860	try to put it on a toaster they try to put it on a refrigerator like if it has a screen if it has
7122860	7129020	any type of computer chip in it somebody inevitably somewhere will try to put linux on it so of course
7129020	7135980	as you probably can guess the nes classic edition yes they've installed linux on that now actually
7135980	7141180	i didn't know this the classic edition of the nes already runs on a form of linux so this made it
7141180	7146780	really really easy to do so a japanese hacker actually did this with the famicom version of
7146780	7151740	the nes classic edition so the famicom mini and actually posted a guide online on how to do it
7151740	7157420	so basically using a serial to usb cable and then a u-boot loader software and then actually
7157420	7164780	installed uh linux's boot sequence now it's very limited obviously what it can do it's not like
7164780	7170300	you're gonna be able to do all this crazy stuff on there but uh apparently um yeah it's it's done
7170300	7173820	would you replace the roms in there because that would be pretty awesome you know what's funny is
7173820	7178540	that it's actually called out that his efforts do not look to be that he's trying to extract
7178540	7183260	the emulator or change the game files in there that would really be different than just trying
7183260	7191740	to install linux off on it um but that is that is what this person's done so there it is linux now
7191740	7195980	on the nes classic release the famicom classic but come on if they got it on there they're
7195980	7201180	gonna get it it's the same it's like the same hardware please probably next week we'll hear
7201180	7206700	that i get one of those they look pretty fun i'm disappointed that the the size of the the um
7206700	7211420	cables on them but there are there's third-party companies that sell extension cords for them which
7211420	7217740	that's nice and that really it is silly that they didn't put it with a longer cord because
7217740	7224460	come on i mean well our skype line is now open at orange lounge radio all one word on skype but
7224460	7229020	loki we we talked about the nes classic a little bit on the the show you missed earlier this week
7229020	7235260	but um i'm curious because you're you know you're usually one of the first to express reservations
7235260	7238620	about nintendo things but you are into this nes class well yeah i thought it looked pretty cool
7238620	7241820	i mean i don't know if i'll actually play it because i bought a clico one and never
7241820	7247740	really did anything with that so i don't know but i wanted to play it all right well let's
7247740	7250860	get to the phones it's uh ringing off the hook tonight hi you're on orange launch radio who's
7250860	7259500	this dare you ask mortal this is satan prince of darkness now wait a minute i know dj satan's
7259500	7265980	voice and he's on strike right now apparently oh well this is not a dj satan this is the satan
7265980	7272220	oh oh excuse me there is a oh i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry satan how dare i doubt you uh how can we
7272220	7279980	help you tonight uh well um hi how are you how are you on this fine evening um i'm i'm feeling
7279980	7285660	sassy and wonderful it's episode 666 uh i bet you're really happy about that aren't you satan
7286300	7292860	oh absolutely i really wanted to congratulate you guys on this milestone i mean i i'd say i'd
7292860	7299340	have you over for a party but you probably don't want to wind up here i hear it's really hot yeah
7299340	7304540	i i don't think i i really want to be visiting you anytime soon satan but do you have any tips on how
7304540	7309340	to stay away like because i don't i mean i mean i'm sure you're cool and all but i i don't really
7309340	7315740	want to visit you for all eternity are there any tips on how to stay away well um let me just say
7316460	7321100	i'm actually really happy with the outcome of this u.s presidential election
7321820	7328380	of course of course well i mean you know i'd like anyone else i get worried about the future too
7328380	7333660	and if everyone had a conscience and did the right thing and tried to be accepting and
7333660	7339420	understanding and tried to make our society better then we'd stop receiving new clients
7339420	7344620	business would sink like a stone we'd be out of work but this election tells us that we're going
7344620	7349660	to have a lot of work ahead of us for years to come satan i feel like at night you know i feel
7349660	7354140	like you're on a broadway show or something um right now but that's it's all good it's all good
7355740	7358780	satan what's your favorite if only what are your favorite video games to play
7358780	7366620	uh well really i'd say mostly mobile games because they're all evil i mean they're evil
7366620	7372940	in a way that we can really learn from down here have you ever heard of game of war uh is that the
7372940	7380460	one that mariah carrey is the spokesperson for i think kate upton for a while yeah but like it's
7380460	7385660	it's not about the the spokesperson it's about the game itself i mean the whole game is upgrades
7386380	7391500	upgrade and then you upgrade again and then you realize that the only way to upgrade faster is
7391500	7397340	to pay the money so you pay the money and then and only then they reveal that the upgrades go
7397340	7402940	farther than you'd ever imagined and that you'll never ever get there unless you pay them about a
7402940	7411260	shit ton it's like Scientology well you know at that point you could quit but you need to train
7411260	7416860	more troops and help your buddy and your alliance and upgrade your farm to level 24 and oh my god i
7416860	7423020	can't stop now and well that's how they do it and and last week you mentioned that the same company
7423020	7429740	that made this game is adapting final fantasy into a game like this now you don't need me to tell you
7429740	7435180	that's evil satan i i gotta get your opinion on one more thing before we let you go uh
7435180	7438060	saying because i don't know how long anything i don't know how long you're gonna be able to
7438060	7443820	hold out that voice but satan uh what what are your thoughts what are your thoughts on diablo 3
7445100	7452940	um well you know uh honestly i don't like it because i mean it everything in there are
7452940	7459660	supposedly from hell but that isn't a realistic portrayal at all you know it's all the equivalent
7459660	7465180	of movie sets and office buildings down here and and our citizens you know they just don't look
7465180	7469740	like that we mostly look like lawyers whose hopes and dreams have been forever crushed
7470620	7473900	don't you hate it when the goddamn media blows everything out of proportion
7474700	7480940	oh no i i love it i think it's great more chaos the better that's what i say
7481660	7486220	all right satan um one more thing before we let you go to any any words of advice
7486220	7491100	to us here at orange lounge radio as we uh continue on to episode 667 next week
7491740	7496700	and beyond sure i mean just keep doing what you're doing i mean i like olr because of the
7496700	7504540	fact that you guys are honest honest people are easily tricked well i don't know i i don't know
7504540	7509900	i don't know satan i mean we we try our best purchase you know mass effect you know three
7509900	7515980	several times you shut your whore mouth actually i got three words for you no man sky all right

7611340	7615740	were off because the release of the nes classic i heard you got your picture in like some newspapers
7615740	7622300	and stuff right yeah a couple of times i'm i'm telling bob i'm still a little shocked and giddy
7622300	7627020	about that that's awesome didn't you didn't you get like second place in their costume contest
7627020	7633340	yes i did congrats that's awesome but here's the thing i almost didn't make it in oh no
7634220	7638940	because i didn't know that you needed a wristband to get into the event but thankfully somebody i
7638940	7643020	was talking to one of his friends left gave me his wristband and the manager's like yeah sure
7643020	7648940	let him in phew well that's good so what i know you talked about this already on bobby's show i
7648940	7653260	don't want you to repeat yourself too much but give our listeners like the 50 000 foot overview
7653260	7658780	how was the event what happened it was pretty amazing now i gave um the bike black will show
7658780	7666060	like the the meat and potatoes i'm giving you guys the big mac okay we'll take it all right see
7666700	7671660	there's a few cosplayers and i took some pictures and i know uh act up got excited about the kirby
7671660	7675340	cosplay because we all know he loves kirby so i had to make sure i get pictures of that
7676300	7683340	pretty much when you walked in all the party was on the second floor and they had some fruit snacks
7683340	7688540	fun dip and other cool snacks from the 80s and 90s that we all ran home to eat or we kind of
7688540	7696140	hoped that was in our lunch boxes when we went to lunch and they had juice boxes and unfortunately
7696140	7701020	i didn't get there in time to get some ecto cooler but i still had a thing of of apple juice which
7701100	7705820	was pretty cool did they have capri sun no that's a bummer
7708060	7714780	maybe next time maybe next time yeah so when you walk in on the left there is a section you know
7714780	7719180	where you can take pictures they had a lot of blow-up balloons and stuff that were that kind
7719180	7727260	of looked like stuff from the 80s like the old um zach morris cell phone oh god all right yeah
7727260	7732140	like the giant like the giant antenna and all that stuff like car phones legit car phones
7733180	7738220	yeah and when i got there there was a guy they dressed as mario his girlfriend was peach and
7738220	7742220	we couldn't even walk through like three feet with somebody asking to take our picture which
7742220	7746380	i thought was pretty cool oh gosh that must have been such a tragedy for somebody who loves
7746380	7751420	attention so much right i'm not that bad of an attention whore rob come on no i know i'm just
7751420	7755900	giving you crap but come on it's it's fun to be in the spotlight for a little bit true especially
7755900	7761740	since i didn't do standard luigi i decided to go ahead and do super mario brothers super show
7761740	7768540	luigi so i was there with the mallet the plunger and some tools you know that nice colored shirt
7768540	7775180	you know i'm thinking you know why not nice so and what was cool was a little bit in they brought
7775180	7781180	everyone together and they had a gentleman who i forget his name but most likely somebody recorded
7781180	7787820	it and it's on youtube that they did like a brief history of the nes and the nintendo coming to new
7787820	7794380	york in america and so forth they talked about how they had rented out a warehouse in jersey
7794380	7800060	and they were putting together the display props um trying to get the inventory in and the stories
7800060	7808940	behind that warehouse that it was haunted uh deer would walk by and there was uh toxic waste going
7808940	7814460	by as well but mind you this warehouse was in jersey so none of this surprised me in the least
7817900	7825100	of course not so as they got into that they showed off some cool commercials what was cool was they
7825100	7832540	did the entire video as if someone brought it in on a vhs tape nice now they showed the very first
7832540	7837820	commercial for rob and let me tell you i cannot find this commercial on youtube i went searching
7837820	7844860	for about three days could not find this one this one was never released then they showed the
7844860	7851260	commercial for super mario brothers 3 now we've all seen that commercial super mario brothers 3 but
7851900	7856540	not everybody knows there is a variant of that commercial i was gonna say yes we've all watched
7856540	7866220	the wizard god damn it loki well what was what was this variant okay now we've all seen the
7866220	7871260	commercial for mario 3 where everyone's chanting mario's name and the screen pulls back and it
7871260	7878060	shows his face now there's three versions of that commercial it's all the same the first version
7878060	7883980	goes he's back and the all-new super mario brothers 3 for nintendo there's that version
7883980	7888540	that's the original one that they showed and that was the one that they originally showed here in
7888540	7895500	the us a little bit down the line same commercial but they changed the wording at the end to
7896700	7901100	all you had to do was back all you had to do was ask he's back in super mario brothers 3
7904060	7909340	third version was only in the uk because there nintendo and Mattel had an agreement
7909340	7914540	for releasing the console over there right and that commercial advertised super mario brothers
7914540	7919420	one two and three and boys the background goes there strength in numbers super mario brothers
7919420	7924140	one two and three for nintendo entertainment system yeah i feel like the nes came out later
7924220	7928940	in europe too so they kind of had some catching up to do yeah they did yeah then they showed the
7928940	7934860	commercial for dr mario not the original one where it was where the the commercial was based
7934860	7938220	off of the witch doctor it was the second commercial where everyone is singing and dancing
7939660	7945020	now by chance do you remember that commercial uh no all right here's a brief clip
7945740	7947740	oh
7955100	7958220	okay i do remember that you're right i remember that on nickelodeon
7958220	7964620	yeah and then they switched over to the commercial for yoshi and we've all seen that one
7966060	7973020	i don't know if i remember the yoshi one all right hold on there's nowhere to hide
7975900	7981100	because here comes yoshi and he's up against goombas bloopers blue buddies and piranha plants
7981100	7986540	in nintendo's new stack and sandwich puzzle game called yoshi match the creatures and wipe them out
7986540	7992620	play along i don't remember that one i remember that one and the third one was a commercial for
7992620	7999420	a game i did not think they would bring up but star tropics well why not star tropics is one
7999420	8004460	of the games in in the uh nes classic edition so it makes sense true but i didn't think it
8004460	8007580	was that popular enough where he's gonna show the commercial for that i figured they would be
8007580	8013820	showing it for another game but that was also pretty cool that's awesome so it's a lot of
8013820	8018460	retro-tastic stuff going on at the event yeah and then they talked about a brief history of
8018460	8028940	the nintendo famicom which became the avs which became the nes well that's cool um so but you
8028940	8033660	didn't walk out of there with one of the systems right no i did not i kind of hoped i did because
8033660	8038860	when the costume contest started it was basically that you would stand next to each person you know
8038860	8045260	level of applause so when they got to me the entire floor was just chanting luigi back to
8045260	8050780	back like luigi luigi and i'm just standing there feeling like freaking um wink from the
8050780	8055100	legend of zelda i'm standing there with my fist up in the air holding the plunger like i'm the best
8055100	8062060	there is right and then he got beat yeah i got beat by by someone came as little mac did did
8062060	8067740	the winners get a nes classic no um they had this limited edition nes classic shirt that
8067740	8074060	the first place got second place got um a water bottle which what i got and third place got a
8074780	8080060	cool beanie uh classic hat well that's cool he had something well of course they're not
8080060	8083740	going to give him a system they didn't have enough to go around it they didn't have enough
8084780	8090460	he's got a point there i'm just saying you know all right well rama i'm going to let you go so
8090460	8094220	we get some more calls but thank you uh for sharing the uh experiences there sounds like

8144620	8148620	call and then uh we'll wrap it up hi your own orange sounds ready who's this hey uh this is
8148620	8155020	raging nader hey rage nader what's on your mind buddy uh not a whole lot um you know i'm not sure
8155020	8161580	if i had asked this at one point or another chances are amaya but just in case i didn't
8161580	8168380	um your music break today had reminded me you know which included a bunch of uh um
8168380	8176220	castlevania music also you know including some um super castlevania 4 music reminded me of
8177020	8184060	when i first got the the super nintendo way back in the day yeah which was which was the the first
8184060	8192780	console that i had bought completely on my own and super castlevania 4 was one of the uh first
8192780	8198460	three games i got with the system dollar two obviously being you know super mario world which
8198460	8204460	came back with the system and the third being act razor and just so our listeners know uh because
8204460	8209260	the podcast folks didn't get the music break because we can't just play the music uh uh for
8209260	8214220	uh free recordings and all that uh so uh yeah we had a uh you know because we take a little break
8214220	8217740	between the first second half of the show we just played a variety of music from castlevania something
8217900	8224540	fit the theme a little bit so you are reminded of when you bought a super nintendo yeah and you know
8224540	8230220	this being the first console that i had bought completely on my own season up my money and all
8230220	8238380	that i was immensely proud of the fact this one system was wholly mine couple letters mine no
8239100	8245260	uh you know if i want to have it in my bedroom you know no one could tell me any differently
8245260	8254620	if i want to have any living room whatever uh that being said um do you have any fond memories
8254620	8261900	of uh the first console that you had bought what and if you don't mind sharing like what
8261900	8268540	console that was and what games you got with it yeah uh what about you guys cons first console
8268540	8274140	you bought and the memories that go with that dark soccer wasn't wasn't like the nes a gift
8274140	8279740	or something to you i remember there was my my nes was a gift the first thing that i paid money
8279740	8287980	for myself was buying a super nintendo because at the time i actually had money um it was right
8287980	8293820	before the playstation came out and i went to thrift store and bought one because it was cheap
8294620	8301420	um the next system that i well actually all the rest of the systems that i bought with
8301420	8309340	my money mine and dan's money so everything else after that um yeah but i know the first one i
8309340	8315580	owned was a clique-o-vision but that was like that was present parents gift right yeah and
8315580	8324140	our neighbors had a um an odyssey too um the first one i remember buying for myself well here's the
8324140	8328860	funny thing because it was a gift but it wasn't so i got christmas money as a gift i got like
8328860	8334140	200 in christmas money i promptly went and bought a playstation one with the money i remember my
8334140	8338700	mom was mad because she was like i can't believe he's spending all that money on freaking video
8338700	8343100	games but it's like she should have known that was going to happen come on so i i went to the
8343100	8347820	warehouse if you all remember that chain i don't even know if it existed on nope not anymore well
8347820	8352460	i know it's long gone but uh was that a west coast only chain or did it exist other places i don't
8352460	8356540	know but anyway i went to this place called the warehouse and i bought a playstation one and a
8356620	8361100	copy of crash bandicoot 2 i think was the first game i had on that because the playstation had
8361100	8364220	already been out for a year or two by the time i got it because it was down it must have been
8364220	8369820	down to 150 or the point where i was able to buy it or maybe i might have sold some games or
8369820	8373900	something to kind of differentiate the cost i don't remember but i do remember that was the
8373900	8379100	first console i bought with my own money uh was the playstation one what about you logie um i
8379100	8384860	bought super nintendo because i had gotten uh my nintendo was a gift for my parents and then
8385740	8391260	i had a clique ovision which my dad had purchased which he says he wasn't a gamer but he had like
8391260	8399420	47 games for it so please explain that and all the peripherals um so i sold that and my nintendo
8399420	8405260	collection to earn enough money to buy super nintendo i think i got like the first game i
8405260	8409260	wanted to get super mario world but they didn't have for sale because i bought it i thought it
8409260	8414460	was like a packing game by default i thought yeah not no not this was just the basic thing and so
8414460	8420700	i got uh roadrunners death valley rally which actually funny enough is actually not a game
8420700	8426540	it's it's a pretty cool sonic clone um and then i forget i think i may have gotten linked to the
8426540	8431660	past or something like that with it but um i know i didn't ever get i don't think i ever bought
8431660	8435980	super mario world but hey you know what that was back in the day when it's like it doesn't fucking
8435980	8439420	matter because my friend down the street has super mario world i'll just borrow it from him
8439420	8446300	and that's kind of what we did so yeah nice uh yeah uh one final question you know before i do
8446300	8453180	hang up and let you get on with the show uh since you know you know everyone's pretty much mentioned
8453180	8461980	uh you know uh you know either buying the super nintendo on their own or at least owning the system
8461980	8468860	well uh at one point or another you know you know be a gift or relatives you know or siblings
8470140	8477980	system um you know just playing and playing it that way um i gotta ask this now when you
8477980	8485500	when you uh played the game uh the system for the first time we heard now the sound you know
8486300	8490620	you know music sound effects coming from the system be it playing uh
8490620	8497020	super castlevania or actuaries or any other games did you have you know have uh
8498060	8504060	no uh holy shit moment you know with you know with the sound you know like wow you know
8504060	8512460	again system is actually capable of this i have to admit not i i yes and no i think no because
8512460	8517180	most systems that i bought i had seen it at friend's house before i bought them so you kind
8517180	8521740	of already had that holy shit moment at somebody else's house i think before i necessarily had the
8521740	8527740	thing in my own house the the i the lone exception may be the nes there was something about when i
8527740	8533340	first got that and i had played that at friends houses already you know plenty of it but i think
8533340	8537740	when i first played that system on like my own tv it was definitely like a holy shit moment like
8537740	8542780	this is this is mine essentially and like it's my own little you know version of super mario
8542780	8546620	brothers that you know is arcade perfect you know if you think about the pay choice 10 back in the
8546620	8552300	day and all that like that there was kind of that moment but at the same time i think i was kind of
8552300	8557660	prepared what to expect because i had seen it at friends houses i don't know did you guys have a
8557660	8563740	holy crap moment i think it was like all the systems you know pretty much the nintendo was
8563740	8569420	you know it's more exciting than i had one and then um but like even just going from each system
8569420	8574780	up until about maybe the playstation 3 i don't think the playstation 3 was that holy shit for
8574780	8581500	me because i had an xbox 360 and that was kind of holy shit you know going from that um and then
8581500	8586060	like playstation 4 there's not a whole lot that's really kind of like like this generation that's
8586060	8591820	not been like hey it looks nicer i mean like grand theft 5 looks fucking awesome so that's kind of
8591820	8597740	wowing but um and then playstation vr is pretty good but yeah i mean i think each generation i
8597740	8602940	remember like you know because i bought like i had my first job at round table you know pizza
8602940	8607500	working there and stuff and i my first paycheck i went and bought a playstation one with final
8607500	8613340	fantasy 7 that was like holy shit this is fucking awesome you know yeah that that's the game to
8613340	8617420	start on right there yeah i remember actually playing that for the first time that playstation
8617500	8622060	i bought served me really well i mean that saw me through college and playing that playstation
8622060	8626540	one's still kicking oh i'm sure i'm sure mine storage somewhere but it's you know still kicking
8626540	8630220	mine would work too if i could find it it's probably in a fucking bin somewhere but
8630220	8635020	i mean that was the same playstation that we played japanese ddr mixes because dark
8635020	8639660	sakura bought some or brought some plug over to my house oh yeah i love this and actually
8639660	8644060	yeah work on the playstation one that i bought like i think that was the year between high school
8644060	8650380	and college so yeah anyway well thank you for the trip down memory lane uh rage nader appreciate it

8669900	8674700	tetsuya says i think my holy shit moment was the metal gear solid 1 demo there's that part in the
8674700	8678460	beginning where you have to crawl under the pipe i didn't expect the camera to pan down and turn
8678460	8682860	into a first person perspective i never see anything like that on the system up until that
8682860	8690220	point uh and the yyr also calls out the playstation 1 my holy shit moment was resident evil the
8690220	8695020	hallway with the dogs crashing through the window enough said oh god i remember that that made me
8695020	8700860	scream so loud i think i had friends over too we all played that anyway that is going to do

8752380	8759820	for our listeners tonight i'm tired i want chocolate would you want the chocolate that
8759820	8764700	has caffeine in it so it wakes you up so you're not tired i gotta sleep eventually i guess that's
8764700	8771260	true um let's see my final thought tonight is um i i'm trying to decide if i need to go play more
8771260	8777580	pokemon or more overwatch because i do my copy my actual copy of overwatch got here today hooray for
8777580	8782460	sunday shipping that's weird but um yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna play i think maybe a little overwatch
8782460	8786220	after the show maybe i'll do some streaming it's been like i haven't streamed since no man sky came
8786220	8790300	out i really need to get back into that and i hear the ps4 pro to 60 frame a second streaming
8790300	8794140	it looks really good you know well i saw x for doing that the other night uh because i got you
8794140	8798540	fallout um they just added mod support that was something i forgot that i mentioned they just
8798540	8802140	added that this week with a patch oh i want to check that out so they have mod support now so
8802140	8806460	yeah go check that out i was downloading i was actually going to play that today um i got to
8806460	8810460	downloading mazin and my wife decided she wanted to watch netflix on the tv i was like fuck i'm
8810460	8813900	like i keep saying we should get it like a roku or something like that way you can watch netflix
8813900	8818460	and i can like play games on the playstation vr you know whether it be like actual vr games or
8818460	8822940	just using that virtual screen i mean then that way we can both do it she's like no chris macuz
8822940	8828300	right around the corner well actually i still can play it on my laptop because i've that does work
8828300	8833580	now which is nice so i mean i guess i well no actually no i can't because she's still fucking
8833660	8839100	using the playstation for the netflix so that doesn't work so no all right and is uh is that
8839100	8844940	your final thought my final thought is i'm gonna really try to work on games this week um i've even
8845500	8851100	decided not to go to work tomorrow so it's gonna end up one two ways one i'm gonna work on my game
8851100	8855340	or two i'm playing gris and i know ingress is going to be for part of the day because i had
8855340	8859260	to get out of the house in the morning because wife doesn't know i'm taking the day off god
8859260	8863180	then i'll have to watch the kids or something like that um so ingress is gonna be part of the
8863180	8866780	day but it's shitty wetter and i don't really want to be out in the weather like this so i'll
8866780	8873020	probably try to program maybe maybe or go see dr strange or something all right well that's
8873020	8877100	gonna do it for another episode of orange lounge radio thank you guys so much for tuning into the
8877100	8882300	show i have one more final what's that an important thing yeah the truth does not require you to
