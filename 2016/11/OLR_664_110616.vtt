Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
This week, less than a month after PSVR hit stores, the process repeats with the release of the PS4 Pro. If you're hearing this an hour later than you expected, you might have forgotten to set your clocks back last night. No matter the hour, it's time for the news and so much more right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, November the 6th of 2016 with episode number 664 of our show.

00:44.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter though, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me as always as he does every week, say hello over there to Techmaster Loki!

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes, this time not popping and locking.

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
We may have had to do a take two while we were live tonight, but we wanted to have everything nice and clean for those of you listening on the podcast. We had some major audio issues, but I think we've worked it out.

01:07.000 --> 01:23.000
And we're just setting the audio levels appropriately so that when Nintendo comes up later on and your voice gets a little louder, the audio can compensate for that without making some of our listeners deaf because I don't think they appreciate that.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
But how have you been otherwise, Loki? You had a good week?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, it was alright.

01:26.000 --> 01:41.000
Well my week sucked, thanks for asking. I was sick on Thursday and Friday, and a little better Saturday, doing much better today although I'm still a little stuffy. So if I sound a little different than usual, that's what's happening as I'm getting over a nasty little sinus cold or something.

01:41.000 --> 01:52.000
So yeah, that part has sucked. But I'm happy to be here with you guys with what is essentially our last live episode before episode number 666 on the 20th of November.

01:52.000 --> 02:02.000
So I'll go out of order a little bit here and do housekeeping first. We're not actually, and this is a bit of a change for what we announced in previous weeks, so listen up y'all.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
Those of you that listen to the show live, there actually is not going to be a live show next week and unfortunately there's not going to be a taped one either.

02:09.000 --> 02:22.000
My schedule before I leave for Chicago just got too crazy busy with me making crazy money, except I'm not. So unfortunately we can't all align to tape a show in advance for next Sunday.

02:22.000 --> 02:32.000
So what we're going to do is we're going to do a special podcast only episode number 665 which will be our last pure episode that will go up in about a week and a half.

02:32.000 --> 02:42.000
It'll go up a few days before episode number 666 in a couple weeks. But don't, I don't know what you're expecting with episode 666 y'all.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I know we've been joking about it for a long, long time.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
We have no plans.

02:45.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, I think we're just kind of doing the same show we always do. Except I will say this, one of Dark Soccer's friends at work did make a new intro just for that episode.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
So that'll be that'll be kind of fun and a little bit different. And you never know what other surprises might be in store. We'll try to pull through in the next couple weeks.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
So we will be back in a couple weeks with that. Speaking of Dark Sakura, she will be here for that episode. I know you guys have missed her.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
She's been on a break for a few months due to her day job. She will be joining us for the mini episode.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
She will be joining us for episode 666 and she will be back in mid-December. Confirm that she will be back on the show in mid-December.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
So that'll be fun. The gang will be all back together up to our usual selves. Although I think, Loki, we've done an outstanding job holding the fort down.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
And we have yet to make Halo the classic game of the week. But who knows what will happen tonight.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Not without me trying.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Anything is possible.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news tonight. Top of the show.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
This is why I don't do Classic of the Week. Or Classic of the Week, you'll notice.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
As I say, Loki, you can do any game you want except that one. Because I don't want that phone call. And you don't want that phone call.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh, I don't care.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Like, I won't answer my phone.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
Alright, anyway. Let's talk a little bit about some of the big news happening in gaming this week.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
And of course, if you are listening live, a big hello and thank you. We do tape live every Sunday night at the VoiceGeeks Network.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
And some comments in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Bobby Black Wolf suggests Sky is just going to replay episode 1 as episode 666.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Oh, then we can get another night off. That sounds great. I love it.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Let's see. Rageinator in chat says, will Sky do another D.Va rant on OLR 666?

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
Let's see how the election goes on Tuesday. I'm kidding. Maybe.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
Tech2030 in chat says, OLR should do an episode negative 1 where they pretend it's 200 whatever again.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, like our Minus World episode. I like that as well.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
sg100matt says, or replay the episode that Travis, John, and Rama did that was labeled OLR episode 666.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah, we were gone one week. So we had like some substitute hosts fill in.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
And this was way back when OLR was maybe like in the 150 or 200 range.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
And so they joked and called it episode 666 because the show is never going to make it that long.

05:15.000 --> 05:23.000
15 years for the show. But oops, now we have the upside down episode 666.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
And that's what I'm referring to that episode as.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
That is the episode 666 from the upside down world. From the parallel universe that was communicated via Christmas lights.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
That is that episode 666. They did a fantastic job, but it exists in a world we can't see.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
So anyway, I promise gaming news. Let's get into it.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
Big Expo that happened this weekend was BlizzCon, which was a convention I went to a couple years ago.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Had a pretty good time. That was the year they announced Overwatch was the year I went.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
So that was a pretty big year. They had a lot of announcements. It was a pretty big seven.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
That was when people got to play Overwatch for the first time.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
This year people knew that there wouldn't be big announcements because there was no real new...

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
You know, Warcraft just got an expansion so they weren't going to announce one of those.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
I don't think Blizzard had anything secret they were working on so there was no real game.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
But I think a lot of people expected that there would be a Diablo expansion.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
A lot of rumors about Diablo 4, but then I think I had even said on last week's OLR the week before.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
And it'll probably be a Diablo 3 expansion. I would gather as a Diablo 3 fan, we're due for an expansion.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
And that didn't happen either.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
No, lower your expectations even more.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Apparently. Apparently.

06:40.000 --> 06:49.000
So no, the big Diablo news was that they are going to be recreating the original Diablo within Diablo 3 as an event.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So you can do the original maps.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
I mean, they're going so far as to actually do the original bosses as new bosses that'll be in these maps.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I don't know if the dude was joking or what, but he was talking about a retro filter as well.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And there's going to be unique rewards in this so it's going to be worth running.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
So that's neat, but there's also a part of me that goes,

07:08.000 --> 07:17.000
wow, all those resources you spent on recreating old bosses could have went to a new expansion and new bosses for that expansion.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
So that's a little bit disappointing as a Diablo fan.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
But it was cool that they announced that the Necromancer is going to be making its debut in Diablo 3.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
And a lot of people played the Necromancer in earlier Diablo games and were excited to see that it was coming back.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
But they are going to charge for that.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
They really slipped it in there that it's going to be part of a character pack that they're going to sell.

07:41.000 --> 07:49.000
I understand Blizzard's got to make money, so I don't think it's crazy that they're charging for the character, but I'm just...

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yes, I do.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Why is that?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Because they're making a ton of money already.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
They're making plenty of money.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
For example, look at Overwatch.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
Overwatch, you have the $60 base game, and then they're charging microtransactions on top of that.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It's like, come on.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Again, it depends what that price is.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
If it's something like $9.99, then all right, cool, whatever.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
If it's something like $20, I'm going to start to give it a little side-eye.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Because that's half as much as...

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
No, actually, I think you can probably buy the original Diablo 3 for $20 right now.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So if it's $20, I'm going to give it a little side-eye.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
But there's a part of me that worries they're going to sell the Necromancer in some pack that will be like,

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
you get the Necromancer and you get a banner for Heroes of the Storm and you get a pet for World of Warcraft.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
They're going to use that to justify the $20 cost.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
And I'm going to be like, no. No, no, no.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Stop putting it...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
It's like those forced...

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Remember when everybody was pissed off when the Wii was really hard to find?

08:50.000 --> 08:59.000
But GameStop would sell a $500 Wii bundle that was the Wii and a bunch of games and a controller.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
That's so strange that GameStop would do that.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
In fact, I saw similar things with the NES, was it the Classic that they're doing?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
That little micro console that's coming out?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
They're bundling it with a book.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
And they're bundling it with an extra controller and stuff and they're charging $120 for it.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
And I'm like, wait a second, that's not supposed to be $120. What the fuck?

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
So, needless to say, I'm going to be a little irritated if that's what they end up doing with the Necromancer.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
But we'll see. Again, I don't know what price that's going to be yet.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
Alan Alkeby pointing out, with Overwatch, you can buy loot boxes at rates like $4.99, $9.99, $20, and $40.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
Tech2030 saying, I just looked and Diablo 3 with Reaper of Souls is $30.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Now, all things considered, that's a really good deal for that game.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
If you're not playing Diablo 3 or haven't tried it yet, it's not what it was when it first came out.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
It's a really fun game and worth your time. And it's pretty good on consoles, too.

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
And they did announce, as part of BlizzCon, that Seasons, which have been a PC-exclusive thing, are going to come out on consoles.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
I miss the details of that. I don't know if any of you chatters over at live.vogniteware.com picked up on,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
does that mean that the consoles are going to have to be always online when they play Seasons?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Because how are they going to keep the integrity of Seasons?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Or do they just don't give a shit at this point?

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
Because you know those console versions are hacked to filth. Exploited, whatever you want to call it.

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
People are running through there with Paragon 1 billion levels that they got through Artificial XP Boost and things like that.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
So my question is, how are they going to keep that?

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
That was the PC thing that was very controversial, was it's going to have to be always online.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
But, hate it or whatever, the nice thing about it is that people can't really cheat in it.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Or if they do, it gets shut down really fast. So the leaderboards are pretty pure in that.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Whereas the console version, I'm not sure you could say the same thing with that.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
So, yeah, I'd be very curious if this console Season thing is going to be online.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Anyway, Diablo wasn't the only thing they talked about.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
They didn't say a lot with World of Warcraft, just because, again, their expansion just came out.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
But if you're really into that game, they started to detail what's going to come out with patch 7.2.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
And they're going to do a mini patch for 7.1.5 or something like that.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
I think they realized they've been really weak in patching.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
And they really got dragged for that in their last expansion, where that game went a year with no content patch.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
So I think Blizzard is really making a commitment to do that better.

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
Especially when one of their biggest competitors, a game that I play a lot, Final Fantasy XIV, does kind of have their patching thing down pretty well.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
Blizzard is now under pressure to step that up. That's why that competition is good.

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
Even though, as a fan of Final Fantasy XIV, I'll readily admit, it doesn't have nearly the number of subscribers that World of Warcraft does.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
But, I mean, WoW's come down a bit from its heyday. Final Fantasy XIV has done pretty okay for itself.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
So, I mean, it's not even a blip on the radar type of thing.

12:10.000 --> 12:18.000
So that's cool that Blizzard is stepping up their game in that regard to patching and offering a lot of stuff for the upcoming patches.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
Starcraft 2, admittedly, I don't play that a lot, so I kind of tuned out.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
But I think I caught that they're going to have an additional single player campaign that they're going to sell.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
So basically another DLC pack type of thing. That's what they're going to do for Starcraft 2.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
But they didn't spend a lot of time on that.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
And then they mentioned with Hearthstone, that Hearthstone is getting another expansion.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Which is, I think they do about two expansions a year for Hearthstone, so that's kind of par for the course.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
They spent a lot of time on that. I'm not super into Hearthstone, but I realize a lot of people are.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
And the fact that you can kind of pick it up with a tablet makes it very alluring for a lot of people.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
So, you know, I think it's good they're keeping that going in that competitive scene and so forth.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
So, cool, cool, I guess.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
But I was very, very, very interested by what they were saying about Overwatch.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
First off, Overwatch had the best reveal trailer out of anything.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
Because Overwatch announced that they are going to have a new character that is not DLC.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
That will just be in the game, as they've promised new maps and characters will be.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
And this is the one that they've been teasing for a long time, Sombra.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
And they announced Sombra with a really cute reveal trailer that was supposed to be an Overwatch behind the scenes thing.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
And then suddenly, like, the audio cut out and does all this stuff and you start to think,

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
Uh-oh, LOL Blizzcon fuck-up live, haha, just like our first take earlier this evening, haha, that type of thing.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
And it turns out, oh no, gotcha, it was Sombra hacking it and they did a little reveal thing and they did a little short.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And it was very, very well done.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.000
And, you know, the strength of the character design in Overwatch, I mean, when you play Overwatch, it's like, you would think Disney did it.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm not saying like Disney games necessarily, I'm just saying you would think you're playing a Disney movie.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
Even though Disney movies don't usually shoot people in the face, I can't explain it.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
It's just like the character development in Overwatch is that strong.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
And these characters are so good and Sombra really, really sticks out as well.

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
And I could go into the whole spiel on, and they're diverse too, which is great, but, you know, I've said it before.

14:23.000 --> 14:33.000
But, then they announced, it wasn't even so much that that caught my attention, although that makes me happy, even though I'm still terrible at Overwatch, but I like the character Sombra a lot.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
But it was the fact that they announced this Overwatch League. Did you see this? Their announcement for the Overwatch League?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
Because you know Blizzard has really been pushing into esports, and half of Blizzcon is esports.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
It almost feels like more than half of Blizzcon right now is esports.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
It's the finals for WoW Arena, it's the final for Hearthstone, now they do Overwatch, it's the finals for all these big competitions.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
And now they're talking about, they're really making this push for Overwatch, they want to make a freaking league.

15:02.000 --> 15:14.000
Like, NFL style league that is based on the cities you live in, and not necessarily, you know, these other types of teams that are formed around corporate sponsorship.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
Not that that's necessarily bad, because that's how esports has kind of maintained itself today.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
So, Blizzard is kind of wanting to change the game a little bit, I think.

15:22.000 --> 15:35.000
And I'm going to, I will readily admit, I am not well versed enough in the world of esports to really understand how this is different, and like in the weeds, how this is going to be very different from what we see today.

15:35.000 --> 15:46.000
But it really feels to me like Blizzard is really, really pushing this to be that game that is going to be, you know, the sport that is on TV.

15:46.000 --> 15:55.000
And yes, I realize ESPN2 has aired some matches in here and there, things like that, and they've done some stuff on what, TNT or TBS, one of those networks as well.

15:55.000 --> 16:03.000
But, I mean, this is probably going to be Blizzard's big, big push to really try to maybe dominate that conversation in a way, with one of their games.

16:03.000 --> 16:13.000
They're talking, what, salaries and benefits with contract signing and all this stuff? Like, again, the same thing you would expect of like a player signing up for the NFL.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
So, this is very, very interesting how the game is going to change with that.

16:18.000 --> 16:28.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, Overwatch knocked League of Legends out of the top on Twitch for a bit after Sombra was announced.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
I think Hearthstone also came in third after League of Legends, that BlizzCon hype.

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
Kaijuto says, if they do a league, they have to do a minor league. I would be curious how that would work as well.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Sign me up for the minor, minor, minor league.

16:41.000 --> 16:49.000
That's right, right? Can I be the water boy for the team? Because I'm not sure I can do too well at the game itself.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
William Ritterface says, I wonder if they have the money for that because that's a whole other ballpark.

16:55.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, I don't know how that's going to work. I'm assuming we're not talking multi-million dollar deals here, but I don't know.

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
Where is that money going to come from and how is that all going to work? We'll see the details.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Well, you see, we charge for an expansion for Diablo 3 to add the Necromancer.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Yes, but Diablo isn't fucking Overwatch.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
It doesn't matter. It's all the same umbrella there.

17:18.000 --> 17:26.000
Really, we charge way too much that we should be charging, but we'll use it as an excuse as we're promoting this esports thing.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Meanwhile, line in our pockets.

17:28.000 --> 17:36.000
I don't know. I'm very interested to see more details and see what this really looks like when it starts to unfold.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
I'm not going to kid myself that I'm any good to get into something like this, but can you imagine?

17:41.000 --> 17:49.000
Loki, can you imagine? Can you imagine if 15 years ago, Konami had started the Dance Dance Revolution League?

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Can you imagine what that would have looked like, Loki?

17:52.000 --> 17:59.000
Can you imagine if we'd been making salaries and benefits off dancing to arrows on the screen?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
I mean, my my, how far can you...

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
Considering the current state of Konami, you probably wouldn't look that great.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Sad but true, but...

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
You'd be dancing with a, you know, wood arrow on the corner.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
Kaijuto in chat says if they don't do a minor league, they can do fantasy draft so we can play along.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
They're gonna have to go more interactive than just watching shit, and maybe that's where the money comes from.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
Fantasy draft, really? Just play the fucking game at that point. I mean, it's just not even worth it.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
But maybe it's something where you play along with the pros? I don't know. I don't know how that works out.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
But I figure like that's something there.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Stoppy in chat points out Tracer is already in my fantasies.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
DungeonBuster says you're doing a dance event. Okay, where are we going? A pachinko parlor.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
SSG100Matt says I remember when DDR was considered in ESPN's Summer X Games.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I remember those days well too. They're long gone.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
I could have been an Olympic contender once, but then I took a DDR arrow to the knee.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
I could have been a contender, but then I gained like 50, 60, 70 pounds.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I could have been a contender.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Could have been a contender, but I stopped exercising.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
But then I started a podcast.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
I got married, had kids, and they sucked all the life out of me.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Anyway, that was pretty much all I got out of BlizzCon.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
What about you, Loki? Is there anything you caught out of BlizzCon I didn't touch on there that you wanted to mention?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I was like, oh, hey, BlizzCon's going on right now?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I didn't realize that was going on.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
I heard people complaining about Diablo, and I'm like, alright, I'm done.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Well, since I was home sick, and yes, I really was sick.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
I was not one of those people that was like, I'm sick and I gotta stay home and watch BlizzCon.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
I like Blizzard, but I could have looked at a live blog on my phone on break or something.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
You weren't staying home to watch, was it Animal Crossing? Their little...

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
No, no, I was really fucking sick.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
But I was like, well, I might as well make the best of it.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
So in between naps, I did watch the live thing.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Which, you know, I think may be the first time I've been able to do that.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Besides the year I was actually there in person.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
So, I mean, that was cool that I could watch that, I guess.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
But, you know, pretty much the same stuff you'd catch on a live blog or what have you anyway.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
But yeah, I hope those that went to BlizzCon had fun.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
You know, a large part of BlizzCon is just being with the people.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Especially for these people that are so...

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
And I count myself, I say these people, but I'm really one of them.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
That are so invested in games like World of Warcraft, where you play with people from across a great distance.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
You know, BlizzCon for many people is like the one time a year where everybody can kind of get together.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
If you were able to get a ticket.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
And get in and celebrate, you know, in the same place.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And people meet up with guildies and all this stuff.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
So, I know that's a big part of it for a lot of people.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
And, you know, the WoW community when we were doing Horde House was always very welcoming and so forth.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
So, you know, nothing but hearts for the folks at BlizzCon this weekend.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
And I'm sure the event was run better than the one I ranted about a few weeks ago.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
But we won't go there because I still love that game too.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And I'm not going to get negative tonight. I'm just not.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm too sick.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
That's why I'm here.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
That's why you're here.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Alright.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
William Murderface says he got that BlizzCon flu.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The year I went, I probably did.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
But this year, no.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I didn't go to any conventions to get this flu.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I just, I went to work and that's how I got sick, I think.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Somebody at work was probably sick or something happened.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I don't know.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Anyway.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Let's talk about our gaming week.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
So, how was your gaming week and what types of games did you play this week besides BlizzCon stuff?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

21:50.000 --> 21:58.000
I reluctantly played Ingress this week because I felt some sort of obligation to keep a streak of, was it, 13?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
Well, 12 cycles.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
And so, you know, they're trying to make it 13.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.000
And it's just, it's very conflicting because it's at the point where it's like, it really feels like a chore.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
And, yeah.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
And it just, I don't know.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
But I'm still doing it for some dumb reason because I sit there with like a, you know, time to waste.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
And it's just like, I could be doing something else.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
But no, here I'm going to try to play Ingress and I really don't know why I do it.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
I think you really have to treat that game like any other MMO.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
I think you really do.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
And that's really what it is.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
It's just an MMO, but it takes place in the real world or what have you.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
I like the win, but there's like, you have to understand the odds are stacked against us.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
It's our team right now because the other side has lots of people that are retired that play this all day long.

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
For one. And two, there's a lot more people in my area on the other team that are playing versus me.

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
So it's like, you know, it's very frustrating because it's like, what am I going to do?

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
There's really no way that this is going to come out in my favor.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Well, without getting too far into strategy discussion or things like that,

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
you have to remember you're also coming off this 12-week winning streak type of thing where it's like,

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
okay, for a while we've been kicking a lot of ass and the team still kicks a lot of ass.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
But it's just that I think the other side is really sick of losing.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
So they're trying some new tricks and some things like that.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
So when the old tricks don't work, you have to kind of put on your thinking hat and say,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
maybe I'm going to take solace in.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I'm going to be the biggest pain in the ass.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
And now you're going to be the spoiler for what they're doing.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And that's where you can get your rewards out of the game.

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
And for the first year in the game when it was like that the entire time I was playing,

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
that's where you kind of get a lot of rewards from it is that, oh, well, I'm spoiling their shit.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
That's funny.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
So I think you just have to kind of take that approach.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
It is just a game for fuck's sake.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It's like any other MMO.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
It's not that serious at the end of the day.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
But it's a very zen thing.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
The other night I was like, I'm going to go out and just play for an hour

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
because I don't want to play my console games right now.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I just kind of want to go for a drive.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
So I went out and played and made some fields, had fun, and that was that.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
The other stuff I played, I meant to actually play something other than Ingress this week.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
So I went ahead and played some more PlayStation VR.

24:25.000 --> 24:32.000
So I fired up, I downloaded that Call of Duty demo thing that they've got.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
I don't remember the hell it was called, but let's see here.

24:37.000 --> 24:45.000
That was the Jackal Assault because it meant that much to me knowing the name.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
And it's just, I don't even know why they put it together to be honest.

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
For people that have a PlayStation VR or played the demo disc,

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
it's like that demo that they've got for Eve Valkyrie, which I think is badass.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
But a very budget, not so great version of that.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
So it basically starts off the same thing.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
You're flying this ship around and you're scanning some shit.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
And then all of a sudden things warp in and you have to destroy ships.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
It's like literally the same fucking demo as Eve Valkyrie.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
The problem is it's so cheap looking.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Like Eve Valkyrie feels fucking amazing.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Correct me if I'm wrong though, but isn't the Jackal one free

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
and the Eve thing is a demo for what's going to be a $60 game?

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
Right, it is free, but technically both are demos for $60 games if you want to.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
But in the other games that aren't even in VR, it's just...

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
I'm comparing demo to demo because I'm not buying the $60 Eve Valkyrie game.

25:52.000 --> 26:02.000
Seriously, we need to fill that void of a really kick-ass single-player flight sim game would be amazing.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
You want to go old school and go Wing Commander VR?

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I want to go fucking Colony Wars or Wing Commander or some shit like that.

26:08.000 --> 26:14.000
Because Eve was fantastic. I don't want to play constant MMO.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Not necessarily, just like an online multiplayer game.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
That's not what I'm interested in. I want to play a solid campaign or something.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
That game felt very badass.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
This game on the other hand, this little Jackal assault thing, felt very fucking cheap.

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
In fact, one of the things I noticed on it, the explosions when you destroy something are flat sprites.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
It's like, holy shit. Seriously? This is the crap that we're pulling 2016?

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
Flat fucking sprites on the explosions? It looks so goddamn cheap.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
Zero out of ten. Explosions are completely unrealistic.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
No, it wasn't that they're unrealistic. It's just so cheap. It's so terrible.

26:54.000 --> 27:00.000
I'm not using the proper VoG network scale. F the bad explosions.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
It just wasn't good. It just wasn't interesting at all.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
It was just kind of like, well, cool. This isn't going to get me the buy Call of Duty.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
You just see how many ships you can blow up in a certain amount of time.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
It's free I guess, but the demo for Eve Valkyrie is free as well.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
I got a lot more enjoyment out of that than I did this.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
I don't know. It was just kind of lame. I'm kind of disappointed.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I was hoping Lisa would be on par with the other one.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I do want to point out Bobby Blackwell says,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I thought Jackal Assault was well done for what it was.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Also points out Elite Dangerous is in VR.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
I don't know if that's a game that interests you, but maybe something to check out.

27:40.000 --> 27:48.000
Yeah, but that's not on PlayStation 4. I know Elite Dangerous is on PC.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
Oh yeah, because you had to get rid of the Oculus to get the PlayStation VR, huh?

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
I don't have a computer that can run it anyways, so it's no big deal.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
The other thing I did play through is I played through Rez Infinite, which is pretty fun.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
I kind of understood a little bit more of the game mechanics than I did the original time playing through.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
I didn't really remember too much of the game, but it was fun.

28:11.000 --> 28:17.000
And then the Area X thing, which is interesting, because for people that may not have played Rez,

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
may think, oh, that's just an extra level that they added to the game.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
But no, it's actually a completely separate game that's in the style of Rez.

28:26.000 --> 28:34.000
It's in a completely different engine. They made the whole thing in Unreal 4, and it's just fantastic looking.

28:34.000 --> 28:40.000
It's unlike Rez, which is kind of an on-rails shooter, this is pretty much a free form.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
You can go wherever you want and stuff in the game, which is kind of cool.

28:44.000 --> 28:53.000
And then Rez is very kind of old school, like, vector-y, just very low poly stuff.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
Whereas the Area X was very particle crazy.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
Like, everything you blew up exploded in a cloud of particles, and it looked cool.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
That game's kind of visual presence.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
I thought it was really neat, especially being able to fly wherever you want in there.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
And it looked fantastic. It's like, this gives me hope for another Rez game.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Make it like that, because that was fantastic.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
And it looked much better compared to the actual game in VR, actually.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
But they're both great. It was a fun experience in both of them, so I enjoyed it.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
But yeah, it was quick. I finished that really fast, and I guess I still have the bonus levels to play through.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
But I don't know. I enjoyed it in VR. I thought it was a fun experience.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
And I guess I found out that I don't get motion sick from any of this stuff.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Because on all these games where they're like, okay, you can have a few settings.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
This is for VR experts, you know. It's a lot of movement. This is this.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
I'm like, always crank it up. The more movement, the better. I don't really care.

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
So, I don't know. But yeah, definitely if you haven't gotten a chance to, check out Area X in Rez Infinite.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
Because it's fantastic. It's basically a sequel to Rez, almost. But sadly, only one level of it.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Alright.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
That's it.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
That's it. My Gaming Week. I don't really have...

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Oh, excuse me.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
One more thing. Because I wanted, you know, this was a recommendation. I tried PolitiCats.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Oh, you did?

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
I did try PolitiCats. I played it for a little bit, and I uninstalled it because I hated that game.

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
I'm sorry. You know, I like clicker games. I do. But for some reason, that one just did not hook me.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
It would just, it didn't hook me.

30:34.000 --> 30:41.000
I have failed in checking it out, I regret to say. So, I can't really argue with you one way or the other on this.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Or support you. But why was it so bad?

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
I don't know. It's just the presentation of it. I just didn't like it. I don't know what it is.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Cats are not cute enough. Kitten explosions were bad. F.

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
No, the cats are fine. The art style is cute and everything, but it just didn't seem interesting to me at all.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
It just, I don't know. It didn't hook me like Katamari or something.

31:04.000 --> 31:11.000
Maybe it's because it's a completely random, random franchise or something.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
SSG100Matt suggests, it didn't hook him in because he couldn't cheat in it.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
Now, that's not true, but yes.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Alright.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
It wasn't because I couldn't cheat in it, it was because it just wasn't interesting.

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
Alright, my gaming week. Sadly, not a lot of new stuff to really report. I've been continuing in Final Fantasy XIV.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
I was also playing Dragon Quest Builders, and I finally got to the end of chapter one.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
Which I know doesn't sound like very far, like, oh, good job, you got to the end of chapter one.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
But I swear, it took, like, I've been playing at least ten hours. At least.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
And, I mean, like, yeah, I feel like it took me a while to get there to the end of chapter one.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
So, maybe I'm just slow with the way I've been progressing things, and doing kind of like that OCD collecting and side quest thing.

31:59.000 --> 32:07.000
But, yeah, so I finally got to the final boss, who's a bit of a pain in the ass, and I realized that I need better stuff.

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
So, I think what happens, based on some other stuff I picked up around Twitter, is that I think there's only, like, three chapters in the game.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
So, even though I'm like, ooh, chapter one, I think that actually is a lot further than you'd think.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
And I get the sense that you have to, I mean, minor spoiler, but I don't think so.

32:23.000 --> 32:29.000
You have to start over when you do chapters two and three, basically, but you're in a new part of the world with new stuff.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
So, it's kind of like starting over.

32:32.000 --> 32:42.000
So, yeah, but anyway, for fighting the boss at the end of chapter one, I realized I didn't have enough of the end game stuff that I needed to really effectively fight the guys.

32:42.000 --> 32:51.000
So, I was like, alright, I've got to spend more time killing the rocks that explode, which is their version of creepers, to get, you know, to craft the bombs I need to take down the boss.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
But anyway, so that's something I was working on.

32:54.000 --> 33:01.000
And then, I've also been playing Civilization VI, which came out a couple weeks ago.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
And I'm finding that that game is hard.

33:05.000 --> 33:16.000
It's harder than any of the previous civilizations, based on the fact that I don't, like, when I play on the easiest difficulty, which is where I will always start my civilization experience, the easiest difficulty.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
And then, when I feel comfortable, I'll kick it up another level and again and again.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
But, like, this time, even on the easiest difficulty, I'm having trouble just trouncing the competition.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
And so, I think the type of old strategies I've been using are wrong now.

33:30.000 --> 33:38.000
And I understand that they want to do that to mix up things a little bit and that not the same old trick, like we just mentioned, sometimes you have to use new tricks.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
So, I understand that I have to do that.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
But, yeah, I just kind of wasn't ready for how different that was all going to be.

33:46.000 --> 33:58.000
So, yeah, again, it blows my mind that some people say Civ VI is, like, the same thing as Civ V, because unless you're looking at it on a purely visual, aesthetic level, I don't know how the fuck you can say that.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
I really don't. Like, the game plays very, very differently than Civ V to me.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
So, yeah. So, I'm still kind of learning and moving along in that game.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
And I'll let you guys know if I'm able to actually get in a position where I can win a damn game. I'll let you know.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
So, yeah, there was that. And I'll mention this quickly.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
Last night, I was hanging out with my pals, Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
And you might know them because they do a show here at VOG Network called gamebuoy.org.

34:29.000 --> 34:36.000
But we were all playing a game called TKO, which is part of the Jackbox Party Pack, right?

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
So, Jackbox Party Pack 3 came out. And I think we talked about a couple of those games last week, right?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Yes, we did.

34:41.000 --> 34:48.000
We played Murder Party. Well, this time, Captain Spike was doing, like, a late Halloween get-together type of thing.

34:48.000 --> 34:57.000
So, there were several people there. And so, it was like, okay, you know, Jackbox Party Pack being with a bunch of gamer nerds, it made for a great, like, easy thing to just put on the TV.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
That's what everybody can just kind of do. So, we were playing Trivia Murder Party, okay?

35:01.000 --> 35:14.000
But then we played TKO, which, you know, when I had heard it described to me, you know, it was mentioned that, oh, you know, some people draw things and you come up with slogans and then you kind of put them together in their shirts and you vote on the best shirts.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
And I was like, that doesn't sound funny. Like, that doesn't sound as strong as the other stuff.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
But I was totally wrong. Like, that game is fucking hilarious.

35:25.000 --> 35:35.000
And I laughed. I don't think I've laughed that hard in my life since the episode of South Park where Mr. Garrison gets a sex change.

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
I have not laughed that hard in my life that I did last night when we were playing TKO.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
And, granted, this was with sick, disturbing people, so I'm not going to repeat for you the things that came up in the game.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Oh, come on.

35:48.000 --> 35:56.000
I don't need, I'll tell you off air, because I don't need Tumblr against me. But, I mean, this was just, it was hilarious.

35:56.000 --> 36:06.000
So, yeah, what happens is you draw pictures, and you can draw anything you want. You just draw pictures so you know somebody's going to draw a dick. You know somebody's going to draw a dick.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
Okay, I'll tell you one shirt that happened that is, in my opinion, is not that controversial.

36:11.000 --> 36:20.000
Take me through, like, how do you play this? Because, like, does everybody draw, like, a picture, then everybody comes up with a slogan and you mix and match them to come up with, like, the best shirt?

36:20.000 --> 36:30.000
Kind of, yes. Okay, so, first round comes up. You draw three pictures. Okay, so you use your shitty little paint program on your phone to draw the pictures with your finger.

36:30.000 --> 36:37.000
Although, Alan was like, you know, oh, I left my stylist at home. I was like, oh, you would. You would have been trying to use your stylist to play this shit.

36:37.000 --> 36:45.000
But, anyway, so you draw pictures. So, somebody always draws a dick, you know, depending on the group you're playing with, or even worse, with the group I was with.

36:45.000 --> 36:56.000
And then, the next round is just submit as many slogans as you can. And you don't have pictures, it's just submit slogans in, like, 60 seconds.

36:56.000 --> 37:05.000
So, some people will get four in, some people get ten in. Then what happens is everybody on their phone gets one picture, or no, three pictures and four slogans.

37:05.000 --> 37:15.000
And you have to mix and match between the pictures and the slogans which one makes the best shirt. And then the shirts go head to head in a strongest M&M style competition.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
Where, basically, it's like the first one fights the second one and then, you know, you push them together. Whichever one cracks first, you eat.

37:20.000 --> 37:28.000
And then the surviving M&M goes on to the next M&M, right? The M&M gauntlet. It's that type of voting. And then, yeah, that's how it works.

37:28.000 --> 37:40.000
And then the shirt, there's a gauntlet winner and then a streak winner. And then the whole process repeats again, but you only draw one drawing to replace the one that got picked, like you do less slogans.

37:40.000 --> 37:48.000
And then, in the very last round, all the winning shirts go through one more battle and then you come up with a supreme champion that way.

37:48.000 --> 37:58.000
So, like, one of the shirts that almost won was somebody just drew a bunch of dicks. It was just like a little dick and a big dick and different colored dicks.

37:58.000 --> 38:10.000
It was like all these dicks in the picture, right? Because my friends are mature. And it got matched up with the slogan, which if you've ever seen RuPaul's Drag Race, Tatiana was very famous for saying, Choices.

38:11.000 --> 38:20.000
So, you had this shirt with all these different dicks on it that says, Choices. And that shirt almost won. It was like the second place thing.

38:20.000 --> 38:33.000
But then what was brilliant that they did, and I would be dying to know how much money they're making off of it. If Jackbox people still listen to this show, somebody send me a tweet on the down low, so I don't want to know how much money you're making off this.

38:33.000 --> 38:49.000
At the very end, there's a button that says, Click here to purchase the shirts in the game. So, if I wanted to go to the next Rocky Horror Show and wear a shirt with a bunch of dicks on it, crudely drawn, that says, Choices on the bottom, I could do it through TKO.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
So, I thought that was pretty funny.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
That's pretty awesome.

38:52.000 --> 38:58.000
Yeah, it was pretty awesome. So, that was one of those games that, in execution, it actually worked a lot better than I thought it would in theory.

38:59.000 --> 39:08.000
And then real quickly, we also played the Fake In It game. I didn't like it as much. It's too hard to be the faker. It is too hard to be the faker.

39:08.000 --> 39:20.000
Like, in theory, it's a cute concept and stuff, and I know bluffing games are really fun, but it was way too easy to figure out who the faker was every time, even when it was me.

39:20.000 --> 39:28.000
I tried really hard to lie, but one of my friends was like, Your lip quivered slightly before you pointed, and I know you're the fucking liar.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
And I was like, How the fuck? Are you a fucking cop? What is that? I'm like, I know you're not a cop.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
You're a cop?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I know, right? Are we all cops?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Some sort of cop or something?

39:40.000 --> 39:55.000
Anyway, it's okay that there's one game in a pack that makes you go, because we played a little Quiplash 2, which was good as well, so there's a lot of strong games in that pack.

39:55.000 --> 40:01.000
And I think even the last pack had a game that made you go, They all kind of have one game that's okay.

40:01.000 --> 40:07.000
But there's probably somebody out there who loves that game the most, so whatever, more props to them.

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
Going to chat, SSJ100Matt says, This sounds hilarious. Rob needs to stream this next time this happens.

40:15.000 --> 40:26.000
No, because again, I don't need Tumblr. Here's the thing, I'll give you the watered down politically correct version if we're going to stream it.

40:26.000 --> 40:36.000
But some bad things happen in these games, so I'm just, it's not as bad as I'm making it sound, but I'm just like, I might want to run for elected office some year, let's put it that way.

40:37.000 --> 40:46.000
I would still do it. I would stand up on stage, you know, doing the debates, wearing my Dicks and Choices shirt.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
Alright, let's see. Vidpower in chat says, Gamers draw penises? Shocking.

40:54.000 --> 41:01.000
Stoppy says, I'm guessing there was a lot of make blank great again shirts. No, I don't remember seeing a lot of that as a slogan.

41:01.000 --> 41:10.000
I did submit the slogan, I'm Captain Spike and I approve this message, thinking that somebody would again like draw a butthole or something that that would get paired up with.

41:10.000 --> 41:17.000
But no, the slogan never got used. Unfortunately, not all the slogans get used, so it didn't work out. But anyway.

41:17.000 --> 41:23.000
Alright, Dark Tetsuya in chat says, Doesn't Travis already have dirt on you though Rob?

41:23.000 --> 41:32.000
He's still desperately trying to find the public access show, but it's, I'm pretty sure those tapes have disintegrated by now. That shows like over 20 years old at this point.

41:32.000 --> 41:42.000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on. We pretty much already talked about our housekeeping, so again, no show next Sunday.

41:42.000 --> 41:49.000
So for those listening on the podcast feed, you're going to have to wait a little extra longer for a show, but the good news is, it's kind of like interest.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
You don't get a show next week, but you'll get two shows the next week.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
And you can use that time to play all the games that are coming out because there's so many games.

41:56.000 --> 42:04.000
Oh, this is that week. This is that week before Black Friday, well not right before, but there's always a huge week in November where like everything comes out.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
So, I'm going to go on a random tangent, well it's not a random tangent I guess, it sort of has to do with my game week.

42:09.000 --> 42:19.000
So, I seem to be completely making 180 decisions, everything that I've come to like decide originally, and I'm just like hmm, I'm going to do the exact opposite.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Oh, totally the same.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
So, I'm thinking now I'm probably going to get a PlayStation Pro.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
Me too, me too. I am getting the PlayStation 4 Pro.

42:27.000 --> 42:37.000
And if you ask me why, I can't even really give you a good reason besides like, oh no, I want to play Final Fantasy 15 the best way possible.

42:37.000 --> 42:46.000
Well, just like looking at like some of the enhancements that they're doing for like VR and stuff, I think that might be kind of useful as well because the games look better on that.

42:47.000 --> 43:02.000
I don't know if I'm going to get one right away, but I think that would be the best time to trade in a system and stuff because like even like if I went to Evil G or whatever, you get 150 bucks and then you've, you know, pretty much 250 at that point.

43:02.000 --> 43:10.000
So, it's not that big a deal. I don't have to say though. It may wait because it's not, you know, a whole big deal, but eventually it might be nice to get one.

43:11.000 --> 43:21.000
Because right now I have a 1080p TV, so it's not, you know, it's not going to notice a huge difference. Once I get a 4K TV, then fuck yeah, but right now it's not going to happen.

43:21.000 --> 43:29.000
Nope, I have my PS4 Pro in pre-order and I'm probably going to go ahead and let it go through and get the system and I probably will sell my PlayStation 4.

43:30.000 --> 43:40.000
I'll probably sell it like, not like on eBay, but like kind of go to Facebook first and be like, who wants a PlayStation 4 and, you know, kind of do it that way and then, you know, kind of go from there.

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
Because I'm kind of like, okay, well, if I can sell it like really cheap and one of my friends gets it like, and I still get some money recovered, like it's kind of a win, right?

43:47.000 --> 43:57.000
So, I'm really probably going to do that and then get the PlayStation 4 Pro, but I didn't end up getting the PlayStation VR and I was convinced I was going to.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
But even still, I'm kind of like, eh, I think I'll hold off a little bit. I want to wait and see what 2017 makes for right now.

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
I'm not sure there's enough like single player, I just want to sit and play by myself type of stuff right now on VR.

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
And a lot of it's really short, like Robinson The Journey looks all right, but even that's kind of like, okay, I don't know.

44:14.000 --> 44:25.000
I just want to see what develops. I really enjoy it when Shane brings his over or at least the time he did, I enjoyed it, you know, but, and hopefully he'll bring it by again sometime, but I'm not in a rush, I'm not in a rush to pick up my own system.

44:26.000 --> 44:34.000
Yes, and I am thinking about that as well is that, you know, 15 is coming out soon and I know I'm going to play that a lot. So, yeah, there's that.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
So, all right, well, let's get into the gaming news that we do have for the week. Loki, starting us off.

44:39.000 --> 44:45.000
So, there was the rumor that Nintendo had stopped production on the Wii U, but apparently that is incorrect.

44:46.000 --> 44:58.000
And they're saying that apparently IT Media contacted Nintendo and a spokesperson said there has been no change in continuing Wii U productions.

44:58.000 --> 45:05.000
So, apparently it is still being produced. At least that's what we're led to believe.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.000
Honestly, with there not being any new games coming out for it, I don't think it's going to be much longer that it's going to be produced.

45:14.000 --> 45:22.000
Yeah, I mean, I think one reason a lot of people were running with the story when it was reported is, well, it sounds plausible. Your favorite, everybody.

45:22.000 --> 45:29.000
No, not the, I mean, it makes sense because, you know, there's still the Wii U version of the Zelda game coming out later on in March.

45:29.000 --> 45:39.000
So, obviously you're going to sell some systems maybe for that, assuming hopefully they'll be smart enough to drop the price of the system if they're releasing, you know, the Switch and everything.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
But how many-

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
We still don't know how much the Switch is going to be.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
How many more Wii U's are they really going to sell?

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Not a lot.

45:45.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah, and so there is going to come a point where they have to say, okay, we're going to sell through what we have left on shelves and that's that.

45:52.000 --> 46:02.000
And Nintendo probably does want that to be at a point where people instead go over to the Switch. I mean, they don't necessarily want both systems existing on the Switch.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
They want them to Switch over.

46:04.000 --> 46:19.000
But, I mean, if we do see that a lot of Wii U games are being redone for the Switch, like we saw Mario Kart 8 and we saw Splatoon in that trailer, I fully realize we don't know exactly what that looks like yet, but hear me out.

46:19.000 --> 46:29.000
If the Switch is doing redone, reimagined versions of those games or whatever, then I can see where maybe they're a little more eager to kind of push the Wii U out the window.

46:29.000 --> 46:41.000
Which I know seems weird, like why would a company want to push their system out that fast? But, you know, I think to really make the Switch come out with a bang, I could see why they'd want to do that.

46:41.000 --> 46:50.000
But, you know, I fully realize Nintendo denied the story. I understand why they kind of need to deny the story going into the holidays.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
I mean, they would still like to sell Wii U's this holiday, don't get me wrong.

46:54.000 --> 47:05.000
I think we fully realize that Nintendo is instead looking to Pokemon Sun and Moon on the 3DS, the Nintendo Mini, and these other ways that they're going to make money during the holidays.

47:05.000 --> 47:13.000
But, I don't think Nintendo wants to suddenly say like, oh no, don't buy a Wii, you're not going to be able to find a Wii U this holiday. Nintendo does not want to say that.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
It wouldn't make any sense, yeah.

47:15.000 --> 47:27.000
But, I mean, can we, I mean, Loki, I don't know, I didn't look at the direct quotes. Can we read between the lines that maybe Nintendo could scale back productions?

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
They're not stopping, but maybe one factory is type of thing.

47:33.000 --> 47:43.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure they've got the plan to ramp it down. I don't think that they're producing a ton of them. There's not like it's going to be a shortage on the Wii U.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
I just don't think there's anything out there that's really driving that purchase right now.

47:47.000 --> 47:56.000
Granted, in March, you know, you will have the Zelda game, and that's a big factor is what those two systems are in price because of the Switches.

47:56.000 --> 48:08.000
If people are looking to buy the Switch for Zelda, and they have a Wii U already, and the price of the Switch is higher than we want, they may hold off on the Switch.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
True.

48:09.000 --> 48:15.000
I mean, especially if all they're offering is like, hey, there's these games that you've already had that have some extra shit in them.

48:15.000 --> 48:21.000
I mean, I don't know, I just, we need to get more information on what's going to be launched with it.

48:21.000 --> 48:30.000
Because if it's just old Wii U games, that's great if you're getting into it, but if you already have a Wii U, it's kind of like, why am I purchasing these?

48:30.000 --> 48:36.000
But now we know, right after the holidays are over, what is it, January 12th, Nintendo's coming out swinging with the Switch stuff.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
So these answers we're going to have right at the beginning of the year.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
Although they have a new Excite truck, I am going to have to purchase that day.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Oh, even Loki.

48:44.000 --> 48:50.000
That is my, but you know what though, they're not. You know why? Because that would be too good.

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
And because if they're making an Excite truck, it makes no goddamn sense because why wouldn't they make an F-Zero?

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah. But what about a new F-Zero? A new F-Zero would do it for you too, right, Loki?

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Nah, I don't really like F-Zero that much.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
What? Get out. Out my house.

49:04.000 --> 49:09.000
Well, I'm sure the Switch is going to be luring a lot of people over.

49:09.000 --> 49:14.000
You know, we've had several AAA companies saying that, you know, they're planning on supporting the Switch.

49:15.000 --> 49:22.000
And there are indie developers as well talking about supporting the Switch and that some already have games in development.

49:22.000 --> 49:29.000
Nintendo Life did an interview with several different indie developers to get their thoughts and if they plan to support the Switch.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Are they going to support the Nintendo Switch in the future?

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
Yacht Club Games, a rep from them, said of course.

49:34.000 --> 49:40.000
Engine Software said we're already working on the platform and we hope to support it for a long time.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
Drinkbox Studios says yes, we do hope to support the Switch.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Choice Provisions says we hope to.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
We got our start with the Bit.Trip series on WiiWare and we plan to continue to bring our games to Nintendo platforms.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
We're not ashamed to admit that we're huge Nintendo fanboys and girls over here.

49:57.000 --> 50:03.000
Atui simply said yes and Shinen Multimedia said we've already been working on it for some time.

50:03.000 --> 50:11.000
So, it sounds like the Switch will be luring a lot of these, you know, well done indie studios as well as the AAA stuff.

50:11.000 --> 50:20.000
And that's important. You know, the big games are important but, you know, if the next Undertale or the next Five Nights at Freddy's is exclusive to the Switch.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
A lot of people are going to be looking at that.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Okay, you guys ready for Switch rumors? Your favorite part.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Oh yeah.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
You ready?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Should we bring out the wheel of plausibility?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Hold on, I think I have my song.

50:38.000 --> 50:44.000
Wheel of plausibility. Turn, turn, turn. Tell us the lessons we might learn.

50:44.000 --> 50:54.000
Alright, these are coming from Laura Kate Dale, which is one of the folks that was kind of doing a lot of those early rumors on the Switch, right?

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
Didn't she call a lot of the early stuff going on with the Switch before the trailer was out there?

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
I don't know.

51:01.000 --> 51:08.000
Well, the Nintendo Switch supposedly is going to support NFC ID cards.

51:08.000 --> 51:17.000
The card would allow you to download content from your friend's personal device, allowing you to get anything from new characters to digital games downloaded through the eShop.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
This could minimize the potential battery drain while the Nintendo Switch is in portable use.

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
A basic card reportedly included with the Nintendo Switch but additional cards for $10.

51:29.000 --> 51:36.000
This sounds a lot like Amiibo, so why are we getting both?

51:36.000 --> 51:46.000
I mean, is the NFC thing supposed to be a little bit more like, I guess I'm assuming you can fit maybe more on one of those little cards than you can on an Amiibo?

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
Like, when we say NFC card, we're talking about like an eAmusement Pass type thing, right?

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
So what's the point of this again?

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Well, we don't know.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
Allegedly, what is the point of this again?

51:56.000 --> 52:03.000
Easily download content from your friend's personal device, allowing you to get anything from new characters to digital games downloaded through the eShop.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Why would I want to do that?

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
Well, here's, okay, and some of the chatters are saying this as well.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Act F says, yeah, sounds like eAmuse.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Get your tinfoil hats on, alright?

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
Get the tarp out, get the tarp out, because I'm going to do fan wank everywhere.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
You ready?

52:20.000 --> 52:34.000
Alright, what if, like eAmuse, and if one of these comes with every Switch and you can get additional ones for extra charge, which I'm sure they would happily print cute Nintendo characters and things people want on these cards.

52:34.000 --> 52:42.000
What if these cards were like your identity, no matter where you are and what Switch you're playing.

52:42.000 --> 52:51.000
And that maybe you can unlock your own personal achievements on a friend's Switch when you've tapped into being the one playing that console.

52:51.000 --> 52:59.000
Or your records and your scores and your Super Mario levels, you can tap in on a friend's Switch, just like that.

52:59.000 --> 53:06.000
Like it's basically, essentially what I'm saying is that you are the amiibo with a fantasy card.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
That's dumb.

53:10.000 --> 53:16.000
I'm sorry, it's just, that's just, it's completely unnecessary.

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
Now, and I'm making this up, I'm pulling it out of my ass based on what this is.

53:22.000 --> 53:34.000
So we can't say Nintendo is or is not doing this, but I'm just thinking like, how could Nintendo kind of do this whole like, online gaming thing but put their own spin on it?

53:34.000 --> 53:45.000
And I think maybe rip, I don't want to say ripping off, but taking what's happening in the arcades with things like EMUs and stuff and maybe putting that into a console type environment.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
It's not a bad idea. I don't know why you think it's dumb as hell. I think that could be kind of neat.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Because, okay, you're comparing the arcade.

53:52.000 --> 53:59.000
Especially if it, okay, especially if it could also work on things like Pokken Tournament in the arcades. That's awesome.

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
And it's your Nintendo, it's your universal Nintendo ID that you'll inevitably lose because it's on a card.

54:06.000 --> 54:15.000
Yeah, that's assuming that they have that kind of support in the arcades. Like, it makes sense with EMUs because you're going to arcade machines, which you're not exactly going to be bringing that into your house.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
And you want to track your progress, of course, across all these different machines.

54:20.000 --> 54:31.000
And that makes sense. I'm not going to go over to my friend's house and tap my amiibo card or whatever the fuck it's going to be to log into their system for what, achievements and shit?

54:31.000 --> 54:42.000
Couldn't we just like, I don't know, like any other fucking system out there already, sign in, oh hey, I'm a guest, log in with your username and password, we're done.

54:42.000 --> 54:52.000
But, to be fair, Loki, that's a pain in the ass on the Xbox 360. I'm not so sure about the Xbox One because I haven't done that. Remember how you have to sit there and wait for it to download your entire fucking profile?

54:52.000 --> 54:58.000
And this wouldn't happen with the whole amiibo card thing, too, because those things aren't going to store a ton of data on it.

54:58.000 --> 55:07.000
Well, now that I'm thinking about it, aren't the Wiimotes supposed to have a little bit of memory in them? Can't you save a Mii to the Wiimote?

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Yeah, you can.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
So you can take your Mii over to a friend's house?

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
That's also very little data. I mean, that's basically the same type of data that's stored in a Mii.

55:16.000 --> 55:22.000
But, so it would show that there's precedent. So, Loki, it's plausible.

55:22.000 --> 55:35.000
No, it's stupid because no one ever uses that feature in the first place because, I don't know, it's just they're doing things just to do things. It doesn't make any sense to do them.

55:35.000 --> 55:45.000
It's not something that people are like, oh shit, I would totally play over at my friend's house if it weren't so cumbersome for me to log in on their system.

55:45.000 --> 55:53.000
I don't think it's that, Loki. I think it's that people don't realize they can log in on their friend's Xbox 360s.

55:53.000 --> 56:03.000
Most people don't realize that's a thing you can do. Nintendo can make it part of their ecosystem and they can sell it in a way where they'll be like,

56:03.000 --> 56:11.000
that cute little toad on a card, that is your identity. And all you have to do, and they'll show the little video of somebody going to their friend's house, be like, bing!

56:11.000 --> 56:21.000
And like the little sound that it'll make when they tap into their friend's Switch or whatever and then it's like, oh look, my Mii appeared and look, it brought over my Mario levels and all this shit and look what we can do now.

56:21.000 --> 56:28.000
You know that Nintendo can explain it to people in a way that Microsoft can't. That is why I think this idea is not as bad as you think it is.

56:28.000 --> 56:35.000
You explain it like it's gonna do that, but it's not.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
That's true, that's true.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
Because this is Nintendo and they don't fucking get it.

56:39.000 --> 56:44.000
We don't know, I am, again, I'm rolling around on the tarp right now.

56:44.000 --> 56:53.000
I mean, I'm just, I'm sorry, but this is not gonna happen. I mean, it's, you're still gonna have to download a profile, whatever, you know what, who cares?

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
Enough wank, enough wank, mom's home.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
It doesn't matter.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
I'll move on to the next thing, I just want to quickly say.

57:01.000 --> 57:08.000
Oh, and can we, while we're on the subject of Miis, can we please like fucking update that shit because they look fucking stupid at this point.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
And they look fucking dumb.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
Do they?

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
They do, they look fucking dumb.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
I don't think so, I think they're kind of part of the Nintendo culture at this point.

57:17.000 --> 57:26.000
Because they force fed that shit, it's just like fucking, you know, removing features from your products is part of Apple's culture, it doesn't necessarily mean something that we need to have.

57:26.000 --> 57:37.000
Alright, anyway, I don't know how you feel about this, Loki, but it sounds like those little previews of things we saw in the Switch trailer are Director's Cut editions.

57:37.000 --> 57:46.000
Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Brothers, apparently one of them as well, and Splatoon will be games that are rolled out as a Director's Cut edition for the Switch.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
It will include all previously released content and new extras.

57:51.000 --> 58:00.000
That is the other rumor going around too, which, you know, I think what many people are already thinking it probably is, except for the fact that Super Smash Brothers is included in that.

58:00.000 --> 58:05.000
But it makes an awful lot of sense, why not do Smash Brothers as part of that?

58:06.000 --> 58:16.000
I guess maybe because there's a lot of people that like to see an all new Smash Brothers on the Switch, but, you know, do you want to wait five years for them to develop one?

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
So, you know, anyhow.

58:20.000 --> 58:32.000
StoppyInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says, what if you took a hottie out on the first date, you pull out your wallet to get your credit card, and your Nintendo Switch It card falls out instead.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
You both stare in silence. What do you do next?

58:35.000 --> 58:43.000
Then she taps it to her Switch and finds out that you've made an amiibo that looks like Hitler as your fucking me.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
And then, you know, or penis head or something like that.

58:46.000 --> 58:54.000
Yes, that's what happens next, Stoppy. She pulls her Nintendo Switch out of her purse and she says, let's see what kind of gamer you are.

58:54.000 --> 59:04.000
And then taps the Switch card to her Switch and finds out that you are MrDicksLOL on the Nintendo Network.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
Then what happens, Stoppy? Then what happens?

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
SSG100Matt says, Sakurai says he wanted to take a long, long break from Smash Brothers.

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
Then again, Nintendo could pay him to reconsider. That's very true, money does talk, but at the same time, the man's earned a break.

59:24.000 --> 59:31.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, and his me name is Choices.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Exactly.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
Fuck you all, next story.

59:36.000 --> 59:46.000
So this was, this was, so this was the live thing that I watched, because it was like, oh, Nintendo Direct, cool.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
Maybe we'll get some cool information, but then the back of my brain said, you're right.

59:51.000 --> 59:58.000
So there was a free update for Animal Crossing that they announced for Animal Crossing New Leaf.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It adds amiibo support, because why the fuck not? And then RVs.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Yeah, so it's called Welcome Amiibo.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And basically you can, you know, take your amiibos and you can even bring in, I guess, some of the non-Animal Crossing amiibos,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
which I think also like kind of adds skins and stuff for your characters or like different clothing.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Some of the other stuff that they have, you can actually get an RV and a new RV campground.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:39.000
And you can even, I guess, they have some different mini games, including Animal Crossing Puzzle League.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Oh, that's cool that they brought in like some of the mini game stuff.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Yeah. And they said that Desert Island Escape.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But I guess with the amiibos, what that does is it actually brings the villager, whatever villager you want into your village.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So like if you have a favorite villager or something, you can go purchase one of those amiibo cards.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Although if I remember correctly, I think they're all blind packs, so fuck you guys.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:12.000
But you can try to find one for the villagers that you like and then you scan it and then they come in their RV and you can, I don't know, hang out or something.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And question your life that you purchased cards.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Stop it.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Get a character in your town.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Hey, you know what, I think it's rad that Nintendo put in this pretty major update to a game that is what, like three years old at least?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
At least four?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
It's a pretty major update to this game.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So I think that's kind of rad actually.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Like I want to go back and check this out for like to see like how the mini games are and apparently you can sell your town.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And now here's the thing though.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I still have the old 3DS, so I can't use the amiibo.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I mean, I know I can buy one of those adapter things, but why? Why would I do that?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Because you're an Apple fan and you like dongles.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
No, I'm not going to do it.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000
But I'm sure there's 50 amiibo cards you can buy. 50! Think of all those 50 purchases you can make.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I don't need the 50 amiibo cards because I already have way too many of the fucking regular amiibo.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Are you sure?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Well, and I understand. Didn't they put the Splatoon stuff in it too? And Zelda stuff?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So there's other amiibo that I already have that I can use in it.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I just need to find a friend with a reader. Maybe Shane has an adapter.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
No, Shane doesn't have an adapter because he has like seven DS's and so he has all the new DS's.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Somebody I know has to have one of those adapters and I can just borrow it to get what I need and then that's it.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's just like the cards. You find your friend that has the villager that you want and you just borrow the friend's card.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.000
You don't actually need to buy 5,000 packs to find the one blind card that's eluding you.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000
ActDeft says four years old, release date November 8th, 2002.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So that's, I mean, that's pretty, look.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
2012 I'm assuming.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
2012, sorry, 2012. EA would have shut the server down this year.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Nintendo updated the game. You gotta give them credit for that. Come on. That's pretty cool.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
They're not making any other animal products.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Yes, it's just sell more Abibo, but I think it's still really cool.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
RageNator in chat says, Sky, you have how many versions of Mass Effect 3, yet you won't get a new 3DS.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Is Mass Effect 3 on the 3DS? Thank you. Have a seat.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.000
No. And I'm guessing that the reason you're buying a PlayStation Pro is because the Pro support for the new Mass Effect game, right?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yes, that would be correct. And Final Fantasy.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And are you, are you hyped up for N7 Day tomorrow?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yes, I am. And you better believe that, especially because DarkSakura will be back on our next mini episode.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Loki, you could just have a, you could have a little nap the first 45 minutes of the next episode,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
because that will be, and we'll get out the tarp again,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
because Jamie and I are going to have a time with whatever comes out tomorrow in N7 Day.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
So, bring a book, is what I'm saying.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Alright. If you have no interest in Mass Effect.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I don't.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
You should.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Alright. Anyway, let's move on with, I'm sorry, what is this?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Rama in chat says, Mass Effect 3 isn't on 3DS because there's a no trash games policy enforced.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Okay, you and I both know that's not true, and for that comment, I'm going to right-click, control, kick.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
That was fun.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Alright, let's move on and talk about that PlayStation 4 Pro that somehow I'm being suckered into buying,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.000
and yeah, probably because of Mass Effect, and because of Final Fantasy, and Lord knows what out.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Lord knows what else.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:50.000
The PlayStation 4 is coming out within days, and we're finally getting an idea of what all is actually going to be supported by the PlayStation 4 Pro,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:00.000
and that includes things like Battlefield 1, Battlezone, Call of Duty, Black Ops 3 Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare, Dishonored 2,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Drive Club VR, Firewatch, Hitman, Infamous First Light and Second Sun, Mafia 3, NBA 2K17, PlayStation VR Worlds,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Rez Infinite, Rise of the Tomb Raider, SMITE, Elder Scrolls Online, Elder Scrolls Skyrim Special Edition,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Super Stardust Ultra, Titanfall 2, Uncharted 4, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, World of Tanks, XCOM 2.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I didn't even read everything on the list. That is a lot of games that are going to be getting some additional support,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
and that's just what the old games are that are going to be getting new stuff in PS4 Pro.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
This doesn't talk about everything moving forward, although now that the PlayStation 4 Pro is in play,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000
we kind of know based on the first press conference that Sony is really encouraging developers to think about the PlayStation 4 Pro

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
when they're developing games, and obviously with things like Mass Effect, like Final Fantasy XV,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
we know the PlayStation 4 Pro will be a part of that.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000
But there are some games that have said they are not doing stuff. I know Witcher 3 was one of them.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
The publisher of Witcher 3 was like, we are moving on to developing our next game,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and it's kind of one of those we don't have time to go back and do it for PlayStation 4 Pro.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:16.000
But that game is solid as it is. Plus, that game was out a while ago already.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I realize they did a best of edition that has all the DLC included and all that, but that's different.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I'm just hoping they go back. I know that they just released Skyrim Special Edition, and they have Fallout 4 already.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I remember Bethesda was talking about how they were going to have a full VR version of Fallout 4 at some point.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
It would be nice to see that support added. I would say that's what I'd like to see, is VR support added to older games.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000
You know which game could really use that right now, could really benefit from that?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
A game called No Man's Sky. Because honestly, no one's playing that right now. I'm not playing that right now.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
But with VR, I would certainly go back and try it again.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Are they still working on patches for No Man's Sky? I don't think we know.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
The only way to get a response out of them is to hack them. Apparently at this point.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Not that I'm saying you should, but I'm just noticing that's the only time we've gotten a response lately.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Yep, I don't know.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the past phrase, hot.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Moving on, Logie.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Alright, so this is kind of a good policy that they're putting in place.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Valve has asked developers now to stay away from using just concept art or other art assets on their Steam pages for these games.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And use more in-game screenshots. So it's part of their Discovery 2.0 update on Steam.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And they're gonna actually kind of follow along with that because one of the games that was a culprit of that was Dota 2.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
And so they've actually gone in and updated the page and removed the concept art and put more screenshots in there.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Which I think is a genuine thing that they should be doing.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And a lot of games really should be doing that to be as honest as possible for the players.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Because you're looking at this concept art and you're like, oh wow, the game looks really good.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And come to find out, it doesn't look like that at all. Sorry.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Yeah, I don't think any of us like when the only stuff we see in the game is a full CGI trailer.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
And it's like, the game doesn't really look like that.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Exactly.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Yeah.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
So that's cool. You know, I think people want to know exactly what it is they're buying.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
So encouraging more actual in-game screenshots is a good thing.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Not that you can't have some CG because, you know, especially some games kind of build themselves on epic CG cutscenes.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
That's fine. That's still a screenshot from the game.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Yeah, exactly, exactly. But, you know, there's gonna be a lot of people that are gonna ask, as in the case of No Man's Sky, for example.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Where's the game? What's the game? What is it? Show me the game.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
You know, and I think it's good to encourage those types of screenshots as well.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Well, and also, yeah, too, that's a perfect example because look at No Man's Sky.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
A lot of the screenshots they were showing were from those E3 trailers, which don't look anything like the actual game.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:23.000
This game can only look better with time and age, and that's the classic game Bastion, which was released on the Xbox 360.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Gosh, it was several years ago at this point. That's why I'm almost calling it a classic at this point.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
It was a while ago at this point when Bastion first came out.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:37.000
But, what's kind of neat is that Bastion is gonna be coming to Xbox One, but it's not just backwards compatibility.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000
They're going to do a new adaptation, Supergiant Games that is, a new adaptation of Bastion on Xbox One.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:51.000
They've rebuilt it to make it feel native to the platform, so it will now run at a full 1080p, and it's gonna include the Stranger's Dream add-on.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
There will be new achievements in there as well, and this is really cool.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
So it's coming out on December 12th, that's when the Xbox One adaptation comes out.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And if you own it on 360, you can get the new one free if you get it before January 1st.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.000
So you will have like, what, a two and a half week window to get the new remaster free if you had it on Xbox 360.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Otherwise, if you're looking to get it for the first time, 15 bucks, which I believe is what the game costs the first time.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So yeah, that's really cool. I think I did own that game on 360. I owned it somewhere, it was PC.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
But I thought I had it on PC. I think I had it on 360, I can't even remember, isn't that sad?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I think I had it on 360, and then I played it again on PC because I got it as some type of bundle thingy.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And so, yeah, but I'm pretty sure I had picked it up when it first came out on 360, because you know, it was a rad game.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
So I'm glad we'll kind of have an excuse to revisit it.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000
It would be cool if more backwards compatibility stuff did this, but I understand its resources.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And you know, like CD Projekt Red, the Witcher guy is not wanting to do PS4 Pro.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It's because they want to focus on new stuff. I get it, I get it.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
But this is a cool little, it's a cool little perk. I like that.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Alright, Logy.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So while we have Microsoft supporting some of that stuff pretty well, this is something that really could use some work.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And that would be the Windows 10 store.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So, if you were buying Call of Duty on PC, where would you choose to purchase it from?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Most people would probably decide to pick it up on the Steam store, because you know, that makes sense.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Although some crazy people like to, you know, go against the norm and decide, hey, let's purchase it off the Windows 10 store.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Well, if you happen to purchase it off the Windows 10 store, you'll be unfortunately, or you'll be pleased or surprised to find out that you can't play it against any of the people that are owning it on the Steam store.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
So, if you own the Steam version, you can't see the people that have it on the Windows 10 store, and vice versa.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
They have actually split the PC version for some reason. I'm not really sure why.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Yeah. Apparently, I don't know, according to Activision, they're saying that they support cross-play between devices and platforms for partners who want to enable it.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Well, I guess that's what Microsoft said, but I'm not sure why these versions were split on PC.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:31.000
But hey, if you're planning on picking it up on PC, probably go with the Steam version if you want actual people to play against when you go to play online.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Because I'm sure there's like a handful of people that probably bought it on the Windows 10 store.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I don't understand why anybody thought this was a good idea.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Well, here's why I would think maybe why people might have decided to purchase that. Maybe they thought that this was one of those games that you purchased it on PC.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
You also get, you know, the Xbox One version or something like that, which is not the case at all.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:04.000
But if you do make that mistake and end up purchasing that, you can't play, I mean, no other game does this where you can't play on, you know, another person on PC.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000
It's stupid. Why? Why would that exist? Activision, why would you do that? I mean, I only get it.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Raginator in chat says, aside from the free version of Killer Instinct plus the Windows 10 version of Minecraft, I've got nothing game-wise from the Windows 10 store.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Well, I think I got Jetpack Joyride and maybe whatever Mahjong thing they had for free, I think, on the store.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And then the Minecraft. I think that's about all I've picked up on the Windows 10 store, too.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
The Minecraft version's fantastic, but that's really the only thing I'd be interested in picking up.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And you know what? The only other thing would be, like, stuff that, you know, you do that cross-buy thing where you purchase, like, Forza or something and you can download.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000
But fuck, if I'm actually gonna make third-party purchases on that. That goes with, like, even you play or anything like that.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I'm not purchasing shit on your store. It's all Steam, unless that's the only place I can purchase that.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Which, if it was a Valve game, yes, Steam would be the only place you could purchase that.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Right.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Or a Blizzard game. Can't get those on Steam. Can't get Diablo on Steam.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:19.000
So, some companies get, which, by the way, also Activision. Funny how that works, huh?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So maybe Activision thinks they can do it that way.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Well, but no, that doesn't make any sense, though, because they have it on both storefronts, so it's like, who said that those versions should be incompatible with each other?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Was that an Activision call? Because that doesn't make any goddamn sense. If it was a Microsoft call, that still doesn't make any goddamn sense.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Yeah, no, it doesn't. I would think it would have to be on Activision's ends, because it would be their servers, right?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I guess. There's, like, literally two different versions of the game, but I just don't understand.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Or does the Windows 10 version go through Microsoft servers? Is that the problem?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
But if that's the case, then would they be able to play against Xbox One players? Because then that would make sense.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Oh, I'm sorry, you just won't be playing against PC players, but you'll play against Xbox One players.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000
But if it's just, I'm sorry, you're stuck with this tiny subset of the PC players and you're playing with... that's stupid.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
It's still a little weird to splinter it that way.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
If you want to sell it for $19.99, I'm on board, but, yeah.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000
All right. Well, you know what? We're going to take a step back into the time machine here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
We're going to take a step back with the Classic Game of the Week.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
And every week, we step into the gaming vault here at OLR Studios and pull out a game that we think,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
hey, you kids should be checking this game out. This is back before they could splinter audiences.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:47.000
In fact, this is a time when the only thing that's going to give you a splinter is the console, because of all the wood in it.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
It's the Classic Game of the Week. DarkSakura is sadly unable to join us, thanks to Radio Magic.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
That could be related to the fact that I've been sick the past few days, and I hear she was, too.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
So, being sick sucks. But, again, she will be back joining us next week,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
where we can fill her in on what a good job we've been doing keeping this segment going while the Radio Magic has been broken.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000
So, the Classic Game of the Week this week is one that I'm picking, and you might have guessed based on my opening joke there,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
that I've picked something on the Atari 2600. And it doesn't really have much of a soundtrack.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Usually, we play the music in the background, but because this is Atari 2600, there isn't much.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000
But there is this, so let's see if you can guess from this sound what game this is.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
If you were only listening to that, Loki, what does that sound like to you?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Any Atari game ever?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000
The game is Kaboom! Kaboom!, which was on the Atari 2600.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It was published in 1981 for the 2600, although it did come out later on the 5200 in 1983.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It was designed by Larry Kaplan, and then David Crane, who was a legend in the 2600 games, Game Days.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
He did the sprites, overlay sprites for the game. This game did very well.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
It was a million-plus seller, which the interesting thing about Kaboom! is, like many Atari 2600 games,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
it was very, very simple in concept. There wasn't a whole lot to it.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
You controlled these buckets. You had a series of three buckets that were stacked on top of each other,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
like a little elevator, that you controlled with the paddle, moving them left and right,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.000
as the mad bomber at the top of the screen would drop bombs in a swirly pattern or whatever,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
so you had to move the paddle left and right to catch the bombs.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And if one of the bombs hit the ground, Kaboom! That's where the game gets its name from,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
when the bomb hits the ground, which hopefully won't happen to you.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:49.000
It is a lot like a 1978 Atari coin-operated game called Avalanche,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
but when Activision, believe it or not, again, this is when Activision is a very old company,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
and this is when they were doing games of the 2600.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
When Activision did this, and Larry Kaplan and David Crane put this together,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
they rethemed it to be the mad bomber instead of falling rocks,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
probably so that it wouldn't get confused with the Avalanche games.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Anyhow, so again, you use the paddle controller, you have multiple buckets,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
but if a bomb hits the ground, you lose a bucket.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So, like, the bucket on the bottom will disappear, which actually makes the game a little bit harder,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000
because you don't have as much time to actually catch one of the bombs.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.000
So, yeah, I wouldn't recommend letting a bomb hit the ground on purpose,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
unless, you know, it's some part of some weird strategy.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Because when a bomb does hit the ground,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:43.000
it will resume with the bombs falling half as fast as they were previously before you screwed up.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
So, I have seen some high score runners purposefully lose a bucket

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
right before they're about to get a free bucket to purposely slow down the game.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
So, I have seen that happen.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
But otherwise, you get points for every bomb caught.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Extra buckets are awarded to every thousand points.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
If you pay attention to the mad bomber's face, he's usually not happy,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
probably because you're catching all his bombs.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
But if a bomb hits the ground, he smiles, because he's an asshole,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
and he's trying to, you know, drop bombs on you, and that's not nice.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.000
However, there was always this tease that if you could get 10,000 points in the game,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
something special would happen.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Do you know what that special thing was?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
The mad bomber would look surprised.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
That was the special thing that happens at 10,000 points.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
The mad bomber's surprised.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Anyway, if you could score over 3,000 points,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
that is how you could get the old school achievements on the Atari 2600.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
You mail in a Polaroid photo of your TV,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
and they would send you a patch for your super cool jacket.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
So, that was what you had to do.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
3,000 points would earn you one of those patches.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So, again, this was one of the all-time greats on the Atari 2600.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
It was just, I remember playing this game at a very young age,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
and I think because it was so simple, yet it was so engrossing,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
and so easy to pick up, and, you know,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
it's like just one of those games you can kind of sit there and you Zen out.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
It's like following the pattern and trying to make sure you catch the bombs and everything.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It's a lot of fun, and usually the games are pretty short,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
unless there's some YouTuber out there who uploaded his video

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.000
that he submitted to Twin Galaxies of scoring, get this, 999,999 points.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Took him three hours, no, almost three and a half hours, I think, to do it,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
and then the game finally fucking breaks when he hits that number.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
It freezes because the game doesn't know what to do.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
It can't count that high, so the game freezes up.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
That is absolutely the highest score you can get is 999,999.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Kaboom.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Which, yes, it was part of, as some folks in chat are mentioning,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
it was part of the Game Room service.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
You could get this in 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Room service,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
which is no longer around.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Screw you, Microsoft, for that.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I'm not a fan that they shut down Game Room.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Although, honestly, nothing matches that paddle controller.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
The little analog stick is okay, but it doesn't match the paddle controller.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Like, the closest thing I've used that actually kind of works is a mouse.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
A mouse will do an all right job, but, I mean,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
the paddle controller was really where it's at.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
So, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Kaboom.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Something really, really, really old for you to check out,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
but I think a classic.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Certainly one of the best Atari 2600 games,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
one of the best selling they ever put out.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Anyhow, we are going to take a break, but don't go anywhere, you guys.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
When we come back, plenty more Orange Lounge ready to come,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
including your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
When we come back, with the conclusion of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
right after this.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Tonight, episode number 664 in progress.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
For this, November the 6th of 2016.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Hey, shout out to everybody that participated with Extra Life over the weekend.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I know that was something that was going on this weekend,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and looking at the tote board over at their Twitter account,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Extra Life 4, the number 4 kids,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:25.000
they raised over $6.6 million for the Children's Hospital Miracle Network,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
or, excuse me, Children's Mir- I got that out of order.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Children's Miracle Network Hospitals charity.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Sorry about that, but we know it's a good cause, no matter which way I order the words.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I had some friends that participated in that.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I tried to host a couple streams on my Twitch channels,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
but every time they switched games, it broke the hosting,

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
so I wasn't able to do that all weekend long.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I do know Dark Sakura and Dan were participating in that at some point,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
because she was streaming at some point,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
but their setup, they couldn't really talk, so it was just raw gameplay.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
But they were playing some cool games.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
They weren't playing anything new.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
They were playing at one point Street Fighter Alpha 2,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
just random shit, because you know Jamie and Dan.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
They drove over to their house.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
They're always playing some random shit that probably isn't from this decade,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000
but that's why we love them, because they play a lot of classic games as well.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
But anyway, very cool that that marathon raised a lot, a lot of money,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
so congrats to everybody involved in that, and job well done.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Let's get back into some rapid-fire news.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Start with Loki.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000
All right, so aside from getting one of these with a Google Pixel or something like that,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:41.000
the Google Daydream View VR will be releasing very soon, next week in fact, on November 10th,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
and you can get it at a variety of locations.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
For example, in the United States, they're going to be selling it for $79,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and that's going to be through Best Buy or Verizon.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:03.000
If you're in the UK, you can get it at Ee, our car phone warehouse for 69 pounds, it looks like.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Some of the games that they said are going to be supported by it, Danger Goat, Gun Jack 2 End of Shift,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Home Run Derby, Hunter's Gate, Macorama, Need for Speed No Limits VR, and Wonder Glade.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I thought about picking up a Pixel just to get one of these, but no, I got PlayStation VR instead.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Fair enough.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, Call of Duty Infinite Warfare's Jackal Assault is out now on PlayStation VR.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:46.000
It's free, so you can go check it out, download it, and see if you think it's more impressive than I thought it was, but it's free.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
That's right, make your own damn decision. Don't listen to Loki, especially when the game is free.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It's free, but jeez, you know, it's just...

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Although I use free with quotey fingers, because you have to buy a PlayStation VR.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
So there is a little investment to make up front, but yeah.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
At least it's something else you get to experience when you put down the money for a PlayStation VR.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:13.000
There's like the Apollo 11 thing that they have on Oculus and stuff,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000
and I thought that was supposed to be coming out on PlayStation VR as well soon, but for some reason that hasn't been released yet.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
It might just be in a couple weeks or something.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
November is a very busy month for games, as we'll find out here shortly, right?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Anyhow, some other news.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Hey, remember the game Destroy All Humans?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:37.000
The game is only about, what, 11 years old, but it is now available on the PlayStation 4 digital store.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Now there's trophies and widescreen support.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000
So yeah, there was I guess supposed to be a Destroy All Humans 2.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Oh no, I'm sorry, I meant there's supposed to be one as well coming out for PlayStation 4,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000
because it's been spoiled by the PEGI ratings board, but it is not actually out on PlayStation 4 yet.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
It did not come out with Part 1.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
So yeah, there you go.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So if you want to check out another PlayStation 2 classic on PlayStation 4, there you go.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
That's available for $20.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Speaking of classics, Blue Dragon has made its way to Xbox One backwards compatibility.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:23.000
So if you own a copy of Blue Dragon, which I do, yay, you can go check that out now on Xbox One backwards compatibility.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
But I would ask you, have you beat Lost Odyssey yet?

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Because if not, don't go back and play Blue Dragon yet.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
No, I'm just kidding.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Both games were fine.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I preferred Lost Odyssey a little more.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Some people really love the art style of Blue Dragon,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
especially because they had some very well done characters and so forth.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So yeah, check that out.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I don't know if anything else was announced at the same time for backwards compatibility.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I didn't check if there were, because usually it's like three games at a time,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
but I didn't check if anything else was released that same day.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Blue Dragon was kind of getting all the press on that.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Alright, let's get into what is in stores this week.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Although our pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat has an update for you, Loki, on Apollo 11 VR.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
We will be releasing the PSVR version of Apollo 11 VR later this year.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:20.000
We are aiming for release of the PSVR, but we felt we needed to update the experience first before release.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
It's coming very, very soon.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Cool.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Alright, well speaking of coming very, very soon, Loki, this Tuesday in stores.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
So yeah, this week we've got quite a few things.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So The Silver Case on Mac.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Trillion, God of Destruction on PC.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Cartoon Network Battle Crashers on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and 3DS.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Eagle Flight, that weird Ubisoft game where you play as an eagle.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
That's on PlayStation VR this week.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Lethal VR on HTC Vive.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Harvest Moon, Skytree Village on 3DS.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Robinson, The Journey on PlayStation VR.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Small Radios, Big Televisions on PC and PlayStation 4.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Sword Art Online, Hollow Realization on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Transport Fever on PC.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Fate, Excella, The Umbral Star on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Motorsport Manager on PC.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Senran Kagura, Bon Appetit, Full Course on PC.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Tyranny on PC.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Candle on PC, Mac, and Linux.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And Dishonored 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
That's it.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Big Week, are you picking up anything on that?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
No.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Maybe I might check out, I had to see about Robinson, The Journey, how expensive it is.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And what the reviews look like on that.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
But maybe that one.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
But no for the rest.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Alright, well things in Japan, not quite as noisy as they are here.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
But we do still have some releases to point out this week.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Which includes the Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes plus Phantom Pain combo pack is out this week.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000
As well as the PlayStation 4 Pro of course also gets its release in Japan.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And there is a game called Fate, Excella.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Which comes out in a Regalia box and a Velbor box.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Which are I guess two different types of collectibles there.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
That you can get that is out in Japan.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Also there is a red and a blue controller that you can pick up.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
That's the new Dualshock that goes with the new PlayStation.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
You can check that out.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And you can also get a full PlayStation 4 with Fate, Excella actually included with it.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Where some of the artwork from the game is like on the PlayStation 4 itself.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So this release is big enough to justify that type of special PlayStation.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
So you can check that out over in Japan this week.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Otherwise over on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000
There is also some new Nintendo, I'm sorry that is another countries release that snuck in there.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
So I will mention Beyblade comes out this week in Japan.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Saikai Kusou no Sainen.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Shijuu Sadae no Saina comes out as well.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And Rilu Rilu Feralu Kira Kira Hajimeite no Feralu Magic comes out as well.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Obviously all of this will not matter the next week because Pokemon Sun and Moon are out.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Which is a huge release.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:30.000
So that's why things are, you know, there are some games on the 3DS but it's going to get really noisy on the 3DS next week.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
As it will over here.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Lastly on the Vita since, you know, it's still a thing, the Vita in Japan.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
We do have that Fate, Excella also releasing there in Japan this week.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000
There is also a Vita to go with Fate, Excella also releasing in Japan this week.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
It's a white PlayStation Vita with some of the artwork from the game on its back.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And AkumaJP is in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com and says,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Fate has its mania.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000
So basically like there's definitely a lot of fans over there that will buy this stuff up.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So there you go, that's what you have in Japan.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
How about the UK, Loki?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
The only thing listed for this week is Dishonored 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Alright, before we get to our mailbag, I thought this is a good time for us to get a little bit angsty

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
and get some things off our chest because we've been waiting until the end of the show the past few weeks.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And you know what, I don't have time to wait, I'm mad, we're getting it out right now.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Loki?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I would like to try to act more angry, but unfortunately I have a really killer migraine right now

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000
that hasn't gone away for a few hours.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I mean it's dulled itself for the medication, but as soon as that 4 hour mark hits, it's coming back.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So just have to get the migraine.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Well, my F.U. goes to being sick because even though I thought I'd shaken most of this,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
my God, this is hard to get through a 3 hour show.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I'm like, oh my God.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. And I have one more actually.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Oh, sure. F.U. to Loki for cutting me off.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
But yeah, God, being sick sucks. I hate it.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I cannot miss any more works. I need to go back tomorrow.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And it's just like, oh my God, don't let me feel like crap tomorrow.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And I'm supposed to go to Chicago on Thursday. Don't ruin my trip.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
What did I do to deserve this? I'm a good person.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Loki?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Okay, my other F.U. goes to people that drive cars who blow through intersections

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
or just flat out just try to hit you with their car.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And then when you look at them like you fucking idiot, they're like, sorry, and shrug their shoulders.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Like I literally saw a guy do this.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000
He ran through the stop sign, just completely blew through it at 40 miles an hour in a residential.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
He just kind of like shrugged his shoulders like, sorry.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I'm like, you're not fucking sorry.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
You dumbass, you're not sorry at all.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
They're like this old woman, I was like crossing the street.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And she like nearly hit me with her car.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And she's just like, sorry.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I'm like, you're not fucking sorry at all, you old bat.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I just hate people like that.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It's like seriously, just, yes, it's your road, of course.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I'm interfering with your driving.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
All right.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
There it is, the F.U.s of the week.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Let's try to better our mood a little bit by reading some fan mail.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Every week you guys send an email to the show.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do it.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
And we pick our favorites and we read them here live on air.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000
You know, it's been a while since we've really had some emails, but we have a few this week.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
We're making up for some lost time this week.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
So I have some emails to get into tonight.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And our first email tonight comes from our old pal YYR.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And this email caught my attention immediately because the subject of the email was that Shane.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
And I was like, oh, good, we're going to have an email to drag Shane a little bit tonight.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Hopefully he's not listening, but we'll see.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Anyway, let's get to YYR's email.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
It starts off like this.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Hello, my name is Aaron Tepletsky.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I hope I said that right. Sorry, buddy.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And this email is about how much I hate Shane Alinko.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
You have my attention. I'm a fan of this fan mail. Let's get to it.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And then says, just kidding. Oh, bummer.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Actually, this is regarding the discussion you guys had on last week's show about Super Mario Run.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:47.000
The way that Nintendo is choosing to sell it and their ambitious goal to make it as popular as Pokemon Go.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
For years now, it's been obvious that Nintendo mostly ignores what their competitors are doing.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And instead, they do things their own way.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
The Switch trailer clearly showed that they will continue down that path.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Super Mario Run is no exception to this.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.000
One of the ways the most popular mobile games have held on and grown their audience over the years has been continuous expansion.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Hate all you want on Candy Crush, but the game now contains over 2,700 levels.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
What?

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I think I got as far as level 40 and then it was like, I literally could not get past the stage without some of the pay to win stuff.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
And I was like, fuck this game.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Exactly why there's 2,700 levels.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Oh my god, that's how there's 2,700 levels? Jesus.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
You gotta beat them all and if you can't beat them all, then you gotta pay to beat them.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Even Rama, who played that game more than anybody else I know, said I hit level 375 and bailed.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000
And even when he was that far into it, I was like, intervention! Call A&E.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Believe it or not, over 1,000 of those levels, email continuing, were added just over the last 18 months.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:03.000
King, along with the makers of other popular mobile games, have been able to keep and grow their player bases just by continuing to add content to their games.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And many of their players have not actually paid them anything at all.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Nintendo, on the other hand, seem to be releasing a game that unlocks entirely after one purchase.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:21.000
On one hand, it sounds nice, but this also implies that the purchase game will be complete as is and will not be expanded in the future.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.000
If this is the case, I expect that the majority of the audience will complete all the levels within days, if not sooner, and then will never come back.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
That's not going to generate much word of mouth.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
If Nintendo wanted to use this sort of outright purchase strategy, I feel like a better idea would have been to release level packs,

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000
and then continue to release level packs every month in the future to keep the players engaged in the revenue coming in.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:51.000
But it seems that's not what they're doing. I wish Nintendo luck with Super Mario Run, sure, and I'll look forward to just trying it personally.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:58.000
But to think it can match the previous success of Pokemon GO is just delusional, unless they borrow a page from Candy Crush,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
or just about every other long-term successful mobile game.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Sigh. I blame Shane for this, and for every misguided idea Nintendo has ever had.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
As well I should.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Until next time, YYR.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Now, unfortunately, Shane is not here to defend himself.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:22.000
But SSJ100Matt enters a very plausible Shane plea.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I'll give you Shane's thoughts on it, from SSJ100Matt's.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Um, whatever, you're wrong. Also, I don't care.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I think that's very fair. It's like he's in the room with us right now.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.000
No, all that aside, I'm actually, all seriousness, I'm actually not sure what that had to do with Shane so much.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Shane must have taken a stance on it last night. I know he's been very hard on Pokemon GO.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:57.000
On the Pokestop podcast, which we just did another episode that I have to put on the feed, but he still is very, very harsh on Pokemon GO,

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
and the fact that, you know, that game's kinda over, basically.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Yeah.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
The minute, but to YYR's credit, he's absolutely right.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
The minute they release more Pokemon, there'll be more people back in the game, for sure.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Imagine when they release shinies on there.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Yeah, exactly. Imagine when they release shinies, even Shane will be back. Absolutely.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.000
But they're kind of drip feeding some of that now, because, you know, just today, like hours before we went live,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Pokemon GO added that whole daily bonus thing, which I think we'll cover in detail a little later in the show.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
So, I mean, Pokemon GO is, you know, trying to add some of that stuff.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So, I can see for one perspective where, based on, you know, YYR's, kind of what he's saying in his email,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Super Mario Run does have to do great business out the gate, because it might not have a lot of longevity otherwise.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:57.000
But at the same time, YYR, to be fair, we are also talking about a company that put out a very major patch for a four-year-old game this week.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:04.000
So, anything's possible. Maybe there will be some free level packs that come out throughout the line,

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000
or some other types of expansions, or so forth. Who knows? Who knows?

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Alright, let's get to some other emails here. Next email comes to us from Robert M., who says,

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I went to Six Flags with my brother's family. Some major issues with food service, but that's not the relevant part.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:30.000
My corn dog wasn't cooked. When we went by the arcade, I quietly lamented the very small selection of redemption machines,

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:37.000
and got to thinking, what were the original, literal Penny arcades like before Space War and Pong?

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I imagine largely simple pinball machines, before flippers even, and hand-cranked movies.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Personally, I'd love to see a clever and forceful steampunk group build an elaborate,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:55.000
mutoscope version of Dragon's Lair with art more resembling iWorks? I don't know.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
That's referencing an old technology that I don't know the name off the top of my head.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Then Bluth, and somehow fully mechanical. Oh, it's a name. Sorry about that.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.000
What's your historical knowledge about that era of arcades? Clearly, if I'm fumbling over your names, not enough.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Would some form of redemption machine have been a thing back then? Thanks.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Well, I do know pinball's been around a very long time.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Pinball's been around certainly longer than video arcade machines have been.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Pinball was always kind of a bar thing, although certainly there were arcades and things like what you're talking about as well.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.000
But yeah, a lot of the Penny arcades was also those old visual crank-turning things. You would see that.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And then, you know, we really didn't start seeing arcades as they were now until it was really like Pong,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:52.000
and then just the floodgates that opened in the late 70s once Atari started doing more like asteroids and things like that.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And then you started getting Pac-Man, and just like in the early 80s, it was really like the floodgates were opened and just unleashed there.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:09.000
So before that, I don't think you had as many arcades, but you certainly still probably had them in places like boardwalks and stuff,

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000
where I think it was probably a lot more like carnival games and those sorts of things.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000
And then like you talked about in there, like the very old crank machines and things like that.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I do know that, at least for a while, I don't think they have it anymore.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:34.000
I know for a while Disneyland had a place called Penny Arcade, but it was like there was a few of those crank machines.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
You could see old Disney cartoons, and then the rest of it is a souvenir shop. Like there's not really a whole lot in there.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
But now it's all about Penny slot machines, but that's very, very different.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I suppose in Nevada, if you went to a Penny Arcade, it was a very different thing. It was slot machines.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Anyhow, oh, there was a PS on that email. I want to make sure I get here.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I did pick up Severed and Crypt of the Necrodancer during the iOS spooky game sale.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Not sure how long I can dedicate a full gigabyte to the latter, but certainly recommendable.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Alright, let's get to our last email tonight from Ragenator, who says,

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Hi Sky, Loki, and Shane and or Alan, if either one of you are there.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Well, you missed, it's just Loki and I hope that's okay.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:27.000
It's Ragenator yet again. Seeing as it's become more or less my thing, I just wanted to point out a deal for everyone.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000
As I type this, GOG, or Good Old Games, is having their fall sale.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000
While not everything is on sale, there are plethora of games that are.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:42.000
On top of that, the sale does have a gimmick of sorts. You can gain XP by performing certain tasks or spending money.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
And once you cross certain thresholds, you can unlock free games.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I actually had no idea that was going on, so I do need to check that out.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Now that I got that news out of the way, I'd like to pose an open-ended question.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:00.000
As we all know, PC gaming has multiple online storefronts, with Steam and GOG being the two most popular of the bunch.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Of course, there's a certain amount of overlap game-wise that these stores carry, plus sometimes there can be differences too.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:14.000
For example, you could buy GameX on Steam, and when you play it, the game drops cards that you can either sell for a profit or use to craft badges.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:22.000
If you bought GameX on GOG, it may not come with cards, but you'd get digital extras like wallpapers, OSTs, ebooks, etc.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Steam also tends to have the better sales more often.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:34.000
With all that being said, do you guys find it difficult to choose what service or storefront to buy the games from, or do you just say fuck it and buy on both?

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
No, I would not buy on both, that's for sure.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Although, certainly in one of those bundles, I've probably bought something on PC that I also had on console, but that's also a little bit different.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I don't think I've ever bought the same game from two different stores. I don't think I can say I do that.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And I think honestly, Rage Nader, a lot of what you just basically said is what weighs into my thinking.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Well, what are the perks here, versus what are the perks here?

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I don't really view the trading cards as much of a perk. It's pennies at most, and it's not really a big thing.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:24.000
But at the same time, I also don't really use a lot of those books and things that they do on good old games, because there's this thing called the internet where a lot of the same information comes from.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:30.000
However, I can appreciate what they're trying to do from a collector standpoint, especially for the classic stuff.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:40.000
So I'm not trying to shade that stuff, I'm just trying to say, realistically, especially for the newer games, a PDF file is not really going to make or break where I'm going to buy this game from.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:47.000
So it does usually come down to the sales, which yes, Steam tends to have the better ones.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:45:00.000
I tend to stick with good old games for classic games, and I'm actually kind of bummed that they're moving more into the newer stuff, because there's still so many classic games, I would like to see them get on their service.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I'm sure they're trying, but there's things like the original Civilization where it's like, please get this game on your service.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And I understand, I'm sure they've asked, and there's reasons why it's not there, but I still feel like there's more to develop in that back catalogue.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And maybe this is just what they have to do to stay profitable and so forth, so I get it, I get it.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Loki, is there anything you want to add to this? Any insight you have on where you choose to buy your games online?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Well, it tends to be worth it, especially on PC, since most of the stuff I purchase I don't end up playing anyways.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
It just ends up in the back catalogue that's ever growing.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:47.000
So typically it's just bundles a lot of the times. If I'm actually going to go out and purchase something, it's usually on Steam, but it's whoever offers it cheapest at that point.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Yeah. Dungeon Buster points out in chat over at live.vog network.com, says GOG still does classic games, but there's the whole sorting out the rights of who has what now thing.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Yeah, that can get complicated sometimes.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:11.000
And AkumaJP is trying to invoke Mass Effect again, but hold on, because Mass Effect 3 was only available on Origin, so it kind of made that decision easy.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:19.000
And I think I did get 1 and 2 on Origin as well, but only because all of them, I bought all of them when they were on a deep discounted sale.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Like it was long after I'd already played the trilogy on Xbox 360, and I bought, no, Mass Effect 3 actually I did buy on PC, not on a deep discount, because I wanted to play online on PC.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I really loved multiplayer on Mass Effect 3, don't forget, that was a big thing I was super into for a while.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:47.000
So, yeah, and I really hope that's something in Andromeda as well. We'll find out tomorrow! I hope. We better.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Anyway, lastly, Raginator concludes the email with, this email was not brought to you by Loki, because if Loki had anything to do with this email, it wouldn't have been finished and sent.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:07.000
That was unnecessarily mean. That was unnecessarily mean, but I laughed.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Alright, there it is, your emails. Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I'm just looking at chat over at Live.Vognor.com. This isn't relevant to what we're talking about right now, but it is kind of relevant to gaming.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:33.000
ActDeft says, did an emote, ActDeft needs to not pay attention to R slash Pokemon Go. Jesus Christ, the salt going on right now.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Yeah, and you know what, that's not the only Reddit that gets a lot of salt. I don't know if they finally cleaned it up, but I know No Man's Sky was really bad for a while.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I would say for Pokemon Go, what the hell is the name of it? It has another name, it's the Silph Road, that's the name of it.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000
That's where there's a lot of people that play Pokemon Go, but it doesn't have quite as much salt.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And that's sometimes what happens on Reddit, is that the communities will form something with a more niche title that you have to search for a little bit to kind of keep the ranters out.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
To keep it more of a fans only thing because you had to search it out a little bit.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:17.000
So, anyway, just an observation from your comments there in chat. Let's get back into some other news. Loki.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Alright, so there's a hedgehog movie guest coming out, which I was unaware of that, but apparently now they've got some people attached to it.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Tim Miller, who was working on Deadpool, is now working on developing an adaptation of Sonic the Hedgehog for Sony Pictures.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:50.000
So he's bringing one of his collaborators, Jeff Fowler, to work on the project as well.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:49:02.000
And it would be his directorial debut. It's supposed to be a CGI animated slash live action hybrid family oriented movie. Oh god.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Yay, family oriented. I just think it's funny that, you know, Deadpool is going to have this in common with Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's not like I suddenly expect Sonic the Hedgehog to start coming out saying fuck.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:23.000
That would be fucking amazing. Like, it's just all family for a little while, then something happens like, fuck.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
And it's like, it just goes downhill from there. That would be awesome.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Tigerclaw in chat pointing out Tim Miller's background is with animation since he worked at Blur Studios.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Right.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:42.000
SSJ100Matt saying, just don't have Sonic's friends in the movie. For god's sake, don't put his friends in it.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I would be fine with his friends being in there if it was like a joke. Like, you know, like all of his friends.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Or they all get brutally murdered.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:50:00.000
But I imagine some like Tails, Knuckles, Doctor Robotnik, some of them are going to have to be there, but the other ones, murder.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:12.000
This kind of sounds like it's like one of those, oh, they've entered our dimension and now Doctor Robotnik's going to try to take over Earth and it's lame and cliche and tropey.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Tigerclaw says, I bet the live action Sonic is based on the Sonic Adventure games. It's the only ones that had Sonic on Earth.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, oh god, so like the Smurfs movie?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:35.000
And Bob Coffee suggests, that's when Sonic says fuck as soon as his friends appear.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Aw, fuck you guys.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Alright, we'll give this movie the benefit of the doubt.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000
You know who should write the Sonic the Hedgehog movie? You know who should write that movie, Loki?

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Whoever's running their Twitter account should be writing the movie. That would be an awesome movie and you know it.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Anyway, so there was a, I guess there was an arcade convention thingy going on this weekend, right?

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:11.000
We're getting some information about some new products that are going to be unveiled at IAAPA, which I think is something like International Amusement.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:22.000
So we get some new games that are being unveiled and Sega Amusements actually unveiled a lot of their lineup that can be expected that they're going to be showing off at this expo.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So they have a game coming out called Target Bravo Operation Ghost.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:37.000
So this is a game where it looks like it's kind of an update of a game that they did back in 2011, which was Operation Ghost and this is a new sequel to it.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:45.000
So it looks like you've got an actual scene from Operation Ghost in this giant blue camo cabinet there, so that looks pretty cool.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya, it says International Arcade Amusement and Pinball Association. Thank you, that sounds a lot better than what I said.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Also, Let's Go Island Dream Edition, another classic game coming back from Let's Go Jungle.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.000
This is a casual light gun game where you're in a tropical setting blasting bugs away, so that's been updated.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
So yeah, there's lots of cool stuff as well.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:26.000
And, apparently, it doesn't stop there, because at the, I guess this is the AAMA Gala, it was announced that Daytona is coming back.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:33.000
That's right, Daytona 3 Championship USA is coming back.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And I always would love an excuse to play this song here on Orange Lounge Radio, although it's tragic Dark Soccer is not here to celebrate.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:57.000
That's right, Daytona is back, motherfuckers, Daytona 3 Championship USA.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:04.000
That's it, I don't think we know much more about it right now, if it's a remake or remaster or what.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:14.000
It's gonna have new tracks, and it's also gonna be the old tracks that are remastered as well, but it's gonna have the same arcade physics feel of the original Daytona games.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:22.000
And if this song isn't in it, throw it in the garbage. Throw it in the garbage if that song isn't in it.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
It's gotta be in it.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Am I right? It's gotta be in it.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Hopefully a remix.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Ooh, that'll be even better.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Maybe they could get a celebrity singer, maybe they could get Ariana Grande to sing it or something, complete with the...

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
David Hasselhoff.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Oh, that'll be even better.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
I'm excited about that.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Yeah, it seems like, I mean, that's the type of thing that'll probably end up at a Dave & Buster's or a Round 1, so I'm really excited to check that out.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Heck yeah.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Loki, what's next?

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Alright, so as we kind of alluded to earlier, Pokémon GO is getting some new daily bonuses to get you to check out the game each day.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
So after the Halloween event, they actually launched this.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Each day, resetting at 12 midnight local time, you'll get some new bonuses.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:23.000
So that'll be different things like activating a Pokésop or catching a Pokémon or something like that.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:32.000
You'll get extra rewards for doing those activities seven days in a row, and it'll give you extra experience and extra stardust.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
And maybe the stops will give you more items.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
That's cool.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Because I sure as hell don't open this game up anymore for, I don't know, I just don't want to play it anymore.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Is this just not something, I mean, is this something that might bring you back, or is this just not a game you're playing again?

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I've been playing Ingress, so it feels like it would take away from that, but it's just, I don't know.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Fair enough, fair enough.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:05.000
The interesting thing is, apparently the client is supposed to be getting an update, but I didn't get the client update,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:11.000
yet I got a bonus for catching Pokémon just right outside today, which I'm sure you already know.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:17.000
They decreased the Pidgey and Rattata spawn, and so now different stuff spawns everywhere.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:24.000
So like here at the house, I'm always catching Nidorans, and I've caught like three Pikachus, just randomly opening the app here.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.000
So somehow our house in this neighborhood is a Pikachu nest again, so that's pretty cool.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
So that's cool if they shook up those spawns too, is that it's not just fucking Pidgey and Rattata.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I mean, they're still out there, don't get me wrong, but it's not nearly as many as it was before, so that's kind of cool.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Alright, but it's not like you're going to suddenly see Porygons everywhere.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:51.000
It's just like the Sandshrews, the Nidorans, the Cubones, the stuff that was like common, but not too common.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
You know, it's just showing up everywhere.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Anyhow, I am really, really, really, really excited about this announcement,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.000
and that is that Inti Creates has revealed that they are now holding the rights to Blaster Master,

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000
and they've announced Blaster Master Zero.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:17.000
That's right, the classic 8-bit series Blaster Master is coming back on the 3DS eShop in Spring 2017.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
This was shared during the company's Fan Festa event in Japan.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
So they got the rights to the original Blaster Master game, and they're working on this title.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:32.000
They are creating a fully 8-bit experience in a way that harkens back to the golden age of the NES,

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:38.000
but uses the current generation hardware to optimize and power up the game for the players of today.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:44.000
This, of course, includes new areas and bosses, and new gameplay elements such as extra sub-weapons,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.000
improved gameplay when battling outside your Sophia III tank, a more robust scenario,

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
refined and expanded exploration mechanics, and more.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:59.000
And there's actually some screenshots out there, so this definitely isn't like a remake of the first game,

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000
but it certainly looks like it, yeah.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Well, there's parts that are definitely inspired by it, for sure.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:10.000
But then you look at some of these pictures, like there's some parts of it where the pictures,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.000
like especially in the outdoor scenes, they don't look the same at all.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
So they've definitely changed some things with this.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Now, I don't know if you guys remember, but there was a Blaster Master game on the Wii,

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:28.000
in the Wii Shop 2006, maybe, was when that was out.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.000
The problem was it was a little bit clunkier, it didn't control quite right,

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000
so it just didn't have that same feel of the original game.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:43.000
But, you know, there have been attempts to do this before, and it didn't work so well.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Although, I don't know, that Wii one, it wasn't bad, it just didn't capture the magic in the same way.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000
So I do think it's pretty cool that they are kind of going back to the 8-bit roots type of thing,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000
and the 3DS certainly is an interesting platform to try that on.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000
You know there's a part of me that's like, why don't you put that on the Switch, though,

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000
so I can put that on my TV in all its 8-bit glory?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Like, would it be that hard for them to move a 3DS game over to the Switch?

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I'll just put it on the Wii U eShop.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Oh yeah, or the Wii U eShop, heck yeah, I'd go for that as well.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
So that would be very cool if that would happen.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Put it on another console that's not the Nintendo.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.000
So, I don't know, we'll see, I'm waiting to see a video as well, all there is is screenshots right now.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
But, yeah, excited to check that out when it comes out next year.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:36.000
So, yay, Blaster Master, I kind of figured that series was done after the Wii version didn't really energize things as well.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:44.000
However, I do want to take this opportunity to say, NTCreates, if you happen to be out there listening to this program,

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:53.000
if you are in the business of buying up old franchises from the NES that are long dead that deserve a new game,

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I got four words for you.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
The motherfucking Guardian Legend.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I think that might be five words there.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Motherfucking is one word.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Ah, fine.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Alright.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Loki, before we get to the Skype line, what do you have for us?

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000
So, Left 4 Dead getting an unfinished campaign that you can download.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
So, Turtle Rock Studios had released this on like a third party site,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:31.000
and it includes campaigns for two previously released, or it combines the two campaigns of dead air and blood harvest.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:37.000
And they say it's not an official release, it's what they call a gray box.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Which means some of the environments lack proper textures, and some of the code and features are missing,

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
but it's playable from beginning to end.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
You know, that means modders will just finish it though.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Also adds two survival maps, which have never been released as well.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
That is also an old game, it's nice to see it getting support.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Wow, it seems to be a running theme tonight.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Everything old is new again.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Sorta.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Fresh coats of paint for everything.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Which, speaking of things that are old, is new again.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.000
How many of y'all are picking up that NES Classic Edition that's coming out next week?

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Although, there's been surprisingly little information on where to pick this thing up,

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
considering that it's coming out in days.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Yeah, and then also the other big bitch about it too is those cord sizes.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Yeah.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000
That's kinda like fucking stupid.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Yeah, they may have really made a mistake with that.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Although, I'll probably just get one for my computer room.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Even though I said I wasn't gonna buy one originally.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.000
However, remember, Loki, we're in that year of we say we're gonna do something and then we do the exact opposite.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
So, that's been a trend on this show the past year.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Exactly. Like I said, I've been working on my game, but I really haven't because I've been fucking exhausted every night.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.000
And like, I seriously, I do open up, Unity is opened up on my computer,

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000
I stare at it for five minutes, and then my brain's like, fuck that, we're going YouTube.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.000
And it's just, it just can't handle programming.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Alright, well anyway, to celebrate the re-release of the Nintendo Entertainment System Mini NES,

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:21.000
for three days from November 11th through the 13th, the power line is coming back.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.000
It's available from 6 AM to 7 PM Pacific, and the advice line will be available at,

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:34.000
I guess I can give the number out, area code 425-885-7529.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
So, the advice line is coming back.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
However, there's a catch, it's fully automated.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
You won't be speaking to anybody live.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:50.000
You'll get recorded tips for several games and behind the scenes stories from original Nintendo gameplay counselors.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000
So, unfortunately, no, they're not bringing in temps to get overwhelmed with questions for three days.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
To try to find the answer in a binder somewhere.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
They are going to just do recorded things to try to...

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Hold on, let me type that into Game Facts to see if...

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
But at least it doesn't seem like it'll be 99 cents a minute.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000
At least there's that.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:14.000
There, there, I guess, and now that we live in the age of cell phones that,

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000
I don't know anybody that has a cell phone that charges long distance for calling a different area code this day and age.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000
So, I mean, I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that are just calling that for the lulz.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
So, we'll see.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Anyway, check that out.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
By the way, also, some other events going on.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
The official Nintendo Store in New York.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
There's going to be a retro 80s-themed launch event.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
The first 250 visitors are going to be able to play classic NES games,

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
participate in a costume contest,

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000
and show off their NES knowledge in a retro Nintendo game show.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Is Rama going to go as Luigi?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Like, tell me that's happening.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Hopefully he can swing, I don't know what his schedule's like, but hopefully he can swing that.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
So, there it goes.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.000
That is launching on November 11th, which is Friday, right?

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
That's Veterans Day.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
I guess so, yeah.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Wait, am I, no.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Am I timing there? Yeah, 11th is Friday.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
It's Veterans Day, or Veterans Day Observed is on the 11th.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So, cool.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Alright.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
It's that time. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
All one word on Skype if you would like to give us a call.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000
And talk about anything we've talked about on the show so far tonight,

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000
or perhaps there's something we haven't discussed yet that you'd like us to bring up.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Skype line is open now.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000
While we wait for any calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
No, I was just taking a look at some of these.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000
They have some pins some guy made that are mashups between Simpsons and Pokemon.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
They're fucking awesome.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Wait, they're pins?

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
They're pins.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Is that like an Etsy thing, or what is this?

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
I don't know, but it looks cool though.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Cool stuff. It's just on Reddit.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Okay. That's pretty cool.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Again, and I'm not going to keep this open long.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000
If nobody calls, then I'm going to say screw it.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I'm going back to sleep because I'm fighting this cold.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Kaijuto says, calling that Nintendo power number back in the day was so cool.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
We are getting calls.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Oh, my threat apparently paid off because now we're getting calls.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Hola, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Hello?

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000
This is a caller that calls in an awful lot to the show, and the audio usually works.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I don't know what's up, buddy. If you can hear me, I can't hear you.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000
So, give it the good old Echo 123, turn it off and then on again, and give us a call back.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
So, we'll try that again.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Yeah, it sounded like a muted mic or something like that.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I don't know what was up with that.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
So, we'll just wait for them to call back.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Oh, somebody else is beating them to it, getting back in here.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Hey, this is Act F.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Okay, good. I know it's not our end.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Hi, Act F. How are you, buddy?

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Really great, really great.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
What's in your mind tonight?

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Pokemon Go.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Ah, how are you enjoying it?

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Well, I've been playing daily, so I pretty much enjoy it all the time.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
It's what I play the most.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I've been playing it more now, probably, than when it first launched.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Well, I actually haven't stopped, so yeah, my experience with it hasn't decreased or...

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Well, it has increased, so yeah.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Yeah.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Well, yeah, we were talking about it in chat a little bit earlier. You mentioned it.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Yeah, the subreddit for Pokemon Go, it's full of complaints right now.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Now what are they complaining about, dare I ask?

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Hello?

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Hello?

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Oh, oh, we just, okay, here in studio, we just lost the entire internet somehow, which caused us to lose the call.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:10.000
And I got that message on the computer that said a local network cable is unplugged, which means we lost the entire internet for a moment there.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Well, I saw the lights flicker, so I wonder if it was like a...

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Oh, do we maybe have a power surge for a minute?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Yeah, because I did see that light turn off and turn back on again.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Well, thank God we didn't just lose the entire recording there, because y'all know I still don't have one of those little emergency brick things.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.000
So, we lost that call.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I guess that's it.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Well, let me see, nope, we're getting it back. I think it's coming back.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Hello, are you there?

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Hello again.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Hi, we had a power surge or something weird happened.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
So, sorry about that, buddy.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:48.000
So, where did we leave off? You were talking about Pokemon Go, and that you've been playing it pretty steady.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Oh, we were talking about the Reddit, and what is their complaint now on Reddit?

02:06:52.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Well, I was talking about the client update, and it has something that many people are complaining about.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:19.000
It's the speed limit, and it has been affecting people for the last month or so, because if you go over 30 miles, I think, or 25 miles, I cannot remember right now.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:26.000
You cannot see Pokemon either on your tracker, or even those that spawn.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:34.000
With this latest update, you cannot use PokeStops if you're going over that certain mileage.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Oh, ouch. Okay, so now people can't hack the gear as fast anymore.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Well, it was that way in Ingress. You can't hack portals if you go any faster. It's 35 miles an hour, which actually, or it's about 35 miles an hour.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That's not entirely true, but yeah.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Well, it is and it isn't. Here's the thing. It has to be, the game doesn't necessarily know where all the legal roads are.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:12.000
So the distance between the two portals that you hack, the game can't think it took you more than 30, that you were going more than 35 miles an hour to get between the two of them, if that makes sense.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
And it's an average speed.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Yeah, it's basically like an average speed.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:28.000
See, Pokemon Go works by basically, it pings where you are every few seconds, or not even every few seconds, every second or so, and then it calculates your speed that way, whereas Ingress, it calculates it based on your last action.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:41.000
So if you either charge a portal or you hack something, that's where it counts it, and then when you do it again, it calculates the time it took you based off the distance, and then it tries to estimate your speed.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:52.000
But I mean, I understand that people are probably irritated because they can't just drive through downtown and hack everything in sight anymore, but I don't know.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I mean, I can also understand why they want to put this in here for safety reasons, although it certainly sucks if you're the passenger, especially if you're on a train or a bus.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yeah, it kind of sucks. I do kind of understand the complaints and all, but really, the subreddit is going like crazy complaints. Like, fuck.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:23.000
You cannot read that subreddit because it's like really a downer, and I don't understand how many people get upset like that.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Yeah, if you're a passenger, it sucks, but the game pretty much states that you have to walk. You have to go out there, walk, and do all that stuff.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Let's see, I'm looking. Since you don't want to read PokemonGo's Reddit, I will. I will right now. Let's see, we have,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:48.000
What the actual hell is Niantic doing with their PokeStop speed cap? I am so confused as to why they try so hard to kill their own game.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Well, I mean, could some of this be due to some of the lawsuits they were getting, too? I mean, think about that.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I mean, if somebody got in a car accident and blamed PokemonGo, which I seem to recall was in the news the week this game came out.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.000
You can't blame PokemonGo. You can blame yourself for violating, you know, cell phone laws.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
That's right.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Yeah, but people are stupid, so.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:15.000
That's right. Let's see, final nail in the coffin. Oh, friendly reminder to Niantic that not everyone lives in San Fran.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Yeah, they expanded the whole San Francisco thing out to, here's the hilarious thing.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Okay, so the new range thing, the new scanner thing works outside the Bay Area. It's the extended Bay Area now, right?

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:40.000
So that will work in Davis. It will not work here in Sacramento, which is literally on the other side of the river.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.000
So we're like the cutoff point for where that thing no longer works.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It also works in some parts of Arizona, which I don't know which parts. I didn't ask my buddy in Tucson if he sees it.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
The Bay Area parts.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
And Seattle has it now, too.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Well, at least they are rolling out to other places.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Yeah, at least they're rolling out to other places.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I imagine that it's going to be like, oh, we're gonna do it first, like, in the US, maybe Japan.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:13.000
But I live in Mexico, and I don't see how or when I'm gonna get that tracker.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:19.000
This has been a frickin' slow process, and they kinda need to get on it, like, you know.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:27.000
And, you know, if you listen to Pokestop Podcast, Shane is very adamant about the fact that the original tracker was the best.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
And that's the one they need to bring back, was the whole hot and cold game.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:36.000
And so, you know, the game kinda lost something when it lost that. So, you know, and it's a fair criticism.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Yeah, it's criticism and all that, but some take it way too far.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Anyway.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Even then, because, let me continue just a bit.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Because with the new update, I don't know if you read it all, or read it all, the gym thing where you can get sniped from other people.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Right.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:08.000
If you take down the gym and other people just can pretty much put their Pokemon and you're screwed.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Yeah, they fixed that, right?

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Yeah, they fixed that. If you take down the gym or the gym leader, only you can put another Pokemon on the gym.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So, yeah, Niantic finally did something great. They're doing some really great things right now with Pokemon Go.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Yeah.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.000
And people also need to see that, that they're actually listening to us.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:43.000
If it's anything like Ingress, the game that people are playing in Pokemon Go in a year won't look anything like the game that it was originally.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000
And I remember Ingress from the early, like, beta years.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Yeah.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Well, beta game, like, and I played it recently before Pokemon Go and it's a completely whole new game.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Yeah, it's different. And there's big rumors, big, big rumors that an Ingress 2.0 is coming soon.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.000
So, we'll see. Because that would be a big deal.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.000
They're thinking that Ingress is going to get updated graphics, kind of like what Pokemon Go has.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
And maybe some other stuff to go with that. So, we'll see.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
That would be nice. I know lots of people that still play Ingress, so.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Yeah.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
They'll be really happy about this.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:28.000
I still play as well, but, you know, I'm kind of getting to the point where I don't know if I want to say I'm burned out.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Because I still like a lot of the social stuff, but it's just, I'm just, I'm ready to play other games.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Like, it's just like, I played Warcraft fucking Pedal to the Metal for like four or five years.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000
And then I just kind of burned out on it. And I think that's, I'm starting to kind of get there with Ingress.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Which I'm sure if any of our local competition is listening to the show, they will be thrilled to hear that.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.000
But, you know, I think it just happens with games. Sometimes you're sick of playing.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000
But I still like the social stuff.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Yeah.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000
So.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Yeah, I did get burned out on Ingress, like, really. Well, not fast, but, yeah.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:09.000
After Pokemon Go started, and I didn't, like, have any interest for Ingress after that.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
But, yeah.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.000
But if some of my friends are like, hey, come down to this bar and, by the way, we might frack a portal there.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I'm going to be like, alright, cool, I'll drop an eight. I'll open the game to do that for you.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
You know, it's that type of thing. I like the social stuff still.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Yeah.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Alright. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can try to sneak in one or two more calls.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Thanks for the call, okay?

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Yep. Take care.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Alright, let's see if we can sneak in this one other call here.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Hello, you're on Orange Dogs Radio. Who's this?

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Hey, it's Ron.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Hey, fixed your mic. What's up, buddy?

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Yeah, I had to unplug the mixer and plug it back in so it'd kind of reset itself.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Uh-huh. So you did have to, you had to turn it off and then on again.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Something along those lines.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
What's on your mind, my friend?

02:14:51.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I just want you to know, I was on the other side of my little small studio apartment being a responsible adult for once in my life, folding my clothes for my laundry.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Good job.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Thank you. And I hear you say something about me having to make an appearance as Luigi somewhere in New York City, so what's going on now?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
You just called in to get more information?

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Yes.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:24.000
So the Nintendo Store in New York is doing a launch event for that mini Nintendo on November 11th is the launch.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I don't know when the launch event is, but they're saying the first 250 visitors will be able to play the classic NES games and participate in a costume contest dressed as their favorite Nintendo character.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:43.000
So I don't know if that's like a midnight launch or if that's like when the store opens or something, so you're gonna have to look into that, but it's for the mini NES.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Well, you know, I am going away this weekend, but I think I could fit that in on a Friday, see if I could do it.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
There you go. You can pencil it in.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.000
If the timing is right, I may have to show up as Luigi from Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
I love it.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Well, I did do that version, you know, for a couple of conventions, and I did buy some more tools, so you know, gotta add to the tool belt, you know?

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Uh, yeah. Where are you going this weekend?

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
I'm visiting a friend upstate New York.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Oh, okay. I thought it was a convention. Sorry, I didn't know.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Uh, no, no, no. I have one more convention on my list, and that's if I can get into it. If I can get in, I'll be going. If not, you'll only be seeing me at MAGFest.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Oh, you are going to MAGFest?

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000
If everything falls according to plan, I will be at MAGFest.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Yay, I'm excited.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Oh, yeah. The main reason is, I will be breaking out one of my favorite cosplays I haven't worn in a very long time, so I've been looking for a reason to wear that one again.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:17:00.000
SSJ100Matt says, again, isn't Exeterfer going to be in New York City next weekend? Oh, is it that soon? It's whenever GamerX East is. He's going out there for that. So, wow, that's great.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000
You know what's interesting about GamerX East? Do you know where it's being held at?

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Yeah, it's like at Microsoft's office or something.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Yep, right on 42nd Street on the 5th floor, if I'm not mistaken.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Yeah, they're converting conference rooms and stuff into what this is going to be. That's why, apparently, you cannot get tickets at the door. You will have to get tickets in advance, because it's going to be kind of locked down to people who only have the tickets, basically.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Yeah, pretty much. Before I started working for the company, I was there a couple of times previously for a couple of independent gaming events, so it's pretty nice.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:42.000
And I already told Exeterfer to keep in touch with me, that way I can drag him around to some cool spots in the city.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Awesome. I know you'll take good care of him.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Alright, but one thing, though. Do I have to take him to the West Village?

02:17:50.000 --> 02:18:07.000
That's up to him. I don't know if he's really super into that type of stuff. I think he has to go to where Christopher Street and Gay Street meet. If he doesn't go there, I don't know why the fuck he got on a plane.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Okay, I think we can arrange that. I'll take a picture and I'll post it to somebody's Facebook or Twitter so you can put your seal of approval on it.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Perfect, perfect. How can he go and not get that picture? He has to.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Well, you do realize if this happens, you have to do the same thing, too, mister.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I did when I was there in 2006, because I sent it to him. I took a picture there and I showed it to him. I said I took that picture for you.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Ah, so, turnabout's fair play.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Exactly, exactly. Alright, my friend. I'm going to let you go, but if you end up going to the event this week, be sure to let us know how it was.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
I will be posting pictures. I'll have a battery with me. I'll try to do a livestream or something. We'll figure something out.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Sounds good, my friend. Take care.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
You, too.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Alright, bye-bye. Alright, and I think that is going to do it for the calls. Those are the two folks I saw trying to get in there. I think I am going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Sorry if you didn't get through, but please consider sending us an email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:21.000
But for now, I've about hit my limit for how much I can talk with still being this sinus cold is still horrible and I need to rest up so I can get back to work tomorrow.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:25.000
But thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to the show. Really appreciate it.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Again, as a reminder, we will not be here live next week. There will be no new show on the feed next week.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:45.000
However, we will have a show on the feed. I'm thinking Wednesday the 16th, I think is the date, there will be a show on the feed, episode 665.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:54.000
And then we will be back live on 20 November with episode 666 of Orange Lounge Radio. So that will be our next live show.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Thank you so much for tuning in and supporting our show. If you like what you heard, please consider leaving us a review on a site like iTunes.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:06.000
A nice 5 star review goes a very, very, very long way in helping us out. So we really appreciate that.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.000
We don't ask for your money. We just ask you to tell a friend or five about the show.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Otherwise, time for final thoughts. And my final thought is I'm ready to edit the show and then lie down and take a nap or something.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:24.000
It's going to be more than a nap at this point. And then face the day tomorrow. Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:29.000
I don't know. I'm deciding where I'm going to drive tonight.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Alright, well I hope it's a good drive. And that's it. Have a good night everybody. We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Bye bye.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:06.000
