20880	22720	And that's just the tip of the week's gaming news.
22720	29840	Stay tuned for this and more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
30000	35200	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange
35200	37880	Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
37880	45160	It is episode number 667 tonight for this November the 27th of 2016.
45160	49600	And we here at OLR hope you all had a happy and safe Thanksgiving, at least those of you
49600	52400	in the States, those of you abroad and other countries.
52400	53520	Well, I hope you had a good week.
53520	57400	I hope you had fun watching all those clips of people beating each other up for toasters
57400	58880	on Black Friday sales.
58880	63440	But meanwhile, we'll talk about any video game deals maybe we got, or you guys got,
63440	64680	in our chat room.
64680	70400	Live here in our studio, studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California is myself, Rob Roberts,
70400	73760	and joining me by my side as he always is, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
73760	74760	Hello.
74760	75760	Hi, Loki, how are you doing?
75760	76760	Doing alright.
76760	77760	Did you have a good holiday?
77760	80300	Yeah, I still have a, I got a bit of a cold, but it's not bad.
80300	83960	I have like a little bit, like I was really sick like a few weeks ago, you guys probably
83960	86220	remember that because I think I missed a show because of it.
86220	91020	But yeah, I feel like I like, like another cold might be trying to come in, but it kind
91020	96060	of can't maybe because my body's still, yeah, it's just minor and like just stuffed up.
96060	97060	Yeah.
97060	101220	Well, I should mention Dark Sakura, even though you guys know she's been on leave, she was
101220	102620	actually going to try to be here tonight.
102620	106060	She'd got the night off work and everything, but she actually got really sick, like had
106060	108320	to go to the doctor and get pills type of sick.
108320	111460	So if she's out there listening, hope you feel better soon, Dark Sakura.
111460	112460	Sorry.
112460	114900	She couldn't, she couldn't be here when she thought she could be, but she will be joining
114900	119460	us after her work conflict ends mid December, so I think her first show back will be December
119460	121020	18th.
121020	125060	Hopefully we'll bring her to you via Radio Magic for a couple of episodes in between,
125060	128100	but for now you stuck with just Loki and I, so deal with it.
128100	129100	Yep.
129100	131160	Did you get caught up in any of the shopping stuff?
131160	133680	You probably don't really do that stuff, right?
133680	134680	Really I didn't.
134680	137860	I mean, the only thing I was going to do, cause I've been meaning to replace it for
137860	145980	a while, is I replaced my Boxee, basically my streaming device, which I was looking at
145980	149700	maybe getting like Roku or something, and mainly because, I mean, we were using Netflix
149700	152860	on the PlayStation, but I wanted to use that for games instead.
152860	153860	Right.
153860	156180	You talked a little bit about this conflict, I think last week on the show or the week
156180	157180	before.
157180	161260	So I was looking at a Roku and I almost got one of the Roku premieres, but I ended up
161260	167220	going with, it's called a, ironically a My Box or Me Box or something.
167220	174060	I think it's My Box, is how they pronounce it, and it's basically an Android TV device.
174060	179660	Which is cool, cause you know, I have an Android account, a Google account, and it runs pretty
179660	180660	well.
180660	185660	So I mean, you can put games on it apparently, I have not tried to do that yet, but for Netflix
185660	186900	it works pretty awesome.
186900	192900	It's also got that Pluto TV, which has a Mystery Science, actually several Mystery Science
193900	197260	channels, they're live streaming all the time, I was like, this is fantastic.
197260	198820	I have never heard of Pluto TV.
198820	203260	Yeah, Pluto TV, it's an app, it's just like a live streaming app, and they have like different
203260	209020	streams for, also just stuff, like they have stand-up comedy, they have like an IGN one,
209020	213780	they have one that's like video games, but it was weird, cause it was like, I think I
213780	217020	was playing some really old videos, cause they were like showing like, talking about
217020	221740	the upcoming Lost Odyssey 3, or not Lost Odyssey 3, Lost Planet 3 or something like that, I'm
221740	223580	like, uh, that's pretty old.
223580	226140	Okay, this was like old stuff, like G4 reruns or something.
226140	230460	Like that one, yeah, that was, but it had Mystery Science 3 3000, I mean a few channels
230460	234260	of that, and what's kinda cool about it though is, like I was looking at maybe doing Sling
234260	240180	with it, the only thing, cause it comes with two months free for Sling, and with that it
240180	244580	has live streams as well, live channels, cause they're cable channels, but what's cool about
244580	248960	it in the Android TV is you can mix and match these live streams, so like, there's actually
248960	257040	a live TV or live channel app, and you can say, okay, I wanna pull the streams from this
257040	262020	Pluto TV, and I also want like actual cable channels in there, and I want this other stuff,
262020	267000	so you can mix like the Mystery Science 3 3000, you know, channel with TNT and Comedy
267000	271920	Central and all sorts of stuff, so it's like pretty cool, that's like kinda what I wanted.
271920	276520	Problem is that live streaming, that live app doesn't quite work, but the individual
276520	281720	apps work, so I'm probably gonna end up picking up Hulu. There's so many, I'm sorry, but there's
281720	284960	so many of these like individual streaming apps now, it's like, I remember when it was
284960	288800	like Netflix and Hulu and that's really it, but now it seems like everybody wants a piece
288800	292040	of this, this is what I was afraid of, when HBO got one and Showtime got one. Pluto, what's
292040	296040	the name of Pluto, it's free. Okay, that's good. It sounds like it's just drawing from
296040	299800	all these existing like internet streams and stuff. I think it is, it's just an aggregate,
299800	303920	but it works really nice, and actually, you know what, I'm not sure if it is pulling from
303920	308800	all this, but it's got like, you know, between each like episode, it has commercials, like
308800	313560	actual commercials, and it also, like it looks fancy, it looks like you're watching a TV
313560	317720	channel, so I'm not really sure what it is, but it works cool. That's cool. And you know,
317720	321720	the remote's neat and stuff, it has like voice search and stuff like that, and I think it's
321720	326560	just like it's a nice little compact box, and it wasn't that expensive, so I'm pretty
326560	330280	satisfied with it, and I also removed all the bloat off of it, you know, before I messed
330280	333200	with stuff, so. And what was it called, My Box, so somebody in chat was asking. Yeah,
333200	338480	it's called a My Box, or Me Box, it's some Chinese, they sell them at like Walmart, that's
338480	345120	why I bought it, and it was the same, it was $10 cheaper than the Roku Premier, which feature-wise
345120	349360	is pretty similar. Okay. So, and plus, you know, Walmart is doing a special where they
349360	355480	gave you two months of, of Sling, but normally when they're not doing that, this still comes
355480	360520	with two months of Sling, so that's $50 right there. Wow. There's still so many, and I got
360520	365920	suckered into another one, you know, I subscribed to CBS All Access now, and I only, I only
365920	371280	did it so I could watch frickin' Big Brother Over the Top, which has kind of ended as a
371280	374280	flop season. It comes with a free month of that, by the way, as well. Does it really?
374280	378520	Yeah. Oh, it's a bump. So a free month of that. Wait to cash that in until they do Star
378520	383080	Trek Discovery at this point. I don't really care, but I'm gonna, I seriously, I'm probably
383080	387480	gonna do Hulu because it's like, you know, another eight bucks, and I may do Sling because
387480	393320	it's, it's $25. And right there, those two were basically what I was getting with PlayStation
393320	398160	View, which I have canceled because they removed all the good channels off of it. Comedy Central's
398160	402120	gone. Oh no. Yeah, they were, like, there's some deal that fell through, and so they removed
402120	406960	all these, like, Viacom channels. I'm like, fuck that. I'm, I was watching Comedy Central.
406960	410960	That's really what I wanted it from, and it's not there anymore. I'm like, nope. I'm not
410960	417640	going back. So yeah, I mean, it looks cool. Okay. Well, I'm, I'm glad to see it sounds
417640	422280	like maybe you've, you've hopefully found a box to mediate the TV and game situation
422280	428860	in your home. Yes, I have. Good, good. Glad to hear it. Um, let's see. Uh, Kaijuto, Kaijuto
428860	432760	in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com arguing me, with me saying, Big Brother Over
432760	437080	the Top is not a flop just cause Justin is in bed. This is an epic season. It's the best
437080	442000	Big Brother in a long time. No, I, I actually agree. It, it was, it was an amazing Big Brother,
442000	447320	but it's like, I'm not very inspired by who's left in the game. Uh, I, I would like Justin
447320	450520	to win out of who's left. And, and also the other thing I was going to mention too, it
450520	454480	is 4K capable as well. That's one of the reasons I purchased it, because eventually I am going
454480	460200	to get a 4K TV, and that's why I was between the Premiere, or the Roku Premiere, or this,
460200	466600	because they both output the 4K. Uh, AkumaJP in our chatroom, uh, again, over at live.vognetwork.com
466640	470120	and just a quick plug, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network,
470120	475320	vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com. Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right
475320	480520	after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Uh, AkumaJP's in chat, and if you are, uh, listening, you
480520	485760	should join our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Akuma just says, Stupid people here, even
485760	489840	though we have Black Friday, but they, or even though, I think that's, we don't have
489840	494200	Black Friday, cause in Japan they don't, you know, Thanksgiving is not as it is here in
494200	497480	the States. So, stupid people here, even though we don't have Black Friday, but they
497480	501960	make Black Friday sales anyway. I heard that was the thing, that more and more countries
501960	505920	are trying to kind of get on the Black Friday thing. In fact, I thought I saw a video, and
505920	509320	it was trying to be a very, like, tongue in cheek sort of thing, where it was like, look
509320	513800	at this Black Friday chaos in Canada, and it was just all these people casually walking
513800	518040	into a Best Buy, like, you know, oh, hello, how do you do, you know, they're too, oh,
518040	521080	sorry. Yeah, yeah, sorry about that, sorry about that. Uh, and then, uh, you know, the
521080	524720	Best Buy people applauding, it was like really funny, with the Tim Hortons cups and everything,
524720	531280	it was like really funny, you know, um, but obviously Canada's Thanksgiving is weeks earlier,
531280	536840	and my understanding is that Canada has Boxing Day after Christmas, which was a similar sort
536840	540960	of thing, but now I guess one day isn't enough, they have to get in on, on Black Friday as
540960	543880	well. Oh yeah, I mean, all the stores are getting in on Black Friday, and it's like
543880	548440	cyber, it's like, I don't know what they call it, like cyber week or Thanksgiving. Cyber
548440	552560	Monday now. No, no, I understand it's Cyber Monday, but they've been doing like this Black
552560	557720	Friday thing like all week, so it's, it's not just that, I mean, I don't know what you
557720	561960	call it, cyber discount, I don't know what they're calling it, cyber week or something,
561960	566120	but yeah, it's, it's, they keep extending it, like they do Christmas, eventually it's
566120	573080	gonna be Black Friday from July on or whatever. I'll be interested to see how the, um, sales
573080	578320	numbers look, because I'll tell you what, uh, yesterday, Saturday, um, I went on a little
578320	581760	road trip with Shane and Extover, you know, two pals of mine that you probably know from
581760	585760	other shows on VOG Network, um, and we went up to a town a couple hours north of here
585760	590080	called Chico, um, because there's this really good Mongolian barbecue place there that we
590080	594760	wanted to eat at, and, um, you know, some of their stores, because they're not as trafficked
594760	599560	as stores say in Sacramento and stuff, um, Shane really likes to look for his Power Ranger
599560	603480	stuff, uh, which if you listen to a show, the Ranger Pride cast, you know all about
603480	607360	his collecting. So anyway, we went to the Target up there and the Toys R Us up there,
607360	610760	and I got to say, especially considering it was Saturday on this big sale weekend, like
610760	615960	it wasn't that crowded at all. Like it was, it was maybe like a busy, busy evening or
615960	619000	something. Well, I think a lot of people, if they're going to those Black Friday sales,
619000	623800	they're going like first thing on Thursday and then it's died down. Well, but here's
623800	627720	the thing, when we were walking through, not just Target, but Walmart as well, they still
627720	632200	had a ton of the TVs that were the deep discount, like the stuff you would expect would be the
632200	638120	first thing gone. Like even I had that moment of, should I just get one of these $500 TVs?
638120	642680	Cause it's right there in front of my face and I do need a 4k TV. But then rational Rob
642680	648400	spoke up and said, no idiot, you just dropped, you know, $1,200 on a TV this year and it's
648400	653360	your own damn fault that you missed the 4k bus. So I'm going to wait a little longer
653360	657120	for allowing myself a new TV, but they only get cheaper and they're only going to get
657120	663000	better too. That's, that's very true. So, um, yeah, so, uh, yeah, I just thought that
663000	667160	was interesting that I didn't, I didn't really notice a lot of traffic and even at the stores,
667160	671360	you know, granted what you said is that, you know, most of it was probably Thursday, Friday.
671360	675200	It still seemed like there was a lot of merchandise. Granted, I was in a different town where maybe
675200	680360	it's a different flow by like, I mean, I don't have a lot of extra money to go spend on stuff
680360	683720	like that. I mean, definitely I'm looking at 4k TVs and some of them are even pretty
683760	690280	inexpensive, like $300, $400 for basically the same size TV I have now. I'm like, maybe,
690280	694480	I mean, it's something I'll get later on when I have something that really uses that. I
694480	699880	mean, granted, you know, the streaming thing does it, but I don't know. I mean, it, we'll
699880	705400	see. Um, I'm more of looking at it like a game console or something like that. Um, but
705400	712800	yeah, I did a lot. I mean, most of my shopping was online and it was mostly on the PlayStation
712800	716040	network. You know, and I think that's where a lot of people are going is online. I think
716040	720280	that has a lot of retailers kind of, uh, creeped out, you know, a vid power and chat says dual
720280	725020	shock fours are $34 on Amazon right now. That doesn't, that matches the deal Best Buy was
725020	729200	having, right? I think Amazon like just matches a lot of what these other Black Friday deals
729200	734400	are. And so, you know, people are like, they see the videos on like, maybe if all the videos
734400	738820	looked like the video in Canada, people wouldn't be so adverse to go into the store, but no,
738820	742440	we see the videos that people in Walmart like dog piling on each other fighting for a TV
742480	746080	and all this like crazy stuff. And you're like, nope, I want no part of that. I'm not
746080	749960	going out with that. I will just click the buy it now on Amazon. That's much easier.
749960	756280	And so I don't know, maybe, maybe retailers will have to do something to make the experience
756280	761080	a little more like it is in Canada. Make people behave. I don't know. I don't know how a retailer
761080	764880	does that. I agree. I mean, and I think there now that with so many online options that
764880	768240	a lot of people aren't going to stores is there's, unless there's something that they
768240	772400	really want. And a lot of the times that, you know, they know what the deals are going
772400	776400	to be ahead of time, which is nice. So you know whether it's worth it going out there.
776400	781520	And a lot of it, you can just kind of compare online before you even mess with it. It's,
781520	784600	it's just so easy to go online, especially now with Cyber Monday, there's going to be
784600	790600	even more stuff. So yeah, why bother? No, I'm not going to the store. Fuck that. I don't
790600	797680	really have an extensive Christmas list. And you know, the people that I would buy, um,
797680	803480	I would buy gifts for, I don't think I would buy televisions for, you know what I mean?
803480	807160	Maybe my mother, if she strongly hinted she wanted one, I would buy her a new TV, but
807160	810560	that's, that's about it. You know what I mean? I don't usually have that kind of budget to
810560	815080	spend that kind of money, you know, and Alan and I kind of, I don't, we don't, we don't
815080	818760	really go all out for holidays. Cause like, we're just the type of household where if
818760	823920	we see something, we buy it, you know, we don't, we don't wait until December 25th.
823920	828120	I don't know. Anyway, but every, every household's different for sure. For sure. Uh, anyway,
828120	831680	let's move on. We spent a good time talking about Black Friday, but the real kickoff topic
831680	836480	I wanted to talk about tonight is, you know, um, it has been a slower news week because
836480	840120	of the holiday in the States. You don't have, you know, the news cycle pretty much came
840120	843640	to an abrupt stop on Thursday and Friday. There wasn't as much coverage of what was
843640	849400	going on. Um, but you know, we are on the eve of a major, major game release coming
849400	855440	up this week. Uh, at least of a series that I have a lot of, you know, um, love for, and
855440	863560	that's Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 15, finally, finally releasing, uh, Tuesday. Uh, some people
863560	867880	lucky enough to get it early. I've really tried to stay away from all that stuff. I
867880	872280	haven't been watching any live streams or YouTube's, uh, just outside of, you know,
872280	876800	the stuff that was out there a couple months ago when, when, uh, Square did their big reveal
876840	880760	of the release date that they didn't even make and all that stuff that was out there.
880760	886360	So, um, you know, I've kind of been taking the, the concept of what happened with No Man's Sky,
886360	892120	which I really know is ironic here because we do a podcast about video games, but I think we can
892120	898520	still temper our expectations and not buy into hype a lot. Even like, I haven't been hyped about
898520	903640	it and I didn't like, honestly, even I'm still picking it up because it's Final Fantasy and I
903720	909480	like Final Fantasy, but like, I think there's something you just have to admit. Yes. I'm buying
909480	914120	it just because it's with the comments. It's kind of like, I really don't care for this too much,
914120	922280	but I'll try it. But Final Fantasy, like I, it's just such a legendary series to me. I mean,
922280	926120	I'm not just talking about the fact that I play 14 probably more than any other game right now,
926120	932040	but I'm talking about the fact like this goes back to playing on the NES with my best friend
932040	936520	at the time. And we could get all the way to Tiamat, which is like towards the end of the game,
936520	941400	we could not beat that motherfucker for all it's worth and everything we tried. I remember getting
941400	946600	very frustrated with that and then playing Final Fantasy II, which yes, I know it's really Final
946600	952040	Fantasy IV, but I'm sorry, certain things I'm just tied to, but playing Final Fantasy II on the Super
952040	956840	Nintendo, you know, and, uh, playing through that whole experience, you know, a little more on my
956840	962040	own, but the story in that game, just phenomenal, you know, for a video games just didn't have
962040	966920	stories like that at the time. It was very, very rare to go that deep. Um, and then that was a
966920	971880	tradition that continued with Final Fantasy III or yes, Final Fantasy VI. But, you know, I just,
972600	976920	wow. I mean, those games like blew me away as a kid. So it just made me a fan of the series for
976920	983320	life, I think in many ways. Well, and you know, with, here's my gripe about some of the Final
983320	990040	Fantasy games as of late, the stories are so damn hard to follow. Like 13, like there, it was just
990040	995160	like, here's this, let me just vomit, like the whole lore in front of your face. And like, you
995160	999320	just can't follow any of the fucking thing. And it's, and even at the end, you kind of have like
999960	1005720	a better idea, but it's, it's so hard to follow. And like, I mean, the demo for Final Fantasy 15
1005720	1008680	kind of is the same way. It's like, I don't know what the fuck is going on. So they broke down
1008680	1013000	their car. Why are they doing all this shit? Why? Hey, my car broke down. Let's go kill those deer
1013000	1016360	over there. I mean, that's kind of like the equivalent of that. It's like, that's what people
1016360	1021320	do. It's just like, man, I'm tired of waiting for my car. Let's go break that animal's neck. I mean,
1021320	1028680	it's like, I don't know, but whatever. It's Final Fantasy. I'll check it out. But I don't know what
1028680	1032200	the fuck's going on in this game. And like, I know that they have like a prequel movie. It's like,
1032200	1035640	do I have to fucking watch the movie in order to understand what's going on in this game? I mean,
1035640	1041320	I don't know. So I just hope that going into it, that the story's laid out better than 13,
1041320	1045560	because 13, I still don't know what the fuck, I didn't finish it, but I still don't know what
1045560	1049560	the fuck was going on. I confused the hell out of everything. Then don't play, for the love of God,
1049560	1053560	don't play the sequel because then they introduce time hopping into it. And it's just like, you'll
1053560	1057960	go cross-eyed. Because now not only, but now, but this happened in the future and this happened in
1057960	1061320	the past. And then when this happens in the past, it affects this in the future. And yeah, you'll
1061320	1069240	go crazy. You'll go absolutely crazy. Anyway, all that joking aside, yeah, I'm really just trying
1069240	1074360	to not like expect too much from the game and read too much in the story so that hopefully
1074360	1078280	it will all kind of come together when the game comes out. Although I know people,
1079400	1084200	and I feel the same way, is that I understand that Final Fantasy 15 has an anime behind it,
1084840	1088040	right? There's that whole brotherhood, like an hour of YouTube.
1088040	1090600	It looked cool. Yeah, I watched the 12 minute clip of it.
1091160	1093880	And then there's the movie, but it's like, I really...
1093880	1095560	So there's the movie and the anime?
1095560	1099560	Yeah, there's both. There's a fully CGI movie as well.
1099560	1101240	Yeah, it's a movie is what I saw at 12 minutes ago.
1101240	1105960	Okay. Yeah. So there's also an anime. And there's all these side cell phone games and all this
1105960	1112840	stuff. But my point is, is that I really hope that stuff is not required to understand the game.
1113400	1119240	That stuff, if it's good, should enhance the game. And that's one thing that kind of bugged me about
1119240	1123960	World of Warcraft sometimes is that like major things that happen between patch to patch. Well,
1123960	1128520	if you wanted to know what happened, you have to read the book. And it's like, I don't want to
1128520	1133960	read the book. I don't want to read. Like I'm playing a video game. Show me. That kind of stuff
1133960	1138120	is very frustrating. So I hope that doesn't happen in Final Fantasy 15. But we'll see.
1138840	1145480	Anyway, also should be pointed out, Final Fantasy 15, they are going to be getting a day one patch
1145480	1149320	after all. I thought the delay was to prevent a day one patch. I thought that was the whole reason
1149320	1155720	they pushed it back. Well, it was to, I mean, they're going to fix everything, but then it's
1155720	1160280	always fixing stuff. So I don't, maybe they'll reduce the size of the patch. Maybe. I'm thinking
1160280	1164840	the day one stuff is an enhancement patch or what they're calling the crown update. And they're
1164840	1169880	saying it's going to add features to the game to make up for forcing everyone to wait longer for
1169880	1176120	the game to come out. So there's an improved camera for narrow areas. Something, the weight
1176120	1180600	mode feature gets expanded a little bit, uh, which is the whole fact that you can actually
1180600	1186280	set the game to pause. So that's not so fast. And I guess, yeah, I'm only candy. I know. Right.
1187400	1193400	Like old basis. It's. I like the turn-based system. I don't know what all the haters were,
1193400	1198040	you know, hating on the turn-based system, but I love it. And that's why I liked loss Odyssey,
1198040	1203320	because it was the turn-based system. Yeah. It was fucking awesome. Yeah. Um, a monster flute
1203320	1208920	that will summon monsters, more fish and more recipes. And you can upload pictures
1208920	1214040	that prompto takes directly to Facebook and Twitter for all that social media hype.
1216200	1220680	Does every fucking game need to have like fishing and fucking selfies and shit in it? I mean,
1220680	1225720	come on now. What I thought was also interesting is that, uh, is he a character that you control?
1225720	1229960	Because that'd be pretty awesome. If, if I think it's just an AI character, this is one of the
1229960	1234200	bros. Right. I understand that, but it'd be awesome if it was just, you know, he's AI
1234200	1238520	controlled. He's taking pictures of shit is, you know, that would be kind of cool. That would be
1238520	1242440	like, uh, that would be like the dude who comes down in random moments and earthbound and says,
1242440	1248440	now say fuzzy pickles. Uh, anyway, uh, Hajime Tabata also went on to say, uh, Hey,
1248440	1253160	I know that copies are out there circulating early basically and say, you know, stressing
1253160	1258200	everybody worked really hard on this. Please don't spoil the game before the game is actually
1258200	1263640	on sale. The direct quote is we may be unable to anticipate the spoiler videos and such that
1263640	1268440	appear as a result of this. We hope that everyone looking forward to final fantasy 15 can be very
1268440	1273960	careful. We are also doing our best to prevent the circulation of leaked videos to those who
1273960	1278120	received the game early. Please be considerate to those looking forward to the official release of
1278120	1283880	this title. Now it says to me, and I will say this upfront, I know nothing about 15's plot,
1283880	1287320	but this all says to me, somebody dies and they don't want you to know who.
1288360	1292280	Well, I think, I mean, people want to get the video out there first because
1292280	1295480	that's the YouTube hits and that's money. And you know, it's all about that.
1297400	1303320	Anyway, uh, looking at some of the chats in our, uh, uh, chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Um,
1303320	1309400	Akuma JP says, Prompto, he is AI. So, huh, interesting. Uh, and Akuma JP says, it's not
1309400	1315160	required the, uh, additional stuff. Uh, but you will have more fun if you know the history and
1315160	1320040	why or how they go to war. Yeah, I'm fine with that. In fact, you know, I kind of want to see
1320040	1324360	the anime and movie cause it looked cool. Just like the first 12 minutes, like pretty awesome.
1324360	1331080	Um, I don't know. I mean, I'm interested. I just like the demo. Sierra Lee didn't do it for me,
1331080	1335240	which is unfortunate. I mean, I got an idea of what the game was, but like, I still didn't
1335240	1340040	understand what the game is and stopping and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, ha ha ha,
1340040	1347560	Rob, you're so cute in believing delay excuses. Well, look, I, what can I, I mean, I, I think,
1347560	1351800	you know, and in the back of my mind, I always kind of thought it failed certification. That's,
1351800	1355160	that's the real reason I got to it failed certification. Then they had to delay it,
1355160	1358920	but we don't have proof. Nobody's saying that. So I can really only,
1359560	1364760	I can really only just have that leap of faith and, and trust what they say. But believe me,
1365000	1370680	I understand your cynic perspective in that regard too. So every single patch update,
1370680	1375320	just like Minecraft needs to have like removed Sephiroth. Cause you know, they always like to
1375320	1381640	add Sephiroth into these games is like an added bonus. Akuma JP also says, has she made to bottom
1381640	1387320	made crisis core and final fantasy zero. Of course somebody is going to die. So that's just,
1387320	1391240	that's what we do now. That's right. I have another final fancy game. I don't play. I completely
1391240	1396360	forgot. I bought that for the demo of final fantasy type zero and all that type zero.
1396360	1403000	Whoops. Yeah, that gave me an impression on me. All right. And yeah, as Joe and a mat says,
1403000	1407320	no one is showing the receipts for why there was a delay. So we just have to take their word for it.
1407320	1410360	That's right. And they're not going to come out and say, yo, we failed certification or,
1410360	1413880	or Hey, we had this major game breaking. They're going to have a guest character.
1413880	1417800	Eric's going to show up all of a sudden she gets run through with a sword again. Sephiroth there.
1417800	1422520	It's like, ah, you know, it's this all over. Well, you know, in the car you can listen to
1422520	1428600	final fantasy, greatest hit tracks. So hopefully they have like, uh, the, the one winged angel
1428600	1431880	that you can actually play in the car while you're driving around. Cause I don't know about you,
1431880	1438920	Loki, but I do that anyway in my own car. I think I would probably like, cause I don't remember the
1438920	1443640	demo. You have to fight the behemoth or whatever. Just run that over with the car. Just like drive
1443720	1448920	right into that sucker. Doesn't the car fly? Just drive straight through his forehead. Yeah.
1448920	1453640	Well, I'm really, really looking forward to final fantasy 15. I have to decide like how much of it
1453640	1458040	do I want to stream? Because I, I realized like everybody's going to be streaming it probably,
1458040	1462360	especially on Tuesday when everybody gets the game. But I think, I think I probably will do a
1462360	1467720	bit of streaming just, especially in talking to Bobby, uh, just before we went live tonight. Um,
1467720	1473560	he kind of said, I'm waiting to see some of the early streams to see like what the options really
1473560	1478440	look like or what the combat really looks like, um, type of thing. So, um, for that reason,
1478440	1482600	I'll probably do at least a few streams the first couple of days of the game, but I don't know,
1482600	1486680	I don't know if I could stream all 70 hours or whatever it's going to take me to beat it.
1486680	1491160	I won't be streaming shit because there's not enough bandwidth in the house to do Netflix and
1491160	1495640	fucking play the game. And sometimes there's not even enough. Yeah. To do both of those. I mean,
1496840	1501160	for some stupid reason, like even though like it's streaming over my network,
1501160	1507800	I can't, I have a fucking gigabit internet, you know, within my home network. Right. That's not
1507800	1512360	enough to stream the fucking shit to my laptop. That's literally sitting four feet away from the,
1512360	1518760	you know, well not four feet, six feet away. Wireless though? Um, yeah, I've been doing
1518760	1522680	a wireless, but I've got a, you know, um, what's automatically going to be like that one gigabyte
1522680	1527640	gets slashed to whatever the wireless can handle. So I have wireless AC, so it should be able to
1527640	1533720	handle that. Yeah. Maybe you got a lot of noise or something. Who knows? Um, all right. Anyway,
1533720	1537320	uh, so I think that's all I really want to say about Final Fantasy 15. Obviously there'll be
1537320	1541000	a lot more in this coming week. It's going to be a big week in games. I mean, this week's been a
1541000	1545480	little, so now is the VR thing included in this or is that something that's coming later? That's
1545480	1550040	lame. You know what else comes later? The patch for the PS4 pro that is not going to be out at
1550040	1554440	launch that comes later. Don't care. Don't have, well, obviously you don't care, but I do have a
1554440	1558760	PS4 pro and I was kind of looking forward to that increased frame rate since, you know,
1558760	1565080	that's the one perk I get on my non 4k TV. So I'm a little disappointed. That's not going to be
1565080	1569640	their launch day, but I'll probably still be playing by the time that patch hits. So it will
1569640	1574760	be kind of interesting to see the before and after, if nothing else, there is that. So, um,
1576280	1581160	anyway, uh, let's move on. I want to get into the other gaming news for this week and how was your
1581160	1585480	gaming week? Uh, so let's get into our gaming week. So what types of video games you have been
1585480	1591000	playing this week? Loki, what have you been playing? So I played, um, on Sunday, I had played
1591000	1595800	a little bit of Watch Dogs 2 and actually got to try some of the online because I didn't realize
1595800	1600840	that they had shuts or turned on some of those services. So, um, ironically enough, I want to
1600840	1606440	say it was Dungeon Buster that jumped in. Um, it was done. I don't remember who was it. I think
1606440	1614360	it was Dungeon Buster that, um, jumped in and, um, we played some co-op and that was fun. It had
1614360	1620520	lots of chaos. So, um, definitely enjoying that. However, I didn't really play much of Watch Dogs
1620520	1626520	2 because I've been purchasing things on the PlayStation store thanks to their like Black
1626520	1632840	Friday, um, deals and stuff like that. So I ended up picking up Skyrim because Skyrim dropped to
1632840	1640200	half price and then, you know, I wanted it for half price. Um, honestly, can't really tell the
1640200	1645640	difference from the PlayStation 3 one. I mean, it's really, well, I mean, I, I didn't actually
1645640	1651960	didn't have the PlayStation 3. I had it on a PC, but it's not, the change is not that noticeable.
1651960	1656520	I mean, I know that they added more like foliage and stuff in the draw. This instance is longer,
1656520	1659880	but it's not like, Whoa, this looks incredibly better. It's just like, yeah, this looks like
1659880	1666840	Skyrim. But mods are fun. I'm having fun with mods. Um, but I mean, it's basically, it's playing
1666840	1673960	like I do on PC. Um, so yeah, I mean, I don't know. It's going to waste a lot of my time though,
1673960	1680520	unfortunately. Um, what else did I do? Um, they have that cool skin that came out now that I don't
1680520	1685320	know if you picked it up for Rez, the, uh, the new background. No, I forgot to grab that. I should
1685400	1688920	have. It's fucking awesome. Is it still up? I hope so. I don't know. It was free though.
1688920	1695400	And for Rez's 15th, 15th anniversary. No, that can't be 15. Is it? No, I think it is. Yeah. I
1695400	1700280	think it's like 15. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, go check it out. Um, it's free. It might be more. It might
1700280	1705880	be more actually because no, it can't be 20. It's gotta be, but yeah, the Dreamcast was out nine,
1705880	1711240	nine 99. So that, that would make sense. 2001 for Rez. That makes sense. Cause it was on PS2 as
1711320	1717640	well. Right? Yeah. 2001 makes sense for that. You know, let's see here. So, and then
1719080	1725720	what else did I play? I, yeah, it was dungeon monster. Yes. Okay. So, um, I also played,
1727240	1732760	what else did I pick up? I purchased the, a couple more VR games cause they were on sale.
1732760	1739880	So I picked up track mania cause track mania was down to like 15 bucks. So I was like, dude,
1739880	1743400	I can't pass it up for that. Plus it has the VR mode. I haven't got a chance to try that yet
1743400	1748760	because the problem with that is, you know, the setup required for that. It doesn't work really
1748760	1757480	well when other people are trying to watch TV. Um, and then I picked up, I don't remember the
1757480	1762280	other game was called now, but quick interjection while you're thinking Rez's release date was
1762280	1771400	November 22nd, 2001 in Japan. It came out in the US, uh, in, uh, January of 2002. Yeah. Bound was
1771400	1776760	the other game I think I got. Um, that was a VR game. So I checked that out and, or I haven't
1776760	1782360	gotten to check that, but I did purchase as well, but mainly Skyrim. I've been playing a lot of
1782360	1787240	that. It has been crashing by, I attribute that to like the 20 plus mods I have running on it.
1787240	1794040	So that's fine. And I'm kind of okay with that. Um, I don't know. It's fun. It's got all the
1794040	1799000	updates to it. I, you know, one of the things with Skyrim, I like a lot of the enhancements
1799000	1804200	that people have made. Like there's, um, one of they've got better quest directions. So it'll like
1804200	1809880	give you, you know, precise, here's what you need to do to finish this quest stuff. And the markers
1809880	1814280	are more updated and stuff like that. So those enhancements really make the game kind of fun,
1814280	1818120	kind of disappointed that it disables your trophies, but I understand because you can
1818120	1822600	totally cheat your way through the whole game. But, uh, I really played for trophies anyways.
1822600	1826440	Um, Fallout 4 was the other one I downloaded mods for, but I haven't gotten a chance to play that
1826440	1831320	yet. Um, just because I'm too lazy to actually pop the disc into the machine and try it out.
1831320	1835560	That's really lazy. But I did, I did pre-order Final Fantasy 15. So that should be unlocking
1835560	1840600	for me at nine o'clock on Monday. Nice. I may, I may not get to play tomorrow night. I may have
1840600	1845400	to wait till Tuesday cause I'm at the mercy of Amazon shipping. So I may not actually get it
1845400	1850600	till Tuesday, but that's fine. If I miss a few hours, I'm not going to scream and cry about it.
1850600	1856360	So it's fine. Yep. So I think that's everything. I mean, aside from, you know, Ingress, I did try
1856360	1861720	Pokemon just to see the updates and stuff and the, you know, the near by features kind of nice,
1861720	1866040	I guess. I still don't understand where things are, but it's like, at least I know it's near
1866040	1874360	this Poke stop or something. Um, I mean, it's all right. That's it. All right. Um, my gimme week,
1874360	1878680	I've been continuing on in Pokemon moon. Um, still playing that a little bit. Uh,
1878680	1882600	Shane also helped me out because, you know, he went straight through the game and he's
1882600	1887160	already beat it. And so he got me, uh, some of the starters. So now I have every starter
1887160	1891880	in my Pokemon party. So that's kind of fun, uh, getting to play the game like that completely
1891880	1895880	unbalanced, uh, for me, but that's okay. It'll give me incentive to get through the game,
1895880	1900280	uh, and play through that more. Uh, we did tape a Poke stop podcast over the weekend,
1900280	1903880	so that'll be up very soon. All right. When you guys are probably hearing this,
1903880	1908520	uh, so you can hear more about that on that. Um, but other games I've been continuing on and
1908520	1914040	Final Fantasy 14, of course, cause I play a lot of that game. Uh, also I got to see, I didn't play,
1914040	1918920	but I got to see the classic Nintendo system because I was at, um, Flaco Jones's place for
1918920	1922840	a little bit yesterday. Um, you know, he has one and so his kids were playing it.
1922840	1926520	So I got to see that and, you know, I saw the, you know, the interface is pretty slick. I'm
1926520	1931560	going to give it that because it seemed very seamless to like save and load, uh, save points.
1931560	1936040	And, you know, you really could switch between games. Now you mentioned the old Nintendo things.
1936040	1940840	I, my kids were bugging me because they couldn't decide what they wanted to watch.
1940840	1944840	So I decided to play some mega man too. They show them what video games look like. So I played,
1944840	1951400	uh, through a few stages of that and it's pretty hard. Yeah. Right. Games got harder at some point
1951400	1957240	we got older. Um, so yeah, I, I enjoyed the system, but again, you know, yes, I do believe
1957240	1962120	the picture quality was a little better and I can see that. Um, but I'm still kind of like,
1962120	1968760	I just, I have a lot of these games on virtual console. And again, that cord, I know we have
1968760	1972040	a story coming up on it a little later in the show, but the length of the cord is pretty
1972040	1977080	ridiculous. Uh, I don't, I don't see how that would work in many living rooms though. The
1977080	1982360	way Flaco had it set up work though, they had like the, the mini NES was kind of like on a chair
1982360	1986040	and then they would have the chair right next to their recliners that the cord would reach.
1986040	1990040	So it kind of worked the way they had it, but it just, it was stupid. It wasn't the most
1990040	1995240	convenient thing. It's a stupid cost saving. Well, how much did you really save on making that cord?
1995240	1999240	Like what did it kill them to make it Bluetooth or something where he could just be wireless,
1999240	2002360	like have the classic controller wireless, would it have killed them?
2002360	2007320	I just don't use the classic controller for it. I mean, yeah, it's just a little silly,
2007320	2011720	little silly anyway. Uh, so I got to see that, but I didn't get to play it. Just disclaimer there,
2011720	2015480	but it was nice to finally like actually see this device we've been talking about
2015480	2022040	on the show for a few weeks. Um, and then, um, I played, um, let's see, um,
2023160	2027240	gosh, not really a lot else that I can think of just continuing on with Pokemon and the
2027240	2032040	online stuff, just waiting for Final Fantasy 15. Um, Overwatch, I guess would be the other
2032040	2036360	big thing. That's it. Um, cause I did buy something on the Black Friday sales and, uh,
2036360	2041960	Overwatch on the PlayStation 4 is what I bought. Now I already had Overwatch on PC and I was very
2041960	2046520	adamant that I didn't want to buy it on a second platform just because it's the same game. But of
2046520	2051320	course I got suckered in by the sale and it was like, I do want to play with my friends who are
2051320	2057800	on PlayStation 4. So I just bought it on PlayStation 4. Uh, actually I bought it on Amazon
2057800	2062120	because Amazon was price matching and it was like, well, I would like to have the physical disc. Um,
2062120	2066680	so I bought it there for like 35 bucks or whatever. And I have been able to play some
2066680	2071560	matches online. There was a one night it was me extra Shane and Flaco were all playing some
2071560	2075400	matches and that was a lot of fun. So, you know, it's not like it was money wasted. Uh,
2075400	2079320	but it's kind of sucks. I'm having to go through the leveling up experience again, but
2079320	2083800	it's not like I got that far on PC anyway. I'm just, I'm just not very good at Overwatch
2083800	2087240	and I'm okay admitting that. I'm just, I'm really not that good at it, but it's still,
2087240	2091480	it's still fun to fly around and fire rockets even though everybody else is way better than I am.
2091480	2095880	But, um, yeah. So that was my experience with Overwatch. So that was my gaming week.
2095880	2100520	So we're going to get into the news for this week. Sorry, Brad from Pod Culture and chat over
2100520	2106760	at live.vognetwork.com says, uh, Sky, you got to get it for the Xbox one. No, I draw the line. No,
2106760	2112360	we're done. I'm sorry to the Xbox one owners and fans out there, but I can't. Maybe when it comes
2112360	2117640	down to 10 bucks, but maybe when it's 10 bucks, I'll finally get it on Xbox one. I would rather
2117640	2122680	they just figure out the cross play thing. I understand why they don't want to do it between
2122680	2127640	a PlayStation or Xbox and PC because of the whole keyboard and mouse versus controller thing,
2127640	2135080	which is dumb. They've actually done some balancing different on PlayStation four because
2135080	2141000	of it like Torbjorn's turret and Symmetra's things don't hit for as much damage as they do on PC
2141000	2147000	because they admit that people can't aim as well on PS4. Then add keyboard mouse support. Wouldn't
2147000	2151960	that be nice? Wouldn't that be so difficult with USB ports in the front of your stupid console
2151960	2156200	support or Bluetooth? I mean, you've got both of those built into both consoles. So what the fuck
2156200	2159960	is the problem? I think, I think they are worried that the keyboard mouse people would kill the
2159960	2166280	controller people. And I don't know, but anyway, but at least let the Xbox one and the PlayStation
2166280	2171800	four be cross play. I thought, I thought people were starting to play a little nicer in that
2171800	2176040	regard. What we have rocket league is now available on all across all platforms, right? I think so,
2176040	2181320	or it's getting there. They say it's going to be. So why can't we have this? Hopefully they figure
2181320	2187960	that all out before, before long enough. Let's see. SSG100 Matt says the keyboard mouse versus
2187960	2192440	controller argument is BS. Controller players have gotten just as good, if not better than
2192440	2196520	their keyboard mouse players. Yeah, it just, it really just all depends on what you're used to.
2196520	2201240	Like I, I'm not here to argue one is better than the other, but certainly I am really used to
2201240	2207800	keyboard mouse in Overwatch at this point. But it's, it does work both ways. Like when I play
2207800	2213400	Halo, I have to be, and you guys all love it when I talk about Halo. When I play Halo, it has to be
2213480	2220280	on a controller. It feels weird on a PC to me. Like just because that game is like an Xbox or
2220280	2226440	an Xbox 360 game, it is a controller game. I can't play it on PC. It feels weird. So anyway,
2227560	2232440	anyhow, that's enough for my gaming week. Uh, I don't really have a lot of housekeeping tonight,
2232440	2236200	so I'll just plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And we're also on Facebook,
2236200	2242360	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. Uh, we're going to get into some news for now though.
2242360	2246360	Talk about that with you guys in our chat at live.vognetwork.com. So Loki, what's up first?
2246360	2251080	So holy cow, they've decided to actually do an update to No Man's Sky and it's actually a pretty
2251080	2257160	sizable free update. It's called the foundation update. It brings the game up to 1.1 and with it,
2257160	2262920	it adds a lot of new features, new game modes and you know, bug fixes. So one of the major things
2262920	2267560	that they added to it is, um, the beginning of base building. So you're actually going to be
2267560	2273800	able to create your own bases on planets and yeah, it's pretty cool. Um, you can even create
2273800	2281160	like farms in there. Um, some other cool stuff that they had, uh, with the base building. Um,
2281160	2286680	like I said, the farming, you can cultivate crops. Um, you can hire farmers and specialists to
2286680	2292840	research technology, stuff like that. Also, um, you can, the new game modes,
2292840	2296200	where they go along with it, they have basically broken up now the three game modes.
2296200	2302440	So there was a normal mode, which is like a normal, like exp, exploration type thing,
2302440	2307640	creative mode, which allows you to explore the universe without limits. And you can build a
2307640	2312760	large base. Does that mean it turns off those fucking sentries? I would love that. I would
2312760	2317240	love that too. I'm going to find out. Um, and survival mode, which is, um, much more
2317240	2324280	challenging, even less inventory slots. No, I'm actually speaking of inventory slots, which is
2325080	2333320	a relief. Um, they've actually made it now where you can stack up to five items per slot.
2333320	2338360	So it actually allows you to, you know, fix, you know, build a store, a lot more stuff on,
2338360	2343080	on your person or in your ship. Um, along with storage, they've also added the ability to
2343160	2349000	purchase, uh, freighters. So you can purchase a freighter and you can store your items there.
2349000	2354200	You can actually teleport or transport your items to the freighter and store cargo there. Um,
2355320	2361720	there's new technology to research. Um, they've redone the UI as well,
2361720	2368360	um, to kind of help along with all that stuff. Um, just also fix some of the, um,
2369080	2374840	you know, anti-aliasing motion blur, just like a whole bunch of stuff.
2374840	2381640	There's no small update. No, not at all. So, um, you know, that sounds, it looks pretty awesome.
2381640	2386040	So I may have to go check out the game now, you know, being that this is pretty sizable.
2386040	2389640	I mean, it's kind of what Alan and I were both saying this morning when we heard about this
2389640	2392920	update as I was kind of like, well, I really need to get the disc and put it in PlayStation
2392920	2396280	four and see what these changes are all about. And then Alan was saying the same thing cause
2396280	2401880	he owns it on PC. So, um, kind of interesting that this, this sort of showed up out of nowhere.
2401880	2405320	I mean, I know they did a blog post what yesterday or the day before,
2405320	2409320	but that was really the first time we've heard from hello games in weeks,
2409320	2413960	which was kind of a controversial decision of its own for them to go completely radio silent.
2413960	2417320	Yeah. They're also saying you can build like a base camp as well. So you can build
2417320	2422280	like a essential equipment on field or in the field on planet. They said, uh,
2422280	2428120	you can play safe points anywhere in the world for like survival mode, uh, automated harvesters
2428120	2435160	to gather resources. Um, waypoints communication terminals will allow explorers to leave subspace
2435160	2443880	messages for others to find. Um, yeah, I mean, it sounds pretty cool actually. Although it was
2443880	2448600	like the base building stuff, I'd almost make, it seems like you'd not want to leave your planet
2448600	2452200	that you're on at that point, you know, you're building a base there. So I don't know.
2452200	2456520	Yeah. That's well, I guess you can build teleporters to go back to your base. So as
2456520	2461080	long as the teleporter is two way, so you don't like lose your progress wherever you're at in
2461080	2466120	the world. And that sounds like it would be, um, pretty cool. Yeah. And I think with the stacking,
2466120	2469720	you know, like it sounds like they've solved a lot of it, the inventory problems like, you know,
2469720	2474760	with the freighters and with your bases and doing the teleporting and stuff like that. And plus
2474760	2481960	you being able to stack your inventory, hopefully that'll solve some of the things that were kind of
2481960	2487560	annoying. Yeah. But yeah, definitely those recon drone things that are fucking, you know, killing
2487560	2492600	you for mining stuff that needs to be addressed. So hopefully that's one of the things I didn't
2492600	2497560	read through all the patch notes, but maybe that creative mode or whatever. Cause I don't give a
2497560	2501320	shit. There there's no fucking story. We know that already. So there's no fucking story to worry
2501320	2507560	about. So just play casually. I think that'd be a lot better than who gives a shit about survival
2507560	2513080	mode. Uh, let's see. Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, I want to
2513080	2517960	know the mechanism of how you get back to your home base when you're millions of miles away.
2517960	2523880	Space teleportation protocols. It's gotta be something like that. Um, yeah, let's see here.
2525240	2529480	Um, yeah, what basically they said, um, when you claim your home planet by finding an
2529480	2535480	uninhabited base or creating your own, um, you basically going to construct your shelter using
2535480	2540040	like a modular structure. They said you could recruit alien life forms. You can use the
2540040	2545320	terminus teleporters and the space stations to teleport, uh, to and from your base at will.
2545880	2551400	And you can expand your base with storage stockpile, you know, resources and whatnot. Um,
2552120	2558520	yeah. Uh, and in chat, they're pointing out vid power says no man's sky was $20 on Amazon on black
2558520	2563000	Friday. Crazy. So it's interesting cause they're pumping out all these features and you know,
2563000	2567080	the game is going to be a lot cheaper for people to jump into. Now also knows that it's discounted
2567080	2571160	right now on PlayStation network, but I couldn't see for how much cause I already bought it when
2571160	2575320	it came out. It's probably a similar type of reduction. Uh, the, uh, one other thing I want
2575320	2579400	to mention with the update that caught my eye was the communication hub thing where it sounds like
2579400	2582920	you're going to leave like communication beacons for other players. So it sounds like they are
2582920	2587240	trying to bridge that gap a little bit where they kind of got caught in the whole, like,
2587240	2590600	you're really not going to be able to see other people. Cause like the two people that were
2590600	2594200	streaming tried to find each other and they couldn't. Right. Yeah. So, but now it sounds
2594200	2597720	like you could leave mess. Again, I'm just inferring this from the patch notes. I don't
2597720	2601720	know what it really is, but it sounds like you can leave these calm mess. Are they going to be
2601720	2605560	able to find your base and stuff as well? Because is it just going to be, is it going to be
2605560	2609640	persistent on this other person's game or is it going to be just in your own? Is it going to be
2609640	2614280	notes like it is in demons souls or dark souls and like that? That's what I'm curious about. Like
2614280	2619320	leaving those messages behind. I don't know. Uh, anyway, uh, joining us on the show here,
2619320	2623400	uh, walking in as a guest, he can do it cause he lives here. Say hello everybody to Alan.
2623400	2627880	Hello. Hi Alan. How are you? I'm good. I saw you were commenting on the show and I,
2627880	2631160	I was hoping you were going to sit in for a little bit anyway. So I was just like, get in here,
2631160	2637080	make your comments live. Seeing the stuff about No Man's Sky kind of makes me want to start over.
2637720	2646200	Um, cause I mean, I, I don't want to say I got that far. I mean,
2646200	2651080	I had a good 20 or 30 hours on it. I mean, I had a ship with like 20 some slots out of the
2651080	2660760	max of 40 or whatever. So I was doing pretty well. But the problem that I had with the original game
2660760	2666040	was they wanted you to keep looking forward and explore at the expense of everything else.
2666040	2669800	You couldn't really make your way back to a planet that you visited before that you really
2669800	2677880	liked. You couldn't even set a waypoint really for a shop on a planet you are currently on
2677880	2681240	cause the planets are huge. You can explore them for literally dozens of hours. It's one of the
2681240	2685640	first stories that came out when the game was launched. So it's like, Oh, I need to sell all
2685640	2691000	this crap. And I know that I've been to at least two different depots on this planet and I haven't
2691000	2695080	left the planet. I can't make my way back to those depots because I've been explained for so much.
2695080	2700680	Like there's all this quality of life stuff that I want to see them fix before they put in the
2700680	2706360	whole like build a base element. Maybe that stuff was included. I don't know. I didn't look through
2706360	2709960	the patch notes that deeply, but I know they have like the save points, but good question.
2709960	2713800	Do they have something where you can build something to call your ship? Cause like,
2713800	2717880	well, they have that already. Some of those deep, well, you have to find a depot that has it.
2717880	2721880	You know what I mean? But can you maybe build one of those on demand? If you can build a base,
2721880	2726280	the fact that you could not name, cause you had to like, let's say you found a ship that was a
2726280	2730840	huge upgrade, but you had to basically rebuild it. Cause it was a, it was a wreck rather than
2730840	2738040	one you bought at a space station. You have to go run around and put all of these materials into it
2738040	2742760	to like restore, you know, everything about it, but then you can't give it a name. It's like,
2742760	2746920	guys, what are you thinking? You could like, you can name the planets and the little
2747720	2754920	chicken donkey grub dinosaur poopy head things and the plants and the little crickets that all
2754920	2759400	look the same, but you can't name the ship. It's like bizarre. That's a good point,
2760280	2763640	but you are going to check this out. Thanks to the update. Yeah. I kind of want to see,
2763640	2769000	cause there were some mods, uh, for no man's sky PC that were like quality of life stuff
2769000	2775080	to like made the way points that you could set bigger. And one that made the, um,
2775880	2781240	like if you were on a planet that had like 15 different life forms, the last one or two were
2781240	2786760	always the hardest to find because it was like, they only come out at night when it's stormy and
2786760	2791960	it's raining. Like those are the types of conditions. And then one tiny cave. Yeah. Yeah.
2791960	2796680	And I was like, I want it. Cause you, you get, you get a fair amount of credits if you can ID
2796680	2802840	all the planet, all the animals on a planet. So I had a mod that kind of increased the spawn rate.
2802840	2807800	So instead of having to look for four hours, that's not an exaggeration.
2807800	2811720	Instead of having to look for four hours, I would just have to look for like 30 to 45 minutes
2811720	2816040	for the last week. Have it where at least you can scan it like, Oh, new species discovered,
2816040	2820680	you know, and have it kind of highlight where it is in your scans. So at least you can kind of,
2820680	2824040	Oh, okay, there it is. You know, instead of like, Oh, Hey, there's something. Oh,
2824040	2826680	I've already found that. Oh, Hey, there's something else. Oh, I already found that one
2826680	2831480	as well. You can get it to show the red dot. Like if you, let's say there's a hill and there's a
2831480	2835560	bunch of animals on the other side of the hill. If you use your scanner to look for minerals,
2835560	2839320	you'll see green and red dots and red means it's an animal you haven't seen before.
2839320	2844760	That was in the base game. Oh, well that wasn't explained very well in the base game either.
2844760	2848360	But the thing, the thing that's frustrating though, is that it could be like, let's say
2848360	2855400	there's a goat with one horn and then a goat with two horns. It's still considered the same
2856120	2860680	species. So it doesn't count as a new, like you'll, you'll be like, Oh, you ID'd this
2861560	2865720	different flavor of the same animal, but it's not the one that you're looking for.
2865720	2869480	Cause you'll see a red dot and it's like, I found it. Oh my God. And it's like, no, it's just
2870520	2876680	a goat worm. That's kind of stupid looking. It's like his cousin. You found his cousin,
2876680	2882840	but you're what you're looking for is like a bird or something. Yeah. So there's all that stuff. I
2882840	2887240	don't, I don't know. It is. It is. I still think it's a really trippy, relaxing game.
2888280	2894280	Once they patched it on PC. So that actually ran well, it's really beautiful. The planets it
2894280	2898840	generates. Um, not to backtrack too much, but before we get to the next story, I kind of want
2898840	2903800	to ask you a little bit because I know you extensively mod your Skyrim game. Yes. So you
2903800	2908600	probably heard Loki's comments earlier about what his experience is. They have a mod to re-enable
2908600	2913480	official steam achievements. There's a mod to undo the mod. Right. But I'm playing a PlayStation
2913480	2918440	four, so. Oh, that's right. Oh, I keep forgetting the console. Steam's not a big deal because steam,
2918440	2923160	I think you could add mods to the steam workshop and it never would disable the anything. It would
2923160	2927000	just, you do whatever that you want. Steam workshop, which has mostly been abandoned.
2927000	2931560	The community, the mod community is still on nexus for the most part for the PC platform.
2931560	2936840	But, um, there is no integration with workshop for special edition yet. So if you go to steam
2936840	2943320	workshop for Skyrim and you click install, it's going to look for the OG Skyrim, which I think is
2943320	2949160	very silly. Yeah. They're mod system leaves a little something to be desired, but I do like
2949160	2953480	that even works on PlayStation four. It's kind of cool with PlayStation four. So what you do,
2953480	2956280	you can go to their website. Cause I thought that was the only way you could do is go to their
2956280	2961400	website and you can browse the mods and say, okay, mark this one, mark this one or whatever.
2961400	2964920	And then you go into your game, go in the mods and you download them, but you can also actually
2965000	2969080	search for them as well through the mod menu in the game. So you can go in the main menu,
2969080	2972840	look at the mods, they'll show you the top mods or popular ones and the ones you have,
2972840	2975960	you know, marked, and then you can download those and I'll show you which ones you have installed.
2975960	2979320	They'll give you the order that you have them installed because some need to go before the
2979320	2983800	other ones in order to not overwrite certain things or something like that. And so you have
2983800	2988200	a lot of control over it and they're really small downloads because you can't add assets to the
2988200	2995880	PlayStation four cause fucking Sony. Um, so it's really fast to get it working. It's just, um,
2995880	2999160	you know, a lot of times I'll have to like look at them like, what is that mod that I marked?
2999160	3003880	What does that do? You know? And we're like, Oh, we'll be like, Oh, this is a chest with stuff in
3003880	3007560	it. And it's like, okay, where was that chest again? It's like, I gotta find, gotta remember
3007560	3013400	where this is. Um, so I don't know. It works pretty well from what I've seen, but I'm,
3013400	3017880	you know, very limited because I can't do assets cause I don't have that on Xbox one.
3017960	3023320	I don't have an Xbox one. Yeah. Um, I imagined the load order cause like if
3023320	3027080	mods step on each other's toes and just the tiniest bit, it's like, make sure you load
3027640	3034600	this mod after this one and this one so that this one gets priority. And on PC there's a program
3034600	3039880	called loot, which is load order optimization tool. And it will read through all the plugins
3039880	3044920	and take all, take care of all of that for you. And I can't imagine on console having 30 or 40
3044920	3049880	mods and being new to mods in the first place because I mean, you know, PC mods Loki, but the
3049880	3055640	average console user that's never owned a gaming PC isn't to be like, Oh, you need to sort the
3055640	3060920	order that you load these in. That's kind of like a power user thing to me. Right. Thankfully,
3060920	3065080	all the mods that I get are really small. So like there'll be just adding more magic spells or
3065080	3069240	something like that. And so it's not necessarily something that's going to affect a lot of, they
3069240	3073960	don't really interact with each other too much. And so I've lucked out there, but there are some
3073960	3077720	where like, Oh, if you're loading this on there, you need to make sure this is at the bottom or
3077720	3083640	this is lower than this. So, I mean, it kind of at least explain that for you, but, um, yeah,
3083640	3088440	I mean, it still crashes. I've had a crash about four times already. And it just, it's usually when
3088440	3093560	it's loading dialogue, it's kind of weird. And I had an animation mod that I loaded up for Rob
3093560	3097480	and I said, Hey Rob, look at this. And I casted a spell on my follower and he started to twerk
3098280	3103080	like actual twerking. And you were like, you were like, you're like uninstall, uninstall steam,
3103080	3107080	uninstall Skyrim. This is what you spend all your mod time doing. This is, this is when I see you
3107080	3111400	in that, that, that big chart where I'm like, are you doing work right now on a Saturday night? And
3111400	3114600	you're like, no, this is the mod management thing. And I'm like, it looks like work.
3115320	3119000	So, and uh, yeah, I'm like, that's what you spend all your hours. And then I casted another spell
3119000	3123240	where they legit do Michael Jackson's thriller dance with like the twitch of the neck and then
3123240	3128360	the arms go out and then shuffle, slide foot, the whole thriller dance. And I was like, it's
3128360	3134200	animation mod. I just cast a spell on him and I reload my save blocked reported. Yeah. Anyway,
3134200	3138760	um, well, another system that you might get to play with Skyrim mods on, it sounds like it's
3138760	3143400	going to be the Nintendo switch. Obviously I'm taking a big leap there, but here's what really
3143400	3149480	happened this week is that obviously we've seen that Skyrim is there in the switch teaser video.
3149480	3153640	A lot of people spotted Skyrim there and said, Oh, does this mean Skyrim is on the switch?
3153640	3160360	They showed it like five times. Yeah. Like maybe not saying anything. It's like, Oh, come on.
3160360	3164840	Well, but what was interesting and what happened this week is that Todd Howard from Bethesda
3164840	3171240	spoke to a gaming publication, a new one called Glixel, uh, talking about the, uh, Skyrim footage
3171240	3175960	that was on the switch. Uh, and you know, they asked, what do you think of the switch? And,
3175960	3180280	uh, Todd Howard said, I love it. I got to play it. I'll tell you. Well, maybe that's an NDA thing.
3180280	3186120	One of the best demos I've ever seen, probably the best demo I've ever seen at E3. Uh, and then,
3186120	3190440	uh, was it a Nintendo game? I mean the device itself. I think it's really smart what they're
3190440	3193960	doing. We're definitely going to be supporting it. It's the first time we've done something on
3193960	3200360	Nintendo. If you don't count the old NES stuff home alone or where's Waldo. Don't worry. Nobody
3200360	3205800	counts that stuff, but then can you really bring Skyrim with you on the go? And the answer is it's
3205800	3213080	the same game on the TV and on the other screen. Oops. He didn't say that it wasn't happening or
3213080	3217960	that we haven't announced Skyrim on it yet. He gave an answer that said, it's the same on the TV
3217960	3223880	and on the portable screen. So kind of, kind of confirmed something we pretty much already
3223880	3229560	assumed. I was going to say, I don't know if it's a mystery or mystery because it was literally in
3229560	3236680	the, yes, but Nintendo came back right after that and said, none of the games you see should
3236680	3239640	be considered an announcement or anything like that, you know? And I think they're speaking
3239640	3244520	more of their first party stuff, but yeah, I think most of us were like, okay, we know Skyrim is on
3244520	3248840	this thing. But one thing I wanted to say with all this is that, I mean, it's not like Minecraft and
3248840	3255000	the Ouya. Yeah. This is okay. This is one of those things where it's like, is this necessarily
3255000	3261640	a good thing though? And I think I said this when the footage was first unveiled, is that Skyrim is
3261640	3267560	kind of last year's news. And I understand that a lot of you are still into it and really play it
3267560	3272920	and so forth. I'm not like trying to be disrespectful. It's 2011's news. Exactly. Yeah.
3272920	3279880	It's news from a long time ago. This was part of what hurt the Wii U. This was a big part of what
3279880	3285720	hurt the Wii U, is gaming companies thought, oh, we can put a year old game on the Nintendo console
3285720	3290920	and people will buy it. And they didn't because for most people, the Wii U was the secondary
3290920	3296760	console, if any console, to the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360. They could launch it though. And it would
3296760	3303000	really only be a six month old title because it's going to be, you know, it's Skyrim remastered.
3303000	3307400	So it's remastered. It's not that old. And honestly, I mean, yeah, it's old, but it's still
3307400	3311800	entertaining. It's a long ass game. It's very good value for your purchase. I'm not saying it's a bad
3311800	3316440	game or anything by that means. I mean, it will, it will be something that definitely is, oh, it'll,
3316440	3321240	to see a game like that in Nintendo's lineup will definitely make it. It'll fill the void until
3321240	3326520	Skyrim, you know, the next Elder Scrolls game comes out. Yeah. But I just, you know, again,
3326520	3333080	I hope Bethesda is working on something else, something newer as well, and not going to judge
3333080	3339320	the Wii, or not going to judge the Switch by a game that's five years old finally coming
3339320	3344040	out on a Nintendo platform. Most of the people that are buying the Switch probably already have
3344040	3349880	played Skyrim one place or another. That's just, that's just my biggest concern. Or what are they
3349880	3356280	going to do with Skyrim that hasn't been done before? Make it portable? Obviously that's going
3356280	3360920	to be the big thing, but is that going to be enough? Maybe, maybe for some people. I don't know, if it was
3360920	3365720	Mass Effect 3 you'd be buying it anyway, so. That's different and you know it. It's not different, it's
3365720	3370520	exactly the same. I didn't actually buy Mass Effect 3 right away. Remember, I didn't buy it on Wii U till
3370520	3376920	it was $12. So, you know. Well, if they come out at $29.99, which is what I purchased it at for the sale,
3376920	3383320	I think that's a pretty good deal. I think that'd be a really easy sell. All right, well, I, we'll, we'll see
3383320	3388680	what happens with Skyrim on the Switch now that we practically have confirmation that it's happening
3388680	3393560	short of. I mean, that's pretty exciting because I, you know, I don't know. That'd be a game I'd play on
3393560	3398920	the Switch if I picked one up. I'd have to see what else is coming out for, but I mean, I like
3398920	3404760	the idea because my laptop just doesn't run it very well. I mean, it runs it okay, I guess, but
3406120	3410120	it would be nice having that screen and everything. Some support in our chat over at
3410120	3415880	live.vognetwork.com. Brad from Pod Culture says, what isn't Skyrim on at this point? Well, a Nintendo
3415880	3422040	platform would be the answer. Dark Tetsuya says, hell, I'm at least considering Skyrim on Switch.
3422040	3427240	And Dungeon Buster says, as much as I love Skyrim, there are a lot of other RPGs to get into
3427240	3433000	nowadays. Dark Tetsuya says, what if they did what Bayonetta did and add some Nintendo themed
3433000	3437960	exclusives? And I'm just thinking like, that just seems like it would be really out of place. I've
3437960	3443880	seen that and it's not pretty. In a Skyrim game. I guess I'm sure, I'm sure Alan could tell you about
3443880	3448120	the total conversion that they have for like, you know, the Mushroom Kingdom stuff. Have you seen
3448120	3455720	that for Skyrim? Oh, um. I know, I've even heard of this. It doesn't look good. Yeah, I think
3455720	3462840	there's also a Minecraft conversion where Skyrim looks like, yeah. But I'm just like, what Nintendo
3462840	3469000	stuff would go into Skyrim? Like not Mario, maybe some Zelda stuff, maybe Fire Emblem or something
3469000	3475000	a little more. Skyrim had the Portal 2 crossover mod where the space, where the space companion
3475000	3479400	that was funny fell and you just put him in your house and he was like space, I'm gonna go space,
3479400	3486280	and then you could have a giant knock him into space. Like that's the only tie. And then I
3486280	3490440	remember you showing me that. That's like barely a helmet out of, that's like barely any content.
3491480	3495720	I mean, you pick a lot of mushrooms in Skyrim. So yeah, just put red and white mushrooms in there.
3495720	3501400	That's ridiculous. How about roll a million goombas down a hill instead of cabbages? Yeah,
3501400	3507800	that would be worth it. All right, moving on. Loki. All right, so this is a game that's been out for
3507800	3513880	a while now and I wish we'd get mod support on PlayStation 4 as well. Saints Row 4, they're
3513880	3519480	finally getting official mod support with the same workshop. So you'll be able to download mods
3519480	3523960	through that instead of the roundabout way that they have right now. But they have had mod support
3523960	3528920	for the game for quite a while now. Actually Saints Row 3rd and even Saints Row 2. But now
3528920	3534200	this will be a slightly easier way to do it and you can check that out. And they've also, I guess,
3534200	3539160	have it on sale. I mean, they always have it on sale. It's been all over the place. In fact,
3539160	3544760	I think I just recently uninstalled it on my PlayStation 4 because I need to make room for
3544760	3553080	Final Fantasy 15. But yeah, I would like to play mods on the PlayStation 4. So what mods can we
3553080	3557240	expect to see besides nude mods? Because that I'm sure is the first thing that'll be out.
3557240	3562600	Well, let's see. I'm trying to think what they had on like just the non PC stuff. They had like
3562600	3567240	tweaks for some of the games to make them not so difficult. Like the mini games, some of them are
3567240	3574040	kind of, you know, frustrating. So they have those. They have adding some of the stuff that was in
3575320	3581400	Enter the Dominatrix. So there's like some added stuff you can add there for that. They had
3583080	3590040	I'm trying to think what else. Like different companions you can get. You can do new cars.
3590040	3597560	I mean, they have all sorts of crazy stuff for it. Different weapons. I don't know. Yeah,
3597560	3602200	yeah. There's new mods and, you know, make your breasts extremely large mods and stuff like that.
3602200	3609640	Old goody. Maybe, maybe Alan will find some mods where they can dance and twerk and do thriller.
3609640	3614600	They already do that. They do the Carlton and all sorts of stuff. Yeah. Saints Row four. They
3614600	3620440	already do all that stuff. I would like a new Saints Row game. I'm not a huge fan of four and
3620440	3630200	wasn't enter. Um, was it gotten the hell was all right or out of hell. Um, but I would like a new
3630200	3636440	Saints Row game for better or worse. I don't see why they won't do one. They will eventually. I
3636440	3640280	just don't know what it's going to be. It may not necessarily be Saints Row five. It could be a
3640280	3645880	reboot. Well, they've got that one game that volition is working on now. That's not Saints
3645880	3649640	Row, but it's got some Saints Row elements in it with all the superheroes. Yeah. With all the,
3649640	3656600	like, yeah, that now looks okay, but I want an actual Saints Row game. I liked Stoppy's comment
3656600	3662360	in chat over at live.vog.network.com. I was about to say Saints Row feels like one massive mod
3662360	3669160	turned into a game. It kind of does. It is. Yeah. For me is basically a massive mod on three. I
3669160	3677800	mean, I don't know. It was just in Gata out of hell was kind of a reskin of four. I mean, I don't
3677800	3683880	know. All right. Well, moving on to a story about Ubisoft and the way that they plan to approach
3683880	3690280	DLC in the future. Um, there was an interview with gi.biz where the vice president of live operations
3690280	3695640	and Blondeljuin, I hope I said that name right. Um, talking about some of the recent things that
3695640	3702120	they've learned from a game like Rainbow Six Siege about how DLC for, you know, other Ubisoft games
3702120	3707320	should work going forward. Uh, in, uh, for those that are not familiar with Rainbow Six Siege,
3707320	3713560	um, you only have to pay for content in the game, which customizes characters or buying new ones.
3713560	3718360	The maps themselves end up being free, which isn't always the case in other online shooters
3718440	3724360	where you have to pay for the maps. Um, some quotes here from again, the VP of live operations
3724360	3727880	monetization is something we have to be very careful about. And my team is in charge of that
3727880	3731880	and making sure we find the right balance. If it's not adding something on top of the actual
3731880	3736520	experience of the game, then it is no good because you'll be asking for money for the wrong reasons.
3736520	3740600	Also, if the content is compulsory for the gamers, it's no good as well. It wouldn't work.
3740600	3745160	It is a way to deliver more fun to gamers, but they have a choice to go for that extra fun or
3745160	3750200	not. No more DLC that you have to buy. If you want to have the full experience, you have the
3750200	3754040	game. And if you want to expand it, depending on how you want to experience the game, you're free
3754040	3759000	to buy it or not. The way we monetize Rainbow Six is that people are happy about the new characters
3759000	3762520	and they can customize them with weapons and charms. But even if they don't do it,
3762520	3768280	they'll have the exact same experience of the other gamers. So, um, kind of a common theme
3768280	3773000	we're seeing in a lot of, uh, games these days is that a lot of the stuff they're tending to sell,
3773000	3776760	especially in games that really focus in the online realm. I mean, this goes from everything
3776760	3782360	from like in the MMO space, World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 to something like Overwatch,
3782360	3788600	is that a lot of the things that they sell on top of the base game is cosmetics. It's new skins,
3788600	3795080	it's new pets, it's new, you know, shinies, but it's nothing that's going to fundamentally change
3795080	3800360	the game. Uh, again, Overwatch being an example of that. When they release new characters like Sombra
3800360	3804280	or they do a new map like Antarctica, it's out there for everybody. They don't charge for that,
3804280	3809320	but they figure they'll make money off those loot boxes for people that must have that Sombra
3809320	3813000	introduction where she hacks somebody else's play of the game, which is actually really funny if
3813000	3818520	you haven't seen it. So, um, I guess I, I think that's a good thing. I, I, you know,
3818520	3822920	I kind of liked that idea that I'm not going to be paying more money for something that's,
3822920	3826520	should be a part of the main game, but the cosmetic stuff. All right. If it's something
3826520	3832200	I'm into, cool. Otherwise, yeah, you know, take it or leave it. So, all right, moving on.
3832920	3839960	All right. So, uh, with the steam sale this time, they introduced the steam awards. So it's
3839960	3845080	basically a way to nominate certain games for different categories. Um, so some of the
3845080	3850360	categories that they have, uh, the test of time award, the I'm not crying, there's something in
3850440	3857480	my eye award, the just five more minutes award, the whoa dude award, the villain most in need
3857480	3863720	of a hug award, the game within a game award, the I thought this game was cool before it won
3863720	3872040	an award award, uh, the best use of a farm animal award and the we didn't think of everything award.
3872040	3877960	Um, there was also one I saw that was like the most, um, what was it like they're saying like,
3877960	3883720	uh, need of a sequel or something like that. Cause I know people have been nominating
3883720	3887800	half-life to episode two for that kind of stuff. I'm wondering if I think you can actually make
3887800	3893080	your own award. That's where that's happening. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, that, yeah, you can
3893080	3896920	participate that now they're in the steam autumn sale. Um, that's going to be running through the
3896920	3903320	29th. So a couple more days on that. I don't know. Is it just me or does it all feel kind
3903320	3908120	of really uninspiring? Like, I don't know what it is. Like the steam, the steam sales used to
3908120	3911960	be really awesome. Like the last one I remember that was really cool was the one with the little
3911960	3916360	mini game with the robots that was the cookie clicker type game. That was cute. I mean,
3916360	3919800	it wasn't their best, but it was cute. And they had some other stuff, you know, before that,
3919800	3925400	that was kind of cool. But this one just feels, I don't know, like, Oh yay. Another awards thing.
3925400	3930680	And especially awards that are completely like ridiculous. You know what I mean? Like nothing
3930680	3937080	really, you know, of substance, it just feels very bleh to me now, granted. I don't think the
3937080	3942440	autumn sale is supposed to be one of their biggest sales, even though black Friday is like, but, but
3942440	3947240	we're what less than a month, probably tell the holiday sale, which will be their big one. So
3947240	3952600	that's why I'm kind of like, all right, maybe I'm judging this too harshly because usually there's
3952600	3957480	nothing with the autumn sale if memory serves me right. Any of their big stuff would be taken away
3957480	3962280	from it a little bit. Cause there used to be a lot of, you know, um, interest in these sales
3962280	3967160	is because now they don't do the rotating days with different deals. It's just all at once. And
3967160	3971080	so you kind of take a look at it and you're like, eh, where it's like, he wants each day.
3971080	3975000	It keeps you coming back to the store and keeps you, but then people also complain,
3975000	3979160	Oh, I missed what I was looking for. And you know, I, and so I see that side of it,
3979160	3982600	but at the same time, yeah, when you, when you put it all out there all at once like that,
3982600	3987720	it's kind of like, Oh, okay. Well, this was, you know, this wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped.
3987720	3991640	Yeah. Cause you know, you don't, you know, that it's not just not going to get any better than
3991640	3997080	that. Uh, SSU 100 Matt saying, uh, the autumn sale was always just a tease for the winter sale.
3997080	4001240	And I suppose that's true. I suppose that's true. Vidpower says, why don't they just call the autumn
4001240	4005960	sale their black Friday sales since it only takes place during most of black Friday weekend. That's
4005960	4010360	a good question. Why don't they just call it what everybody else called it? Um, let's see. Uh,
4010360	4015080	stop. He says, I do like how alien isolation is getting nominated for the villain and most
4015080	4020440	need of a hug award. I'm sure I'm sure the online communities like Reddit and Twitter and all that
4020440	4025560	stuff are coming up with these ridiculous ideas for nominations that we'll probably see win.
4026120	4030200	Cause otherwise there's so many games on steam. I can't imagine really goat simulator should win
4030200	4036360	for best use of a farm animal. That was a good point. I think I nominated like stardew valley
4036360	4041240	or something, but you're right. Goat simulator is a good, good call. Maybe I'll have to consider
4041240	4045720	going back and changing my answer. Uh, one game that I've been very, I have to admit,
4045720	4049240	I've been very tempted with during the black Friday sales. So I just haven't,
4049240	4053800	I haven't pulled the trigger on buying it yet, but I'm very, very tempted on street fighter five.
4053800	4057400	Cause you know, the street fighter five has been getting some deep discounts during black Friday,
4057400	4061960	uh, and street fighter five, you know, some people are wondering like, is this is, you know,
4061960	4067480	how long is this going to go on? Did the game flop? You know, cause I don't think it's sold
4067480	4070680	and we've reported on this before. I don't think it's sold as strongly as they'd hoped in the
4070680	4074680	beginning. Um, you know, are they gonna, are they going to move on to street fighter six
4074680	4078760	or something else? Well, that doesn't seem to be the case because, uh, in an interview that
4078760	4084440	Yoshinori Ono did with Japanese magazine Famitsu, uh, he's basically saying that the company is
4084440	4089960	still planning ahead to support the game as far as 2020, uh, saying that there's still work to
4089960	4096040	be done to solidify street fighter five as an e-sports title. Um, so yeah, saying that they're
4096040	4100840	going to continue to support this through 2020. And we're very likely to see more about this plan
4100840	4106520	at the PlayStation experience because the Capcom cup is happening with the PlayStation experience,
4106520	4111720	which is this coming weekend. I can't believe, Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's like already here.
4111720	4116120	A buddy of mine was really trying to get me to go. And it's like Anaheim is the type of thing
4116120	4120520	that I could road trip him back in a weekend, but I'm just like, Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
4120520	4126920	It's just, I don't know if I could do it. I just, I'm just tripped out at this point from all the
4126920	4131640	different and I have magfest coming up in a few weeks. So, uh, which I can't believe that's what
4131640	4136200	like six weeks away is magfest. So it's, you know, I got all this other stuff going on, but I know
4136200	4140120	the PlayStation experience are going to get a lot of news out of that, uh, including whatever,
4140200	4146440	probably the future of street fighter five looks like, which probably new characters,
4146440	4152440	new stages. I'm sure we'll see plenty of that. Yep. Loki. So another thing that's coming around
4152440	4158760	the corner is, you know, the game awards, um, and the game awards, well, they've got a category this
4158760	4166440	year. That's the best fan creation. And with that, they had four nominees, but now it's actually
4166440	4171960	whittled down to two titles and a couple of these have been pulled. The two tiles have been pulled
4171960	4179720	Pokemon uranium and project AM2R or for those who don't know what AM2R is, it's the, another Metroid
4179720	4189720	2 remake and, um, kind of coincidental that both of those are Nintendo titles and had cease and
4189720	4196760	desist against them. So, um, thanks Nintendo for ruining half of those, uh, nominations.
4196760	4201400	The other two though, who's a big sponsor of the game awards, by the way. Uh, yeah. So the,
4201400	4208360	the other two titles that aren't left, um, to be nominated for brutal doom 64 and end reel,
4208360	4213960	the shards of, uh, order, which I have no idea what that is based on. I know why, I mean,
4213960	4218280	I know what doom is, but I don't know if the other game is a fan game of surprise,
4218280	4223880	not any Sonic fan games there, because that's what I was thinking was that, that, um, 3d one
4223880	4227080	look kind of cool. That was the first thing I thought is that when I was like, okay, well,
4227080	4231720	Nintendo doesn't support these fan remakes. I was like, well, I'm surprised there's no Sonic remakes
4231720	4236040	in there because Sega is supportive of that stuff. And we'll probably love it if a Sonic game won
4236040	4241560	this award. So, uh, that did kind of surprise me, but obviously it's probably too late to replace
4241560	4246040	a nominee. Like I don't think you could fairly do that. Um, but that does kind of suck that those
4246040	4251800	two got pulled. I mean, I understand. No, I don't understand. I mean, come on. I just say,
4251800	4255880	I understand how it happened. I'm not saying I understand why it happens because it's fucking
4255880	4260440	Nintendo. I don't understand that. I don't like their approach, how they take, you know, not only
4260440	4266200	people promoting their games. Like I think the whole Nintendo thing with YouTube and how you
4266200	4271240	have to be like a, you know, an official, you have to pay money to do that. So I think that's
4271240	4277960	fucking stupid. It's such a backwards way to think as a company, I think. And that the kind
4277960	4282200	of that stuff right there just really kind of gives me doubt on, you know, all this awesome
4282200	4285800	stuff that we think is going to happen with the Switch because yeah, a lot of this potentially
4285800	4290360	could be awesome because it's done on other platforms, but Nintendo also likes to fuck
4290360	4297240	things up for some reason. They like to do things their own way. And I'm, I don't know. I'm, I don't
4297240	4304120	like it. Uh, vid power and chat wants you to know Loki enderall is like an unofficial expansion
4304120	4309160	pack to Skyrim. So, I mean, that's kind of cool. Like an Uber mod for Skyrim, basically.
4309160	4313800	There's a bunch of those now. Yeah. There's the forgotten city. There's moon path to elsewhere,
4313800	4319480	like full voiced campaigns that are hours long. Wow. Yeah. That's pretty cool that people build
4319480	4323720	that. So that's cool that at least one of that, one of those is getting recognized. So it'll be
4323720	4328280	that or doom. See now the Switch, here's how you, I heard how you make the Skyrim on the Switch
4328280	4332920	fucking awesome. You, you allow that mod support and you allow it with the, you know, the new
4332920	4338760	media along with it. So not this PlayStation four way of doing things, but I'm talking like
4338760	4346600	X-Box one or PC that'll get you some mileage on that game. We'll see, uh, stopping and chat. I'm
4346600	4350840	talking about, you know, Nintendo's a lockdown on this. Stop. He says, Mark my words, the
4350840	4356120	Switch's equivalent of the share button will be a relinquish all rights to Nintendo button.
4356920	4360600	I'm very curious. You know, a lot of people are assuming there's going to be a share button of
4360600	4364520	some sort on the Switch, you know, because that's basically where we're at now with games is the
4364520	4371240	very social element, but how much control is Nintendo going to put on that? I'm very curious
4371240	4377640	to see. I think it's stupid. And you know what? The answers will be here in January. You know
4377640	4383080	what? And it's, it's, I hope that the Switch does well, but you know, if the Switch doesn't do well,
4383080	4387960	that might least maybe consider have them consider re you know, changing their stance on that stuff.
4388920	4393960	If the Switch doesn't do well, Nintendo may be done with hardware. Uh, I'm fine with that.
4395160	4400920	They may be done with home hardware. Yeah. I mean, they're not leaving there. There's always going
4400920	4407240	to be a 3DS. Nintendo still has a lot of cash in the bank, but if the Switch also tanks in the way
4407240	4413640	that the Wii U did, um, I'm not so sure Nintendo will have another chance to do the home market. So,
4414200	4419160	but we'll see. I mean, who knows? I mean, Nintendo could also, I mean, you look at something like the
4419160	4424120	classic NES doing very well. So maybe Nintendo will milk the nostalgia thing for a few years.
4424120	4430360	Who knows? Who knows? To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
4430360	4436600	at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, chalk. But anyway, speaking of milking nostalgia,
4437480	4442600	something we love to do here at Orange Lounge Radio every week, we take a trip down memory lane
4442600	4447640	with a segment we call the classic game of the week. And usually Dark Sakura walks in here every
4447640	4453000	week to pick a game that she thinks is worthy of being in the archives of a classic video game
4453000	4459720	that, hey, you kids should drop all your, drop your fancy Final Fantasy 15s and play this instead.
4459800	4465640	But unfortunately she's sick, but, uh, we brought in a special guest commentator here this week,
4465640	4472120	Alan, to choose a game for us instead. So Alan, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4472120	4477720	The classic game of the week is Rock and Roll Racing for the Super Nintendo and Genesis
4477720	4482120	by Silicon and Synapse Studios, now known as Blizzard Entertainment.
4482120	4491560	There you go, a little loading screen here. This game, uh, came out in June of 93,
4491560	4497080	uh, was a ton of fun. I know in particular, Rob, the conventions that we used to go to in our youth
4497080	4502120	group where we would hook a, I mean, when I say we, I mean, the group of people I was with,
4502120	4506760	we didn't know each other back then, even though we were at these same events. We hooked up a NES
4506760	4512280	to the hotel TV and we played Rock and Roll Racing, I think for like two and a half days
4512280	4516600	straight. The NES was just never turned off. Like we just played it and played, which is,
4516600	4520600	which is what you do when you're 14. Which said convention was always Black Friday weekend,
4520600	4524280	so good timing on your part. You gotta wonder if they're still using the same
4524280	4527080	hotel and everything for that all these years later.
4527080	4536840	So, um, this game was published locally by Interplay Entertainment back before, um,
4539000	4545080	Blizzard was really its own juggernaut. Uh, the playable characters in it, or for what the game
4545080	4549640	is, it's obviously, it's a racing game that's very combat oriented, maybe a little bit more
4549640	4554760	combat focused than Super Mario, which of course has Super Mario Kart, which does have a combat
4554760	4564360	element. Um, it has four or five licensed songs in it. Um, I believe in 2013 or 2014 on the
4564360	4570440	battle.net site, you can play a demo of Rock and Roll Racing, but the licensed music has been
4570440	4576360	MIDI-ized because of course those licensing agreements have long since run out and they
4576360	4583800	don't want to, um, you know, pay to license Bad at the Bone and Johnny Gun and all that stuff again.
4584360	4594520	Uh, the playable characters are Cyberhawk, Ivan Zephyr, um, Cyberhawk is kind of like a
4594520	4602360	weird sort of Batman clone. Uh, Ivan Zephyr looks like Chewbacca. Jake Badlands is like a cyberpunk
4602360	4609320	with like the Mohawk. Uh, Katarina Lyons is a cat girl. Damn furries always ruin everything.
4609400	4616360	Stop it. Uh, no, I'm kidding. Uh, Olaf, Olaf the Stout is from the Lost Vikings. That was
4616360	4623560	Blizzard's Easter egg is that he was in there. Right. Um, and Snake Sanders kind of looks like
4623560	4629400	the sort of blonde Gaston, like Dudley Do-Right type character. And then there was Tarquin,
4629400	4635400	who looks like the gay elf from Drawn Together. So which of these characters will be the next hero
4635400	4641720	in Overwatch? That's, yeah. Uh, this is a franchise that, and actually reading up about
4641720	4648760	this game, I didn't know that it had, um, they aren't really official sequels, both in name
4648760	4655480	and the fact that Blizzard didn't, um, create them interplay, put them out saying this is an extension
4655480	4659720	of this rock and roll racing IP. But I, I don't remember much about either one of them. But this
4659720	4664360	character, by the way, looks straight like an orc right out of Warcraft. Yeah. Or Slimer. He looks
4664360	4669720	across between orc and Slimer from Ghostbusters. Yeah. Wow. Um, one of the fun things about this
4669720	4676280	game is that it had compressed voice narration for, so Tarquin takes the lead, um, or she's
4676280	4681160	gonna blow when your car's about to blow up. And at the time, obviously, when it was still
4681160	4688120	kart gaming, you know, this was, I remember, I'm trying to think of when this came out in relation
4688120	4692200	to Super, Super Metroid, which had, you know, the, the galaxy is at peace, that was over part
4692200	4698040	at the beginning. So hearing voice that didn't sound like total garbage in a kart game was still
4698040	4707160	kind of undiscovered, um, territory. So that element of it was awesome. Uh, it played really well.
4707160	4716760	No real kart stutter or frame rate lag. Uh, you could buy upgrades for your car. I believe the, the
4716760	4722840	most expensive car that you could get was like a hover car. Like it was on a, um, it didn't have
4722840	4729480	wheels. It sort of glided, but that wasn't the best car. The best car was this, the, um, this,
4729480	4737400	the second to best, which was the, uh, the one with, uh, like triangular, like treadmill wheels,
4737400	4744920	because it could make really sharp corners. Uh, so yeah, you can hear the, the, um, announcer
4745400	4750840	through the YouTube. Let me see if I can find the soundtrack for it. I was just to say real quick,
4750840	4757320	um, one of the thing about this game is that it's basically RC Pro-Am. Yeah, it was originally,
4757320	4761960	um, let me find it here. Was it supposed to be a sequel to ours? I mean, actually it was,
4761960	4772360	it was, um, specked out and budgeted to be an RPM racing sequel. Oh, interesting. But then some
4773320	4781960	point halfway through that interplay got all of the licensed music. And from then it became,
4781960	4786520	um, Oh, let's put Olaf, the Viking in this let's create, let's create the whole like
4787160	4794200	galaxy racer outer space thing. So yeah, it was originally specked as being a sequel to RPM
4794200	4800440	racing, but then through development, it became a entirely separate and probably I'm not familiar
4800440	4805000	with RPM racing. I imagine it was a classic, but there's just so much style to this game.
4805000	4810520	And it's sort of strange to me that, well, I mean, Blizzard also had Blackthorn, I think,
4810520	4814600	which is a game they made when they were a baby company that has absolutely like,
4815240	4819320	they haven't touched that IP. They probably never will. That style of game doesn't really sell
4819320	4825960	anymore, but this is something from their vault that they don't necessarily deny exists, but you
4825960	4830840	really have to dig for the fact that they made this at Blizzcon. I don't know if they still do
4830840	4834600	it, but they used to do it at Blizzcon. They would have a Blizz arcade type of thing that was like
4834600	4839000	their classics that you could play a Blizzcon and this game would always be there hooked up
4839000	4844120	as would, you know, the other stuff you mentioned, uh, lost Vikings, especially their older stuff.
4844120	4848280	But yeah, I don't, I don't see Blizzard revisiting this anytime soon, but I guess you never know.
4849480	4855480	Also lost Viking has Easter eggs and I think vanilla. Wow. There was that. What, what was the
4855720	4860920	old them? They show up. Yeah. You're right. I think it, yeah. Old war, I think is the name
4860920	4864840	of the instance that they show up in. Yeah. So they're there. And also of course,
4864840	4871320	one or more of the Vikings are in Heroes of the Storm. So the lost Vikings gets all of the credit
4871320	4877160	as being the vintage Blizzard game, but rock and roll racing is also, um, one of the, one of the
4877160	4882040	things in there. Um, a sequel to the original rock and roll racing was made for the 32 bit PlayStation
4882040	4888120	console by interplay. The game was sold in Europe as rock and roll racing to red asphalt. I've
4888120	4894680	literally never heard of this. I found, I found that out while reading up on what my classic pick
4894680	4901800	was. Yeah. I don't think it was a very good game from what I heard. Um, released December 16th,
4901800	4908600	2013 a motor rock is a game that was developed and published by yard team on steam. It featured many
4908600	4912200	elements, including art assets from the original game and some additional content.
4912200	4917000	It was originally named rock and roll racing. 3d development was started in June, 2009,
4917000	4922040	and it had an Indiegogo campaign. It was pulled from the steam store due to copyright infringement
4922040	4928040	from Blizzard because of course it was, um, it's for a fan project to just like, be like,
4928040	4932680	Oh, this is a sequel to the game. And a ton of like of assets are taken wholesale from the
4932680	4940200	original. It seems a bit silly. Um, but apparently since, uh, then yard team sells a game steam keys
4940200	4950200	through their website. So I may have to check that out. Um, and I still cannot find in this.
4950200	4953400	You'd think I would have discovered it. Like I would have had it prepped before it was my
4953400	4957240	turn to talk about this, what the soundtrack was, but it was the, um,
4957240	4968200	um, bad to the bone born to be wild playing right now. Did it have the spy Hunter song theme song
4968200	4972920	in it too? Johnny, I'm trying to think, I feel like it did. Peter gun is the Peter gun is the,
4972920	4977800	yeah, that song. Yeah. So it did kind of get repetitious, but the game was so fun because
4977800	4982120	it was only the same three or four songs over and over again. And the voiceover announcer also was
4982120	4990120	kind of repetitious, but the game play was so smooth and fun and incredible that, you know,
4990120	4994920	when you were 14 playing this game at four in the morning, it was, it was a good old time.
4994920	5000440	And I recommend if you were into combat based, I was like, why, when did Samuel L. Jackson get
5000440	5005560	into the game? Sorry. I had an ad pop up and I got it. I changed browsers today on the studio
5005560	5010360	computer, so I haven't been able to do all the ad blocking stuff. And I know twisted metal was
5010360	5015160	its own beast, but if you're really into those combat, like racers with a heavy combat element
5015160	5018920	where you're shooting missiles and cars, and it's really not even about who races the best,
5018920	5025160	but who can get the best shot in to blow up your opponents and just take the lead. Definitely check
5025160	5030680	this game out. So I found the song list for you. Okay. To the bone born to be wild highway star
5030680	5035480	paranoid and the Peter gun theme. Yes. Yeah. I think paranoid was a fit. That's black Sabbath,
5035480	5041960	right? Yeah. So yeah, um, for this Ness and Genesis came out June, 1993 rock and roll.
5044040	5048520	Awesome. Great pick. Thank you. Uh, there it is your classic game of the week. Rock and roll
5048520	5053080	racing. Dark soccer. I would have approved if she was here. Actually I swore up and down. She'd
5053080	5057640	already picked it, but I think we just had a side discussion of it one time when the blizzard thing
5057640	5062600	came up in the battle net, uh, and they were doing the whole revival. Cause I know that dark Tetsuya
5062600	5067720	is on it. He's probably already updated the Wiki right now with this game. I searched for blizzard.
5067720	5072760	I searched for rock. I searched for racing. It was not there. It's not there. It's not there. Yeah.
5072760	5076040	Yeah. No, I I'm always surprised that she'll find some games. She's like, can you believe I've never
5076040	5080120	liked silent Hill last week? Like really? She never done silent Hill before. Oh, cause she's
5080120	5084920	done two, three and four, but she's never done the original. So there it is anyway. Yeah. Lots
5084920	5089160	of classic games. You know, we're up to over 400 classic games. This has been, this segment has
5089160	5093400	been going since episode two 50 classic game of the week was not always here on the show.
5093400	5097320	Um, it was the website of the week. Uh, yeah. And then it was something else before that.
5097320	5102440	It was advice column that this one comes from the podcast days, not the original original life.
5102440	5106840	There's five show. So yeah, it was the advice column. Then the website of the week and now the
5106840	5111880	classic game of the week. Um, and yeah, this one's been going strong since episode two 50. So yeah,
5111880	5117720	over 400, I would say unique classic games of the week, but there have been a couple repeats
5117720	5122120	on accident. She has accidentally repeated a game a couple of times, but it's still not a bad track
5122120	5128520	record for over 400 episodes. So anyway, uh, let's see a dark to see a giving credit where credit is
5128520	5132920	due that AJ mix actually does a lot of those updates. Uh, Alan, just so you're aware on the
5132920	5138200	Wiki anyway, uh, we're gonna take a quick break. Uh, when we come back, there's plenty more orange
5138200	5143160	lounge radio to come, including rapid fire news. What's in stores this week and some more news and
5143160	5148600	your calls at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. We will get to all that when we come
5148600	5160200	back with more of orange lounge radio right after this. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge
5160200	5167480	radio live tonight with episode number 667 for this November, the 27th of 2016, our show already
5167480	5174680	in progress. Um, Alan has retired, uh, to back into his, uh, office to go play some more Skyrim
5174680	5178840	or whatever game he's working on, but we thank him for sitting in on part of the show. He might
5178840	5182680	come back a little bit later. He did a good job of the classic game of the week. Um, I wish I'd
5182680	5189240	waited to do this on air, but during the break, I realized that Loki had yet to have crystal Pepsi
5189240	5195960	since the 1990s. And, uh, it, the crystal Pepsi came back in stock all of a sudden on the Amazon
5195960	5202360	pantry on black Friday. So I had a pretty substantial coupon because my PlayStation pro
5202360	5206920	I was in Chicago when the pro came out. Right. So I just had it shipped normal speed. So they
5206920	5211240	gave me a pretty good coupon for pantry. So long story short, I ordered and I had to get like an
5211240	5216280	eight pack of crystal Pepsi to, to get delivered here, uh, to, to get any of it. Cause Alan had
5216280	5221720	never had it either. So he finally tried it last night. And during the break, Loki had some crystal
5221720	5225000	Pepsi for the first time. Was it, was everything you remember from the nineties? Um, I don't
5225000	5229960	remember it being very good in the nineties and this is okay. It's just, um, uh, it's kind of
5229960	5237640	disturbing not seeing it caramel colored. Um, and it's just also, it's like, it's like how you
5237640	5242520	imagine diet, you know, when they replace the sugar with like sweetener, except they replaced
5242520	5247960	it with like more sugar or something like that. And so it's like incredibly sugary sweet. Like,
5247960	5253480	I feel like drinking this, I'm still going to do it is going to make me sick later to my stomach.
5253640	5257320	Well, that's sick to myself, but like, it's going to be like, oh, I'm going to,
5257880	5260920	yeah, sugar coma. That's cool. Like I can be awake.
5262280	5266680	Drink it slowly. Um, I would think maybe that's going to be a great mixer for something like,
5266680	5271400	uh, vodka or something that might be a place to use that. Then it's going to be like completely
5271400	5275720	clear alcoholic drink. That'll get me messy. Um, well, no, not vodka, but like, you know,
5275720	5282440	staying awake. Um, I've been trying to work on, I went back to working on, um, my car game again,
5282440	5287400	so hopefully since everybody's been bothering me about, um, where'd you beat the car game?
5287400	5292120	Like someone to work on something else. It's like, fine. There you go. So I went back to
5292120	5296760	working on that again. Um, but I got to rebuild everything. It's going to be from scratch. So
5297880	5303000	yep. Uh, Brad from pod culture says guy, Hey, geek cuisine is our thing. Sorry. Sorry. My
5303000	5306600	friends over at pod culture, but just, I just tell them that like, I totally forgot I should
5306600	5310680	order a case of surge because that's really, that was my thing. I don't remember that at all. I
5310680	5314600	remember having it back in like high school, but I don't, we had it. Remember I used to, well,
5314600	5318840	cause I had gotten a job at Qs are cause I played laser tag and honestly got a job there for the
5318840	5323160	free games. Cause they give you like 20 games a month for free or something like that. Plus you,
5323160	5327160	whatever you want. So that was why I worked there for like minimum wage. Uh, but yeah,
5327160	5330600	search machine there. And so I used to get surge all the time, you know, playing keys,
5330600	5333960	art and stuff. And I love that stuff. It's so good. But then they'll make it anywhere.
5333960	5337000	That's the other nineties thing. I want to make a comeback as cues are, I'm sure you,
5337000	5341640	you much more than me. Oh yeah. Unfortunately that's never going to happen just because,
5341640	5347320	um, does it still exist? Like it does still exist. It's the, the closest location to us.
5347320	5352120	I think they have one Vacaville things still going and then conquered is the other one. Um,
5352120	5358520	those are the two closest in Pleasanton, but it's just a lot of the, unfortunately the,
5358520	5362440	like the people that own, like the Qs are franchise originally like the rights to
5362440	5367080	everything. They sold it off. And then like, there's a guy named will low who had like 300
5367080	5371800	packs from all these different clothes locations. And I think those have been sold off, but they
5371800	5376680	have another company now in the UK. I want to say that's making the parts again for those. Um,
5376680	5380760	I honestly thought it was like the best laser tag that they had out there. Cause I played quite a
5380760	5385480	few of them and I thought that one was the most fun. There's a lot of like, well, they're not
5385480	5389320	indie, but they're like other systems. Then they just, they don't call them. It's like,
5389720	5394840	branded the same one of the bowling alley golf land has one. There's a specific laser tag place
5394840	5398920	in Carmichael, the laser castle thing. Yeah. They've got lots of like these systems where
5398920	5403080	they just rebrand their own laser tags thing. But Qs are, was more of like a franchise that
5403080	5407080	was like across the world. So that was like, well, none of these still have Qs are locations
5407080	5411400	like in the UK and Australia and stuff like that. And now I feel too old for Qs are like,
5411400	5414600	I don't want to play against a bunch of teenagers. Really good exercise. I would be doing it
5414600	5419720	honestly. Like if it was still around, I would probably be doing that every weekend. Um,
5419720	5424200	cause it's fun. I had a lot of fun with it. See, you know what, this is where I'm missing out.
5424200	5428200	I should, I should have an Amazon referral link for the show because now all these people in
5428200	5432040	chat are like, Hey, the crystal Pepsi is still on prime pantry. I gotta get, and now they're
5432040	5436680	sharing a link with you for surge is apparently there on Amazon. I know it's on Amazon. I just,
5436680	5443160	I'm not ordering it cause I don't need a case of surge. I mean, try explaining that to the wife.
5443160	5447000	I don't need to explain to the wife. I've got like, I've got two cases of like
5447000	5451400	red bull at my desk at work. So that's fine. That's true. I mean, whatever. And I'd surge
5451400	5455640	is good, but like the new, the, the new one that they have now is not the exact same as
5455640	5461560	the old one. It's slightly different. Um, flavor wise. So that's unfortunate. If it was exactly
5461560	5465480	the same, it'd be pretty awesome. But I would say crystal Pepsi is very similar. It's not the same.
5465480	5469960	Yeah. From what I remember, like soda is different in a can versus a bottle. It is,
5470840	5475000	and I've had it in a can. I have had the last time I had crystal Pepsi and I only tried it once was
5475000	5479640	in a can. I was like, Nope, don't like that. I liked it when it was. Um, so I had it in a can
5479640	5483880	in, um, surge. I used to always get it in a bottle, but yeah, you're right. It does taste
5483880	5488520	differently. I Pepsi is Pepsi is actually good pretty much in anything except I think the fountains
5488520	5492200	actually the weakest for Pepsi. Whereas Coke tastes the best out of a fountain, especially
5492200	5496360	a fountain that doesn't, you know, regulate the amount of carbonated water versus syrup and has
5496440	5501560	way too much syrup. Yeah. Or even those Coke 360 machines, they get all like the, like little
5501560	5506600	citrusy flavors in there because it's all mixed together. Yep. That's good. All right. Anyhow,
5506600	5511400	we can talk about soda all night, but we got to get back to video games with some rapid fire news.
5511400	5514760	Loki, what do you have for us? So we've got our first taste of what's going to be coming out for
5514760	5519640	games with gold in December and it's actually a pretty awesome lineup. So, um, for Microsoft
5520520	5529400	on the Xbox one, you're going to be getting, um, let's see here, uh, sleeping dogs. That's
5529400	5535560	going to be like the definitive edition and then also outlast. And then on three 60,
5535560	5541320	you're going to be getting a via backwards compatibility, burnout paradise and Outland.
5542280	5547560	So that's a pretty fantastic lineup right there. Burnout paradise and sleeping dogs. I mean,
5548520	5552040	yeah, that's a pretty killer lineup. Burnout paradise. I'm really looking forward to having
5552040	5557880	on backwards. Fantastic. No word on what Sony has available yet, but it's probably not burnout
5557880	5563400	paradise and it's sadly, there's no backwards compatibility stuff that is really hurting them.
5563400	5570040	I think. Um, cause it's just, I mean, there's great games coming out each month and just Sony,
5571320	5575320	I don't know. I'm just getting less impressed each month with the stuff that comes out for free,
5575400	5580040	though to be fair, I don't play most of it anyways, but I would play burnout paradise again
5580040	5585320	because I have it on PC. Um, speaking of games coming out again, there's, um, going to be a
5585320	5590840	rerelease of Lego city undercover for other consoles. Cause remember Lego city undercover
5590840	5594840	was one of those Wii U launch titles. I think it was launched actually may have been after launch,
5594840	5600680	but close to launch, um, that only came out on Wii U and it was originally being shown off as
5600680	5606360	a grand theft auto Lego game, which it kind of spun off into something else, but certainly looked
5606360	5610840	exactly grand theft auto with the same HUD and everything. Um, but now it's going to be coming
5610840	5616680	out on PlayStation four and Xbox one and on the switch and that should be coming out, um, probably
5616680	5621560	next year, but I will definitely pick that up cause it looks awesome. I never did pick it up on
5621560	5625880	Wii U and that might be one I had to pick up on the Wii U, but I may wait. Yeah. I think there's
5625880	5629320	a lot of people that are probably in the same boat issue where it's like, wow, I really wanted
5629320	5633800	to play that game, but eh, I didn't really want to play it on Wii U. I think it's just hasn't
5633800	5639480	come down in price. Maybe it has. A lot of Wii U stuff hasn't. That is unfortunate. Like I,
5640360	5646040	I don't know. I, I, I saw when I was at Toys R Us over the weekend, I saw that super Mario
5646040	5652920	all stars on Wii. They still want 20 bucks for that. 1999 for a, for a basically a virtual
5652920	5658120	console release on a Wii disc, which that game actually was never on virtual console because
5658120	5662760	they can charge 20 bucks for it and people will pay it. Yeah. Which is funny. Well, yeah. Cause
5662760	5666440	yeah, it's actually, it's not funny at all. Yeah. Cause it's super Nintendo games, which they charge
5666440	5671080	way too much for anyways. It'd be charging like what? $10 for eight bucks, eight bucks,
5671080	5674680	maybe nine on wheels. I don't remember. Ridiculous. I understand. Don't get me wrong.
5674680	5681080	These are great games, but you long ago made your money back on this shit and it's fucking stupid.
5681080	5684760	They should be selling those virtual console games. Like they do the fucking humble bundles
5684760	5689080	because you know what? Like there's a lot of games out there that I may not purchase, but
5689720	5693960	I would fucking build up a library of like, especially like these sales that come on.
5693960	5698040	I buy a lot of stuff that I honestly don't play on the PlayStation or, but I purchase it because
5698040	5702120	it's so cheap. And you know, there's a lot of stuff like virtual console. They could be totally
5702120	5706040	taking advantage of that, but they're fucking greedy because they're like, well, our games
5706040	5711160	are quality and they should be sold for this amount. Yeah, you're right. Your games are good,
5711160	5715880	but you know what? Those games came out decades ago and you made your money back
5716840	5722440	so many times on that. It's fucking stupid. Well, maybe a lot of copies are still on the shelf,
5722440	5727560	so maybe, uh, maybe the folks will speak on that and get it a discount on that.
5728200	5733240	Dark Tetsuya says in our chat room, I don't know if I need Mario all stars that badly.
5733240	5737080	All I need to do is buy Super Mario Brothers 2 and already have all the virtual console
5737080	5742040	additions anyway. Well, to be fair though, and to be fair, the Super Mario all stars
5742760	5747000	remakes were really good, especially the original Mario and Mario 2 turned out really good as well.
5747000	5750760	Mario 3 didn't have a lot of changes cause it was already kind of the newer game, but, um,
5751400	5755880	and I can't remember if the all stars they're selling in stores also has Mario world on it
5755880	5760040	or not. Cause remember that was the thing. There was Super Mario all stars plus world
5760040	5764440	was a packing. I don't think so. Yeah, it probably isn't probably isn't anyway. Uh,
5764440	5767560	speaking of retro friends, if I remember correctly, that was one of those games that
5767560	5773480	they dumped someone had dumped the disc and it was literally like a 30 megabyte ROM. It was stupid.
5773480	5779320	Anyway. Um, speaking of retro franchises that keep coming back, uh, some new trademarks have
5779320	5784520	been filed by Bandai Namco and these trademarks were filed in Europe and two of them have to do
5784520	5792600	with Pac-Man. There are two new Pac-Man trademarks for Pac-Man, cash rush and Pac-Man and leprechaun.
5793400	5796680	One sounds like a slot machine and one sounds like a mobile game. That's what it sounds like to me.
5796680	5799880	I wouldn't say cash rush sounds like it's a slot machine.
5799880	5803400	Slot machine or a ticket redemption or something like that. It's probably not
5803400	5807960	going to be what you think. I doubt these are new console games or anything like that. Although,
5807960	5811320	I mean, to be fair, I mean, we kind of roll our eyes at these, but.
5811320	5815000	Or cash rush could almost be like a lottery, you know, like a lotto.
5815000	5818840	A lotto ticket or something. Who knows? Uh, but I was gonna say like, you know,
5818840	5823720	to be fair, like Pac-Man championship edition deluxe plus, and I really like championship
5823720	5827240	edition too. I know a lot of people didn't, but I still thought, found a lot to love in that.
5827240	5832280	So a lot of actually the Pac-Man, I even like Pac-Man 256. Like a lot of the Pac-Man titles
5832280	5836360	lately have been pretty cool. So, you know, I guess don't knock until you tried it.
5836360	5843400	Uh, there were also some trademarks, uh, for skies unknown, uh, the precious 12 and fortune gears,
5843400	5848200	but we don't know exactly what those could be. Those could be literally anything. So,
5848200	5852040	but there they are, some trademarks. That's why we put it in rapid fire news because everything
5852040	5856040	else is pretty much speculative with that. Uh, something that is a little more certain,
5856040	5861800	in fact, almost too certain is Ubisoft giving away 30 days worth of giveaways.
5861800	5866200	If you sign into Uplay and go to the 30 day site, you can start looking at some of the fun little
5866200	5870360	giveaways that they're giving away. And some of it is a little silly, like greeting cards for
5870360	5875560	Just Dance or something like that, but they are also as part of this giveaway, giving away
5875560	5880680	copies of PC games through Uplay. Like you can actually get Rayman or, you know, some of the.
5880680	5884120	Well, they have the 30, was it like the 12 months that they were doing that too?
5884120	5889000	Yeah, but now, well now they're doing the 30 days of, of Christmas as well. Uh, or the 30,
5889000	5893880	30 days of giveaways. Cause you know, you can't really say Christmas, but anyway, um.
5893880	5895240	Why does Nintendo own Christmas?
5895240	5900040	Uh, maybe, uh, all that stuff aside, if you want to know what they're giving out, well,
5900040	5904680	good news. It's all already leaked anyway, because the source code for the webpage had
5904680	5910760	all the giveaways listed in it. And it was leaked to Twitter. Now Ubisoft has since updated the
5910760	5915320	page and who knows, maybe they'll try to shuffle some things to make it play out a little
5915320	5920360	differently, but we kind of know now what's going to happen. So that's what's going to happen.
5920920	5925000	Uh, those PC games to talk to you about, there's going to give away some PC games as well as some
5925000	5930760	of the other stuff. So, um, there you go. Let's talk about what is coming out in stores this week.
5930760	5931800	Loki, what's in the US.
5931800	5937080	So this week we've got Blade Shield on HTC Vive, um, Dark Master or Darksiders,
5937080	5943320	uh, War Master Edition on PC. Steins Gate Zero on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
5943320	5949320	Final Fantasy 15 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Watch Dogs will be coming out on PC.
5950120	5955480	Townsman on PC. Apollo Justice, Ace Attorney on iOS.
5957240	5966040	Maze on PC. Rad Rogers, World 1 on PC. The Dwarves on PC, Mac and Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5966680	5975400	Fury on Xbox One. Little Briar Rose on PC. Steep on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5976120	5981960	And finally, Super Mario Maker for 3DS. Oh, okay. 3DS. All right.
5982680	5987640	Uh, going over to Japan, a little game called Final Fantasy 15, I think has people's attention.
5987640	5992120	They're getting that on Tuesday, which is usually our release days, but, uh, usually I don't think
5992120	5996200	Tuesday is a release day in Japan. So they are kind of shifting things to coincide with us,
5996200	6001080	uh, so that that way it's a worldwide release. So they are getting that. Uh, I would usually think
6001080	6005000	a week that a Final Fantasy game is coming out, there would be nothing else, but believe it or
6005000	6009960	not, there are still some releases in Japan this week on the usual, uh, Friday, December 1st is
6009960	6014920	going to see, I guess these are rereleases Biohazard 4, 5, and 6 are all coming out from
6014920	6020040	Capcom in Japan. Uh, so that is something to look forward to on PlayStation 4, the crew ultimate
6020040	6024520	edition as well. Dragon Quest Builders moves into the ultimate hits collection and we'll get a
6024520	6030280	release there. Uh, and then also God Eater 2 Rage Burst. I think that's also a price reduction. So
6030280	6035560	a lot of these are just, uh, titles that are moving into greatest hits or some type of like
6035560	6041400	remaster or whatever, but Watch Dogs 2 gets its release in Japan on December 1st. So you do have
6041400	6046680	that to look forward to as well in Japan. Now I'm looking at some of the other consoles. The 3DS
6046680	6053240	has All Common Rider, Rider Revolution comes out on December 1st. Also Mario Maker for 3DS also
6053240	6058120	arriving in Japan this week. Uh, there's also some new amiibo from the Legend of Zelda series to go
6058120	6062120	with that. The Toon Link and all that stuff is out this week. Although, um, yeah, I guess this
6062120	6068200	is a new like Legend of Zelda series, uh, and not like just a rerelease of the Super Smash
6068200	6074840	Brothers ones. Uh, there's also Digimon Universe is out this week on the 3DS. Uh, lastly, taking
6074840	6080840	a look at the PlayStation Vita, uh, this week there is a new model. There's a silver and a
6080840	6087000	metallic red PlayStation Vita. Uh, Dragon Quest Builders gets its, uh, rerelease price reduction
6087000	6094040	as well on the Vita. Uh, and then Digimon Story also on the Vita. And Katamari Damacy,
6094040	6100920	no Vita, gets a rerelease, a welcome, welcome price. And Taiko no Tatujin V version also getting
6100920	6106280	that same rerelease. So it looks like you get a lot of, uh, like price reductions and repackagings
6106280	6111400	things moving into like best hits type collections in Japan this week. Uh, how about the UK, Loki?
6111960	6117880	Um, the UK, we've got Final Fantasy 15 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Watch Dogs 2 on PC.
6118600	6123880	And, um, finally, let's see, Gravity Rush 2 on PlayStation 4.
6125080	6128920	Uh, and thank you to, uh, Dark Tetsuya in chat reminding me, oh yeah, they did announce this
6128920	6132520	during a Nintendo Direct some time ago. And now I'm, now I'm remembering this again. Uh,
6132520	6137640	there's also the 8-bit link in the style of the NES original version and a Twilight Princess 1
6137640	6141720	too. That's right. So that's all in Japan this week. So I imagine it must just be around the
6141720	6145400	corner for us. I know your release date thing doesn't track Amiibo, but I can't imagine it's
6145400	6149480	not also releasing here real soon. Probably. Probably another way for Nintendo to make a
6149480	6155720	little bit of money going into the holiday. So let's get into, excuse me guys. I'm still getting
6155720	6161160	over that cough. Uh, let's get into the mailbag of which I think we have like one email this week.
6161160	6166760	So we're going to get into tonight's email. Um, where's my email music? Here it is.
6173240	6177880	Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungelaungerator.com is the place to
6177880	6183000	send us an email and we will read your emails here on air. And this is the only email I believe
6183000	6188040	we have this week, which I think just missed the cutoff for last week's show. I think it came in
6188040	6192360	during the show. So I'm going to read it now. Uh, this is an email from Reddertainment who says,
6192360	6198120	uh, dearest denizens of Potopia. That time of year has come again. That time of year when my parents
6198120	6202840	start to bug me about what I want for Christmas. Since I'm an adult, who's pretty good at buying
6202840	6207320	his own thing. I don't have any ideas for what my parents can get me for Christmas. Do any of you
6207320	6214840	have any ideas? No, my parents won't buy me anything gaming related. Don't ask why it's just
6214840	6219320	that way. Reddertainment. Well, if they're not going to get you anything gaming related,
6219320	6225880	I don't know if this is the show to be emailing to be fair. What else do you like Reddertainment?
6225880	6231160	Ask them to give you an Amazon gift card. Yeah, yes. Actually, that's not a bad idea.
6231160	6237160	Ask for gift cards for Amazon, Toys R Us, Target, and then you can go buy video games.
6238760	6242520	Huh? I think you just have to outsmart them a little bit Reddertainment. That's how you're
6242520	6246600	going to get the video games. I don't know. Are you into Legos? I was looking at Legos at Toys
6246600	6250200	R Us the other day. There's a lot of fun sets. They're so expensive, but there's not all of them.
6250200	6254920	Now they finally have a, they released like a generic set for Toys R Us. That's just like,
6254920	6259960	here's a variety of blocks in different colors for like 60 bucks for a ton of blocks. You know what
6259960	6266360	else came back from my childhood that I was not prepared to see at Toys R Us? Domino Rally.
6266360	6270040	You remember that? Domino Rally's back. I think you should buy that for your kids.
6270040	6275320	Provided the little one won't try to eat the dominoes. No, he won't eat the dominoes,
6275320	6278920	but here's what'll happen. And this is just like with any of the blocks that they have.
6278920	6282440	They will throw them around the room. They'll land on the floor. They won't pick them up off
6282440	6287160	the floor. And my cat will knock them under the couch. Cause that's what she does. Or they'll
6287160	6290360	throw them under the couch and then like, Hey, why not under the couch? I'll get them out from
6290360	6294360	under the couch and they'll do it again. All right. Uh, since, since we're not very good at
6294360	6297640	coming up with ideas for entertainment, one thing we love to do here at, uh,
6297640	6301160	orange on radio, we crowdsource to our chat room. So here's some ideas for your
6301160	6305480	entertainment from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, SSJ100 Matt suggests
6305480	6312440	crystal Pepsi. Um, let's see. SSJ100 Matt also suggests a puppy or a wife. Um, I'm sorry,
6312440	6318920	a puppy or a kitten. And Akuma JP said, get a wife. That's actually like a wife with a W.
6319960	6323000	Don't. Don't if you don't have to.
6323000	6329080	Raygenator suggests a hooker. Uh, Akuma JP suggests a Monoprice 3d printer.
6329640	6332280	I would love a 3d printer. 3d printer might be fun. That's actually,
6333880	6337640	I would love a 3d printer. There you go. So there's something, then you can 3d
6337640	6341560	print all the gaming things. I would want to build a 3d printer, but they never have a build
6341560	6345560	base. It's large enough for me. And I haven't found any instructions on how to make larger
6345560	6351480	3d printers by combining, you know, some of those hotbeds and stuff, but yeah,
6351480	6355960	I would love a 3d printer. All right. So there it is. Uh, some suggestions from our chat, uh,
6355960	6364040	over at live.vognetwork.com. All right. Let's move on with more show. We're going to get back
6364040	6371160	into some news, right? Loki. Yes. Um, so Sony's got some stuff coming to the, or some surprises
6371160	6376920	coming, I guess, to the PlayStation experience. Um, they have a full list of games, but there's
6376920	6382680	also some unannounced panels as well. So some of the stuff that they're bringing, um, like Ace
6382680	6387080	combat seven looks pretty cool. And especially that's possessed some VR as well. Um, a lot of
6387080	6393800	games are already out already, like Batman Arkham VR bound. Um, let's see if there's anything else
6393800	6402280	that's really kind of stand out ish. Um, full throttle remastered. I didn't realize that was
6402280	6406280	being remastered. That's kind of cool. So that's something that's going to be coming. Uh, grant
6406280	6413880	there's no sport. Uh, there's a new hot Sunni Miku game project diva future tone horizon zero
6413880	6431320	dawn looks pretty cool. Um, let's see. Uh, new hog two. Let's see. Uh, there's the evil seven.
6431320	6438360	Yeah, it looks pretty cool. Um, lots of PlayStation VR stuff, um, Sonic mania. But, uh,
6438360	6443640	one of the things that hopefully will be there, and this is of course a huge rumor is, um, which
6443640	6447240	by the way, I just want to say, I think has already been disproven just so you know. Okay.
6447240	6452920	Well, I hope it's undisproven, but, uh, the thought was maybe during the whole Capcom cup,
6452920	6457640	they're going to make an announcement for a new game. And the hopes were for Marvel versus Capcom
6457640	6463320	four. I would love to see that, but I don't think that's going to happen. And apparently that,
6463320	6470840	yeah, as you mentioned has been disproven. So. Womp womp. Yeah. I'd heard about the whole, uh,
6470840	6476760	Marvel versus Capcom rumor. And you know, the, the reaction from some of my friends I was with was
6476760	6480440	didn't, didn't, weren't there a lot of issues with licensing and Marvel versus Capcom three
6480440	6484680	towards the end. So it seemed very unlikely that a four would, would actually have, you know,
6484680	6489160	they could work that stuff out. I mean, I don't know. Um, it would be a place to announce that I
6489160	6496360	would think, but, um, maybe not. We'll, we'll have to see. I like surprises though. So I would even
6496360	6502120	be fine if you can't do a Marvel versus Capcom game, maybe like a guest character for, you know,
6502120	6506680	street fighter or something like that. I don't know if they're going to do that though. Um,
6507880	6512360	but yeah, so too bad. Well, there's some announcements at least we know,
6513080	6517800	so hopefully we can expect some surprises. All right. Well, moving on to talk about,
6517800	6523400	Ooh, I like this. Dartetsuya says maybe we'll get Capcom versus SNK three. Oh man. I would,
6523400	6527480	I would be so here for that. If that happened, I would be so excited. I'm not really. I could
6527480	6533960	see cause you know, SNK seems to be pre-opened that kind of stuff. So maybe, maybe SNK would
6533960	6539080	be developing it. Although I preferred Capcom's version back in the day, but you know, I'd,
6539080	6543480	I'd still be excited if that was an actual thing that happened. Uh, anyhow, moving on to something
6543480	6549400	we were talking about earlier in the show, the NES classic additions controller and why it's so
6549400	6554440	darn short. Um, apparently, uh, you know, some research has been done on this issue and the,
6554440	6559640	the issue with this is, uh, the communication protocol that is used, uh, is that apparently
6559640	6566040	this is a high speed chip to chip communication, but the length, I guess, uh, for this communication
6566120	6571800	to actually work is the length basically that the cord is at right now. Uh, why didn't they do a
6571800	6576120	thicker cable? Well, it would have been more expensive and I guess less practical when we
6576120	6580440	talk about more expensive because I guess $60 for this system may have already been pushing it. I
6580440	6585000	don't know. Uh, but there's also talk about extension cables saying that they work, but
6585000	6589240	they're pushing the limit of the protocol and you might get communication errors, but you just may
6589240	6594200	not notice them while you're playing. Uh, why didn't Nintendo just use something else? Well,
6594280	6597800	because if that was the case, then they would have to make new controllers for the mini that
6597800	6603240	weren't necessarily compatible with the Wii and the Wii U, which I guess I'm with that.
6603240	6609000	Exactly. It's like, who gives a fuck? You know what you could have done? You could have made the
6609000	6615960	fucking original NES controllers. Hey, imagine that you can make an NES controller and it just
6615960	6620200	fucking works because you build the port in there. I don't understand why they had to have
6620200	6624840	compatibility with the Wii U and the Wii in the first place. I don't understand why this can't
6624840	6630120	just plug into the Wii remote, just like the classic controller does. And I've never had a
6630120	6633960	problem with virtual console or any of that. So I don't buy any of this shit. What kind of, what
6633960	6638760	kind of fucking chip to chip protocol only works at two fucking feet away? But, Oh, those additional
6638760	6642920	V that's really pushing it. That's a bullshit right there. That's just, it's technology from
6642920	6650760	1982. That's why it's technology from 1982. No, fuck that. And you know why that doesn't make any
6650760	6655720	fucking sense? Because technology from it was analog. Okay. It was analog fucking stuff that
6655720	6660120	they had working there and they had eight foot cables on the original NES controller.
6660120	6665400	So, Oh, and now it doesn't fucking work. I don't think so. It's just a bullshit excuse. I'll tell
6665400	6670360	you why, what they probably had standard size, size cables, because those two foot cables were
6670360	6675240	meant to be plugged into a Wii remote that was wireless anyway. So they didn't need to have
6675240	6679880	an eight foot long fucking cable. And then the, or the key parity between their other accessories,
6679880	6684040	maybe they had some sort of internal guidelines that they have to do for these stupid accessories.
6684040	6688520	That's why the cable's that long. It's not because of fucking, Oh, the chip can't fucking
6688520	6692280	handle it because that's stupid. Then use a different chip or use a fucking chip that you
6692280	6697480	had in fucking eighties because that shit works just fine. It's a whole bunch of nonsense and
6697480	6705240	bullshit. I use, you know, usually guys, I'll try to, I'll try to nudge Loki on some of these
6705240	6709400	rants, but this one I kind of agree with because if the extension cables worked just fine,
6709960	6713560	I'm sorry. There was a potential that it could look, you know, it might not work.
6714680	6720680	I don't think so. I think it's dumb. Yeah. All right. Well, let's move on Loki,
6720680	6724280	calm down and go to the next story. This is so stupid. Like just say, listen, we,
6724840	6729320	it was too expensive to have the longer cords. Just keep it that we want the cost of the system
6729320	6735320	doubt. It was too expensive to have longer cords or like we wanted the ensure compatibility with
6735320	6740600	the, we, um, you or the, we, and so because you know, all of our accessories have a certain cord
6740600	6745480	length, that's why you may give a fucking honest answer instead of trying to bullshit us with this.
6745480	6751720	That's the worst part about it. I just, I hate fucking PR responses is what I hate.
6752600	6756040	So Pokemon goes gotten some updates lately and this is actually kind of interesting stuff.
6756040	6758920	They're really trying to get players back into the game. So one of the things that they added
6758920	6763800	was a new Pokemon. So you can actually catch Ditto now. And Ditto is kind of a unique character
6763800	6768520	obviously because with Ditto, you're actually not really catching Ditto. You're catching something
6768520	6772520	else and it ends up being a Ditto. And then what's kind of cool is when you actually take Ditto and
6772520	6778600	fight him, um, against other Pokemon in the gym, it'll turn into those Pokemon. So it's kind of
6778600	6785560	neat to see that unique gameplay with Ditto. I caught a Ditto here at the house. It was a Rattata.
6785560	6791160	But, uh, yeah, yeah, I'll have to play a little bit more to check it out. Also, if you're interested
6791160	6796120	in checking it out again, you'll be happy to know that they're doing a double XP in Stardust event.
6796120	6800840	So it's going to be running between now and November 30th. So you got a few more days left
6800840	6806760	of that. So go check it out. And along with that, they've also expanded the, uh, nearby
6806760	6812520	in sightings features. So now instead of just having, you know, this no distance whatsoever,
6812520	6816360	it's kind of giving you like pokey stops that things are nearby, kind of like what they were
6816360	6821240	doing in like San Francisco for a long time. But now it's kind of expanded outwards. If you live
6821240	6828200	west of the Mississippi. Right. Sorry, New York. So, um, yeah, apparently it's available now. Um,
6828200	6833720	you know, west of the Mississippi and, uh, except for Hawaii and Alaska and America and then British,
6833720	6840200	Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Mentoba, um, in the western half of Ontario, Canada,
6840200	6844520	and all of Australia. I don't get why they're rolling out, whatever.
6846120	6851400	Well, my hope is, is that that was pretty quickly after they expanded the San Francisco Bay area
6851400	6856040	part. So maybe you guys will get this the right. And when I say you guys, the East coast will get
6856040	6863160	this like in a matter of a week or two and not much more. So I hope for you guys, I hope so.
6863720	6869800	Oh, all right. Have you, have you played much Pokemon go Loki since this, that changes?
6869800	6873960	No, I turned it on the other day and that's when I found out that they had updated the
6873960	6877560	nearby thing. Um, cause I was trying to see if there was like, maybe it did a nearby,
6878520	6882440	but then I turned it right off. Yeah. We caught a Charmander here and actually
6882440	6886120	we must live in a Pikachu nest because Pikachu shows up all the time. In fact,
6886120	6890120	I just brought it up to see if maybe there was one available and sadly there's not,
6890120	6896440	but there is a 429 EV available right now. It's a pretty good, uh, pretty good CP roll for an EV.
6896440	6901640	So I might try to catch that there to try to evolve it later. We'll see. Anyway. So I'm still,
6901640	6905560	I'm still doing the Pokemon go thing, but then again, you know, I also still play a lot of
6905560	6909480	Ingress and all that other stuff. So I'm just, I'm a fan of location-based gaming. What can I say?
6910120	6915080	Oh, there we go. Back to my, back to my three day streak by catching that EV. I'm proud of myself.
6915640	6921400	All right. Moving on to a story about Xbox One and, uh, you know, I got to admit as much as I
6921400	6927880	enjoy the Xbox One and it's got a lot of great games, the UI still feels clunky to me. And that's
6927880	6932200	certainly because of the fact that it was designed for the Kinect where if I had a Kinect, it might
6932200	6937240	feel less clunky. Uh, but a lot of people like myself don't have the Kinect anymore. So things
6937240	6943000	like snap mode feel a little strange. Like I just, I, I realized some of you might think I'm weird,
6943000	6946280	but I just cannot get used to it on the controller. It doesn't feel right to me.
6946920	6951640	Well, Xbox One, they might get rid of it. But the reason doesn't have to do with people like
6951640	6955880	me bitching. Uh, the reason why this might happen is because the snap mode is based around the
6955880	6962040	windows 8 dashboard system. Uh, and of course, obviously things have upgraded a little bit since
6962040	6967320	windows 8. Uh, so apparently according to a report from windows central, uh, Microsoft is looking
6967320	6972440	into a system that will replace snap mode with something more picture and picture, which is more
6972440	6977240	compatible with the universal windows platform apps. So unfortunately don't know a lot more
6977240	6981720	about it besides that. Uh, but if any UI alterations are coming, they're probably going to
6981720	6987240	come next year around the same time. We start to learn more about project Scorpio and whatever the
6987240	6993800	real name is behind that, which I'm sure we will learn all about at E3 2017. But, um, look, you
6993800	6997640	don't, do you have, I don't think you have an Xbox one, right? That's the one you don't have.
6997640	7001080	No, I don't really have to worry about the whole snap. It's, it's a little weird to me.
7001080	7007640	It looked weird. Like again, it's kind of sad, but it's true. Like the best UI that Microsoft
7007640	7014040	ever had was the original 360 interface. It really was. Yeah. And it's kind of sucks that now it's
7014040	7018920	just like, it's too convoluted. Sorry. That doesn't mean there aren't some great games on
7018920	7022680	Xbox one, but it's just the UI is kind of, I want to get an Xbox one. I was, I almost
7022680	7026280	picked a couple up, you know, but I'm just still going to wait a little bit longer. They will come
7026280	7031960	down to price even more. And especially next E3, you know, I mean, I don't, I don't know if I
7031960	7037240	really wanted a Scorpio because I don't either really see what the gains are from that. Just,
7037240	7042680	I don't know if it's going to be worth it for the price, but we'll see. Well, again, isn't the
7042680	7047640	Scorpio supposed to be kind of like a pro where the games will still work on Xbox one, but they're
7047640	7054040	all supposed to scale up because it's like the windows, uh, windows 10, I guess where it scales
7054040	7059960	everything. Right. Right. We'll see. I mean, I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. Uh, just a couple
7059960	7063480	more stories for you guys. Then we're going to open up the Skype line at orange lounge radio.
7063480	7066840	We're almost to the end. Believe me, I told you it was lighter news week. So we may finish a little
7066840	7070600	early tonight. I don't know. It just depends on calls. So the console version of Minecraft is
7070600	7076120	getting quite an update. Um, so they're going to bring almost all of the PCs additions, um,
7076120	7082040	to the consoles with the holiday update. And so with that, they're going to have the, um,
7082840	7086760	some of the things they're adding, the Altria wings, um, that I guess allow you to
7087400	7094120	fly and glide the amplified terrain and cities, uh, dragon's breath, potion ingredients, and
7094120	7100440	more also they're including, um, new UI, uh, new mobs items, blocks says effects.
7101160	7109320	And, um, I guess Altria, the, or they'll find, I guess you'll find the ultra in the end. Um,
7110040	7114280	but yeah, I mean, God, I've, it's been so long since I played Minecraft in cities. I have no
7114280	7118680	fucking clue what that is. Um, I'm interested to see, I know they have like these new cabins
7118680	7123640	and stuff on the PC version with the illagers, um, wonder that's coming in later on, but it's
7123640	7128280	nice to see the consoles kind of catching up. Um, and then also hopefully mod support soon.
7128280	7133000	Cause I know that they do have that on the pocket edition, uh, where you can do like some sort of
7133000	7138600	like basic mods with that. Be kind of cool to see that on console as well. I was telling my son
7138600	7142520	about this cause I'm like, Hey, I'm all, they're going to be doing an update for the Wii U version
7142520	7146600	pretty soon. You got to check it out. Cause he plays it every week. So he was checking out
7146600	7152200	actually, uh, this week, the, um, Chinese mythology skin that they have on there. Cause they have all
7152200	7157080	these like free skins and each one has its own world with it. And what's kind of cool. I don't
7157080	7162760	remember those being free on like Xbox 360 and stuff, but for whatever reason, a Wii U they are.
7162760	7170040	And so, um, yeah, like the massive, he's like been in the mass effect one before and the Skyrim one
7170040	7173800	and, um, but the Chinese mythology one was pretty cool. I liked the music in that. So
7174920	7177880	looking forward to it. I'm sure my son's looking forward to it more than I am.
7177880	7181000	Yeah. I love that these console versions of still getting updates all this time.
7181000	7185000	I really need to go back and play again because it's been a long time for me too.
7185000	7191560	I there's a lot of like, I don't think there's a lot of, um, it's still too kind of like open ended
7191560	7194600	as far as what you need to do in the game. I think it'd be cool if they have like, you know,
7194600	7199240	a little bit of the monster, um, was it monster quest builders type stuff in there, you know,
7199240	7202280	a little bit of like that where you can actually build like a village and there's a little bit of
7202280	7206360	questing around that. That would be kind of cool if they add that in the Minecraft. Um,
7207480	7211960	but I don't know, that's pretty cool. All right. Well, last but not least tonight,
7211960	7217240	a story about origin. That's right. EA's online store platform, which we haven't talked about
7217240	7222120	in quite a while. I can't imagine why. Um, but anyhow, EA has made some updates to the origin
7222120	7228280	store, uh, with some new features and that is to add items to your wishlist and the ability to gift
7228280	7233720	games and DLCs to other users. Both of them just went live just in time for black Friday,
7233720	7237080	uh, which I think they're having a sale. That's still going, which by the way, you know, it's
7237080	7241080	as much as I throw a little casual shade at origin now and then they have made a lot of
7241080	7244920	improvements since the early day when we used to really bag on them. And the fact that, um,
7244920	7250040	the Mass Effect trilogy is available for like 19 bucks. I think it's either $19.99 or it's $24.99,
7250040	7253720	which is a steal for those three games. Uh, so, you know, just a cheap plug for that there. If
7253720	7257800	you've never played the games, if X for happens to be listening out there. Cause he's, he even just
7257800	7260440	wrote a tweet earlier tonight that said, I'm thinking about getting into Mass Effect cause
7260440	7264760	Robin Shane wouldn't shut up about it this weekend. Uh, anyway, but what's interesting
7264760	7269080	though, is that despite the fact that they're finally adding these features, which seem like,
7269080	7274200	kind of like, Oh, aren't these kind of normal for stores? Uh, well, apparently they do have
7274200	7280600	limitations. For example, you can only gift already released content, not pre-orders and
7280600	7284520	that includes DLC. Well, I guess that is reasonable. You can only give something that's
7284520	7290520	already out, but you can only gift EA published games, not third party content. You can't get
7290520	7297240	virtual currency. You can't gift bundles that have virtual currency. Uh, and you can only gift to
7297240	7302680	friends in the same country as you. I think that's good, especially with all the things that they've
7302680	7308440	had via the EA hacks with the whole FIFA cards and stuff. I suppose I'm kind of okay with that.
7308440	7311640	Okay. All right. That's a good, that's a good perspective. I wasn't thinking about that,
7311640	7317000	but you know, steam does have the ability to gift across different regions and so forth, but
7317000	7322280	steam has also had not rampant, but they've had some problems in the past with, you know,
7322280	7325880	some hacking and so forth, you know, kind of the same type of exploits about, you know,
7325880	7330520	giveaways and certain games and what like selling those in the marketplace for lots of money. Right.
7330520	7336680	So, yeah. Well, anyway, maybe it's a little explanation as to why EA's system is a little
7336680	7341320	more limited. Anyway, that is going to do it for the news this week. Uh, but we are now going to
7341320	7346280	open up the Skype line for you guys to have your say. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype
7346280	7349800	is the place to be. If you want to give us a call to talk about anything we've talked about so far
7349800	7353880	tonight and your perspective on it, or maybe something we missed that you're really passionate
7353880	7358040	about. Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or if you prefer to do things
7358040	7363720	old school, you can 1-877-GAME-OLR, but I think most people are on Skype these days.
7363720	7370600	Uh, we are getting a call on the line, so let's get to it. And hello there. You are on Orange
7370600	7375880	Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Strelok. Hey, Strelok, buddy. How you doing? Uh, not too bad.
7375880	7380360	What's on your mind tonight, my friend? Uh, not too much. I wanted to talk a little bit about,
7380360	7385000	uh, Pokemon Sun and Moon. Oh, please do. How are you enjoying Pokemon Sun and Moon?
7385560	7394280	Um, a lot actually. Uh, I was afraid that, uh, I didn't intend on buying it at first because of the,
7394280	7400760	uh, removal of the whole grid, uh, system. Right. And so our listeners remember, if they haven't
7400760	7405880	heard a call from you before, you are a blind gamer. So sometimes these accessibility things
7405880	7411320	are very important. Um, so, uh, yeah, getting rid of the grid system where you would, you know,
7411320	7417160	be able to, when you move up, down, left, right, you kind of know where you are based on how many
7417160	7424280	times you press the button. That kind of goes away in this, right? Uh, yeah, but it's actually,
7425960	7431960	see, I was envisioning, like, if you guys remember Lumiacity from X and Y,
7433240	7439960	and how much of a mess that was like to, to move, I was kind of imagining something kind of like
7439960	7448360	that. And it's actually not, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's not easy, like, particularly to,
7449560	7456760	or as easy to move around, um, as it was previously, but it's, uh, still doable
7456760	7461080	and I've been able to progress. So. About how far in the game are you right now?
7461720	7465880	Um, not too far at all, just cause I haven't played a whole lot, but I'm,
7466520	7472280	uh, just got to the, the big city on the first island where you can,
7474040	7479960	um, change your, customize your character and stuff. Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And,
7479960	7486280	uh, about to fight Team Skull for the first time. It takes a little time to get there. I mean,
7486280	7490440	the beginning of the game's kind of long. So, uh, yeah, a lot of, a lot of cut scenes. There is,
7490440	7493240	there's a lot of stuff that goes on in the beginning of the game, but, you know,
7493240	7496680	it's kind of, it's kind of the same as most Pokemon stories is that, oh,
7496680	7501240	we just moved to this new town and now I'm going to leave for a long time to go catch Pokemon.
7501240	7510440	It's kind of the, what I think is interesting is that, um, your character in, uh, Sun and Moon
7510440	7517720	actually comes from Kanto, which is the region of red, blue and yellow. Yep. So it's kind of
7517720	7524360	a nice nod to, you know, being it being the 20th anniversary game. Well, that and the fact that,
7524360	7529800	you know, you have the remakes of the gen one Pokemon that show up as well. You know,
7529800	7536680	they have the Alolan forms, um, that are there, which apparently, uh, the gen one originals are
7536680	7542280	in the game. You will see them when we open up the Pokemon bank and all that stuff. So yeah,
7542280	7547560	you will have the possibility of Alolan Raichu for, uh, fighting, you know, gen one Raichu.
7547560	7552760	That's, that's going to happen. Um, but, uh, you know, there's a lot of the throwbacks to gen one
7552760	7560360	with also a red and blue are characters in the game. Yeah. What I like too is about the Alolan
7560360	7565560	forms is their, uh, typings are different too, which is pretty interesting. Definitely mixes
7565560	7571080	the game up a little bit. Um, any, any favorite Pokemon early on, or maybe from things you've
7571080	7575640	seen, uh, in trailers or, or, uh, you know, heard about online or whatever. Um,
7577720	7584120	I don't know. The, uh, starters are pretty cool. The starters are pretty cool. Um, I, at, uh,
7584120	7589480	Toys R Us this weekend, I wasn't prepared to see this. They had the stuffed animal versions of the,
7589480	7595320	uh, starter toys, but it's, but no, they were gigantic instead of being like the little sized
7595320	7599800	ones. Yeah. I already have the trio that you can get a GameStop, which are more little size.
7599800	7605320	These were gigantic. So they're like carnival. Yeah. They're like carnival sizes. We're like
7605320	7610440	the Litten Litten's head is as big as my own head. I swear. There's a, uh, for those that would want
7610440	7615400	to check it out, um, on, on my Instagram, which I think is public, I don't know. Uh, but I actually
7615400	7620200	posted a picture of me with this huge Litten. I'm sure tiger clock and dig up the link for you guys
7620200	7626920	to put it in chat. Um, but yeah, you can actually see this thing is like as big as my face. So nice.
7627480	7634360	Um, but yeah, so, uh, but they were 75 bucks each. Yeah. For, for something that size. Right.
7635080	7641080	So they were, they were huge and we're so funny. You didn't even have to like play, you know,
7641080	7646440	$600 worth of skee-ball to get them. Yeah. $75 doesn't seem so expensive when you put it that
7646440	7651480	way. Um, and a lot of my friends on Facebook were asking where's Popplio? And I said, I'm not
7651480	7659640	letting that thing in the picture cause I'm so rude. I'm so rude. But guess what? I have
7659640	7668040	all the starters right now in my Pokemon party, including Popplio. Yay. Speaking of, uh, not
7668040	7674440	gaming related, but did you hear about that whole thing that came out? It was either earlier this
7674440	7681800	year or maybe last year with that guy that was trying to like sue a carnival because he spent
7681800	7687480	like thousands of dollars trying to get a, like one of those stupid bananas or something like
7687480	7693480	that. Uh, well, if the game was rigged so he couldn't win at all, there might be a case,
7693480	7699000	but otherwise, uh, there's a certain risk reward. I think you kind of know going into it. I mean,
7699000	7704120	he would have to prove that it was completely faulty for him to have any merit.
7704760	7709480	Yeah. Yeah. I think the guy was just salty cause he spent a bunch of money and
7711080	7714520	that's what it sounds like. You gotta be careful with those carnival games. Uh,
7714520	7718360	you don't ever assume you're going to win anything more than a little piece of shit.
7718360	7722520	Like what, what are the little, little crappy prizes they give you like spider rings, spider
7722520	7728360	rings, spider rings, erasers, erasers, and spider rings and, and, uh, Tootsie rolls.
7728360	7731320	That's going to be about the extent stickers. That's going to be about the extent of what you
7731320	7737080	win. Yup. Well actually it was, yeah, we spent like about $10 at one of these arcades and we
7737080	7741240	got, they were playing the ticket machines and one of the things that they got were stamps. Like
7741240	7745480	my kids got stamps that like a soccer ball or football and those things are a piece of shit,
7745480	7750840	but they love them. They like kids eat that crap up because they was like, Ooh, a stamp. I could
7750840	7755240	stay myself. Yeah. Then they, then they stamp everything. They stamped the walls, then they
7755240	7759960	stamp dinner plates and stuff. Usually just themselves. Um, but, uh, also what was I going
7759960	7764280	to say with that, that whole thing? Um, Oh, around one, uh, cause they have a ton of claw
7764280	7769480	machines there around one. I have seen grown adults, uh, no different than you or me drop
7769480	7774120	so much money into that to try to win like a little Kirby or something like that. I could
7774120	7780120	just imagine being there or just spending all the money, uh, trying to win. I can't really talk
7780120	7785240	because I will do the same fucking thing in record keeper trying to go after a specific relic.
7785240	7792280	I guess it happens to the best. We all have our weaknesses. All right,
7792280	7795720	Sturlock, my friend, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but keep enjoying Pokemon. All
7795720	7799960	right. Yeah, definitely. I'm looking forward to, uh, I'm also looking forward to, uh,
7800760	7808680	final fantasy 15 colon dude. Where's my chocobo. Me too. I hope, I hope the story is as in depth
7808680	7814760	as other, other episodes. I I'm just been really trying to avoid spoilers to, to, uh, keep it,
7814760	7821240	keep it a surprise. Yeah. Should be interesting. Games been in development for 10 years,
7821240	7826200	just 10 years. You know, no biggie. All right, my friend, take care. All right. All right. Bye. Bye.
7827720	7830200	Yeah. That's the other thing that makes fun. Uh, one eight seven seven game,
7830200	7834200	OLR or username on Skype, orange launch radio. That's the other thing that makes this final
7834200	7839240	fantasy 15 such a big deal is that, you know, we've been waiting 10 years, 10 years for this
7839240	7844920	game. I mean, the E3 where this was announced was like one of our first E3s that must've been
7844920	7849240	the Paris Hilton year. The, the year I called the Paris Hilton E3. That was the one where the, we,
7849240	7854680	the, we, it was the last big E3 before they clamped down to the airport. That was the E3
7854680	7860280	where, uh, final fantasy versus 13 was announced. If I remember right, you went that year, right?
7860280	7863560	We went to the square Enix theater and they had like all the different trailers, right?
7864840	7868680	Um, that was our big appointment was we got to sit and watch a bunch of, a bunch of trailers,
7868680	7874520	but it was great that the presentation, so yeah. Um, wasn't that, was that the year that
7874520	7884120	they announced 13 and then, and 14, uh, was it that year? Uh, or was it the year before,
7884120	7888360	or was it 2009 when that happened? No, I feel like that was the year.
7889400	7895080	2006 was the year they announced all of them, but I don't think the game actually showed up until
7895080	7901960	like 2009, I think was the year that they announced final fantasy 13 was coming and 14.
7903160	7910200	And that was a big like, Ooh, ah moment. And that was the first E3 back at the, uh, convention
7910200	7916280	center after the two down years. So, yeah, everybody thought he made a mistake when he
7916280	7920280	said Final Fantasy 14 was going to be coming to PlayStation three. We all thought he meant
7920280	7925320	13 verses, but then Nope. They showed that trailer that Nope, it is really final fantasy 14
7925320	7931080	online. And I just remember, I know I started like, I started like scream crying in like
7931080	7935880	Sony's booth because I wasn't at the, but uh, Sony's booth, you could just walk in and watch
7935880	7940440	the press conference. And when I saw that I just was like, like hyperventilating tears because,
7940440	7945480	you know, I'd played so many hours of 11 and then for that game to come out and for it to be so
7945480	7954120	fucking bad. So, so bad when it first came out, but thankfully they fixed the, the, they can come
7954120	7958920	back from that. The no man's sky can come back from the mess that it is. That's right. Diablo
7958920	7963640	three came back from its original release. That's just, that's the world of games we live in now.
7963640	7967960	If Final Fantasy 15 sucks when they release it, you know what? Yeah, they'll just patch it next
7967960	7976040	year. They're not going to kill the Final Fantasy brand that easy. Uh, Dungeon Buster in chat says
7976040	7981880	the good old Fabula Nova crystalis constellation of Final Fantasy 13 games. Yeah. Of which type
7981880	7985480	zero was the other one, right? It was originally supposed to be a mobile game and they kind of
7986040	7990440	sorta like it ended up being on the Vita and then they did the PS4 release and all that. That was
7990440	7997560	also part of the 13 trilogy or 13 Fabula, none of it, which seems to tie together with anything.
7997560	8000520	Yeah. Right. None of them seem to tie together with anything. I don't think Final Fantasy 15
8000520	8004440	supposed, but I mean, they've had a decade. They probably changed the story to really separate it
8004440	8013160	from 13. Yeah. My thought was a lot of those stories were tied into, uh, maybe what we got
8013160	8019160	in 13 two and lightning returns, which I still always want to call 13 three. All right. Uh,
8019160	8023400	one more shout out for calls orange lounge radio on Skype or the old fashioned way one eight seven
8023400	8029320	seven game O L R. Um, any last minute stories you want to bring up? Logie? It's been kind of
8029320	8032520	a slow. I don't know if there's a lot else. There was a, um, one thing we didn't mention,
8032520	8038440	there was a majora's mask fan film. You can go check out. It's animated. Some guy worked on it.
8038440	8044920	Um, so it's called majora's mask, a terrible fate. So go check that out on YouTube. Um,
8044920	8051720	that's pretty cool. That's sadly it. All right. Well, I don't see the phone lighting up. I think
8051720	8056200	we probably have a few less live folks tonight because of, uh, some folks traveling back from
8056200	8061960	the holiday weekend. So we're going to go ahead and, uh, wrap it up. Um, and, uh, call it a night
8061960	8066200	here at orange launch radio, but thank you guys as always for your support. Thank you for downloading

8103560	8108760	oral are, uh, Loki enjoy the crystal Pepsi and a good luck with programming. Oh, you really did
8108760	8115480	almost finish. I'll enjoy. Yes. All 58 grams of sugar in this. Uh, and, um, yeah, have a good week.
8115480	8120280	We'll see you next time. Any closing thoughts for our listeners tonight? Um, I'll try working on my
8120280	8125160	game some more, but no guarantees because I have Skyrim. And so, you know, that is distracting.
8125160	8131960	It's very tempting. And to just waste hours of time, which is basically doing the same quests
8131960	8136680	I've done over and over and over again. It's just like, but it's funny because there's so
8136680	8142440	many of them. I forget what they are half the time. So, well, I will not be promising any work
8142440	8148280	on a game of mine because I know final fantasy 15, of course. Yeah, that's coming out tomorrow.
8148280	8152440	Yep. Uh, that's, that's pretty much that, but I, I will look forward to seeing you guys potentially
8152440	8156920	on a live stream or, uh, you know, I do have the PS4 pro, you know, one advantage of the PS4 pro
8156920	8161400	it does stream at 60 frames a second. I was looking at a extra with streaming
8161400	8165640	Overwatch and it looked great. So I'm excited to do some streaming in a 60 frames a second.
8165640	8170760	That'll be fun. So, uh, thank you guys very much for, uh, downloading and checking out the show.
8170760	8175160	Um, I don't really have a final thought besides that. I'm looking forward to Final Fantasy 15
8175160	8182040	and, um, you could, I guess a cheap plug for my Twitch stream over at Rob Roberts, um, which I
8182040	8186120	Loki, you, do you ever stream anymore? I think I have your name. I think you Loki OLR on Twitch,
8186120	8190920	right? I think I have you set up. I don't even remember what my login is to be honest.
8191560	8195880	I'm probably not. I don't, I don't tend to do that because if I'm playing games,
8195880	8201560	it's most likely my wife's watching Netflix or something or, or even then, um, I don't
8202200	8207080	talk over anything. Cause if I have a headset on, my voice is loud. It wake up the wife awake
8207080	8213400	up or like they're watching TV. That's just irritating. So I, the last time I was able to
8213400	8218040	even play online games with a headset was in the garage and I'm not doing that. Fair enough. Fair
8218040	8221800	enough. All right, well that is going to do it. Uh, for another episode of orange launch radio,
8221800	8225880	have a great gaming. Those together are going to play Final Fantasy 15 this week. Uh, enjoy it.
8225880	8229800	I hope it's great. I'm hoping with you guys, for those that are playing other games this week,
8229800	8234440	have fun. Uh, and we will see you in seven days for another edition of orange launch radio to
8234440	8238360	talk about the game awards and to talk about the PlayStation experience. It's going to be
8238360	8241000	a busy week next week. We will see you then in seven days. Good night.
8265000	8268680	or bog network, but you know, they were all still true.
8271720	8278680	See you next week.
8294440	8306680	Okay.
