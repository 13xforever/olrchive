Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:28.000
This week we're doing the Time Warp back to 2006 when Nintendo's hottest new console was nowhere to be found, the NES Classic Edition. Also, OLR was only 4 years old back then. Stay tuned for more news from a now-teenaged OLR right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and Time Warp indeed. We are not live tonight with episode number 665 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 01:01.000
For this, a special Wednesday edition, November the 16th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me once again, reunited without the use of radio magic and it feels so good, say hello to DarkSakura or Tami Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
We're definitely Time Warping back to 1938, 1939.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes, I know there's a lot on everybody's mind this week, but we're just going to try to play some video games instead.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
If I could live in several different video game worlds, I would be pleased.

01:16.000 --> 01:30.000
Which world would you want to live in? I think, even though I'll probably get a lot of crap from Shane for this answer because I don't know enough about it according to him, I would want to live in the world of Pokemon. I would. What world would you want to live in? Video game world.

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
It's actually pretty hard to say. I mean, because, I mean, maybe like a hundred years pre Reaper Mass Effect, maybe, you know.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
So you have a nice, a chance to live a nice life.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
So I can die before that's done, you know.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
A nice full life before, yeah, that all starts.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Or, or even I would say maybe post Inquisition Dragon Age.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I see BioWare fangirl to the very end.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh, maybe. Or I would just be a nice barmaid on Azeroth.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
That works too.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I would be the barmage.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Would you, would you, would you work at the Goldshire Inn on the Moon Guard server?

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
No, because it has those fucking creepy kids. You know what I'm talking about.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I do. I know what you're talking about.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh my God.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
Alright, welcome back. Sorry, I got to do some audio adjustment on the fly for Dark Soccer because it's been so long since you've been here live. We've missed you.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
But welcome back. Quickly, how has your gaming month been?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
What is up with my mic?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
It's just super sensitive tonight.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
No, it's actually like weird.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh, it's like falling apart in there or something?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Maybe. Hi, Mike. I'm nice to you, pet, pet, pet.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
We'll figure that out. Just don't swing it around too much. We'll, we'll operate on it.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I'll swing my thing where I wanna.

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
No, I'm, it's been interesting because I've had some voice problems.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
And, which I sound okay right now, but.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Do you? No, you sound fine.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
Girl. So, but like I'm on like a big work restriction where like I have to spend 10 minutes every hour just not talking.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
And it's, it's made my life interesting. It's made me learn to listen a lot more.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Interesting. Alright.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
So forced silence. Everyone should try it.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Well, I hope you feel better.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Thank you.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
And don't, you know, it's, it's great to have you back here on the show though, where luckily since we have several people to share the responsibility here, you don't have to talk nonstop for an hour, which is nice.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
You're, you're no Bobby Black Wolf, but I would encourage you to join us sometime.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm glad, he's hairy.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
I would encourage you, encourage you all to join. What's wrong with that?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Until Dan, I was going to shave him.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
There's nothing wrong with that.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I mean, like shave his back.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Alright, anyway.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Just to see if he would notice, like if he woke up with no hair on his back.

03:43.000 --> 03:58.000
OMG. Anyway, you can usually listen to us live Sunday nights, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com immediately after the very handsome Bobby Black Wolf and his show, which you're on.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
He is handsome.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
But we're not live this week. As mentioned on the show previously, I was out of town last week over the weekend.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
So we're giving you this kind of podcast only special bonus show.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
Usually I would introduce about now Techmaster Loki, but sadly, Loki couldn't be here tonight.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
And, you know, as tempting as it is to make a joke about can Loki and Jamie be in the same room right now?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Like what's going on?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Actually, Loki had a family emergency he has to deal with. He had to bow out this morning.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
So our thoughts are with what's going on.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I was just going to say reasons.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't want to, you know, it's not my place to disclose.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
He's fine. Wife's fine. Kids are fine. It's something else.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
That's all I can really say.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Reasons.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
So hopefully he'll be back Sunday.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
I would really be sad if he missed a huge landmark episode like Sunday Show, which is episode 666.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
However, the reality is real life first, family first. We all know that.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
So fingers crossed and all that stuff.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
However, joining us in studio at last minute notice, which I really appreciate.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Say hello, everybody, to somebody else who we haven't heard from in a while on this show due to work

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
and the environment and place where he works. It's Alan is back.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Hello.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Hi, Alan. No, not Shane. It's Alan.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh, right.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
How are you, Alan?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm good.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Good. Happy that the elections are over since you work in that polling and all that stuff?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yes.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Yes. So.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm happy that the election is over because of my work schedule, not for any other reason.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Right, right. I wasn't trying to set you up for anything there, but it's nice to have you.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
It's nice to have you back on the show this week.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
So you're going to help step in and do some of the stories that Loki was going to do for us tonight.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
And how's life been treating you recently?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Good.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah. Oh, let me ask the question that came up with Dark Soccer and myself at the top of the show.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
If you had to live in any video game world, what video game world would you want to live in?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Possibly Skyrim.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
It's fresh on my mind and the version of the game that I had before the special edition, all the dudes were basically like naked.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Like they were technically wearing uniforms, but.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
So you don't want to live in Skyrim. You want to live in modded Skyrim.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yes.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Absolutely.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Alan Alchemy's head cannon Skyrim.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
Do you have the Skyrim where the dragons come out to the Macho Man song?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Because they have Macho Man's face.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I thought it came, but they actually came out to the Village People's song.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Oh, yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Instead of roaring, it would say, oh, yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh, okay. I thought it actually came out to the song.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
There was also a Tommy the Tank Engine mod.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah, that's right.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Is that a part of your Skyrim head cannon?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
No.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Because I would want to, oh.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
No.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
The world of Skyrim is pretty brutal. You got to have something to lighten it up a little bit.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
That's why you roll cabbages down the hill.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I could probably mod it. I could probably find a mod to put like Taco Bell in it or something.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
There you go. No, that would be Shane's Skyrim head cannon.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
It would be the Taco Bell in every village.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
What about what Jamie's suggesting, the 5,000 cabbages rolling off a hill?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Is that something that would exist in your Skyrim world?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
It could.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Well, because if you have access to console, that means basically you're God, so.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, okay.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
I would also want to live in Rezworld because it would mean that I was high as balls.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Is that from watching me play Rez the other night on PlayStation 4?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yes.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Or you were playing Rez with the headphones on, which is the cruelest thing that you could do.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I'm sorry.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Because of that incredible music. And I'm like, ooh, he's playing Rez and I can't hear a damn thing.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
It's more selfish. Let's get it right. It's more selfish because I wanted to be surrounded.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
I wanted to be cocooned like Jasmine Masters in the experience of Rez.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
But it was selfish because I wasn't going to share that with you by putting it to myself.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
You weren't willfully inconsiderate. It was just a symptom of the true reason.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yes.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
All right. Anyway, we'll get into our gaming weeks a little more specifically in a little bit.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
We don't have a chat room tonight, sadly. Usually I would plug our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
But again, we will be back on 20 November with episode number 666 of our show live.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
So if for some interesting reason this is your first episode of Orange Lawns Radio,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I realize this episode's a little different because we actually don't have the live thing going on.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
But we wanted to do something a little bit special. We don't like missing shows.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
But I will mention real quick before we get into our kickoff topic, I did spend the weekend in Chicago.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
And I didn't get to spend a lot of time there, so it's not like I could meet up with all these different people and so forth.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
And I wasn't really there for a gaming convention or anything like that.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
Although I was there, well, I don't like to say I went to play Ingress because that wasn't the sole reason I went.

08:44.000 --> 08:52.000
I went to Chicago to visit Chicago and Ingress was a good excuse to have something to do while I'm there.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
But it was really about visiting my friends that were out there.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
And I have some friends out there, several of the hosts of a show that used to be around Koopa Club live there.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And we became friends through the podcasting community and all that stuff.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
So I was able to hang out with them and just really get to see Chicago.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
And I had a great time. It was a fun city.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
You really need to go, Alan. Next time, we'll go when there's not an election happening.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
And I think you'd enjoy Chicago a lot.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Let's go like early February. Just like the worst part of winter.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
Not during the winter. That's the one thing. I love Chicago, but I don't love the winters there.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
That airport is cursed because you briefly had a scare.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Everybody gets delayed at O'Hare.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
And actually, I learned that for transit, it's honestly easier to do Midway.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
So, note to self.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
The weather there is really Bucky.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yes.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Bucky O'Hare.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Anyway, didn't really do a lot of gaming in the city.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Didn't do a round one or a Dave and Buster's.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I mean, it was just Ingress.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
I've talked ad nauseam about that game and so has Loki.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
So I don't know what else I want to say about the event.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
We lost. I mean, that was that.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
But I had a good time. It's not really about winning or losing because it was just meeting people.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And I met people from all over the country and had a really good time.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
So, yeah, I really found a lot to love in Chicago.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
You got to eat pizza flavored casserole. So that was good.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Yes. Yes.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
That is authentic deep dish pizza. It was amazing.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
They took me to a place in Chicago called Cheesy's, which like everything on the menu is like super cheese.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
Like I had a grilled cheese sandwich, but instead of just grilled cheese, it actually had mac and cheese in it.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
And I knew it was going to make me sick, but actually it didn't.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
I did very well. I was ready for it mentally.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Prepared. Anyway.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
All right. Enough about food.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Let's get into video games.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Although I suppose snacky foods like mac and cheese go hand in hand with games sometimes.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
And things from the past, which is our kickoff topic tonight.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
So a lot of the stories we're going to focus on this week are things that have come up kind of in the last week.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
And then on our next live episode, we'll focus more on the stuff this week.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
But obviously this is a big story that kind of continues to go on is the release of the NES classic, the miniature NES.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
Right. And, you know, we've talked about this on the show before leading up to this, but these retro consoles have been doing very well.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Like Atari has had a new one.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I think they're up to what, like flashback seven or something.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
They've had a new little Atari on the shelf every year.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
It seems like of some type of flashback console Coleco.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
There's one out there in television.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Sega is really big on these now too, right?

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
Like a target, you can get a Genesis or a handheld, but they didn't call it.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
They didn't name it after the Sega handheld.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
They just have like a handheld Genesis that you can get too.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, now Nintendo's getting in on this action.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
And since there's not really a lot going on for Wii U this holiday,

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
granted 3DS has Pokemon, there's not a lot going on on Wii U.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
This is kind of Nintendo's big thing for the holiday.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
And it was released on Friday and it pretty much sold out instantly everywhere.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Like most Nintendo things tend to do these days, it seems.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Jason mentioned in the intro there, the Wii had this problem, right? Big time.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
If you weren't camping outside back in 2006.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Remember 2006 Dark Soccer when we traveled around to all the lines?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
What was it we gave out?

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Orange soda as promo for the show. Some cheesy thing. Donuts.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Donuts is part of it. Maybe coffee.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
I know that Kristin and I bribed our way into the Wii line with donuts and coffee.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
No, they were great. It was just Kristin.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Maisie wasn't here for that, right? It was just Kristin.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
But she was great in helping us go around and all that.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, I just had a great time.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Anyway, so there was that with the Wii.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
And then with the Wii U, there was lowered supply.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
It was a little harder to find, but I think because the demand for the Wii U wasn't as high,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
it wasn't as big a problem. Just kind of depended where you were.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I remember when you got your Wii U, it was a week or two after release,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
and you said, I'm going to open up the Target app.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
No, it was the day of. It was the day of.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Oh, it was the day of.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
But it wasn't like 6 a.m. camping out front.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
It was like after brunch.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah, we were out eating and you're like, I'm going to check the Target app,

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
we can find one within 30 minutes drive that just has one, I'm going to get it.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And they had like three of them.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Yeah, they did. So I ended up getting it.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
So it wasn't as bad, but then Amiibo was a fucking nightmare.

13:28.000 --> 13:35.000
So this has a lot of people asking, why can't Nintendo figure out this supply and demand thing?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And are they doing it on purpose?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
And this question was asked around the time that Amiibo were launched.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Is Nintendo doing this on purpose?

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
Are they driving it up or are they, I guess, artificially, maybe in some way making demand

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
so that this becomes the hot must-have Christmas item that news stations are going to report on to get this thing more coverage?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
What do you think, Alan?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Do you think Nintendo is doing this on purpose?

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
Or do you think Nintendo really just doesn't understand that there is an audience for this stuff?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I would say that it's on purpose.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah, I think it's calculated.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
I think they will figure out how many they think will sell and then kind of do exactly that amount

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
or maybe scale it down a little just so that it's like all profit.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
Like they just move every single unit and they just be like, we'll catch up later.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
What about you, Dark Soccer? You like to collect collectibles.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
What are your thoughts on the mini NES or classic NES, whatever they're calling it?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Is this something you and Dan are interested in or?

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
We talked about it, but we have, I think we do have all of those games.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
You have the real thing.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
And we also have an EverDrive.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
I just wanted it to sit on my desk because it's cute.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I mean, you wanted it as a prop.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I wanted it as a prop.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
As a paperweight.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
We discussed that the big problem with it has to do with the length of the wires on the controller.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Yes.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And that they're hardwired in.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
It must be for like college kids in a dorm room because you have to play the thing on your lap.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Like it's crazy.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Well, I'm thinking it's designed for an office.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
It's not designed for your living room. It's designed for your office.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
That's my thought.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
But look at the length of the ones on the original Famicom.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
They were also hardwired in and pretty short.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
So.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I guess that's true.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
It's just, it's weird though that it won't support like wireless through the Wiimotes or something.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
It's just, it's some of the, some of the decisions are really baffling sometimes.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Like the thing that gets me, here's the thing.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
And I talked about this when the mini NES first came out is that I kind of felt like I don't need one

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
because we already have virtual console on the Wii and the Wii U.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
So, I mean, what is this thing?

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
It's just basically virtual console with 30 preloaded games that will never change.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
At least that's what they say.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
And I don't think that thing suddenly has internet capabilities in it.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
So I'm pretty certain that they're going to keep it at just the 30 games that are with it.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
It's a power AC plug and HDMI.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
That's it.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
That's it.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
But then I heard that, well, the emulation in these things is actually supposedly better.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
The picture quality is going to be better than what you get on the Wii U and the Wii.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
And to be honest, I don't know why, but that actually like it really bothers me that that's the case.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Because I'm kind of like, you can't be asked then to patch that into the Wii U,

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
give me that same software in the Wii U, whatever you're running on that $60 device,

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
put in my $250 device that I spent $5 a game for NES on,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
whereas this other thing is $2 a game.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
I don't know. There's a part of me that's just really irritated with this thing.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
But then of course there's the half of me that's like Jamie where I'm like,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
but it is really cute and I kind of want one for that reason.

16:44.000 --> 16:51.000
But I don't know. It would be a hate purchase. I'd hate myself after buying it.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
If you're a Nintendo fan, I think the code of life you live by is fool me once, shame on me,

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
fool me 20 times, yay Nintendo!

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
That's so true though! Nintendo always gets a pass on this.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And like, when are we going to draw the line?

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Like how many times have the people listening bought Link to the Past?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Probably six or seven.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And I'm honestly probably included in that.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
I can't wait to buy a Zelda game. Which one? Oh, the old ones again and again.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Just buy them forever.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
I don't know. I know people have been buying them and they've been having a great time with them.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
And it is a really solid collection of games that's in it.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
And to be fair, if you're not stocking up on virtual console games on Wii and Wii U,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
it is only $2 a game versus $5 a game.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
So in that regard, it's a pretty sweet deal.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
So like, I get it. I'm not knocking it.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
But I'm just, I'm kind of irritated that Nintendo's got one thing going on over here

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
and they got another going on in the Wii U.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
And you fucking know. You know when that Switch comes out, they're gonna make you buy them again.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
Now, I can only hope, fingers crossed, toes crossed,

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
that Nintendo's gonna do something like their upgrade program from Wii to Wii U

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
where it only costs a dollar or whatever it is.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Hopefully they do something similar for the Switch.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
But then my question is, well, but what about the ones that we bought on the 3DS?

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Because now you've got two ecosystems becoming one,

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
although Nintendo says the 3DS is still separate, blah, blah, blah.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
You guys all know I don't believe that.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
The fact that it was a dollar upgrade is still shady as hell,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
but because that's more than what we're used to from them.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Because think about what Xbox does.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
I mean, they are porting the games piecemeal, but you're still getting them.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
That is very true.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
At least I could justify the one dollar because it is a picture quality upgrade.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
You do have the fact that you can play it on the gamepad.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
You have just minor, minor features that, okay, a dollar is fine.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
But if I had to pay another five dollars, I would have been very, very upset.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
So I'm hoping Nintendo does something like that with the Switch,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
that at least they charge maybe a nominal fee.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
But I don't know.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Do they have a need to do Virtual Console

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
if now it's shown that the mini things can sell fine on their own?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Does the Switch even need Virtual Console?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I kind of think it'll have it anyway.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
I had that day off, and it was around three or four in the afternoon

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
when I realized, oh, that came out today,

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
and I wanted to maybe just see, just like you in the Wii U,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
if I could find one for the lulz.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
But by then, I had decided that it was already too late.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Because between Walmart, GameStop, Target, Best Buy,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
there are a lot of places where you could try to hunt the sucker down.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
But I think if I had that crazy notion at like 10 or 11 a.m.,

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
I would have gone for it.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
But at 4 p.m., it was like, no, it's gone everywhere.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah. No, and I understand. I understand.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, I mean, and so it's one of those things where it's like,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
well, maybe if I come into one sitting on the shelf somewhere,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
maybe I'll buy it.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
But at the same time, I've spent enough money on gaming lately.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Final Fantasy XV is out next week, or sorry, two weeks.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I mean, Pokemon Sun and Moon is out this week.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I mean, there's so much other stuff that's happening in gaming.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
I don't know if I'm going to pick up on that NES Classic thing right now.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Maybe next year. Who knows?

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
I'd be very curious to see if they do a Volume 2

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
or what that's going to look like in 2017.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
But we'll see.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Anyway, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
and what kind of video games have you been playing this week.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Dark Sakura, it's been a while since we've heard of one of your gaming weeks.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
How was your gaming week?

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Fuck.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
A little bit of Dragon Age.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
A little bit, actually a lot of WoW lately

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
because now I think I just hit 865, no, 856.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
It was the other way around.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
I honestly still don't know if that's good, but I could do Mythic, so whatever.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I was playing some Animal Crossing, actually.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Well, the Happy Home Designer.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Danganronpa 2 because I've been playing just a little bit at a time.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
Have you gone back and checked out the major update to Animal Crossing 3DS

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
with the Amiibo support and the stuff?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Apparently there's like 20 pieces of furniture

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
if you've done Happy Home Designer or something like that.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Really?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah, make sure you check that out. If you missed that.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I might have to move back into my village.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Oh yeah, get your game card out and download the update

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
because they did a huge, even I checked that out this past week.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Now there's RVs that show up and there's a whole new currency

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
you get for doing quests in Animal Crossing.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Yeah, it was like a whole shit change, Joe.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
And they fucking cleaned up all your weeds.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I know.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Fuck.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Isabelle was like, I hired a guy and they're gone.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Isabelle, get shit done.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Isabelle for president.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
I support that over plenty of other things.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Over the orange Cheeto.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Yes.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Sorry, Cheeto Hitler. Sorry.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Anyway.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Anyway.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
God, I played other stuff too.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Oh yeah, Dan did an Extra Life marathon.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
So guess what the fuck I played?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
You guys were playing random shit.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
You had your Twitch thing going.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
I remember tuning in at one point.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
You guys were playing Street Fighter Alpha 2

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
on the Game Boy Advance through the GameCube thing or something.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
It was like random fucking shit you guys were playing.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
Dan was going for weirdness and then I busted out the Guardian Legend.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
And I hate to say I suck balls at it now.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
It's hard.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, a lot of these games we were good at when we were kids.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
We go back now and we're like, fuck, no wonder our parents sucked at these games.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
I got through, it took me four tries to get into the game.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
You know, you have that intro thing.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
And finally I felt like my skills were coming back.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
And then I kept dying on the first level and finally beat it

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
because I realized I forgot to go get the other weapons I needed.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Right.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
And so, but it was just like, I bet if I sat and played and played,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
but I found something actually that I had to use rubber grips

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
on the edge of the NES controller because of my wrist.

23:15.000 --> 23:22.000
And so it was interesting, but we also played, what else did I play?

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
We actually had Fantasy Zone, the Tengen Fantasy Zone going on.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Nice.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
No, we played other things though.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Oh yeah, Dan played through The Legend of Zelda.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Just straight played through it.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Nice. The original?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Yeah.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Awesome.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
It only takes like, what, an hour?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Did you guys raise any money for that?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Yeah, what about 250?

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Oh, that's still really good.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I don't remember you guys doing a lot of build up to that or anything.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Is this really good?

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Well, Dan was just saying, oh, just get me this off.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I was like, well, do you even have a Twitch channel?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I'll just use yours.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
That's fair.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Okay.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
So, but yeah, the next thing I think investment list is.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
We have an Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channel,

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
and I need to remember to go in and set that up so it auto hosts you, me, or Loki.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
I don't know if Loki has a Twitch.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
I think he does.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I think he did something one time on it.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I think he's like my stream from his PS4 or something.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
But I need to set it up so it's like you, me, Loki,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
if any of us are ever streaming, it's on there.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And then, you know, some friends of OLR too,

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
like Xtopher and Shane or something, you know, set up some of them.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
We used that Elgato thing.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah. Oh yeah. I have one of those. It worked great.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
That Loki loaned us.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Oh, I have like one of the cards in the computer now. Yeah.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
But it was like maybe a 20 second delay, but it wasn't terrible.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
And I'm thinking, I've actually been thinking about getting myself

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
a condenser mic anyway for stuff that we might record on the go.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Yeah, you should.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
I bet a lot of people would get a kick out of that if you did more

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
streaming.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Yeah, we'll see.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Because I mean, other than that,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
it's just going to be me streaming while going fuck this shit.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Fuck that shit. Fuck you.

25:01.000 --> 25:09.000
Oh, I am foul now, especially fouler on doing stupid.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I mean, heroics are easy as balls now,

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
but doing anything that relates to Ayah Vajra, I will cuss.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
I will cut every bitch in that game in my head and I will not be nice

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
about it. I will cut them with syrup.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
No, not even serrated because that would be too easy.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
I would cut them with spoons with little plastic Dairy Queen spoons

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
and break every single one of them breaking into their faces because I

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
hate that dungeon so much.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Is that the one with the big worm in the middle?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yes.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Oh, God, I hate that one.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
You want to know what, though, is stupid about that worm?

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
It's easier in Mythic and Heroic than it is in Regular.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Interesting. I believe it. I believe it.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
Regulars are really oddly balanced. Really oddly balanced.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Heroics are easy as balls. They're easier for me.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
And what's funny is that I didn't even realize that there was a hole

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
when I skipped over until I started doing randoms.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
And it was like the one where you fight like Helia on the ghost pirate ship.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I don't think I ever did that one.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
I did a pug for it earlier today.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
And I said something that everyone just goes,

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
Oh, my God, you're right. Like, if this is based off of Norse mythology,

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
why are they using pirate terminology instead of acting like fucking Vikings?

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
And that was my WoW revelation of the day.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It's Warcraft. You have to suspend disbelief.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah, but it was still pretty just random epiphany.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
They should be Vikings, not pirates.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

26:45.000 --> 26:53.000
Uh, oh, yeah, I got really, really bored and played through and beat Regency Solitaire.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
That is very bored. You have to be really bored.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Solitaire?

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
It plays like the fairy solitaire, where it's kind of weird

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and you have to just match the numbers instead.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Still, though.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
But Regency Solitaire, I was like, she has got to marry what's-as-fuck.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And I even hate like...

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
You were playing it for the plot, really?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
You were playing solitaire for the plot?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I was that bored.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
But I mean, I was just like, oh, whatever.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
And then I was like, you know what, this actually is kind of a decent story.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
I mean, but I don't like like the Regency era, like, you know,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Pride and Prejudice, not Pride and Prejudice, what am I thinking?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Pride and Prejudice is zombies.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
No, um, who was the writer? God, I can't think of her name now.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Jane Austen?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Jane Austen, yes. I was never a fan of Jane Austen.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I mean, good writer.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Oh, I'm a big fan of Clueless, but that's about it.

27:41.000 --> 27:48.000
Yeah, but still, you know, it's not my era of classic literature.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
All right, only you can take your gaming Wii to classic literature.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
We're going to move on, if you're good to go.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
I reckon. Oh, yeah, Miitomo update.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Eh, Miitomo update can kiss my butt.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
It blows my phone up at seven in the morning now.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Well, you can turn off notifications.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I'm yanking its privileges, that's for sure.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
But I like the sending messages and decorating my room.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
So now I have my Cullen poster and my Geras poster,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
and I have the European Guardian Legend poster,

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
and I also have, like, some Danganronpa.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I'll have to come over and visit.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Come visit.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
And steal your posters.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
No.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
All right.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Okay, I'm good.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Alan, how about you? How was your gaming Wii?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
What have you been playing?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I'll just rattle off, like, the last month or two.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
I was playing Overwatch to death forever and ever, hundreds of hours.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Overwatch forever.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Was? Have you broken up with Overwatch?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I barely play around a day now.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Really?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
If even.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Even with Sombra just coming out this week?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
It's really hard to get her, because even in Quick Play now,

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
there's only one hero allowed per team, which I understand for balance,

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
that way people don't do stupid stuff like six Bastions or whatever.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Okay, although the time we had six Torbjorn's, that was hilarious.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I'm sorry.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
But, yeah, I haven't really tried her yet,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
and I was spinning my wheels in the...

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Build them up, pick them down.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
I was spinning my wheels in the mud with the season two ranking.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
I was, I peaked at about 2,300, and then the last month or two,

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
I've been just floating between 1,900, then I'll go up to 2,000,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
get six really bad games in a row,

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
fall back down to 1,900, go back to 2,000, 1,900.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
So it's not fun.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
I was playing the hell out of Dark Souls 2.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
I did my anniversary run of Half-Life and Half-Life 2 in the episodes,

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
or rather Black Mesa, the remake.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
And then Mortal Kombat X finally got acknowledged by Warner Brothers

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
or NetherRealm Studios for PC,

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
because they just didn't touch it for a year or a year and a half.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
So they came out with a huge quality patch

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
and also the XL content with Alien and Predator and Leatherface,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
so I played that.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
Then that made me go play story mode again in MK9 with Freddy Krueger.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
And now I'm back fully into Skyrim Special Edition.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
I knew that was a rabbit hole waiting for you to fall into.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Yeah.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
And a lot of the really complicated mods

30:16.000 --> 30:23.000
depended on this third-party extender for the scripting program.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Because there's a whole programming language, obviously,

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
with the creation kit that you can write in to make mods.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Well, the extender that allows for much bigger scripts,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
because it's a 64-bit program, that hasn't been made yet.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
So a lot of the mods are really pared down

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
and gone back to their roots.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
It's difficult for your save to get corrupted,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
whereas before, if you uninstalled a mod

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
and it left tons of scripts in your save and you didn't clean it,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
you might have lost that career,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
unless you put the mod back, and so on.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
So Special Edition is in this really neat Renaissance period

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
where all of these great mods are coming back,

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
but in a stripped-down version.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
The game runs great. It looks incredible.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
I put some really awesome screenshots on my Twitter today.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Yeah, it looks really good.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I'll look over my shoulder sometimes,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
and it looks really pretty on your computer.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
So I've got to get that installed on mine at some point.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Use your Steam login or something to figure that out.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
That'd be nice.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
But that's it.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
All right. Awesome.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I won't take up too much time.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
No, don't worry about it.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
My gaming week, I've been playing, you know,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I hate to say it, but a lot of the same stuff.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Still trucking along in Final Fantasy XIV,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
although, you know, a lot of that now is just basically

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
grinding my later gear and getting the tomes and everything

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
and trying to do the Wonder's Tales books every week,

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
even though the randomness of that could be really infuriating.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Otherwise, I've actually been playing a little bit of Overwatch,

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
just casually.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
I'll play a match or two a night, and that's still fun.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
I think I might finally break and get that on PlayStation 4

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
with some of the Black Friday deals,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
just because I know so many people that play it on PlayStation 4.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
And I honestly feel like console might be better balanced for me.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Yeah, I've heard that it plays almost completely different.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Yeah, well, they had the free weekend a few weeks ago.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Remember that?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
And I played that.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Yeah, that just happened, I think.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Well, there's one coming up this weekend.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Okay, that's what I'm thinking of.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Except Pokemon's happening this weekend,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
so, you know, there's a lot going on this weekend.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
But I probably will try it again, Overwatch,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
because I also got a PlayStation 4 Pro,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
and Overwatch is one of the games that supports Pro.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Now, I don't have a 4K TV,

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
so I fully expect that I'm not going to get a ton of stuff out of the Pro.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Bring it to my house.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
I might.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
I also, I mean, it's a really tricky scenario,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
because we just got this TV.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I was going to say, not to reveal our business,

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
but you paid a nice chunk of change for the great TV we have,

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
and then to find out,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
oh, there are these three features that we don't have on this year-old TV.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
That's cute.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Yeah, so that part kind of sucks, so I don't know.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
We have to kind of decide,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
because Alan and I don't really have a need for a second TV,

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
so I have to kind of figure out, like, do we just sell that TV

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
and try to, you know, cut our losses?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
What do we do?

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
But for the meantime, I still, you know what?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
There are some things with the Pro

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
that some games will run at 60 frames a second,

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
like Final Fantasy 15,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
and, you know, obviously there's going to be some support

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
of Mass Effect and Andromeda,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
so I still kind of want to get it.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I kind of looked at it as getting a video card,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
because I'm selling my PlayStation 4,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
so I'm recouping some of the cost back.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
So it's like upgrading your video card.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
That's kind of what I looked at it as in getting the Pro.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
So, but anyway, I still want to check out Overwatch,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
because I want to see, you know,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
just how that feels on PlayStation 4, you know, with that,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
although I anticipate it's not going to be that much different,

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
but I'm excited to, like, try Sombra,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
although I have the same problem as you.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
I don't really get to use her in any match, because everybody is.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
So now the question is, who's a good counter for her?

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
And apparently I'm hearing it's Winston is the best counter for her.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
So you're now seeing a lot of Winstons show up,

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
whereas I rarely would see that character ever pop in.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
He's very hard to play.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
He's very hard to play.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
I like playing him better than a lot of the tanks,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
but yeah, he's hard to play.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
But I guess he can zap her while she's invisible,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
and that goes a long way.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah.

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
Did you see the Sombra, was it Sombra?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
I don't play the game, but...

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Cosplay?

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
No, no, no, no. Exploit for private matches,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
where you turn off the cooldown.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
She apparently has this, like, jump thing that knocks her into the air.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
She can throw, like, she basically throws a teleporter,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
and she can teleport to wherever it lands.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Exactly.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
So people were using it to get, with no cooldown,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
to get to the top of the map.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh, okay.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
And then get, like, a free view of everything,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
or try to free fall into certain locations.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Oh, that's clever.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
There's videos of it.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Wouldn't you be able to do that with Pharah?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
No, it was Widowmaker.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
You take one of the basketballs that are in the starting area,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
and you get someone to knock it up,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
and then you use your grappling hook,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
and you just keep going up, up, up off the basketball,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
and you could break the map, or break yourself on the map.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
I'm really surprised.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I would think with Pharah, if you can remove cooldowns,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
you could do the same thing with her boost.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Well, she is limited by her fuel, though.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Oh, and you can't change that.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Oh, interesting. Okay.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
I mean, I noticed in just looking at some of the maps there,

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
if you, you know, can find a place that, like, would work sort of as a ladder,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
but, I mean, does fuel recharge on its own,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
or do you have to find it for her?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
For Pharah?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Uh-huh.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
It's just on a cooldown.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Yeah, it's a meter that recharges.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
So you do it, like, ladder style, where you pause on your ladder,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
and then see how high you can go.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
But, I mean, actually the levels look really nice if it wasn't still, you know, expensive.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Yeah.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
And I've, I don't have time for that.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Look, well, Black Friday is my suggestion,

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
because I think some places are going to have that down to 35 bucks on Black Friday.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
We'll see.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
So that's a little more reasonable.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
But I know you have the motion thing, and it's a first-person shooter.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Don't forget that.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
So that could be a problem.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Yeah, we'll see.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I don't know, I did okay with portal.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
That's true.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Watch streams.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Well, but then you're not in control in the streams.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Maybe that's different.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Maybe.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
All right.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Okay.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
So I'm trying to think if there's anything else in my gaming week,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
and I'm kind of coming up short right now.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
I haven't played a whole lot else.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
I have one thing to add, only because I haven't been on the show in so long.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
I do live under a rock in that I had never heard of No Man's Sky until it came out,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
and everyone shit the bed.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
So I got on PC just to see, because I, again, knew nothing about it.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
I played the hell out of it for a good month, month and a half.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
It was really meditative and chill.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
A lot of it is because the planets were beautiful,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
and it was just a good way to just decompress.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
And then one day I just stopped playing it, and I haven't touched it since.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
And they haven't done any updates to really bring people back,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
like I thought they were going to do.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Occasionally.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I don't think one's come through in a couple weeks,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
but even through all of the radio silence,

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
I would occasionally get a patch once a week or twice a week,

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
little one or two meg patches, consistently from the release through about six weeks,

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
or whatever, through start of September or start of October.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
So they were patching it, which kind of lends itself to the,

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
we're not talking to anyone because we're busy fixing this broken game that we released.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
But yeah, nothing as far as features that I know of.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Okay.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
All right.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
Yeah, I think being in a bubble and not letting yourself fall into the hype too much

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
ended up being a really, really good thing for that game.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Because I don't follow E3.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Like, if Half-Life 3 was announced to E3,

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
it would take a good hour or two for me to find out about it.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Until I'm screaming about it, right?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah, I would see it on Twitter.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Yeah, right?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I just found something that makes me super happy.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
What's that?

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
The Kung Fu Panda director is working on an adaptation of Bone.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Oh yeah, I'd heard that on Twitter or somewhere.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
The graphic novel?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
I love Bone.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
That'd be cool.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
All right.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Well, I may as well share some happy news, right?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Yeah, that's true.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
All right, well, we're going to share some gaming news right now with you guys.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I don't have a lot to say for housekeeping.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Just remember to follow us on Twitter at OLR,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
and we're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook,

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Google Plus as well if you're still trucking along over there.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
And again, we will be back Sunday on our normal schedule

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
Our next hurdle now that we've cleared Rob's Chicago trip is

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
what are we going to do during the holidays?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Because did you know this, Dark Saga?

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
December 25th, January 1st, January 8th, all Sundays.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
You want to know what else?

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
Christmas through New Year's is Hanukkah.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Oh, is it? Great.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
So we have Chris-ma-kah-nah near year.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah, all of it.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
All of it's happening all at once, so I don't know.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
We've been throwing around some ideas.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
What do you think, Dark Sakura?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Do you think, I know since, you know,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
well, if December 25th is the first night of Hanukkah, though,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
that might not be, that might not work out so well.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Because I was going to say, YOLO, I mean,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I know Loki won't be here, but he wouldn't mind

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
if we did a show with Adam on Christmas Day.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I would certainly not mind.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I don't think that we do much with the family.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Oh, wait, wait. No, I actually, I would be off.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Yeah, so.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Because work is usually open on Christmas Day.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
We, but we, and we usually do a thing,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
but we would probably be done in time.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
So figure something out.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
So.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I mean, unless they call me into work.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Yeah.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Then.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Don't quote us on that,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
because the reality is there's the 25th, the 1st,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
and then January 8th.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Guess what?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I'm at MAGFest in Washington, D.C.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Woohoo!

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
So I won't be here.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
But guess what?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
You know what?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
We shouldn't do a Christmas show.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
We should do a first day of Hanukkah show.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
A first day of Hanukkah show?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
A first day of Hanukkah show.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
What about just a holiday show?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
No, Christmas gets way too much,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
and we need to reclaim some.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
You know what?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Festivus for the rest of us.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
No.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
No, it's the, it's Orange Lounge Radio Day.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
That's what we're going to be celebrating.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
A holiday for us.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Why?

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Because it's us.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Right?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Yes.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Alright.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Anyway.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I'm still, I actually, I found two shirts.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I'm trying to decide which one I want.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
One of them says Happy Holidays.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
It has a piece of bread on it.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And the other one says Happy Hanukat.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
I like that.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
So, I don't know.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
Don't you think December 25th should be Orange Lounge Radio Day?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
It's Decemberween.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
It's Decemberween.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Alright.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
I guess some folks would argue,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
no, that should be 20 November because of your roots,

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
but I don't know.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
I'm coming.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I'm coming for Christmas.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Well, it's coming for you.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Alright.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Screaming.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
You think the deviants have killed Christmas.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
You ain't seen nothing yet.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Alright.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
Anyway, let's get into some actual gaming news that has happened.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
While we've been gone, Allen,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
you have something to start us off with tonight.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Yes.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
In Grand Theft Auto Online,

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
they released a new adversary mode called Deadline,

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
and in Deadline, you can use the Tron bicycle.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Like, it's...

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
I don't know how they did this because Disney...

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
Grand Theft Auto is not really a property Disney would license to,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
but maybe it's the guy who...

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Because it's not actually a Tron bike, right?

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
It's just something that looks like a Tron bike.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Wink, wink, nudge.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
It's like, yeah, I was going to say,

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
maybe they changed the handlebars and, like, said,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
okay, it's not copyright because we changed this one thing about it,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
but it's...

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
It's when they do those pornos and they'll say, like,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
a blank parody type of thing, you know?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Like, I don't know, what are...

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
I don't even know it's important.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Like, the slut of the rings or something.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
It'll be a Lord of the Rings parody.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Wink, wink, nudge.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
That type of thing.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
So these things...

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Or the Lord of the cock ring.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
These things are 90% identical to a Tron.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
I think, oh, you're sitting more upright.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
You're not completely like...

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Because, you know, on the Tron bikes,

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
they're completely like Superman.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
It's semi-recumbent.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yes.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Yes.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
That was me.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
And I just started an ad on my phone.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Oh.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Good job.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
I'm sorry.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
So if you order it now, there's a limited offer.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
This came out a week ago, though,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
so I don't know if it's still valid.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
Oh, through November 21st, there's still time.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
You can get a Nagasaki logo t-shirt for your in-game avatar.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
That's cool.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
And the mode of...

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
You leave a trail of light behind you that stays there,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
and it's basically the last man standing.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
You try to cut people off and get them to slam into your wall.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
You know, Loki sent me a tweet the day this was announced and said,

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
this is how I'm going to get you to finally play that fucking game.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
And I'm like, you're probably right.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
But it's GTA Online, not 5.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I'd still check it out.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
You don't have to play a monthly fee for online, right?

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
No, I know.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
But I thought the game that he was desperate to get you to play was...

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Honestly, Grand Theft Auto 4.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Any of it.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Which I've played and beaten.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
It's a really downer game.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
But yeah.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I think as far as Loki's concerned, any of it, to be honest.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Probably make him happy.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
All right.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
We'll ask him when he gets back.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
What else happened this week, Darzagra?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I have some big news for you, right?

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Oh, so many Mass Effect Andromeda things.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
They introduced the crew, which I'm waiting for one to be called peanut butter.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Or jelly, sorry.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
So they have peanut butter jelly time?

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
They have PB, who's somebody.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
But it's...

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Sorry, right?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Yeah.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Who is supposed to be just kind of a bit of a badass.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
But it's supposed to take place between Mass Effect 2 and 3.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
Well, at least the beginning of the story does.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
And the writers are siblings and everything.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
It's just...

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
That was cool.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
But I'm trying to find the last thing.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
Other than that, the only thing that I know is that there's a new race.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
Who look vaguely Prothean anyway, because just about everything that they create

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
kind of has that same head.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
The big, poofy head in the back.

44:00.000 --> 44:09.000
It's supposed to be a more, I guess, robust morality system in there.

44:09.000 --> 44:17.000
Where you have different types of responses based on heart head, professional or casual.

44:17.000 --> 44:24.000
And so it's supposed to lead to more interesting directions with how people judge you in game.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
Also, it's supposed to be a more nuanced romance system, things like that.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
And multiplayer.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Yeah, I'm excited they confirmed multiplayer.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
Although it sounds like they're really gonna cash in on multiplayer.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Like they did last time?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Like that super deluxe edition.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
Well, speaking of multiplayer, I still need to go back and check this out.

44:44.000 --> 44:49.000
But on N7 Day, they made Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 backwards compatible on Xbox One, finally.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
They did that.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Which is exciting.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
So I want to go back and play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer on Xbox One.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
I think that would be super fun.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
But when I went to go do that, my Xbox was like,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
you have a seven gig update to download.

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
And I was like, God, can't you download overnight when I'm sleeping?

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
That's what the Wii U does. Let the Wii U have its own gimmick.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
The Sony does that too, but that's a PlayStation Plus gimmick.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
It had the update anyway.

45:15.000 --> 45:20.000
Well, also thanks to a couple of leaks, one of them being from Best Buy,

45:20.000 --> 45:28.000
that they have a dynamic cover system where if you say that you're hiding behind a rock,

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
the rock that you're behind could get destroyed.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
So lots of blowing up things and particles and stuffs.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Oh wow, okay. That's gonna be different.

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
And that it's actually, in fact, a very similar comparison has been The Last of Us.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
And then we have a jet pack. We finally have a jet pack.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
And they'll be using them to go to places they shouldn't

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
because somebody will mod it so that jet pack has unlimited fuel.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Right?

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
That's the first thing Dar Sager is going to be looking into.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
How can I fly around and see everything?

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Well, you know I do that shit anyway. It's so much fun.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
You know what struck me as interesting about the whole story in the setup?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
You kind of mentioned it really quick,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
but I think it's something that's really interesting to me

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
is that you have the rider or the brother and sister, right?

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
You have a brother and sister.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Whereas in the original Mass Effect trilogy,

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
there was a very distinct male shepherd or female shepherd.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
They were the same person.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
Yes, they were, but it's like, but now in this one,

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
my point is, if you were male or female, you had that representation.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
The other sibling is also out in the...

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Exactly. And that was it.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
There was no other half or whatever.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
But in this game, if you're going to go with male rider,

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
you're not eliminating female rider.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
She will still be there and a part of the story,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
as well as vice versa, obviously.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
So that's very interesting to me.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I reckon if that's kind of like, well, I mean,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
while it wasn't throughout the whole game,

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
at the start of Fallout 4, you had both characters together.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
You know, I sat and designed both of them because that's what I do.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
Of course, you know, spoilers, one of them dies still.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
Yeah, you can spend hours in the character creator,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
especially if you have mods designing your spouse,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
whether it be the husband or the wife, and be like,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I have my hot couple. This is me.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
The other one is who I'm married to.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
And then they're like, they're dead.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
We're going to steal your baby.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
All right.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Have fun being frozen.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
All right. So I'm super looking forward to Mass Effect.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
More gameplay. They said, when are the game awards?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
They're soon, right? They're probably like in a couple of weeks.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
So that's when we actually get gameplay.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I'm excited to see gameplay.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I'm sure Dark Soccer is excited to see gameplay.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
I want to see the interface because they've been very good at hiding that.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
They have not shown the interface at all,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
so I'm very curious what that's going to look like.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
So many questions will be answered soon.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
One question I'd like to have the answer to is

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
when are Generation 2 Pokémon going to show up in Pokémon GO

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
to try to lure people back to the game?

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
Well, apparently, it may be a little sooner rather than later.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
A new update to Pokémon GO, which showed up on Android devices,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
and I think iPhone's got this too eventually,

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
was version .45.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
And inside the APK, which is basically the package file

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
that goes on the phone that the game comes out of,

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
there were actually new Pokémon, the 100 new Pokémon

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
from 152 through 251.

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
That's Chikorita through Celebi are now actually in the game data.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I don't think that means graphics.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
That just means in the game data.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
But I do think graphics of Ditto showed up.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
So that's telling me that Ditto will probably be the first Pokémon

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
that they either do as an event,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
because now Pokémon GO has been doing more events recently.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
They did a Halloween event.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
They did an increased drop thing recently.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
So they may do the event in-game,

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
but Ingress has an event right now,

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
so maybe Pokémon GO is sitting out while the Ingress is doing the double AP,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
which is going on right now.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
Or if it's going to be a live event.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
We still fully know Niantic plans to do Pokémon GO live events.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
Whether they're staffed to handle it, I don't know.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
But we'll see.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
So that could be something that that comes from.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
I'm not sure if they can follow the Ingress model,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
because imagine if kids, there's an event,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
and it's like an hour's drive away.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Let's say they do...

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
Because the Ingress, it's like three or four cities in the whole country.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
So let's say they do several cities per state.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
You're going to have kids that parents can't take them to

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
for whatever this is, where you have to be there

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
if they follow the Ingress model,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
and the kids will have a total meltdown.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
Ingress does have a van that they take around the country.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Didn't we go to one? I don't remember if you went.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I have not been, but you've been once or twice.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Yeah, I went. Okay, so you didn't go that night.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
But they have a van tour thing that goes around,

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
and maybe that's how they do it,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
is they have to literally take the Pokémon on tour.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
And they're only going to be able to do this at very large parks.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
You can't play in the middle of downtown like you do Ingress

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
with kids and people on the street and stuff.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
It's going to be big parks, like Chicago as an example.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
It will have to be Millennium Park or something,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
like a huge park where they can do this.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
That's really the only place that's going to be set up for that.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
I'm very curious to see how the live events turn out.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
But anyway, we'll talk about this

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
whenever we're able to do a new Pokéstop podcast.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
But with Sun and Moon coming out this weekend,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Shane's basically said, don't call me.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
We'll see. We'll see what we get around to doing that.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Shane was talking about his Pokévacation.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Yeah, he's taking six days off to play Pokémon.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Yeah.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Is he getting four copies of the game,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
two in English and two in Japanese?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Last I heard, yes, that was his plan.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Oh, I was kidding.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
No, he is...

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I knew he was getting an English and Japanese.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
He's getting two of them digital and two of them physical.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Gotcha.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
He said he may cut it back to three,

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
but there's some type of double dual edition thing or something he wants.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I don't know.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I'm getting one copy of the game. One.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
And you know what? If there's Pokémon in the other game that I don't have,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
you know what I'll do to get them? I'll trade for them.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
That's what you did in Pokémon back in the day.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Or I'll just say, Shane, you have 5,000 Pokémon.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Shane can't trade like that, though, because he doesn't have any friends.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
Stop. He's not here to defend himself. Be nice.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
All right.

51:23.000 --> 51:28.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
use the passphrase, train.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
Let's travel back in time to a time when you didn't buy four copies of a game

51:35.000 --> 51:40.000
because you were probably begging somebody for money to buy the game.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
Or you were mowing the lawn or gardening or something.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
It's time for the classic game of the week.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Or stealing from a convenience store.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
And Dark Soccer is here.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
She's back with no radio magic. She's here to...

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
We've had to fill in a few weeks without you.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Because I was, like, dead.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Well, I hope the picks were worthy.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
I picked it because it's unique, and then I found out it's not as unique as I thought it was,

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
but for a while it was exclusive to a system that people hardly remember existed.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
Well, it must be because I heard it's the 15th anniversary of Halo this week,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
so you finally did it. You finally picked Halo for the classic game of the week, right?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I'm going home.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
No, you're not. You're here forever.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Bitch.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
What is the classic game of the week?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Al Khazar, the Forgotten Fortress.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
And this game has very little audio.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
It bleeps and bloops.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
I will still leave it up in the background so you can hear some bleeps and bloops,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
but there's not a lot.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Besides Dark Soccer and meowing.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Just like the piercing internal speaker on an old IBM computer.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Pretty much.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Oh, here you go.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
There you go. There's some music.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
I had Chipotle earlier. I'm sorry.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
An abrupt record scratch right there that you would hear on an old Atari system.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Anyway, Al Khazar.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
It's an action-adventure game.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
It actually very much resembles Legend of Zelda and Dungeon Master,

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
and it came out in 1985 for the Coleco Adam,

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
which was also the first computer that I ever owned for the record was Coleco Adam,

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
which kind of sucked, but hey.

53:19.000 --> 53:28.000
It was downgraded later on for a Coleco Vision only version that came out later.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
So for the longest time, it was only on Coleco systems,

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
specifically the good version being the Coleco Adam.

53:34.000 --> 53:40.000
And it was done by, not specifically by Activision,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
but by one of their designers.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
I just realized for the record, this clip I'm using is the Coleco Vision version.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
Sorry about that. That's probably why the bleeps and bloops are more bleepy and bloopy.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Yeah.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
But, Rob, you will be happy to know it was ported to the Commodore 64.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Well, thank God.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Yeah.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
Anyway, the goal is to get to the main castle, Al Khazar,

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
by going through different castles, enemy castles,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
until you can retrieve the stolen crown.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So you start off on a world map.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
Okay, this is an important question, because this is something I'm noticing about this game.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
This is important, because it's very Dungeons and Dragon-esque, right?

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
There's torches, and it's a dungeon, and you've got castles.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
But the weapon he's using is a gun.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
It could be a wand.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
No, it's a gun. It looks like a fucking gun, like the graphic and everything.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
It's a gun with bullets.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
So it's like, we're going back to medieval times, or I'm going to get medieval on your end.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
They have guns in Warcraft.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
I guess, no, but this doesn't look like-

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I call it a boomstick!

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
No, this is like a fucking, like, gun.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Okay.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Can I finish?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Gun.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
Actually, Gun was the last song I was listening to in my car.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Churches.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Tim Gunn, make it work.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
That's Peter Gunn.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Anyway.

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
Anyway, you have a world map, and it's got 22 castles on it.

55:13.000 --> 55:19.000
And your goal is to move through each of the castles until you get to the main fortress on the right-hand side of the map.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
Each castle has different rooms, it has traps, it has floors.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
The maps change every time a new game is started.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
And you've got different difficulty levels, like beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert.

55:30.000 --> 55:36.000
You also have different items that you can get, such as a pistol, gun, rob.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
You can also get a grappling hook.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
And you have a little map to help you, you know, remember where you are.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
You do have traps, you have enemies.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
You know, if you get too much damage, you lose a life and you die.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
There are no continues in the game.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
The only way that you can save is on the Coleco Adam version.

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
And good luck at that, because the Coleco Adam was notorious for erasing shit.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Just sayin'.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
Okay, pause. Rant time.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
The Coleco Adam ran-

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I'm literally pausing the bleeps and bloops for this.

56:13.000 --> 56:19.000
It's power through the printer that connected to the tape deck.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Yes, it used cassettes.

56:21.000 --> 56:27.000
And if you had a power surge, like hello me living in Alabama, it would power surge through your cassettes.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
And you know what happened? Erase.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
It burned the cassettes, or magnetized, yeah.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Yeah, demagnetize them.

56:34.000 --> 56:42.000
So, I found, like, packs of the Commodore 6- not Commodore 64, what am I saying- the Coleco Adam cassettes.

56:42.000 --> 56:49.000
And in the box and everything, it's like, I don't know if I can sell these, because I don't know if they're demagnetized or not.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
So I put them on eBay, I said, good luck, bitches.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Anyway.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
The game is also one of the earliest adventure games to have a demo mode.

56:58.000 --> 57:03.000
So it actually gives you a demo, you wait for the title screen for about 30 seconds, it goes into demo mode.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
And believe it or not, there is an earlier version of this that was initially created for the Apple II.

57:10.000 --> 57:20.000
For all of its various versions, apart from the Apple II version, Coleco Adam, Coleco Vision, and Commodore 64, it also was ported to the MSX.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
And that's it.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Alright.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Alcazar. Algazam.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Alcazar, The Forgotten Fortress.

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
It's very Zelda-y.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
I would almost say, like, oh, I wonder if Zelda was inspired by this, but no, the years don't work out.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I mean, they probably came out nearly at the same time.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
So, in fact, maybe Zelda was even a year or two earlier.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
But yeah, still really cool looking.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Yep.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Alright, good choice for the classic game of the week.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Let's get back right into it.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
We're not going to do a break tonight, we're running right through.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
It's going to be a shorter show since it's something we're taping mid-week.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
But let's get into a few more news items.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Alan, what else do you have for us tonight?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I'll try to make this quick.

58:04.000 --> 58:14.000
Final Fantasy XV, when it is released in a couple weeks, is supposed to run allegedly between 40 to 50 frames per second, depending on what's going on.

58:14.000 --> 58:27.000
It's been announced via Active Time Report that in December, for the PlayStation 4 Pro, they're going to drop a patch that should take the whole game up to 60 FPS sustained.

58:27.000 --> 58:37.000
And 60 FPS, of course, is the magic number for, I guess, the true gaming experience for hardware people that fap over graphics or whatever.

58:37.000 --> 58:44.000
Well, 60 frames per second, too, isn't that when the picture starts getting that fake look almost? Like it's too real?

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Yeah.

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
That whole type of thing? So that's going to be great.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
So that is happening in December.

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
And then, let's see, is there a date for when this is coming out?

58:56.000 --> 59:06.000
Anyway, Square Enix has partnered with Machine Zone for a Final Fantasy XV franchise mobile MMO.

59:06.000 --> 59:15.000
Machine Zone, or MZ as they go by now, are the makers of Fire Age Game of War and Mobile Strike.

59:15.000 --> 59:22.000
We actually did a story on Fire Age Game of War that I think I reported on when I guested.

59:22.000 --> 59:29.000
After they did the Kate Upton model campaign when she was in their commercials, they also had Mariah Carey money.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Oh god, yeah, that was them?

59:31.000 --> 59:38.000
Yeah, so they'd be like, Mariah Carey, do you want a cape for a video game? Fuck no, here's how much money we'll pay you. Okay.

59:38.000 --> 59:45.000
That game after the Kate Upton campaign was making a million dollars a day in microtransactions.

59:45.000 --> 59:51.000
So it's them. So they know what they're doing. Typically, Squeenix is used...

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
So now there's only one degree of separation between Mariah Carey and the Final Fantasy franchise.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
And she didn't even have to sing the song at the end of the game to do it.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Who's the one that did Record Keeper and the other one that are supposedly really good?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
DNA? That's who Nintendo's partnering with for things like Super Mario Run and whatever else they've got up their sleeve.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Yeah, so they're not going with them. They're old standard. They are doing it with Machine Zone.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And yeah, Mobile Strike and Age of War or whatever are consistently top five games.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And they've gone to the top five or top three and stayed there on both the Apple and Google online mobile stores.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And the spokesperson for Mobile Strike is Arnold Schwarzenegger, if you've seen those commercials.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Oh yes, I have.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
So those games are all the same company and they're going to be making the 15 equivalent mobile game.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I wonder what celebrity they'll get for those commercials for this game.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And as far as when it's going to come out, I'm not sure if there's a date. Just Google it.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I'm thinking David Hasselhoff.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Oh God.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I don't know. I'm trying to think. Who's a celebrity that's kind of like way past their time in the spotlight?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.000
They'll get the Backstreet Boys and just put gel in their hair because practically the crew that you play in 15 is a boy band anyway.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000
So just get like NSYNC minus Justin Timberlake and put them in a black convertible on a green screen and be like,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Kirkpatrick, take out your Android.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
No, didn't you see they're going on tour because it's coming to the new arena thingy we have here.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
It's the Backstreet Boys, whatever, boys to men. Cool. Right.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
But then do you know who they just added to that tour? Paula Abdul.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And like the 12 year old little gay and me was like.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Because it's it's all fun and games when you're in your 20s and you see those monsters of rock like State Fair of like foreigner and.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Or when you're me and you see the Spice Girls.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Or or like Journey and or whatever, like some Led Zeppelin cover band.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:02.000
But now the ones that are coming up is like I think they had like a triple header of Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson and like Garbage.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And it was like 90s goth like festival. And I'm like, that sounds so fucking good.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And it's like, how old am I that we have these three bands that are teaming up to play, you know, the vacant lot behind Shakey's.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
My mother messaged me and said, New Kids on the Block are touring.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000
The same woman who bought me my sheets. Who is your favorite of the new kids?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Back then, honestly, it was Joey. The gay one, right? Was Joey? No, that was John.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Jonathan Knight. Oh, I can. He just seemed the one I'd want to hang out with.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I see. But I thought that Joey was kind of cute. Jonathan Knight had that nasty song, too, and he had his comeback.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
All right. Anyway, so the mobile. Oh, yes. Final Fantasy 15 mobile game. Yes.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Well, I was just the only thing I was going to comment is that, you know, that's that sounds really exciting and will be a cool little like thing for this for the series.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
But it's like, my God, there's Final Fantasy 15 spinoffs everywhere.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
It seems like it's everywhere like that. And that's not the first mobile game for Final Fantasy 15.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I already have one on my phone that's like a pinball type game that they put out for 15. Brave Exvius, which I think is their latest release.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Damn it. This article had what rank it is. It's currently number 46, which I imagine is not very good for a new game.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I imagine Record Keeper has kept its momentum better than Brave has. So they could use MZ support on that.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Well, I just, you know, it's very interesting how much they are saturating with Final Fantasy 15.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000
They really want to make sure they get their money back on this game. But this could be a make or break game for the franchise, I guess.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Well, I'd rather have them do freemium games, as awful as that sounds, than have them charge $20 for a Final Fantasy 5 ROM for like the 10th time.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Oh, yeah. Or that horrible, but I didn't like the Final Fantasy 5 remake on the phones. I didn't like that at all.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yeah. Well, I think they realized, oh, these won't sell because they're bad and they charge too much money for them.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Yes. Good. Good. All right. Anyhow, Dark Sakura, we got one more from you, right?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Yeah, you do. Well, two of my favorite franchises. Well, the producers of one of them wants to marry it to another one.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The producer of the Tekken, let's say the more recent Tekken series, Harada Katsuhiro and the designer Michael Murray,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000
were asked before about what their favorite fighting game franchises were, and one of them mentioned was Samurai Showdown.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And it came up again very recently at the King of Iron Fist 2016 North American Tekken 7 finals.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And asked again, the quote from Harada was more than still talk of the possibility of a collaboration.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000
We would like to buy the rights and make ourselves a new Samurai Showdown title and put the franchise back on the map through our vision.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It's a distant dream, but a dream.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah. How long has it been since the Samurai Showdown game?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Samurai Showdown 5 was the last official one. And I think it was also, if I, I may be wrong, but I think it was also the last official Neo Geo cartridge release.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Interesting. Well, that'd be cool. I think that would be a franchise that would be fun to have come back.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Yeah. I'd be into that. Well, one more story for this little special show this week.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And that has to do with another kind of retro franchise, Super Mario Brothers, specifically number three.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Apparently there was an interview that happened on the Japanese Nintendo website with Takashi Takusa,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:59.000
who actually talked about that Super Mario Brothers 3 originally was going to have an overhead perspective rather than a horizontal one,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
which is kind of the more, the style we're used to. But can you imagine if Super Mario Brothers 3 had been an overhead game?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
That would have been kind of like, like a Zelda type game. That kind of, that would have been very interesting.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:16.000
But apparently the plan actually would work. So in this interview, not only is Tezuka there, but Miyamoto is there too.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And as part of this, Miyamoto said, he said, I want the game to be viewed from a little bit above,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.000
but having a clear indication of where you're going to land after jumping was a key part of the original Super Mario.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Viewing everything from above made it very difficult to tell how far you were from the ground.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
So I told Mr. Tezuka, this will take forever. And Tezuka does a laugh in response and said,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000
in fact, there are still remnants of the top down view in the final game from before we switch to the horizontal view.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And the interviewer calls out the black and white checkered floor and they admit that, yes, that is one of the relics of the overhead view.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And my thought was the overhead map probably came from that too a little bit, but that's just my, you know, thought.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Nothing concrete on that. But it is interesting that all these years later we did get, like, Super Mario 3D World,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000
which is an overhead per se, but it definitely, you know, is a little more like tilted up.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
So that way, you know, but it has the 3D to help lend that perspective to it a little bit.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And obviously the additional processing power that the NES didn't have probably helped fix a lot of those issues.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But I just thought it was really cool that, you know, Super Mario Brothers 3 started out as something completely different

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
and then turned into what it is now, which many would argue is the best Mario game.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Although there's always going to be that Mario Brothers 3 versus Super Mario World debate that we're not doing tonight.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Yes, Star Shocker?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I like Super Mario World.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Yes, I knew it. You couldn't resist.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I'm surprised that this made it to the point where there are assets to be hidden in the actual cart

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
because just listening to how they're describing it, I'm surprised that it...

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I would imagine it pittered out during like the storyboard, like not even a proof of concept.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Like they decided this is too much work. So the fact that they had assets is surprising to me.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Have either of you ever watched Beta64?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Is that like a YouTube thing?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's a YouTube channel.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Yeah, no, I haven't.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Beta64 is actually really cool. It's one of my favorite channels because, you know, I like to dig around and play around in places.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:34.000
But they go through things like E3 coverage, test copies, photos and magazines, and try to reconstruct the design cycle of a game.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Oh, like what it looked like before and how it really ended up.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Interesting. I'd like to see the episode on No Man's Sky.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I don't know that they've done that, but as I recall, I think they did do one for Super Mario World.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000
In fact, I know they did one for Super Mario World, but I'd like to think that they did one on Super Mario Brothers 3, or if not, then it's been requested.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:03.000
But the ones they did on Star Fox 2 was amazing, especially since Star Fox 2 now has been given...

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:12.000
The final release copy is still in the possession of the designer who doesn't have the right to re-release it, but it was finished.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000
And someone's actually gone through and done a finalized version and put it out on, you know, Protocarts.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000
But I mean, I'm just saying as an example, you know, they're pretty resourceful when it comes to finding that type of information.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
So it'd be worth it to see if they've done one.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Yeah, cool.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I'm a big fan of Beta64.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Yeah, I'll have to check that out. I like that type of hidden stuff you weren't supposed to see, vault type stuff.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
There's that one website that has all that type of stuff too, and I can't remember the name for the liveme, like, Forgotten Stuff.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I don't remember what it is.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Doctor Tsuruya posts links from there all the time about new things that are found, like, in games.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
This is where not having a live audience tonight is hurting me, but we'll talk about it maybe on Sunday show.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.000
But yeah, those are, like, it has, like, all the stuff that, you know, they deleted from games and hidden things.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I like that stuff. It's interesting.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Alright, well, we are getting ready to wrap up, but before we do, I mean, usually we would take phone calls at the end of the show,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
but since we're not live tonight, we can't just do that tonight.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
You know, the phone's ringing, Rob.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Hello?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Sit!

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Just imagine if you called, like, DarkTekTsuruya or TigerClaw and is like,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
alright, can you just sit on hold for the next hour, and then they'll be like, I need you to look this up really quick.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Like, we just have to sit on Skype.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
No, you don't get to listen to us record. We're just gonna cut over.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
We should just call one of our people randomly.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
One of our people randomly.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Let's do it!

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Oh, no, I did that once. We did that at an early OLR, and I'll never do it again.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Why?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Because we woke some guy up or something who was in, like, a horrible mood or something, and I swear that guy stopped listening because of it.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Let's call Dan.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
We're not gonna call Dan. We're gonna get to the mailbag.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Fuck.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Every week, you guys email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And DarkSakura enthusiastically jumps into the mailbag and finds some emails to read here.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And you know what? Since she's back this week after, you know, what, like, six weeks not being here, I'm very happy to put her to work.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So DarkSakura, read some emails.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Do your job, DarkSakura.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Okay, I'm... I just caught some keywords in here, but I'm still gonna read it.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So, um, this... I wonder if these are... Okay, never mind.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Because I'm reading them sort of secondhand.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Anyway, um, the first one comes from Robert M.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:52.000
And it says, quick clarification, the Six Flags food service, we were having to wait an hour and a half in line for basic meals.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Still not relevant to this right now.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Oh, that was a follow-up from last week's show, since you weren't here. He had talked about this whole experience, and we were kind of... Okay, anyway.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I suppose the carnival games of old would, in fact, be the redemption games of today.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Note, forgive my use of the term dongless, as opposed to anatomically-inexplicit. It just seemed funnier and more direct.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I've been having serious issues sleeping for the last few weeks, partially from general anxiety, undiagnosed, and partially from excessive caffeine, due to lack of sleep perpetuating the cycle.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And I've been browsing YouTube nearly all night.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Late last night, while browsing Let's Play-type videos, I came across the Rooster Teeth guys looking at a prototype release of a gladiatorial game on the HTC Vive called GORN.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Where the player battles various numbers of cartoonishly muscular naked dongless warriors with fists, flails, shields, swords, bows, and so on.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:13:01.000
The game features a fair amount of blood and dismemberment, with an audience of blocky heads that are clearly from the silly physics-based Wolfenstein 3D game, if you've seen that one.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I'm not really sure if this is the same developer.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Overall, it's very much the vibe of Ridiculous Game presented semi-seriously.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I do see a later build of the prototype gives gladiators armor and basic leather briefs to break away plate mail and helmets.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Wait, so this is nudity and violence we're talking about? Because I'm kind of sold.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
More like no genitalia nudity. It's Ken doll.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And more blood and bruising.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I'm sorry, I'm looking at something. Of course I had to dig up a YouTube. I doubt it's the same one.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
But I'm actually watching somebody play this game and it looks fucking ridiculous.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Are you watching this, Talon?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
It's like a 3D Choniki.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
It's not even that. It just looks...

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
We have a winner. Raise your arms in victory, peasant.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I think you'd laugh at this, Darasaga.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Okay, well let me finish what you mean.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Okay, sorry.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Giving it a slightly more serious feel, even the gladiators still look like a wrestler from Looney Tunes.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I imagine what I've seen in the... Is it the Veve or the... It's the Veve.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
It's the Vive.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Vive. Vive. That's so weird.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
This could be more than a little overwhelming. I encourage you to look up Gorn.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Looks interesting if obviously unfinished.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
That's from Robert M.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Well, yes. By your recommendation, I'm looking at this now.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000
It does look very plain. There's still a lot of fluff that they could put into this.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I really don't know what the audience for this game is.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
If they're going to sell this beyond the WTF factor.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
They need to pad those guys.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
But the WTF factor is very strong with this. So, congrats, I think.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Congrats.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Sorry, they just knocked the guy out. It's funny.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Alright, next email.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
This is so stupid.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Yes, I'm closing this YouTube now.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Hello, LR.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Hello.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Some people might have been confused about the reasons for my email last week.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Especially me since I didn't hear it.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Specifically, my calling out of Shane.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I don't actually dislike Shane.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And in fact, I find him to be quite entertaining.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
But during episode 663 when mailbag had been empty for the second week in a row.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Rob specifically suggested that we write emails ranting about Shane.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I did. I did.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Okay, now it makes sense.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
See, I don't even remember what my ass said a week ago on this very show.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I have to message Dark Soccer on Twitter. Did I do that?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
What episode did that happen on? I can't remember.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I'd be like, bitch, I don't know.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Yeah, I know, right?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
So this was just before the 2-0-2 mark.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
And I happen to be quite good at following directions.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
How are those receipts?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
If you go to episode 663 and check the two hour and two minute mark.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
You said this. This is why I'm fucked.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It's Red Shirt. It's Red Shirt guy for O.L.R.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
This is why I'm fucked when it comes to politics.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Because, you know, somebody's going to dig up some clip of something stupid I said

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
when I was drunk on a particular show.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Or, you know.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
We only have to be extra careful about that with the fur now.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Well, that's neither here nor there.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
But, you know, just in general, I'm really surprised and I shouldn't encourage this.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
But I'm really surprised somebody has a strung together, like a clip of things

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
where like I said something in one episode and then said the exact opposite thing

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
like three weeks later. Because I know it's happened. I'll fully admit.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
But opinions change.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I am sure there's an early episode of O.L.R. where I said

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I don't really like Mass Effect whatsoever.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Like I tried playing Mass Effect and it wasn't very good.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Right? And we all know that my opinion on that changed.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I think that did happen.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I think I did it too.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah, because I remember playing it and I wasn't like super into it.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
But then when I give it...

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And this happens all the time with different types of art.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Like sometimes you'll see a movie a second time and you're like,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Oh, this is... I just must have been in a bad mood when I saw this the first time.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Or music. Huge thing with music, right?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Haven't you ever listened to an album and the first time you were like,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Well, whatever. And the second time you listen to it you're like,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Okay, this is really fucking good.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Okay, get this. I have been...

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
However many decades broken up with this guy,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I still can't watch The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
The Disney movie?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
The Disney movie.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Well, the good news is it's one of the lesser Disney movies.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Yeah, but still.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Yeah, I know.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I saw it in the theater right after.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Yeah.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
With him and other friends.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I mean, he's married. He's got kids. It's all fine.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
But I'm just saying it was just that emotional impact of the moment.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Sure.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It's hard to do it.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Sure.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
There's certain songs that remind me of X's to this day.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I mean, it's just the way it is.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Now at the same time I have certain songs I listen to on repeat because they get me mad.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I actually have one.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Well, what song gets you mad?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Daughters of the Chaos by Luscious Jackson.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Interesting.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It's not my angry song.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
It's my fired up song.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Well, I always tell people if I'm listening to Tori Amos, something's wrong.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Something is really wrong.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
So look out.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Yeah, no, no, no.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
If I bust out the Tori Amos, you need to take me out and feed me because I'm depressed.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
It's intervention.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And food will make it better.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
We'll fill your face with noodles.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Yes.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Noodles always make it better.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Noodles always make it better.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Anyway, I don't know how we got here from YYR's email, but I think it had something

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
to do with how forgetful I am.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
But anyway.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Receipts.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Yes, receipts.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I hope that you guys are recovering from the election.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
No.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
No.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
At least it is over.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
It's not gonna be over.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It seemed like it went on forever.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Which it is.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Which is bad.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Because, yeah, damn right it's bad.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.640
It's this one time I saw it out on TV saying I should call my doctor if I have an election

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.000
lasting more than four hours.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Oh well.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.600
I bet he wrote that email before the election even finished just to make that fucking joke.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:45.600
I bet that's-

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.000
Wednesday, November 9th.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Oh.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Lots of love, Aaron YYR.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.320
No, it's not over.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.800
I am not saying this in jest either.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.800
It's fucking not over.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.880
Put on your hard hats.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.000
Put on your marching boots.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.800
We got work to do.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:11.880
And we got a lot of video games to play to get the fuck all out of it sometimes.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880
Fuck yeah.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880
Anyway.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.840
Why do you think I've been playing so much WoW?

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:22.360
I'm doing the fucking 80 Soul Shard Illidan quest right now.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.440
I'm like, okay, okay.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:28.240
Dear Blizzard Activision assholes.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.720
First of all, happy 12th anniversary of World of Warcraft today.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.120
Thanks for the fun history quiz.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.200
Happy dozen.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.600
They should celebrate with a dozen donuts.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.040
I should celebrate with a dozen donuts.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:47.760
Here all about the 12th anniversary of WoW on the next Horde house.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.880
Coming on the 20th anniversary.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880
Coming never.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880
Coming never.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880
Never say never.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880
Never say never.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.880
Never say never.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:20:03.400
But, this is a really obvious grasp for time because they must have been so ill prepared

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.400
for the patching.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:10.080
They should have just left that quiz, the quiz, quest for when the patch comes out and

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:16.680
just had it be like 40 so you don't have to spend two months farming those pieces.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.320
At least they have it now that you can do it on heroics and not on just mythics.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320
But fuck.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:26.360
There's only so many times I can run Darkheart Thicket.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:32.320
Don't give me a new quest every time I'm done with it to do the same damn thing.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:38.440
But at least there's always something to do unlike Final Fantasy 14.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.880
It's now as funny as I feel the exact opposite.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.000
As I log into WoW and I'm like, I guess I'll pick flowers because I'm kind of not interested

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
in the end game content.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.160
But then I log into Final Fantasy 14 and I'm like, ooh, I've got wondrous tales to do or

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.480
I've got roulettes to run or so it's not going to work with me.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.720
I think it just depends on what you're into.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:58.720
Coke or Pepsi.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.720
All right.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:00.720
Anyway.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.120
But you still have to go run things with me.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:09.080
I've got four more days to do it and thus I get thirty thousand gold in the next four

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.080
days.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.080
We'll see.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.080
I'll give you 20.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.520
That's you should buy your own month with that.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.340
I have like one hundred and twenty, one hundred twenty thousand.

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:17.340
My God.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.640
How are you making money in that game?

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640
Starlight Rose.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:23.680
Oh, is that really what they sell for like three hundred a pop.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680
OK.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.680
One sells for three.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.920
Yeah, no, I was trying to gather that was trying to do that in the fell fell something

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:33.280
that I'll work is the daily sells pretty well to sell where it's not quite a daily, but

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.840
you get like a seed to plant and you can grow more.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.520
No, you can collect like one a day somewhere.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.720
I sell the seeds.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.160
You make a ton of money off those.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.720
Just make a ton of money off the plant to you.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720
Yes, that's true.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720
All right.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.800
Anyway, I think I think those go for like six hundred a pop.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.800
So anyway.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960
All right.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.840
Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.360
I hope you enjoyed this special, shorter, but still fun episode number six hundred sixty

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.360
five.

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.040
I want to thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to the show tonight.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.240
If you like what you heard, please tell a friend or five about the show.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.240
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:12.400
if the voices are here to use them and the voices will be back live this Sunday with

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.300
episode number 666.

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.300
We made it, Jamie.

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:16.300
We have a treat.

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:17.300
We made it.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.300
I know I'm excited.

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.780
We've taken off the podcast because it sounds different.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:22.780
Yes.

01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:24.540
There's gonna be a lot different next week.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.100
Devil's food cake in the studio, hopefully.

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.100
Oh my God.

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.100
That's what I want.

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.100
That's how we celebrate.

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.100
You know what we're talking about.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:31.340
What are we going to do for episode 66?

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.700
We eat devil's food cake.

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:33.700
There's the celebration.

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:34.700
I love it.

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.180
I'm down for that.

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:40.020
I got the day off, OK?

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.020
That's great.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.020
It is great.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.300
Y'all should come to the bar with me like the night before.

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:47.300
Should I cancel the order then for the three live chickens because I figured we'd just

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.420
kill them.

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:51.220
That was every D&D game every week.

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.580
I've got that down to a science.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:53.580
All right.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:59.720
Anyway, no, no, we don't need the live chickens, but we do need chicken strips.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.780
Just saying we do need chicken strips.

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:03.740
Anyway, that's going to do it.

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:07.780
A nice five star review, of course, on a site like iTunes or Google, wherever you found

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.980
this show is going to go a long way as well.

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.620
Before we wrap up, of course, we have to get everybody's final thought.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.780
Alan, thank you for filling in, even though it was a shorter show tonight, but it was

01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.940
great to have you back on the show.

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.100
And I say that because I'm completely biased.

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:20.100
Yeah.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.520
So thanks for having me.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520
You're welcome.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.660
But, you know, you can kind of invite yourself on whenever you want.

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:25.660
Oh, I do.

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:27.980
I'll just walk up and snatch the mic out of your hand.

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:30.220
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.220
I like pizza.

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:32.220
I'm going to make a pizza.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:33.220
Sounds good.

01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:34.220
P as easy.

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:36.220
I was saying that.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.220
All right.

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:44.520
Anyway, my final thought tonight is I'm excited for Pokemon this weekend and the Overwatch

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.800
free weekend and lots of games ahead.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800
Yay.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800
Yay games.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.560
And Dark Soccer, last but not least.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.720
And you'll be here next week.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.400
You get two Jamie shows in a row.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.800
And then we're only going to lose you for what, like two more weeks and you're back

01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.800
full time, right?

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.600
Like December 10th or something was your first show back?

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.600
11th?

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.600
Something like that?

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.600
No, it's the 18th.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.600
Oh, okay.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.600
So maybe three weeks.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.600
Yeah.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.600
All right.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.600
But something like that.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:10.600
But you'll be back full time soon.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:11.600
Yeah.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.600
But in the meantime, give us a really good final thought.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.600
I got to pee.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.160
I guess that's what we get.

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.160
Anyway.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.480
Thank you guys very much for listening to the show.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.320
We'll be back live on Sunday.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.320
Good night.
