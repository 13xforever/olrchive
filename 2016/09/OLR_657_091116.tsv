27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	35000	and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	37000	where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	It is Orange Lounge Radio
39000	42000	Live tonight, episode number 657
42000	46000	for this September the 11th of 2016
46000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts joining you here in Studio N7
50000	52000	in Sacramento, California
52000	54000	Here with you over the next few hours to talk about
54000	57000	video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
57000	61000	and with me in studio, as he always is, say hello to Techmaster Loki
61000	62000	Hi
62000	63000	Hi Loki, how are you doing?
63000	64000	I'm alright
64000	66000	Happy birthday! Today is your birthday
66000	67000	Thank you
67000	72000	I know there's other historical events weighing heavy on people's minds today for good reason
72000	76000	and you know, obviously our thoughts go out to those that are affected all these years later
76000	81000	but, you know, things go on and we still do our podcast
81000	83000	and you still celebrate birthdays
83000	84000	which is today
84000	85000	Yeah
85000	87000	And what did you do to celebrate? How was your day?
87000	89000	Well, I...
89000	92000	This does not sound like a happy birthday
92000	94000	I'd like to say I did something fun
94000	97000	but it really was just the wife was stressed out about the kids all day long
97000	102000	so she was in a really fantastic mood this morning
102000	104000	so I went out and got breakfast for her
104000	107000	and then we went grocery shopping
107000	109000	and the kids were just acting up like they usually do
109000	113000	and then we bought stuff to make food
113000	116000	she wanted me to make salmon wellingtons
116000	118000	so I made salmon wellingtons
118000	124000	and then she didn't want to buy, this week for some reason, the frozen macaroni
124000	128000	or not macaroni cheese, spaghetti and meat sauce for our kids
128000	129000	because it has MSG in it
129000	133000	so I also had to make spaghetti with a meat sauce
133000	136000	for two hours standing up, didn't eat lunch
136000	140000	felt like shit until I had some cereal
140000	142000	so I wouldn't pass out from stress
142000	144000	which we'll get into in a little bit
144000	146000	why I'm so fucking stressed
146000	147000	and then...
147000	149000	Don't worry about this, alright
149000	151000	I mean, I guess we could talk about it now, why not?
151000	155000	Why not? Let's talk briefly about why are you so stressed out?
155000	156000	Do you need a hug?
156000	158000	Yes, so here's what happened
158000	159000	Yes, you need a hug?
159000	160000	No
160000	161000	What happened?
161000	164000	So, obviously it's my birthday today
164000	167000	and so I typically every year
167000	169000	because I'm weird like this
169000	171000	I buy myself something for my birthday
171000	172000	Why not?
172000	174000	Because everybody else is the excuse
174000	176000	I don't know what they get you, you know, whatever
176000	177000	so that's fine
177000	180000	I get myself awesome birthday presents
180000	182000	I treat myself the way I deserve to be treated
182000	183000	Exactly
183000	184000	My friends are very generous too
184000	185000	but I know I'm gonna buy myself something
185000	186000	And just on a whim
186000	188000	and I don't even know what prompted it
188000	190000	it was just like I was at work one day and I was on a whim
190000	191000	and I was like, you know
191000	196000	I haven't checked eBay in a while
196000	201000	because I used to go on eBay and I used to go look at DDR stuff
201000	203000	just for the hell of it
203000	204000	Okay
204000	207000	And this is where it started
207000	212000	So in Rancho Cordova there was a guy selling a TechnoMotion machine
212000	215000	for $99 starting
215000	218000	and I was like, holy shit
218000	221000	I'm never gonna be able to find something this perfect
221000	224000	I feel like I already know the punchline that's coming
224000	225000	and I'm really worried
225000	226000	Go ahead
226000	227000	No, it gets worse
227000	228000	Oh, it gets worse
228000	230000	I'm already upset about it
230000	233000	So anyways, the whole week I'm stressing out
233000	236000	I'm like, oh, I can't possibly do this
236000	239000	My wife would kill me if I got this
239000	240000	There's no way
240000	243000	So we were just at Best Buy yesterday
243000	244000	because we went out to dinner
244000	247000	because we have to kill time because the kids are there
247000	250000	and she's like, well, let's go get you something at Best Buy
250000	253000	I'm like, okay, we'll go walk around, look at stuff
253000	256000	and I didn't know what I really wanted, so whatever
256000	259000	and so I brought up, I'm like, well, you know
259000	263000	it'd be cool if I could get this, this cabinet
263000	264000	I mean, it's really huge
264000	270000	and she's constantly complaining, stressed out about how our house is a mess
270000	272000	because there's just clutter everywhere
272000	274000	which happens when you have kids, but yeah
274000	276000	and she wants to get rid of it
276000	280000	and I've already set up to throw away some of that
280000	282000	but I still wanted this cabinet and stuff
282000	284000	so earlier today I was talking with her about it
284000	294000	and I'm like, at that point it was up to, I think, 102.50 or something like that
294000	297000	or no, 205 is what it was sitting at
297000	299000	and it was sitting at that for a few days
299000	301000	and so I was like, okay
301000	305000	so I gotta run this by the wife and see if I can get an okay
305000	307000	and if it's okay, maybe I'll try, you know, bidding on it
307000	314000	so reluctantly after, you know, she's very not happy with this idea
314000	318000	she's like, fine, whatever, just do whatever you want
318000	321000	and so, and then she finally kind of warmed up to it a little bit
321000	325000	after she was like, you know, once she got in the car and drove away with the kids
325000	328000	so I got basically the green light to go ahead and bid on this
328000	333000	and I was gonna basically cap it at about $300
333000	337000	I may have gone a little higher than that just to see if I could, you know, get it
337000	340000	so I'm getting everything ready
340000	343000	I've got my computer up on the eBay page, ready to go
343000	345000	and I'm putting away clothes and stuff
345000	348000	and I'm watching the clock and the clock in our room's not right
348000	351000	so it's about three minutes before I need to get there
351000	353000	so I'm going to the living room
353000	359000	I notice the clock in the kitchen says it's one minute before, not three minutes before
359000	362000	I look at my computer, it's 30 seconds before the auction ends
362000	367000	so it's like, oh shit, put in my bid, highest bidder
367000	370000	but the problem was I put it in about 10 seconds too early
370000	372000	I got outbid
372000	375000	so I had it for $250
375000	377000	I had it for $250 for 10 seconds
377000	381000	and then I got outbid and if I only fucking waited a few more seconds
381000	384000	I would have had a fucking DDR machine
384000	385000	whatever
385000	386000	well sorry to hear it
386000	387000	it's so frustrating though
388000	390000	I always thought eBay worked
390000	393000	like you're supposed to put in the most you're going to pay anyway
393000	396000	no, it's bid sniping, it's always bid sniping
396000	398000	you always got to bid snipe
398000	400000	I decided to shop eBay
400000	401000	I remember doing eBay
401000	403000	but it was so perfect, like it was cheap
403000	405000	I bought a copy of Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo
405000	407000	it was cheap and it was fucking local
407000	409000	like cheap and local and it was a Technomotion machine
409000	412000	and the screen, the monitor didn't work on it
412000	415000	or it may have not worked, something didn't work
415000	417000	like the hardware for the Technomotion didn't work
417000	419000	but it's a fucking seller on PC
419000	421000	is basically what Technomotion is
421000	423000	it's a seller on PC with an old ass video card
423000	425000	I'm like, that's fucking perfect
425000	427000	just rip it out, throw a new PC in there
427000	428000	step mania done
428000	430000	and then you know, fix up the pads
430000	432000	you know, possibly put metal over the other pads
432000	434000	or you know, we're golden
435000	437000	it just wasn't to be, unfortunately
437000	439000	and it would have been so fucking perfect
439000	442000	but I was so stressed out because I had to talk to my wife about it
442000	444000	and it's, you know, a big auction lady
444000	446000	and it's so stressed out
446000	448000	but now, okay, so you lost this one
448000	450000	okay, caeser-a-ser-a
450000	453000	but now, like, don't you kind of have like this pass
453000	455000	like, don't you get to put that card in your pocket
455000	457000	like, hey honey, remember when you said I could get the machine
457000	459000	no, it doesn't work that way
459000	460000	it doesn't work that way at all
460000	462000	but it's fine, you know, because like
462000	465000	you know, we're throwing away stuff in the garage
465000	467000	and I gotta move my arcade cabinet out there anyways
467000	469000	because, you know, the kids
469000	471000	and originally I wanted to like set up
471000	473000	you know, dance pads with it
473000	475000	but it would have been so perfect not having to build
475000	477000	because it was the same price to build those pads
477000	479000	as it is to buy a whole fucking machine
479000	481000	so, it's like
481000	483000	you know, why not
483000	485000	I mean, I wouldn't have picked Technomotion as my first choice
485000	487000	but
487000	489000	whatever, it's basically DDR machines
489000	491000	some folks in our chat
491000	493000	let me, of course, formally introduce the chat room
493000	495000	hello chatters, and you can chat along with our show live
495000	497000	we do tape live every Sunday night
497000	499000	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
499000	501000	live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
501000	503000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
503000	505000	and if you are listening live
505000	507000	participating with our show, you can join our chat
507000	509000	over at live.vognetwork.com
509000	511000	so, real quick
511000	513000	so I, here's what it actually went for
513000	515000	so I bid $350
515000	517000	even though we agreed on $300, I still wanted to have a margin
517000	519000	okay, because some folks wanted to know
519000	521000	what does a little higher mean, so
521000	523000	and I really should have counterbid
523000	525000	but who knows if I would even want it
525000	527000	it went for $366
527000	529000	it's still not that much
529000	531000	no, it's not
531000	533000	but whatever, I mean
533000	535000	it's techno motion though
535000	537000	it's a copy of a copy
537000	539000	but it doesn't matter, I wanted it for the hardware
539000	541000	I don't give a shit about that
541000	543000	you deserve a prime DDR machine
543000	545000	you deserve something legit
545000	547000	I didn't, I mean, it's basically
547000	549000	the pads are exactly the same, you just
549000	551000	cover up the other
551000	553000	the other buttons
553000	555000	Tech 2030 in our chat wants to know a little more
555000	557000	if eBay automatically lets the highest bidder win
557000	559000	at the end of the auction
559000	561000	how do you still snipe people?
561000	563000	because what it is, is you put in basically
563000	565000	say
565000	567000	say someone wants to pay
567000	569000	$250 for something
569000	571000	and yes, you could think, okay
571000	573000	$250 is all I can pay, you know, here's what I'm going to put in
573000	575000	but
575000	577000	you know,
577000	579000	I would have paid
579000	581000	a few extra, if I knew it was going to go for $366
581000	583000	I would put $367 in
583000	585000	I mean, obviously, that's what it would have done
585000	587000	and so, it would have stated that
587000	589000	because, see, the problem was he had
589000	591000	the person that had time to respond
591000	593000	to, he saw I got outbid, and he had
593000	595000	time to put in another bid
595000	597000	the trick, when an early bid on that stuff, is you wait
597000	599000	until like, there's 10 seconds left
599000	601000	and there's no time, you, if you're lucky
601000	603000	enough to be high enough, then you get it
603000	605000	and there's no time for them to react
605000	607000	it's all some damn psychological game
607000	609000	you guys turned it into something way sicker
609000	611000	but that's how you
611000	613000	get stuff for cheaper though, because
613000	615000	if you just put in, I want to pay $250
615000	617000	for it, then it's going to sit at $250
617000	619000	and someone's just going to pay $250
619000	621000	but it's all psychological, because you're like
621000	623000	$250 is the most I'm willing to pay
623000	625000	but then when you see somebody, some little fucker snipes you
625000	627000	and gets $251, then you're like
627000	629000	well shit, I'd pay $252
629000	631000	so, aha, $250 isn't the most
631000	633000	you'd pay, you're actually willing to pay more
633000	635000	that's the psychological game
635000	637000	is, how much are you
637000	639000	willing to pay for this shit
639000	641000	is, how much are you really willing to pay for this
641000	643000	it's a sick game
643000	645000	it is, but see, I'm out of practice
645000	647000	it's been several, it's been at least a couple
647000	649000	of years since I've actually bit sniped somebody
649000	651000	and I was panicked because
651000	653000	I almost missed it, because I was putting away clothes
653000	655000	from the laundry
655000	657000	and I was like, shit, there's like 28 seconds
657000	659000	left, I'm like holy fuck, I'm glad
659000	661000	I got you here in time, I just like
661000	663000	I put stuff in and I was like, worried
663000	665000	because sometimes you put in a bid, they're like
665000	667000	oh, please sign back in again, you know, because
667000	669000	make sure that you're signed in
669000	671000	or some shit, and you know, if that
671000	673000	comes in there with 10 seconds left, it could fuck you
673000	675000	with, you know, not being able to actually place a bid
675000	677000	I do want to introduce our guest
677000	679000	who's been sitting here very patiently listening
679000	681000	to the horrors of your
681000	683000	eBay day, but I do
683000	685000	want to quickly acknowledge some folks may have
685000	687000	forgot, where's DarkSakura?
687000	689000	Remember DarkSakura, this is her first
689000	691000	week of her hiatus from the show, she will
691000	693000	be gone from the show for a couple of months
693000	695000	due to an arrangement
695000	697000	with her day job, she's just unable to
697000	699000	make the show for a couple of months, however
699000	701000	we will be hearing her a little later on
701000	703000	during the Classic Game of the Week through the Magic Radio
703000	705000	she will still be joining us every week for that
705000	707000	and she did confirm to me this week
707000	709000	she got November 20th off
709000	711000	so she can be here for episode 666
711000	713000	so at least she's making sure that the important
713000	715000	stuff is covered, so
715000	717000	yeah, that's, literally, hell yeah
717000	719000	so, anyway
719000	721000	meanwhile, we
721000	723000	have a guest here in studio with us and it's
723000	725000	a friend of the show who's been here a couple of times before
725000	727000	but we're really excited to welcome him back, it's always
727000	729000	a good time to welcome to the show
729000	731000	Gabe from Nascent Games
731000	733000	creators of Crumple
733000	735000	Kinship and whatever
735000	737000	other projects this man takes on
737000	739000	because he does games like I do podcasts
739000	741000	and also
741000	743000	involved with Sacramento
743000	745000	IGDA, what's your role with
745000	747000	SACIGDA? I'm the founder and chair of
747000	749000	IGDA, you're the Grand Pooba
749000	751000	basically, you are
751000	753000	you are SACIGDA
753000	755000	so I put it like
755000	757000	I'm the face of
757000	759000	IGDA Sacramento and then I have my
759000	761000	vice chair of Brianna who's the
761000	763000	voice of IGDA
763000	765000	Sacramento because she's the vice chair
765000	767000	that's a very good way of putting it because I know Brianna works her little
767000	769000	fanny off for IGDA, she does
769000	771000	great work, and hello Brianna
771000	773000	if you're listening out there
773000	775000	so I definitely want to talk to you a little
775000	777000	bit about what's going on with Nascent Games and Crumple
777000	779000	and all that, we're going to get to our kickoff topic
779000	781000	first, I'm sure you have some things to say about this
781000	783000	as well, one or two
783000	785000	Loki, let's talk about
785000	787000	what Sony unveiled this week in our kickoff topic
787000	789000	so Sony had their little
789000	791000	press conference if you will
791000	793000	they unveiled basically
793000	795000	hey, you know that Playstation Slim
795000	797000	that came out, or that got leaked out and had
797000	799000	reviewed and all that stuff, yeah it's real
799000	801000	basically going to be replacing
801000	803000	the Playstation 4 that's
803000	805000	available now
805000	807000	and I want to say that it was
807000	809000	$2.99, and then
809000	811000	they've got the
811000	813000	Playstation Pro
813000	815000	which is basically their
815000	817000	Playstation Neo, it's what they're calling it now
817000	819000	it's sponsored by GameStop
819000	821000	well
821000	823000	is it?
823000	825000	no, because that's just the first
825000	827000	thing I thought of when they announced that
827000	829000	would you like a Pro card instead?
829000	831000	that's a page out of
831000	833000	Microsoft's playbook right there
833000	835000	the Xbox Elite
835000	837000	and the Xbox Pro system
837000	839000	everything is Pro
839000	841000	I'm okay with the name
841000	843000	I didn't think it was actually going to be called Neo
843000	845000	it's basically $3.99
845000	847000	it's more powerful
847000	849000	it will do
849000	851000	output to 4K
851000	853000	not natively
853000	855000	up res stuff, but it will be
855000	857000	better looking than
857000	859000	the other stuff is now
859000	861000	and will supposedly
861000	863000	help enhance
863000	865000	VR
865000	867000	and stuff like that
867000	869000	not even you can say it in a complete
869000	871000	sentence without just
871000	873000	foaming at the mouth
873000	875000	and that's precisely how Sony sounded
875000	877000	because not even they can be like
877000	879000	they just used a bunch of technobabble
879000	881000	no one gave a shit about it
881000	883000	it's just like
883000	885000	talking about
885000	887000	all this stuff and how they're gonna
887000	889000	maybe at the end of the day it's like
889000	891000	how much better are these games gonna look
891000	893000	and a lot of these games are gonna be supporting
893000	895000	these enhancements including
895000	897000	starting off with Call of Duty for third party
897000	899000	Call of Duty
899000	901000	and even Black Ops 3 that came out last year
901000	903000	will get a patch to support
903000	905000	the higher resolution
905000	907000	gameplay
907000	909000	but will they be free?
909000	911000	yes
911000	913000	I heard that some publishers
913000	915000	are gonna be free
915000	917000	there's a story out there somewhere
917000	919000	that Sony's saying
919000	921000	that publishers can essentially set
921000	923000	whatever price they want for it
923000	925000	no they retracted that
925000	927000	oh okay well that's good
927000	929000	I think the first company to do it would have gotten
929000	931000	a lot of internet BS
931000	933000	yeah I can see them doing that
933000	935000	so it's gonna be something
935000	937000	that's gonna be available
937000	939000	coming out in October
939000	941000	and
941000	943000	I'm not really interested in picking it up
943000	945000	because I have a system
945000	947000	already and I don't
947000	949000	have a 4K TV although I did look at 4K TVs
949000	951000	yesterday because I was at Best Buy
951000	953000	and there's some pretty nice 4K TVs that aren't too expensive
953000	955000	so
955000	957000	you know what caught my eye amongst that whole
957000	959000	press conference was the fact that they actually
959000	961000	showed the first Mass Effect Andromeda
961000	963000	like in-game footage and so
963000	965000	that definitely had me laying on the couch
965000	967000	going awwww
967000	969000	I didn't know what any of it meant
969000	971000	it didn't look interesting at all
971000	973000	I was living for it
973000	975000	every minute I was very happy
975000	977000	it's very pretty
977000	979000	oh my god and they're purposely obscuring
979000	981000	some of the characters and so forth
981000	983000	but I thought it looked great and so
983000	985000	I'm certainly sitting there going okay
985000	987000	well if Andromeda
987000	989000	is gonna look better
989000	991000	on a pro
991000	993000	maybe I do need to get a PlayStation 4
993000	995000	pro but now
995000	997000	here's where I'm stuck now is because
997000	999000	okay yes
999000	1001000	these games like Final Fantasy 15 even
1001000	1003000	I think they showed in the sizzle footage
1003000	1005000	a lot of games coming up that people are
1005000	1007000	very hyped for that will supposedly look
1007000	1009000	better on the pro but then I worry
1009000	1011000	my television even though I bought it
1011000	1013000	last year as a 2014
1013000	1015000	model it doesn't do 4K
1015000	1017000	and I don't think it does this
1017000	1019000	other coloring stuff they were talking about
1019000	1021000	so am I gonna get any benefit
1021000	1023000	from the PlayStation Pro
1023000	1025000	and I kind of feel like that message
1025000	1027000	was garbled like I
1027000	1029000	know they said oh yes conventional
1029000	1031000	TVs will also see a benefit
1031000	1033000	because down sampling
1033000	1035000	I think is what they're talking about
1035000	1037000	basically it's gonna be a little bit clearer of a picture
1037000	1039000	but is that really
1039000	1041000	worth selling your system and buying another
1041000	1043000	system for $100 more?
1043000	1045000	No it's not and honestly
1045000	1047000	cause it's not just the system it's the
1047000	1049000	TV too you gotta get a TV
1049000	1051000	and that's gonna
1051000	1053000	display that kind of content
1053000	1055000	and there just isn't sufficient content
1055000	1057000	right now period other than Netflix
1057000	1059000	but even the discs
1059000	1061000	it won't play 4K Blu-ray disc
1061000	1063000	which was the dumbest
1063000	1065000	thing ever because Sony came up with
1065000	1067000	Blu-ray and they're the
1067000	1069000	ones and oh yeah we beat HD DVD
1069000	1071000	but now here you are coming out
1071000	1073000	with PlayStation 4.5
1073000	1075000	instead of waiting like you should
1075000	1077000	and they just
1077000	1079000	they put the limitation
1079000	1081000	on their own format
1081000	1083000	which is ridiculous
1083000	1085000	for them to have left
1085000	1087000	the door open for Microsoft
1087000	1089000	to be able to say hey our
1089000	1091000	entry level Xbox One S system
1091000	1093000	will do that that was a
1093000	1095000	real faux pas
1095000	1097000	Microsoft jumped
1097000	1099000	on that like I mean they jumped on
1099000	1101000	that it was that was hilarious
1101000	1103000	yeah not this in particular
1103000	1105000	but there's other things that have really gotten me
1105000	1107000	like pro Microsoft camp now
1107000	1109000	mainly one thing
1109000	1111000	and we'll get to that later but
1111000	1113000	there's one thing I'm like really
1113000	1115000	you can't do this like this bullshit
1115000	1117000	you can't fucking handle this
1117000	1119000	Microsoft can do this no problem
1119000	1121000	but Sony oh poor Sony can't fucking
1121000	1123000	handle this shit and on top of
1123000	1125000	like all this other nonsense
1125000	1127000	I'm like maybe I should get an Xbox One
1127000	1129000	then I can get this game on there instead
1129000	1131000	because I would be purchasing all my games
1131000	1133000	on Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4
1133000	1135000	with their multi-platform you know we asked our
1135000	1137000	users on Facebook in our community
1137000	1139000	over at Facebook.com slash Orange
1139000	1141000	Lounge Radio about the PlayStation 4 Pro
1141000	1143000	and here's some of the responses we got from our listeners
1143000	1145000	about what they feel about
1145000	1147000	this whole you know press
1147000	1149000	conference and if they want a PlayStation 4
1149000	1151000	Pro or not our pal Critical Myth
1151000	1153000	said it's not clear to me what the benefit
1153000	1155000	of this console would be versus the
1155000	1157000	existing PlayStation 4 they have a
1157000	1159000	long way to go before I'm sold on the
1159000	1161000	need for it you know I'm kind of in a similar
1161000	1163000	spot with that because
1163000	1165000	what really got me was when
1165000	1167000	I went back to go watch the
1167000	1169000	Mass Effect footage on YouTube
1169000	1171000	or whatever it actually
1171000	1173000	the president of BioWare or whoever
1173000	1175000	it was sorry I forget who it was in the video actually
1175000	1177000	said if you're not on a 4K
1177000	1179000	TV to see this
1179000	1181000	go to one and
1181000	1183000	replay this or you know it's kind of like
1183000	1185000	stop now and go to a 4K TV and I'm
1185000	1187000	sitting here like oh okay
1187000	1189000	let me just run to Best Buy and get one
1189000	1191000	yeah let me just drop eight nine hundred
1191000	1193000	thousand dollars you know because that's you know
1193000	1195000	because you know you're the one percent
1195000	1197000	so thank you in a weird way
1197000	1199000	actually have them down about like four
1199000	1201000	dollars yeah I kind of feel like if you bought a TV
1201000	1203000	in the past maybe two years
1203000	1205000	that was one of the past two years model you
1205000	1207000	probably got I mean TVs are
1207000	1209000	getting more reasonable yeah I'm surprised how
1209000	1211000	cheap they were I mean they had those
1211000	1213000	all did HDR and all that stuff but even
1213000	1215000	I'm not gonna go drop a grand on a new TV
1215000	1217000	just for this right and so
1217000	1219000	you know and honestly I think it was
1219000	1221000	that more than anything for
1221000	1223000	me that said
1223000	1225000	maybe I don't need this PlayStation
1225000	1227000	Pro because I'm not gonna drop the money
1227000	1229000	on a 4K TV then this guy is
1229000	1231000	actually saying I'm gonna need one to
1231000	1233000	see the difference
1233000	1235000	so is Andromeda coming out whether
1235000	1237000	that was the message Sony wanted to convey
1237000	1239000	or not I'm sorry but that dude from BioWare
1239000	1241000	that's how he phrased it Andromeda coming out on
1241000	1243000	PC it is
1243000	1245000	and don't don't think
1245000	1247000	I haven't thought that exactly I need to
1247000	1249000	go to that's like my thing right there
1249000	1251000	like I actually started thinking about like
1251000	1253000	why do I have a PlayStation 4
1253000	1255000	is it because of you know Sony
1255000	1257000	first party exclusives that were like I
1257000	1259000	was really interested in and I started thinking
1259000	1261000	what Sony first party exclusives do I have
1261000	1263000	that was really interested in oh no man
1263000	1265000	sky well that came out of fucking PC anyways
1265000	1267000	so
1267000	1269000	ah infamous
1269000	1271000	yeah that wasn't very good
1271000	1273000	um
1273000	1275000	nope don't have anything so
1275000	1277000	I was like well
1277000	1279000	why I forgot a war
1279000	1281000	got a war is alright but
1281000	1283000	you don't buy a system for one game
1283000	1285000	Zelda so
1285000	1287000	I don't know we'll have to see
1287000	1289000	let me get through a couple other
1289000	1291000	comments on this from Facebook
1291000	1293000	some different perspectives here Tiger
1293000	1295000	Claude said I currently own the regular
1295000	1297000	PlayStation 4 and don't have a 4K TV
1297000	1299000	so I don't need it however
1299000	1301000	I heard that the PS4 Pro does not
1301000	1303000	support 4K Blu-ray media
1303000	1305000	so it's going to be a deal breaker for those who
1305000	1307000	want to watch their 4K Blu-ray disc
1307000	1309000	on the 4K TVs
1309000	1311000	Degenerate Johnny had a very similar response
1311000	1313000	to that talking about that 4K
1313000	1315000	digital content from Netflix and Hulu but
1315000	1317000	not physical content from 4K
1317000	1319000	Blu-ray you know
1319000	1321000	wasn't Microsoft placed in the hot seat years
1321000	1323000	ago for doing something similar favoring
1323000	1325000	digital content over physical content
1325000	1327000	digital content's all good and stuff if you
1327000	1329000	have the fucking bandwidth to do it
1329000	1331000	yeah and we've already hearing what
1331000	1333000	you know we hear what um
1333000	1335000	our home IPs you know the
1335000	1337000	ISPs are doing like Comcast and stuff
1337000	1339000	they're putting a cap
1339000	1341000	on bandwidth
1341000	1343000	you know on a monthly basis already too
1343000	1345000	so what's you know so now we
1345000	1347000	so now we run into this
1347000	1349000	conundrum of you know
1349000	1351000	this rapid fire advancement
1351000	1353000	in technology and
1353000	1355000	and clarity in gaming and
1355000	1357000	movies but now you've got you know
1357000	1359000	the ISP saying well
1359000	1361000	we're only going to let you enjoy it for a limited
1361000	1363000	amount of bandwidth before we kind of start capping
1363000	1365000	you so we're running
1365000	1367000	into a problem here so it's like
1367000	1369000	yeah it you know so
1369000	1371000	we've become so obsessed and dependent on
1371000	1373000	the streaming aspect of it you know
1373000	1375000	um yeah
1375000	1377000	but here we are you know
1377000	1379000	you know questioning are we
1379000	1381000	willing to drop another four hundred dollars
1381000	1383000	on essentially minuscule
1383000	1385000	upgrades well and then there's this thing
1385000	1387000	about one more one more response from Facebook
1387000	1389000	um Andy Ard said since I don't have
1389000	1391000	a 4K TV I don't see too much
1391000	1393000	of a reason to get one sure we'll have some
1393000	1395000	improvements for 1080 TVs but not
1395000	1397000	enough in my opinion plus I'd
1397000	1399000	rather get PlayStation VR this
1399000	1401000	fall and I don't have the funds to drop
1401000	1403000	on two four hundred dollar boxes
1403000	1405000	and that for me puts the nail
1405000	1407000	in the coffin of why I think this it's
1407000	1409000	this was not the right time well here's
1409000	1411000	the other thing too now it has been wondering
1411000	1413000	how well is this running on
1413000	1415000	how well is PlayStation VR running on the
1415000	1417000	regular PlayStation 4 I
1417000	1419000	don't know yet well like how
1419000	1421000	what they're demoing it and best buys
1421000	1423000	on a regular yes I know I got there a few
1423000	1425000	minutes too late yesterday so
1425000	1427000	I was like oh hey oh
1427000	1429000	man yeah but I
1429000	1431000	mean I think for the most part I
1431000	1433000	feel like I actually feel okay
1433000	1435000	that the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to
1435000	1437000	support the VR stuff okay
1437000	1439000	but um you know I think that's a very
1439000	1441000	good point is that Sony's putting out
1441000	1443000	two new four hundred dollar products
1443000	1445000	this year and I'm not sure that's the
1445000	1447000	brightest thing to do especially
1447000	1449000	when it seems too early for this
1449000	1451000	4K thing exactly and Microsoft's
1451000	1453000	coming out with theirs probably I'd say next fall
1453000	1455000	so
1455000	1457000	already I mean technology is going
1457000	1459000	to be so much better like or at least
1459000	1461000	cheaper than what they've got there
1461000	1463000	and they can put out a system that's more
1463000	1465000	powerful same price
1465000	1467000	when actually more people have content
1467000	1469000	and like the devices actually
1469000	1471000	watch this stuff on I just don't
1471000	1473000	I it's too damn early
1473000	1475000	it's like when they try to push that fucking 3D
1475000	1477000	TV shit they actually had hey look
1477000	1479000	it's the PlayStation TV and it's
1479000	1481000	you know got fucking 3D
1481000	1483000	you know TV and something it's a
1483000	1485000	shitty
1485000	1487000	small TV that did their 3D
1487000	1489000	stuff and then they're like ah
1489000	1491000	fuck 3D you know VR
1491000	1493000	but do you want to hear the hilarious part of this
1493000	1495000	I pre-ordered one on
1495000	1497000	Amazon anyway you can because
1497000	1499000	as you said
1499000	1501000	you can just go on there and click
1501000	1503000	pre-order I don't have to give them any money or commitment
1503000	1505000	or anything and I can go in and cancel
1505000	1507000	if I change my mind which I
1507000	1509000	kind of think I'm going to do but Sony
1509000	1511000	has 30 months to make
1511000	1513000	me change my or 30 months 30 days or so
1513000	1515000	to make me change my mind I just
1515000	1517000	I still maybe change my mind on PlayStation
1517000	1519000	VR yeah because the more I think
1519000	1521000	about it I'm like what am I really getting
1521000	1523000	out of this and I'm kind of wondering
1523000	1525000	maybe if I should just wait and see
1525000	1527000	if
1527000	1529000	there's something if they're going to you know handle
1529000	1531000	this like they did 3D
1531000	1533000	I was hoping to hear a little
1533000	1535000	more you know a lot of folks had said that this
1535000	1537000	PlayStation conference they did this week felt
1537000	1539000	very short and I was surprised
1539000	1541000	they didn't talk more about VR
1541000	1543000	considering that is coming out in a
1543000	1545000	month you know
1545000	1547000	obviously they talked about it in conjunction
1547000	1549000	with the pro but they didn't really
1549000	1551000	talk a lot about that kind of
1551000	1553000	surprised me how is it better though is it just
1553000	1555000	you know a higher frame rate and even still
1555000	1557000	it's like that's kind of
1557000	1559000	lame I think it's the same sort of
1559000	1561000	textures improved and you know
1561000	1563000	those sorts of like I don't
1563000	1565000	understand why I would drop that kind of
1565000	1567000	money for that I just
1567000	1569000	I don't know it's just
1569000	1571000	that's all you've got
1571000	1573000	for me is that your games aren't
1573000	1575000	that innovative it's just it's slightly
1575000	1577000	prettier it's going to look much
1577000	1579000	brighter you're going to be able to see the details
1579000	1581000	but that's on any system though HDR
1581000	1583000	is going to be supported you know
1583000	1585000	on anything but
1585000	1587000	we'll get into that a little bit later but I'm just
1587000	1589000	saying what's the point in dropping money for
1589000	1591000	this pro thing because you're not going to
1591000	1593000	I don't know I don't really think there's any
1593000	1595000	immediate
1595000	1597000	needs for that and look at the titles
1597000	1599000	that are going to support it yeah Call of Duty
1599000	1601000	is going to support it but is it everything out of the
1601000	1603000	gate I mean how many titles are going to be supporting
1603000	1605000	this right away and not everybody
1605000	1607000	has to support it
1607000	1609000	I'm really curious what's going to happen
1609000	1611000	for those households that don't have
1611000	1613000	PlayStation 4s at all right now because
1613000	1615000	I mean at first glance you would think oh
1615000	1617000	well if I didn't have a PlayStation 4
1617000	1619000	at all then great I'm just going to buy the pro
1619000	1621000	because it just makes sense but at the same
1621000	1623000	time does it because now these households
1623000	1625000	are faced with do I get
1625000	1627000	the PlayStation 4 pro or do I
1627000	1629000	save a hundred bucks and get a slim
1629000	1631000	is this worth a hundred dollars
1631000	1633000	that's going to be the question that these
1633000	1635000	holiday sales numbers are going to be very interesting
1635000	1637000	and for most families yes it is going to be a huge
1637000	1639000	huge difference because I mean
1639000	1641000	that's why Nintendo meanwhile
1641000	1643000	Nintendo's in the background in the
1643000	1645000	in the darkness just laughing
1645000	1647000	maniacally like haha we're still going to be
1647000	1649000	cheaper than all of you
1649000	1651000	it does
1651000	1653000	really feel like Nintendo is just riding
1653000	1655000	off this well I shouldn't say they're riding off this holiday
1655000	1657000	they're riding off the Wii U
1657000	1659000	for this holiday but you're starting to see
1659000	1661000	all these other plans
1661000	1663000	like it's like okay well since
1663000	1665000	our mega beast won't be available
1665000	1667000	we're going to send all these other
1667000	1669000	little gremlins out you know between
1669000	1671000	the classic NES and the
1671000	1673000	the thing we'll get into with the iPhone later
1673000	1675000	on that I'm sure you all already know about
1675000	1677000	with that and
1677000	1679000	what else
1679000	1681000	the physical Pokemon Go thing
1681000	1683000	you know they're going to start attacking holiday
1683000	1685000	from all these other angles I think instead
1685000	1687000	and I think Wii U is just kind of like
1687000	1689000	you know well
1689000	1691000	come on down to your old
1691000	1693000	old Wii U saloon
1693000	1695000	not so much the Wii U just Nintendo in general
1695000	1697000	with their next announcement
1697000	1699000	and I mean because I think that's what
1699000	1701000	more I was referring to just because
1701000	1703000	you know they did pretty well last
1703000	1705000	year you know with them being
1705000	1707000	the cheapest at the time even though it didn't make
1707000	1709000	a huge difference
1709000	1711000	now but
1711000	1713000	you know but still
1713000	1715000	I think that you know Sony shot themselves
1715000	1717000	in the foot majorly with this
1717000	1719000	Microsoft's going to do
1719000	1721000	a lot better which is kind of sad
1721000	1723000	because the slim wasn't really necessary to begin
1723000	1725000	with anyway but
1725000	1727000	you know but yeah so we'll see
1727000	1729000	yeah we will definitely see especially
1729000	1731000	you know the games are going to be very
1731000	1733000	important I know the last month
1733000	1735000	of sales figures showed that
1735000	1737000	Xbox One outsold PlayStation
1737000	1739000	4 now to be fair
1739000	1741000	Xbox One put out that new S
1741000	1743000	and that figure is
1743000	1745000	the old one and the new one
1745000	1747000	combined
1747000	1749000	but still
1749000	1751000	you know that is not
1751000	1753000	a trend that Sony would want to see continue
1753000	1755000	and here's the thing what's really amazing about the Pro
1755000	1757000	is it's able to output
1757000	1759000	you know 4K images
1759000	1761000	you know upscaled but it's
1761000	1763000	you know higher than 1080p
1763000	1765000	greater detail
1765000	1767000	more fidelity in the picture
1767000	1769000	but
1769000	1771000	still can't fucking run PlayStation
1771000	1773000	1 games or can't run
1773000	1775000	PlayStation 2 games yet a
1775000	1777000	fucking PSP can
1777000	1779000	run a PlayStation 1 so what you're telling me
1779000	1781000	is that system is fucking weaker than a
1781000	1783000	PSP yeah the only thing yeah
1783000	1785000	what was that the emotion chip in the
1785000	1787000	PlayStation 2 that made all the difference with the
1787000	1789000	virus compatibility but they
1789000	1791000	still have now it's software emulated
1791000	1793000	stuff on the PlayStation 3 so don't tell me that
1793000	1795000	that fucking powerful ass fucking
1795000	1797000	system can't play PlayStation
1797000	1799000	2 games oh but PlayStation Now
1799000	1801000	has just no fuck you I am not buying
1801000	1803000	your fucking PlayStation now well it does play
1803000	1805000	select PlayStation 2 games available
1805000	1807000	for $9.99 I am not subscribing to PlayStation Now
1807000	1809000	ever fucking ever
1809000	1811000	I am never ever subscribing to
1811000	1813000	that more like PlayStation I'm gonna save that clip
1813000	1815000	for when he subscribes a year from now I will never
1815000	1817000	subscribe to it more like PlayStation
1817000	1819000	never all right uh let's
1819000	1821000	see Dungeon Buster in chat says
1821000	1823000	it's been barely three years since the PlayStation
1823000	1825000	4 came out this still feels
1825000	1827000	like a knee-jerk reaction to a changing
1827000	1829000	market I just okay
1829000	1831000	here's the weird thing for me I've
1831000	1833000	been following video games for
1833000	1835000	even longer than this show has
1835000	1837000	existed 15 plus years at
1837000	1839000	this point right what what
1839000	1841000	is the what is the changing market
1841000	1843000	I didn't understand that there
1843000	1845000	there isn't there isn't they believe
1845000	1847000	that there isn't there absolutely isn't
1847000	1849000	and and it's the cell phones are fucking everything
1849000	1851000	yeah I think I think it's the
1851000	1853000	advancements of the smartphones and
1853000	1855000	and you know the you know the the bigger
1855000	1857000	publishers are like uh we can't we need
1857000	1859000	to keep them at home we can't let them go
1859000	1861000	out people think because
1861000	1863000	people drop hundreds of dollars every other year
1863000	1865000	on a nominal cell phone upgrade they're gonna do
1865000	1867000	the same thing right they have the
1867000	1869000	apple mentality and they like they think that that's
1869000	1871000	okay but even we're seeing with Apple themselves
1871000	1873000	it's like it's Apple's losing sales
1873000	1875000	from the subs from the six because of
1875000	1877000	you know these sort of things and you know
1877000	1879000	it's gonna change it's it's gonna change
1879000	1881000	after a while people are gonna get tired
1881000	1883000	of spending five six hundred dollars
1883000	1885000	a year because it's gonna it's gonna happen to Xbox
1885000	1887000	as well that's that project Scorpio
1887000	1889000	that better be something crazy
1889000	1891000	good because because we're hyping
1891000	1893000	the slim but now we're gonna have
1893000	1895000	extra you know an
1895000	1897000	xxl version of the
1897000	1899000	one next year and it's like
1899000	1901000	well rumor is and take
1901000	1903000	this with a giant salt lick because
1903000	1905000	rumor doesn't mean much but
1905000	1907000	that Scorpio's like an expensive
1907000	1909000	motherfucker like it's gonna be a seven hundred dollar thing
1909000	1911000	like it is for gamers
1911000	1913000	that are dedicated and need the power
1913000	1915000	but you know we laugh but
1915000	1917000	check out how much steam boxes cost
1917000	1919000	you know like there's people willing to pay the
1919000	1921000	higher end power and you want to play Xbox games
1921000	1923000	buy a PC
1923000	1925000	I mean seriously that they were
1925000	1927000	fucking pimping that shit
1927000	1929000	all fucking E3
1929000	1931000	Windows 10 and Xbox One
1931000	1933000	exclusive then fuck you
1933000	1935000	don't need them if you want a more powerful
1935000	1937000	system why are you gonna drop money
1937000	1939000	on an Xbox that you can't fucking upgrade
1939000	1941000	unless you buy a brand new system
1941000	1943000	buy a PC that's probably that's the
1943000	1945000	thing is like that's why I was like oh I'll buy an Xbox
1945000	1947000	One no way actually no I will
1947000	1949000	buy a PC because why would
1949000	1951000	I buy an Xbox One that you're gonna
1951000	1953000	try to sell me a new one later on and I don't understand
1953000	1955000	the point of this new PlayStation
1955000	1957000	system because
1957000	1959000	once again what is it
1959000	1961000	what are they meeting I mean are there people
1961000	1963000	out there going well that PlayStation 4 just
1963000	1965000	doesn't look good enough I'm not buying it
1965000	1967000	no one is saying that
1967000	1969000	nobody is doing that
1969000	1971000	I mean people might be like oh yeah
1971000	1973000	I wish it was 4K well
1973000	1975000	it fucking isn't and you know what it's still
1975000	1977000	not fucking 4K it just
1977000	1979000	outputs upscales to 4K
1979000	1981000	it's not 4K but there's just still not enough
1981000	1983000	content to justify you know 4K
1983000	1985000	like that again other than Netflix and such but
1985000	1987000	that's it like it's just it's like
1987000	1989000	we all said earlier it's just too soon
1989000	1991000	and you know who I pity the most and you know
1991000	1993000	of course this is gonna come from me
1993000	1995000	of course it's the developers
1995000	1997000	the developers who've been so focused on
1997000	1999000	even developing for the PlayStation
1999000	2001000	platform as it is and then
2001000	2003000	to hear now you're
2003000	2005000	getting two different hardware upgrades
2005000	2007000	or options and I remember hearing
2007000	2009000	some point earlier this year that
2009000	2011000	I remember
2011000	2013000	I don't know if it was Game of Sutra
2013000	2015000	or somewhere else were saying
2015000	2017000	that for any
2017000	2019000	new developers on Sony
2019000	2021000	Sony
2021000	2023000	made the developer sign this like
2023000	2025000	exclusivity thing where it's like
2025000	2027000	your games have to be
2027000	2029000	4K ready as an option
2029000	2031000	like it can't just not
2031000	2033000	have 4K option and
2033000	2035000	you know or something along those lines
2035000	2037000	it was very concerning
2037000	2039000	because as a developer making
2039000	2041000	a game in even
2041000	2043000	1080 is tough
2043000	2045000	because you know because it's like you know there's so many
2045000	2047000	limitations you know whatever you know
2047000	2049000	as powerful as the consoles are you know
2049000	2051000	we as indie developers
2051000	2053000	only have such
2053000	2055000	a limited amount of budget you know
2055000	2057000	to make a game as pretty as possible
2057000	2059000	I mean you know
2059000	2061000	I mean for God's sake look at what happened to No Man's
2061000	2063000	Sky as pretty as it was
2063000	2065000	you know what I'm saying and the approach that they made with it
2065000	2067000	they have a long way to go but they
2067000	2069000	but they fell big time because
2069000	2071000	of all the crap that they went through
2071000	2073000	and they barely got by on the
2073000	2075000	PC version but look what happened
2075000	2077000	between PC and Playstation 4
2077000	2079000	all that stuff but my point is that
2079000	2081000	there's
2081000	2083000	there's a cost there's a huge
2083000	2085000	cost to creating
2085000	2087000	4K textures
2087000	2089000	1080p textures and of course
2089000	2091000	the people who are playing they're not thinking
2091000	2093000	about that but people like
2093000	2095000	myself that's a huge
2095000	2097000	that's a huge hit on our
2097000	2099000	budget because it's like we
2099000	2101000	budget our games you know
2101000	2103000	hopefully to get it right
2103000	2105000	we hope to get it right and
2105000	2107000	you know let's put our game in
2107000	2109000	1080p but now we're in 4K
2109000	2111000	and it's so difficult
2111000	2113000	to get 4K textures
2113000	2115000	you know 4K textures
2115000	2117000	implemented properly especially when
2117000	2119000	we've never made you know
2119000	2121000	huge games we don't have the support
2121000	2123000	we don't have the size of a
2123000	2125000	AAA studio and that's the other
2125000	2127000	big problem too like that's where I was concerned
2127000	2129000	with Sony announcing this
2129000	2131000	because it's like how many developers
2131000	2133000	are actually going to utilize
2133000	2135000	that 4K?
2135000	2137000	Can I tinfoil hat something for a minute because
2137000	2139000	no just your line of thinking
2139000	2141000	here kind of made me think of something
2141000	2143000	is it possible that No Man's
2143000	2145000	Sky you know because
2145000	2147000	obviously people have their issues with
2147000	2149000	some of the quality checks and things like that
2149000	2151000	is it possible that No Man's Sky
2151000	2153000	was rushed to market try not
2153000	2155000	to laugh because I realized the game was delayed like five
2155000	2157000	times but was it
2157000	2159000	possible that No Man's Sky had
2159000	2161000	to release now to
2161000	2163000	get around this 4K directive? I think
2163000	2165000	they did but I do
2165000	2167000	think
2167000	2169000	I think where they failed the most
2169000	2171000	is that they
2171000	2173000	they tried to
2173000	2175000	they were trying to create an imagination
2175000	2177000	imaginary world this massive
2177000	2179000	not even world universe they were trying to create
2179000	2181000	this imaginary universe and
2181000	2183000	the procedural generation approach
2183000	2185000	in the on the development
2185000	2187000	side that's a really inexpensive
2187000	2189000	way to create a massive
2189000	2191000	to create a massive world a massive
2191000	2193000	universe because procedural generation
2193000	2195000	it's all in programming it's just all in programming
2195000	2197000	but the problem the problem with them
2197000	2199000	is I think partly you're right
2199000	2201000	about that you know on the on the back
2201000	2203000	end because they're like you know because even with
2203000	2205000	myself with my kinship game kinship
2205000	2207000	when I started kinship kinship was initially
2207000	2209000	going to be on the 360 and then
2209000	2211000	we hear about when they when Microsoft
2211000	2213000	moved to Xbox One and they weren't bringing
2213000	2215000	it wasn't supposed to be backward compatible
2215000	2217000	so anything coming out on Xbox
2217000	2219000	Indie wasn't going to be able to be played
2219000	2221000	because they changed the whole architecture for
2221000	2223000	Xbox One then the Nintendo opportunity
2223000	2225000	came up with you know for Wii U we were like
2225000	2227000	alright great you know you know this is our
2227000	2229000	second chance but now Wii U is dissolving
2229000	2231000	into the nether
2231000	2233000	and now here we are again like
2233000	2235000	well what's going to happen with NX
2235000	2237000	let's see what happens with NX so now we've
2237000	2239000	I've just ultimately decided we're just going to make it for PC
2239000	2241000	and see what happens from that point
2241000	2243000	but you come to the you know
2243000	2245000	it is an extremely frustrating process
2245000	2247000	because you know yeah
2247000	2249000	at some point you know
2249000	2251000	they No Man's Sky was so
2251000	2253000	far in especially with the size
2253000	2255000	of their game if their game
2255000	2257000	was just a regular you know 10
2257000	2259000	level game you know couple worlds game maybe
2259000	2261000	a six eight hour game they
2261000	2263000	probably would have delayed it again but they were
2263000	2265000	they were in too deep with No Man's Sky
2265000	2267000	and they were like and they knew
2267000	2269000	they didn't want to become
2269000	2271000	and again this is
2271000	2273000	I'm probably putting my tinfoil hat on myself
2273000	2275000	but they probably didn't want to be a star citizen
2275000	2277000	Well I still like
2277000	2279000	No Man's Sky for what it is
2279000	2281000	and you know I stand by my early impressions and review
2281000	2283000	of that game but what I don't
2283000	2285000	like is all of a sudden there's like some
2285000	2287000	massive radio silence coming out of that company
2287000	2289000	like after they patched the PC thing
2289000	2291000	then like you check the Twitter
2291000	2293000	it's like dead like and I
2293000	2295000	realize okay you put out a game that you've been
2295000	2297000	working on for years maybe you need a little vacation
2297000	2299000	but you rotate
2299000	2301000	that vacation so somebody can
2301000	2303000	keep us in the loop of what the hell's going on
2303000	2305000	Not for that kind and that's what I'm saying
2305000	2307000	not for that kind of game they
2307000	2309000	try to be and that's one you know even
2309000	2311000	even when I do my meetups
2311000	2313000	this is why I'm really
2313000	2315000	proud to be to have
2315000	2317000	founded the chapter because that's one of the
2317000	2319000	things we talk about in our different chapter
2319000	2321000	meetup sessions the one thing you
2321000	2323000	don't ever want to do
2323000	2325000	as your first game is
2325000	2327000	make an MMO
2327000	2329000	that's like game development
2329000	2331000	101 your first game should
2331000	2333000	never be a World of Warcraft
2333000	2335000	you just don't do that unless you're an
2335000	2337000	inheritance baby but even then
2337000	2339000	you still have to know what you're doing
2339000	2341000	It's too much to chew
2341000	2343000	It's huge and you don't have
2343000	2345000	it's not just the skill
2345000	2347000	set because one can have the skill set
2347000	2349000	to make that scale
2349000	2351000	of a game but you have to
2351000	2353000	the one thing you know nerds
2353000	2355000	a lot of nerds and especially
2355000	2357000	developers don't have
2357000	2359000	especially at the start of all this
2359000	2361000	is discipline you need
2361000	2363000	a mental discipline to make
2363000	2365000	that to make a game of that scale
2365000	2367000	and with everything those guys went
2367000	2369000	through with No Man's Sky yeah they
2369000	2371000	they should have
2371000	2373000	they should have brought it out and you know they should have
2373000	2375000	brought it on bits and pieces they would have been so much
2375000	2377000	better off I think they kind of did
2377000	2379000	well well
2379000	2381000	I mean efficiently not just
2381000	2383000	not just sloppy but you know
2383000	2385000	okay well okay let's let's
2385000	2387000	shift a little bit to talking a little more about you and what
2387000	2389000	you're involved with and all this stuff so obviously you
2389000	2391000	are you know founder and such
2391000	2393000	as the Sakai GDA how are things going has
2393000	2395000	there been growth here locally with developers
2395000	2397000	absolutely yeah absolutely I mean
2397000	2399000	we you know the
2399000	2401000	the proof is always in
2401000	2403000	you know our indie arcade event
2403000	2405000	you know we we the I
2405000	2407000	founded the chapter three and a half years
2407000	2409000	ago and the whole point of the chapter
2409000	2411000	founding the chapter was
2411000	2413000	we needed
2413000	2415000	I needed our game our
2415000	2417000	Sacramento game developer group to be taken seriously
2417000	2419000	I was tired of us getting laughed
2419000	2421000	at by by our neighbors
2421000	2423000	why would you laugh because we're Sacramento
2423000	2425000	because we're Sacramento we we
2425000	2427000	we are we are the red-headed
2427000	2429000	stepchild of of California because we're also
2429000	2431000	like if I'm not mistaken we are a
2431000	2433000	top 20 media market right top 25 media
2433000	2435000	market right but it's something something
2435000	2437000	like that but I mean again but she's still on
2437000	2439000	gigabit earn it though yeah but
2439000	2441000	like San Francisco is right next to us sorry
2441000	2443000	our houses are affordable right well
2443000	2445000	yeah they won't be for long no we won't be really because
2445000	2447000	all the Bay Area people are coming here no it's the
2447000	2449000	fucking arena's fault yeah it is the arena's
2449000	2451000	fault and and and you know and that's how
2451000	2453000	you talk like a Sacramento
2453000	2455000	playing everything on that goddamn arena well that's what I do
2455000	2457000	and I'm from New Jersey and I already know better
2457000	2459000	it's like no will the arena make them
2459000	2461000	play better no it won't and
2461000	2463000	and my and and I'm only I'm
2463000	2465000	not going any further with the king's stuff other than
2465000	2467000	in the arena suffer than this statement and
2467000	2469000	I've said it a few times and it's racing my
2469000	2471000	brows and I'm gonna do it again because I don't care my
2471000	2473000	opinion on it is that the Kings the
2473000	2475000	new arena should not have been a bit should not have
2475000	2477000	been built until the Kings won something
2477000	2479000	period so no arena should
2479000	2481000	have been built for an average team period
2481000	2483000	win a championship and then you get then you get a
2483000	2485000	great Christmas gift a newer well
2485000	2487000	to be fair counterpoint they've promised
2487000	2489000	to bring the Monarchs back yeah
2489000	2491000	Monarchs were able to win a champ yeah
2491000	2493000	and God promised me to be six three with
2493000	2495000	six pack sometimes that hasn't happened
2495000	2497000	sometimes you need a woman to get it done
2497000	2499000	well
2499000	2501000	anyway
2501000	2503000	I just showed you
2503000	2505000	receipts
2505000	2507000	right so but
2507000	2509000	so nonetheless like
2509000	2511000	so one of the biggest things was making
2511000	2513000	sure that our game developer group was taken seriously
2513000	2515000	and more importantly we weren't losing
2515000	2517000	great talent you know
2517000	2519000	you know a lot of talent leaving Sacramento
2519000	2521000	to go to all the you know to go to all these
2521000	2523000	different locations and such which I again
2523000	2525000	I respect that you know they want to work you know
2525000	2527000	they want to work for you know insert you know
2527000	2529000	triple big triple A studio here whatever
2529000	2531000	but if we had an opportunity to
2531000	2533000	to create a job
2533000	2535000	market here at SAC and
2535000	2537000	make them be like whoa I don't have
2537000	2539000	to leave home I can stay and
2539000	2541000	not have to worry about paying three thousand
2541000	2543000	dollars a month for a studio in San Francisco
2543000	2545000	if I get lucky and
2545000	2547000	excuse me so we'd like so that the idea was
2547000	2549000	was that you know we
2549000	2551000	have been nurturing and developing this chapter
2551000	2553000	and it has
2553000	2555000	expanded into wonderful proportions
2555000	2557000	I just put out a newsletter last
2557000	2559000	week and on our meetup group
2559000	2561000	we we are over
2561000	2563000	a thousand members now now it
2563000	2565000	is both and I said this in the newsletter
2565000	2567000	it is both a very interesting milestone
2567000	2569000	but it's also a concerning
2569000	2571000	one because we don't see a thousand
2571000	2573000	members at a time ever but
2573000	2575000	we have seen a lot more I will say
2575000	2577000	that in our newest indie arcade
2577000	2579000	oh yeah
2579000	2581000	yeah see the next event
2581000	2583000	that might change but for the moment
2583000	2585000	we'll see what happens but with our most
2585000	2587000	recent indie arcade back in April
2587000	2589000	in West Sacramento you know
2589000	2591000	we had about five hundred fifty attendees
2591000	2593000	which was more than double
2593000	2595000	the other two indie arcades
2595000	2597000	I told you this
2597000	2599000	I told Bree this you guys are sitting on the next
2599000	2601000	big sack gaming con and it's
2601000	2603000	it I would say it's going to happen but it
2603000	2605000	is happening well I'm gonna
2605000	2607000	I'm very proud
2607000	2609000	I'm very proud of this number one
2609000	2611000	I'm very proud of the people that have helped
2611000	2613000	make this happen in the first place you you are
2613000	2615000	part of this you know what I'm saying you guys were a part of this
2615000	2617000	we just showed up and told you no you
2617000	2619000	did more than that thank you
2619000	2621000	so you did more than that
2621000	2623000	with this microphone cord I'm just telling you you've
2623000	2625000	done so much more than that because
2625000	2627000	no no seriously because and
2627000	2629000	because it's not just us our chapters defined
2629000	2631000	by everybody I just
2631000	2633000	host I just host and I try to
2633000	2635000	and I try to be the push for everybody
2635000	2637000	especially this man over here Loki
2637000	2639000	trying to get his shit done you know what I'm saying
2639000	2641000	that's what we do that's what that's that's what we try to
2641000	2643000	do you can find a way for me to get more than
2643000	2645000	four hours of sleep at night which is just
2645000	2647000	I hear sedatives are pretty good
2647000	2649000	but anyway I digress so the idea
2649000	2651000	is is that have you
2651000	2653000	got just quickly have you guys had some games
2653000	2655000	that have that like people might
2655000	2657000	recognize like the downloaded that have come out
2657000	2659000	of Sac IG members oh my god
2659000	2661000	the one I think of I just
2661000	2663000	saw because Monsters and Monocles
2663000	2665000	that guy in Davis
2665000	2667000	that put that together in fact I need to invite him
2667000	2669000	on the show that
2669000	2671000	that just released on the
2671000	2673000	steam early access and I know he was at
2673000	2675000	the arcade event a couple years ago so
2675000	2677000	you're starting to see and they were at PAX
2677000	2679000	they went to PAX West while I was at Dragon Con
2679000	2681000	and I know they had a lot of success there
2681000	2683000	so I mean that's a really great success story
2683000	2685000	and I'm sure you've got more because based on
2685000	2687000	the games I saw at arcade
2687000	2689000	yeah Venture 4th almost
2689000	2691000	Venture 4th is done
2691000	2693000	Venture 4th is done Venture 4th was out and actually
2693000	2695000	I'm actually glad you said that because we're actually doing
2695000	2697000	a meetup later this month in
2697000	2699000	Elk Grove I believe it's in Elk Grove
2699000	2701000	at Elk Grove and Ed at the
2701000	2703000	Innogrove co-working space where we're going to
2703000	2705000	do a Q&A for
2705000	2707000	Skirmish Studios
2707000	2709000	as well as ArcLight for the Venture
2709000	2711000	4th game and because they did very
2711000	2713000	they both ran recently very successful
2713000	2715000	Kickstarter campaigns and
2715000	2717000	we're going to be talking to them and
2717000	2719000	interviewing them to see why
2719000	2721000	what went right what went
2721000	2723000	wrong and what they could have done better so on and so forth
2723000	2725000	but yeah I mean Monsters and Monocles is
2725000	2727000	definitely one of those games
2727000	2729000	that's done so well and
2729000	2731000	yeah we've had a slew
2731000	2733000	more and in fact we had
2733000	2735000	we had a mystery
2735000	2737000	judge who she used to work at Xbox
2737000	2739000	I don't know if you were there for that
2739000	2741000	but she came through
2741000	2743000	and was like
2743000	2745000	you know I'm going to look around I want to see what's
2745000	2747000	going on but no one knew that someone from
2747000	2749000	that used to work for Xbox she works for
2749000	2751000	a subsidiary of Wargaming and
2751000	2753000	she came through and was like
2753000	2755000	here's you know I'm going to tap
2755000	2757000	you guys and I feel so horrible I cannot
2757000	2759000	remember the name of the game if Bree's in the chat
2759000	2761000	I don't know if she's listening or in the chat right now
2761000	2763000	Was that the one that was like a runner with polarity
2763000	2765000	type of thing like it was black and white?
2765000	2767000	Yes absolutely and I feel
2767000	2769000	so bad we have the studios listening
2769000	2771000	I'm so sorry guys because my mind
2771000	2773000	my mind is just upon the mess
2773000	2775000	Which one? The one that won that prize
2775000	2777000	from the Microsoft developer that was
2777000	2779000	that was really good it was the
2779000	2781000	like you had like a
2781000	2783000	it was like a black and white type of game
2783000	2785000	and then like in the white spots would be the black
2785000	2787000	character that's running through and then the white
2787000	2789000	spots would be the white character
2789000	2791000	I got the demo for that it was like the
2791000	2793000	rabbit and the owl
2793000	2795000	rabbit and the owl that's it
2795000	2797000	yeah they
2797000	2799000	they have been kicking butt
2799000	2801000	they've been doing great they got selected
2801000	2803000	Bree's actually in our chat I just realized
2803000	2805000	she's the anonymous chatter in there
2805000	2807000	she's like screaming at the top of her lungs
2807000	2809000	Thanks Bree
2809000	2811000	Thank you Bree so
2811000	2813000	but again ultimately
2813000	2815000	there's been a ton of growth here and
2815000	2817000	we've started our most
2817000	2819000	recent progressive game jam
2819000	2821000	and a slew of new teams
2821000	2823000	a slew of new faces as well as
2823000	2825000	as well as the veterans that were there last year
2825000	2827000	and the year before that
2827000	2829000	it's been a tremendous
2829000	2831000	tremendous thing and
2831000	2833000	even now with myself I'm proud to say that now
2833000	2835000	I can finally be a part of that with my crumple
2835000	2837000	game coming out within the next
2837000	2839000	month and a half-ish
2839000	2841000	I'm so happy for you
2841000	2843000	I was starting to
2843000	2845000	wonder if your game was kind of like one of Loki's games
2845000	2847000	we were going to see it come out
2847000	2849000	I don't release stuff that's not fun
2849000	2851000	and I am so mentally working on
2851000	2853000	stuff so every day
2853000	2855000	I think about my game and every day
2855000	2857000	you know jot stuff down
2857000	2859000	and I do research every day
2859000	2861000	well maybe that's the problem
2861000	2863000	every day I think about mowing the lawn
2863000	2865000	alright
2865000	2867000	no I don't actually
2867000	2869000	who really does that?
2869000	2871000	that's alright I'm one step ahead of you
2871000	2873000	I just don't water the lawn so it doesn't grow
2873000	2875000	well technically you're obeying the law
2875000	2877000	because we're in California
2877000	2879000	so fuck the lawn
2879000	2881000	so yeah with crumple
2881000	2883000	yeah
2883000	2885000	I announced it
2885000	2887000	maybe even 3-4 weeks ago
2887000	2889000	that crumple's over
2889000	2891000	90% done now
2891000	2893000	we're working on
2893000	2895000	90% left now
2895000	2897000	we're working on
2897000	2899000	the actual ending for the first
2899000	2901000	episode since crumple for some
2901000	2903000	who've been keeping
2903000	2905000	close lock on our game
2905000	2907000	crumple's going to be released in episodes
2907000	2909000	and so the first episode is
2909000	2911000	like I mentioned a little over 90% done
2911000	2913000	we're working on the ending to how episode 1 will
2913000	2915000	end it's going to be really
2915000	2917000	pretty intense and
2917000	2919000	we're just putting the final touches of any
2919000	2921000	bugs squashing in the code but
2921000	2923000	yeah we're almost done
2923000	2925000	you wouldn't think a game starring an envelope would be intense
2925000	2927000	but
2927000	2929000	see one thing about me
2929000	2931000	and this is something that
2931000	2933000	this is another reason why I started this chapter
2933000	2935000	because I came in as the
2935000	2937000	idea guy I do not
2937000	2939000	have any art skill I do not have
2939000	2941000	any coding skill but I could tell a
2941000	2943000	story because I've done poetry and I
2943000	2945000	have a wacky imagination the thing
2945000	2947000	with me it's about what's on the inside
2947000	2949000	and that's anthrax
2949000	2951000	let him finish
2951000	2953000	shut up
2953000	2955000	so what happens
2955000	2957000	is
2957000	2959000	you know what's on your inside? pepperoni
2959000	2961000	I don't eat pepperoni it's all
2961000	2963000	garlic and parmesan
2963000	2965000	so what happens is
2965000	2967000	that for me it was
2967000	2969000	you know even if you have the imagination
2969000	2971000	and the idea you can make something
2971000	2973000	beautiful you can make something very intense
2973000	2975000	and I mean I think we've seen
2975000	2977000	I mean you know
2977000	2979000	a lot of games that seem
2979000	2981000	simple on the surface are actually very
2981000	2983000	very intense Limbo which was part
2983000	2985000	inspiration for Crumple comes to mind
2985000	2987000	like okay a 10 year old boy black and white
2987000	2989000	silhouette okay what's why
2989000	2991000	and that game turned out to be incredibly
2991000	2993000	intense and atmospheric so
2993000	2995000	to be able to achieve that on
2995000	2997000	Crumple knowing we were making it on
2997000	2999000	a flash
2999000	3001000	it's like how are we going to pull this off but
3001000	3003000	we've been able to do it and I can't wait
3003000	3005000	when we show the little
3005000	3007000	progression reel of how Crumple
3007000	3009000	started how it looked when it first started
3009000	3011000	as compared to how it looks now with all
3011000	3013000	the sounds and you know the
3013000	3015000	attention to detail I'm excited to play it again
3015000	3017000	I think the last time I played it was almost a year ago
3017000	3019000	at that Reno thing oh my goodness
3019000	3021000	yeah yeah you can
3021000	3023000	actually play the demo now
3023000	3025000	there's been a demo for probably
3025000	3027000	near a year now on Newgrounds
3027000	3029000	and well as a listener of this fine program
3029000	3031000	please tell me where I can get this demo
3031000	3033000	so oh man I
3033000	3035000	did you have something on good old games
3035000	3037000	though I thought or no
3037000	3039000	I'm thinking of the other one Desura
3039000	3041000	so the demo started on Desura
3041000	3043000	went just dissipated into
3043000	3045000	had some problems yes dissipated
3045000	3047000	quietly so yes
3047000	3049000	we'll call it um but yeah we
3049000	3051000	so there's actually a demo on itch itch.io
3051000	3053000	as well but I don't really remember
3053000	3055000	but so it but on Newgrounds
3055000	3057000	and they've been super supportive Newgrounds have
3057000	3059000	actually been retweeting and liking my stuff
3059000	3061000	as well which is pretty cool but on new
3061000	3063000	but I don't have the exact link off the top of my
3063000	3065000	head because it's like numerical so just
3065000	3067000	Newgrounds go on Newgrounds.com
3067000	3069000	on the search type Crumple
3069000	3071000	it'll be the first link you'll see it
3071000	3073000	you don't need to sign up for an account
3073000	3075000	on Newgrounds you can just play it and
3075000	3077000	yeah it's it's not the newest

3079000	3081000	it's pretty it's it's
3081000	3083000	generally pretty close to where we're at we've made
3083000	3085000	a number of upgrades and touch-ups
3085000	3087000	since then but you'll still be able to give
3087000	3089000	it a shot there's a link uh just given in

3151000	3153000	want to make you want that feedback from the O.L.R. listeners
3153000	3155000	before the rest of the internet we're
3155000	3157000	very we're very fortunate here at O.L.R.
3157000	3159000	that we have some pretty pretty decent minded
3159000	3161000	people in this program thank you decent
3161000	3163000	minded adults or children whichever
3163000	3165000	that's great glad to glad to
3165000	3167000	hear that well a lot of them did start off as children
3167000	3169000	and now we're adults
3169000	3171000	you have to have a little bit of a thick skin to put up a
3171000	3173000	Loki's crap three hours three hours a week I have
3173000	3175000	four sisters man he does not need they
3175000	3177000	know he can do that hasn't already happened
3177000	3179000	uh tell us briefly about kinship what what is
3179000	3181000	kinship where's where's this at kinship
3181000	3183000	right now um it you know just
3183000	3185000	like any almost anything in the game development it has
3185000	3187000	suffered its setbacks um
3187000	3189000	you know both on a technological tech
3189000	3191000	uh tech standpoint you know as
3191000	3193000	well as um who
3193000	3195000	who's able to help and and and you
3195000	3197000	know so on and so forth and it's
3197000	3199000	kinship is um it's
3199000	3201000	funny because kinship initially started as
3201000	3203000	a the original idea with kinship was
3203000	3205000	that it was going to be a fan remake
3205000	3207000	of Gradius 3 and
3207000	3209000	I then I decided no fan remakes
3209000	3211000	I can't be doing that I need to do
3211000	3213000	something original if I'm going to spend three years making
3213000	3215000	something might as well make something new and original
3215000	3217000	you can come up with something Gabriel do
3217000	3219000	something so I did so so here we
3219000	3221000	are now again you know as we
3221000	3223000	talked earlier kinship started as a 360
3223000	3225000	game you know was becoming
3225000	3227000	what's going to hopefully be a Wii U game
3227000	3229000	that's not going to happen now so now
3229000	3231000	we we look at just PC for the moment
3231000	3233000	and then console wise see what
3233000	3235000	what comes from that um
3235000	3237000	on the I've do you have
3237000	3239000	your 4k textures ready to go hell no
3239000	3241000	4k you know
3241000	3243000	can whatever so anyway so 4k
3243000	3245000	this so the idea is is that
3245000	3247000	um you know I've
3247000	3249000	involved myself more in the
3249000	3251000	development side I've actually learned
3251000	3253000	how to do environments
3253000	3255000	and build levels out so I'm not
3255000	3257000	I was gonna I was gonna say and I just to back up
3257000	3259000	a little bit I was very blown away when you
3259000	3261000	just said now because I didn't even realize
3261000	3263000	this you said that you didn't code
3263000	3265000	crumple and I always had this
3265000	3267000	thing in my mind that oh you you coded
3267000	3269000	right in there with the best of them but you you're
3269000	3271000	more of like a project manager is kind of what you're
3271000	3273000	doing right you're making you see the plan
3273000	3275000	and you're making sure all the moving parts
3275000	3277000	are doing this but it sounds like you got your
3277000	3279000	hands a little dirtier with kinship you actually
3279000	3281000	got in there and and did some more
3281000	3283000	of the environments yeah I've been
3283000	3285000	developing more of the environments um if
3285000	3287000	you look at it's not it's not
3287000	3289000	a very very recent trailer but well
3289000	3291000	actually no I actually posted a gameplay
3291000	3293000	trailer back in March before the indie arcade
3293000	3295000	event I posted a game our first gameplay
3295000	3297000	trailer on our YouTube channel um
3297000	3299000	youtube.com slash nascent games
3299000	3301000	go there and and look up the
3301000	3303000	stage three for kinship
3303000	3305000	gameplay I actually created that
3305000	3307000	that that it was a space
3307000	3309000	you know just kind of the easiest thing to create
3309000	3311000	first but I did but yeah it was
3311000	3313000	a great place to start and you're gonna get to see
3313000	3315000	get an idea of what kinship
3315000	3317000	looks like how it feels so on and so forth
3317000	3319000	and I I saw Bree's comment about the soundtrack
3319000	3321000	yes uh we have
3321000	3323000	definitely check our soundtrack on Bandcamp
3323000	3325000	we have um a compilation soundtrack
3325000	3327000	um and I just released a demo track on
3327000	3329000	there now um yeah nascent games
3329000	3331000	dot com dot excuse me nascent games
3331000	3333000	dot bandcamp dot
3333000	3335000	com yes definitely thank you
3335000	3337000	so anyway so kinship um
3337000	3339000	kinship is gonna end up
3339000	3341000	I'm working on the next trailer now for kinship
3341000	3343000	uh it's going to be
3343000	3345000	it's gonna become much more
3345000	3347000	personal for me because I've gone through
3347000	3349000	both the technical setbacks
3349000	3351000	as well as the personal setbacks
3351000	3353000	with with with the development of this game
3353000	3355000	when this game comes out
3355000	3357000	it's probably gonna piss off a couple
3357000	3359000	of people who know they were involved with
3359000	3361000	it and were no longer involved with it
3361000	3363000	and there's gonna be messages to them
3363000	3365000	in very subtle subtle ways
3365000	3367000	wait whoa whoa whoa whoa
3367000	3369000	what fucking dynasty unfolding
3369000	3371000	here dynasty in space unfolding here
3371000	3373000	so you're are you wearing dirty laundry
3373000	3375000	here on this project you did so you had
3375000	3377000	people that you were working on this game with
3377000	3379000	that are no longer a part of the project
3379000	3381000	for I'm assuming creative differences
3381000	3383000	is always politically correct yeah
3383000	3385000	those two words but you are you're flat out saying
3385000	3387000	listen listen all y'all
3387000	3389000	I've left I left I left you bitches
3389000	3391000	some messages in my game
3391000	3393000	yeah the idea here yeah
3393000	3395000	you're like the fucking Taylor Swift of
3395000	3397000	video games
3397000	3399000	I I hopefully don't want to go
3399000	3401000	that way yeah snake
3401000	3403000	game some more like a solid snake
3403000	3405000	a sneaky snake fuck you
3405000	3407000	so any good
3407000	3409000	thank you good so here's
3409000	3411000	so here's my whole thing with with that I
3411000	3413000	don't I I I'm always
3413000	3415000	grateful for both the good and the bad
3415000	3417000	experiences whatever whatever we go through
3417000	3419000	the one thing I mean
3419000	3421000	we've seen it happen to so many game
3421000	3423000	developers you know especially those
3423000	3425000	who kind of
3425000	3427000	kind of had their hands you know
3427000	3429000	just by themselves and then they decide to sneak
3429000	3431000	one more person in you know
3431000	3433000	and I mean we won't you know I'm sure we can
3433000	3435000	all we can all think of immediately who
3435000	3437000	who we think of when I when I say that
3437000	3439000	um you know uh
3439000	3441000	anyway so nonetheless it's like we think
3441000	3443000	about what we think about what happened
3443000	3445000	you know what happened with
3445000	3447000	those challenges with me
3447000	3449000	it's not it with me
3449000	3451000	it was more you
3451000	3453000	it was a couple of things you had
3453000	3455000	you had those who
3455000	3457000	had the drive but
3457000	3459000	didn't you know they they had the drive
3459000	3461000	but their ego got in the way
3461000	3463000	but then you had those who
3463000	3465000	you know who were very humble
3465000	3467000	but not
3467000	3469000	not at all confident in their skill
3469000	3471000	set and it affects you during your
3471000	3473000	game development and after a while
3473000	3475000	you know you try to
3475000	3477000	you try to empower them
3477000	3479000	there's one thing I learned
3479000	3481000	very early on with this is that because
3481000	3483000	I don't know anything about development
3483000	3485000	you know I had to make sure
3485000	3487000	I came at this from a very
3487000	3489000	from you know from a very reasonable point
3489000	3491000	of view and very empowering point of view
3491000	3493000	and you know this
3493000	3495000	year you know
3495000	3497000	and I've run into the issue a few times
3497000	3499000	I mean you know to the point where someone
3499000	3501000	and this was very early on in development not
3501000	3503000	recently but to the point where
3503000	3505000	someone actually sat down with me
3505000	3507000	and asked me to make them
3507000	3509000	the producer of my game
3509000	3511000	they asked me to make them a producer of my game
3511000	3513000	and they hadn't actually made anything for me yet
3513000	3515000	and they hadn't even graduated school yet
3515000	3517000	I said why would I make you that
3517000	3519000	why would I make you that at all
3519000	3521000	because they were like well I need to have that on my resume
3521000	3523000	I'm like no you need to earn it
3523000	3525000	and we run into
3525000	3527000	those egos and that's part of the
3527000	3529000	biggest problem one of the biggest problems with
3529000	3531000	this is that
3531000	3533000	you know we
3533000	3535000	you know I run into those things and
3535000	3537000	I'm left speechless like what the hell do I
3537000	3539000	how do I even respond to this sort of thing
3539000	3541000	so for me you know it became
3541000	3543000	and it's very frustrating because
3543000	3545000	it's like again with the ton of other
3545000	3547000	setbacks that I already had
3547000	3549000	you know now that
3549000	3551000	becomes you don't want to take it personal
3551000	3553000	but it's like I don't share
3553000	3555000	my story with why I'm
3555000	3557000	making my games to just anybody
3557000	3559000	you know unless I'm selling
3559000	3561000	you the game and you want to understand
3561000	3563000	why but if I'm asking you to help me make this game
3563000	3565000	and I share my story it's for real
3565000	3567000	and to just kind of for those
3567000	3569000	things to happen is a big slap
3569000	3571000	in the face but I
3571000	3573000	don't vent about that sort of thing
3573000	3575000	online I'm not typing multiple messages online
3575000	3577000	or anything like that here
3577000	3579000	us as friends we talk
3579000	3581000	about that because and it's something I share
3581000	3583000	with the people in my chapter too when we talk about
3583000	3585000	that it's you know
3585000	3587000	it's a thing was you have to be ready for
3587000	3589000	that you're going to come across people like that
3589000	3591000	and you have to know how to handle yourself
3591000	3593000	when something like that happens
3593000	3595000	that's part of life and also part of business is that
3595000	3597000	there's going to be people that you have unfortunate
3597000	3599000	you know run-ins with and circumstances
3599000	3601000	with and you you know you
3601000	3603000	learn from every experience
3603000	3605000	so what I'm understanding here is I'm going to be the executive producer
3605000	3607000	on this game that's fantastic
3607000	3609000	but what I
3609000	3611000	but what I do like about this and you know
3611000	3613000	well I mean not that this
3613000	3615000	story is unfortunate and everything but
3615000	3617000	what I do like about what you know you're talking
3617000	3619000	about with the story and how you
3619000	3621000	were not really coding for crumple but you got
3621000	3623000	in there a little more with kinship and I think this is a
3623000	3625000	very very very important point that we don't always
3625000	3627000	talk about but it does seem
3627000	3629000	to come up whenever you or Brie
3629000	3631000	are on the show and it's it's definitely
3631000	3633000	worth repeating is that you don't
3633000	3635000	necessarily have to be a and I'm gonna use
3635000	3637000	my quote-y fingers code monkey right
3637000	3639000	to get and no offense to the code monkeys
3639000	3641000	of the world we wouldn't have gaming
3641000	3643000	for y'all but here's
3643000	3645000	the and it's a great Jonathan Colton song it is
3645000	3647000	however
3647000	3649000	however you don't necessarily have to
3649000	3651000	already know
3651000	3653000	unity you don't know
3653000	3655000	uh
3655000	3657000	c++ you don't have to know
3657000	3659000	visual game makers on sale this week
3659000	3661000	you don't have to know one dollar in order
3661000	3663000	to make a game because sometimes the key
3663000	3665000	part to making a game is networking
3665000	3667000	with the right people that you want
3667000	3669000	to make a game with but then that turns
3669000	3671000	into a family and sometimes you get
3671000	3673000	family problems right game
3673000	3675000	development is all about
3675000	3677000	chemistry no matter no
3677000	3679000	no coding no coding skill
3679000	3681000	no art skill no
3681000	3683000	animation skill no 3d modeling skill
3683000	3685000	or two or you know 2d or 2d
3685000	3687000	our art assets go describing me right now
3687000	3689000	none of that is gonna matter
3689000	3691000	if you don't have the chemistry with
3691000	3693000	your people and you know
3693000	3695000	and that has to come from both ends and
3695000	3697000	and and with that chemistry has to come
3697000	3699000	accountability and part of the issue
3699000	3701000	um with my with my past
3701000	3703000	uh with the past issues I've run into
3703000	3705000	has mainly been between
3705000	3707000	you know the the just filthy
3707000	3709000	arrogance and the and the filthy lack
3709000	3711000	of accountability because it's
3711000	3713000	you know you you know
3713000	3715000	I myself start questioning
3715000	3717000	my own capabilities
3717000	3719000	on what what I can what
3719000	3721000	I've been doing and the impact
3721000	3723000	I've been leaving with both the community and my
3723000	3725000	own games and it took me long
3725000	3727000	it took me so long
3727000	3729000	to finally decide
3729000	3731000	what part of game development was I
3731000	3733000	gonna do because I tried to get into
3733000	3735000	animation back in the late 90s you know or
3735000	3737000	mid 90s when when Donkey Kong Country
3737000	3739000	came out on the Super Nintendo how
3739000	3741000	inspired I was to like oh my god
3741000	3743000	I want to do this seeing what they did
3743000	3745000	to make that silicone graphics was my friend
3745000	3747000	I wanted them I wanted to marry
3747000	3749000	them and but as I got
3749000	3751000	doesn't right well of course
3751000	3753000	indeed but the idea was is that
3753000	3755000	I as I learned more and more about animation
3755000	3757000	what it took I like I can't
3757000	3759000	draw so for the next
3759000	3761000	15 years I gave
3761000	3763000	up on myself and just
3763000	3765000	went with a regular life and I was part of
3765000	3767000	the sheep and just worked and then
3767000	3769000	and put my dreams aside and now
3769000	3771000	here I am at this point where I'm so close
3771000	3773000	now and I've got crumple coming
3773000	3775000	out and and I
3775000	3777000	turned 40 at the end of November
3777000	3779000	and November 28th
3779000	3781000	that crumple
3781000	3783000	is going to be out through
3783000	3785000	hell or high water before
3785000	3787000	I turn 40 and
3787000	3789000	and I'm telling you with all these things that I've
3789000	3791000	gone through that you know
3791000	3793000	that's why it's like we learn from this
3793000	3795000	we chalk it up to the experience and
3795000	3797000	when we put the credits when the
3797000	3799000	when kinship finally is done
3799000	3801000	and we put those credits up and in
3801000	3803000	that special thanks section you know how you see
3803000	3805000	the special thanks and all these different
3805000	3807000	the special thanks are going to be to all those people
3807000	3809000	who didn't do an effing thing for me
3809000	3811000	and I can't wait I can't wait but it's also
3811000	3813000	going to be mixed with the good people who were supportive
3813000	3815000	and all that stuff but it's going to be a great guessing game
3815000	3817000	because it's going to be like wow wow
3817000	3819000	which one of them really pissed him off and which one
3819000	3821000	actually supported him you'll never know
3821000	3823000	and it's a beautiful thing so
3823000	3825000	but anyway all that aside so
3825000	3827000	I don't know how to follow that up
3827000	3829000	but I'm excited to play
3829000	3831000	that game
3831000	3833000	and kinship which will be out
3833000	3835000	so come hell or high water
3835000	3837000	before your 40th birthday
3837000	3839000	what's interesting in hearing you talk and say all that story
3839000	3841000	is it was so funny to me in a way
3841000	3843000	not funny haha but ironic
3843000	3845000	is you could just replace like everything you said
3845000	3847000	with radio and hey it's me
3847000	3849000	because that's what I went to college to do
3849000	3851000	was to do radio well originally
3851000	3853000	it started that originally
3853000	3855000	originally it started I was going to be a weatherman
3855000	3857000	so was when I was a little kid
3857000	3859000	when the weather channel came out oh my
3859000	3861000	god I was so obsessed with that so you're not alone
3861000	3863000	can you imagine Rob Roberts with the weather
3863000	3865000	so there was and then I actually
3865000	3867000	I did broadcast journalism
3867000	3869000	I actually interned at a television
3869000	3871000	station in the town where I went to school
3871000	3873000	and I learned about how fucking miserable
3873000	3875000	everybody was there
3875000	3877000	and I started to realize like I don't know
3877000	3879000	if this is really for me and then you start to get into
3879000	3881000	radio and this was right
3881000	3883000	when the internet was starting to boom and all this other stuff
3883000	3885000	and there's this very like ho-hum
3885000	3887000	attitude in radio and it's like you know
3887000	3889000	you can work your way
3889000	3891000	you can work and work and work and work all these hours
3891000	3893000	but if you don't suck the right dick you're just not
3893000	3895000	going to get anywhere with radio and I'm just kind of like
3895000	3897000	I don't know if this is
3897000	3899000	I don't know if this is the life I son of
3899000	3901000	but here we are
3901000	3903000	Bree who's big in radio
3903000	3905000	now in TV she could totally
3905000	3907000	tell you all you just got called out Rob Roberts
3907000	3909000	Roker that's what he put
3909000	3911000	you know and I have
3911000	3913000	mad respect for people
3913000	3915000	like Bree who stayed in
3915000	3917000	that industry and have really
3917000	3919000	worked on that from the inside
3919000	3921000	for me I was like
3921000	3923000	eh I'm going to just
3923000	3925000	go work a temp job and see
3925000	3927000	what I can do with my life and figure this out
3927000	3929000	another way and started
3929000	3931000	radio as a fun little thing on the side
3931000	3933000	and shit here we are
3933000	3935000	I'm going to be turning 40 in a couple years and
3935000	3937000	we got some podcasts
3937000	3939000	but I love it you know
3939000	3941000	I've been able to do all this on my terms
3941000	3943000	Absolutely and no one can
3943000	3945000	ever take that away from you and that
3945000	3947000	is the same thing with game development and that's the same
3947000	3949000	thing that I have to tell myself
3949000	3951000	everyday and that's the same thing I have to
3951000	3953000	tell other people like this is going to probably be
3953000	3955000	the one and only platform
3955000	3957000	that I'm going to share kind of the more
3957000	3959000	personal stuff that I kind of did here
3959000	3961000	no one's ever going to hear this again because I got to
3961000	3963000	keep going forward but I think this was healthy
3963000	3965000	for me because I haven't really been able to
3965000	3967000	share this because
3967000	3969000	I'm glad we can be your psychological outlet
3969000	3971000	you like how we have a couch here in the studio?
3971000	3973000	I just, I'm not, should I put my feet up?
3973000	3975000	If you want, make some home
3975000	3977000	Put my feet up and lay back, that's just awesome
3977000	3979000	Definitely, so thank you
3979000	3981000	for that by the way
3981000	3983000	I just feel a little weird that you
3983000	3985000	talk about some of those difficulties and we
3985000	3987000	follow that up with, hey but you should all try
3987000	3989000	to get into game development
3989000	3991000	No they have to be ready for that
3991000	3993000	you have to be ready for the good and bad
3993000	3995000	And that is life, you could be involved
3995000	3997000	in sports, you could be involved
3997000	3999000	in podcasting
3999000	4001000	you could be involved, and there's going to be
4001000	4003000	people that are
4003000	4005000	great, that you work with great like Loki and
4005000	4007000	Dark Soccer and there's going to be people in your life
4007000	4009000	that you don't work with so well, greatly
4009000	4011000	and that's just going to happen
4011000	4013000	although honestly, like I don't want to
4013000	4015000	I've made it sound shady
4015000	4017000	like everybody's going to go try to figure out who does
4017000	4019000	Rob Roberts not work well with, actually I've been
4019000	4021000	pretty fortunate in the podcasting thing that everybody's
4021000	4023000	been pretty decent, so I can't
4023000	4025000	Yeah and I've
4025000	4027000	had my, again I've had
4027000	4029000	dealing with my bad eggs and you know
4029000	4031000	it's good, the important thing is that
4031000	4033000	I can complain about that and this is why I don't really
4033000	4035000	ever talk about it, this way today was kind of the
4035000	4037000	exception and I'm happy I was able to
4037000	4039000	but once it happens
4039000	4041000	I chalk it up to the experience
4041000	4043000	and I just simply ask myself who
4043000	4045000	am I not going to, what type of personality
4045000	4047000	am I not going to deal with going ahead
4047000	4049000	because they're not going to stop me
4049000	4051000	from going forward in what I've got to do
4051000	4053000	I've got a game to make and I've got games to release
4053000	4055000	and I've got people waiting to play my game
4055000	4057000	and no one is going to remove
4057000	4059000	that dream of mine because I
4059000	4061000	I'm the only one in control of that whether I decide
4061000	4063000	to stop it or not and I'm not
4063000	4065000	because as I said I did that for 20 years and that's
4065000	4067000	not happening again so and I've got
4067000	4069000	a community rooting me on
4069000	4071000	waiting for me to get this
4071000	4073000	done so, like you guys
4073000	4075000	so hell yeah
4075000	4077000	Well that's one of the most raw interviews we've probably had here on Orange
4077000	4079000	Lawn Radio but I, no I appreciate it
4079000	4081000	I love it, you know
4081000	4083000	I appreciate it more, man
4083000	4085000	If people want to get involved with making
4085000	4087000	games, you know, again, and we just want to
4087000	4089000	emphasize, you know, even though
4089000	4091000	Gabe's talking about some dramatic experiences
4091000	4093000	that he's had, you're going to get that
4093000	4095000	with anything and you have to be prepared for it
4095000	4097000	but there's a lot of great rewards
4097000	4099000	I've gotten great rewards from podcasting
4099000	4101000	you've gotten great rewards from
4101000	4103000	making games and the best is yet to come
4103000	4105000	when these things actually release, so keep
4105000	4107000	an eye out at Nascent Games on
4107000	4109000	Twitter and
4109000	4111000	websites, nascentgames.net, right?
4111000	4113000	nascentgames.net, that's our new website
4113000	4115000	you can actually see the most
4115000	4117000	up-to-date crumple gameplay trailer
4117000	4119000	first thing on the video there, there's a lot
4119000	4121000	more I'm going to be doing to that website
4121000	4123000	I had to revamp it from the ground up
4123000	4125000	but it's nice for what it is
4125000	4127000	right now at the time, for the time being

4183000	4185000	this Tuesday, I don't know
4185000	4187000	if I'll be able to beat the whole game
4187000	4189000	oh I will, I definitely will
4189000	4191000	I don't know if I'm going to be able to beat all of Part 1
4191000	4193000	in one sitting on Tuesday, I'm going to try
4193000	4195000	but yeah
4195000	4197000	twitch.com slash nassongames
4197000	4199000	and the Extra Life

4201000	4203000	Brie if you find
4203000	4205000	if you get the link for the
4205000	4207000	yeah, because we're part of the
4207000	4209000	Sac Indie Arcade team, because we have a
4209000	4211000	team on Extra Life for Sac Indie Arcade
4211000	4213000	and I'm one of the people for that
4213000	4215000	I don't know if she'll be able to pull that up
4215000	4217000	but if you're in the chat
4217000	4219000	be sure to keep an eye on that
4219000	4221000	but otherwise, yeah, so
4221000	4223000	those are all my links
4223000	4225000	two other quick questions and I've really got to move on with the show
4225000	4227000	because we're running a little long, but that's okay
4227000	4229000	so one, I'm
4229000	4231000	sitting here, I'm passionate about
4231000	4233000	games, I want to get involved with games
4233000	4235000	hearing this has made me realize
4235000	4237000	I don't necessarily have to know code to get
4237000	4239000	involved with games, I need to meet
4239000	4241000	people at my local IGDA
4241000	4243000	how do I find them? So our meetup
4243000	4245000	group, meetup.com
4245000	4247000	slash game developer
4247000	4249000	it is as easy as that, is that good anywhere
4249000	4251000	in the world? Yeah, yeah, anywhere in the world
4251000	4253000	but yeah, meetup.com slash game developer
4253000	4255000	that's our chapters meetup
4255000	4257000	group, be sure to check us out there
4257000	4259000	there's other links for
4259000	4261000	our Facebook, our Instagram and so on and so forth
4261000	4263000	but definitely go there
4263000	4265000	and yes, you
4265000	4267000	the two things I ask
4267000	4269000	for if you're going to come talk to us
4269000	4271000	you need to be in this for the
4271000	4273000	love of the development
4273000	4275000	I don't need you walking up in my group saying
4275000	4277000	I've got this great money making idea
4277000	4279000	because I've had a few people do that
4279000	4281000	I've happily showed them the door
4281000	4283000	like don't come back because this is not why
4283000	4285000	we're doing this, we hope to make money
4285000	4287000	but that's not why I need you here
4287000	4289000	we're trying to create a job market right now
4289000	4291000	and if that's how you're going to be
4291000	4293000	I can't have that right now
4293000	4295000	I'm laughing because again
4295000	4297000	the parallels to my own world are just
4297000	4299000	uncanny. Yeah, it's crazy
4299000	4301000	it's crazy stuff but I mean
4301000	4303000	and yes, the extra life link
4303000	4305000	oh man, I can't even follow that
4305000	4307000	so yeah, sorry, if you're in the chat
4307000	4309000	yeah, so extralife.org
4309000	4311000	or .org. Does that game developer
4311000	4313000	meet up, is that, like, if I
4313000	4315000	remember our audience is all over the world
4315000	4317000	let's say I've got somebody in New York City
4317000	4319000	we have a few listeners there that wants to join
4319000	4321000	the New York City IGDA of which I'm sure there's
4321000	4323000	one in every borough, how could they find
4323000	4325000	the IGDA in their area?
4325000	4327000	Yeah, so IGDA.org
4327000	4329000	and there's a section for chapters
4329000	4331000	and there's a ton
4331000	4333000	of chapters
4333000	4335000	go there, check it out
4335000	4337000	and even the, I haven't been there in a while

4343000	4345000	to reach out to them. She posted a more
4345000	4347000	friendly link

4367000	4369000	too, she works so much earlier
4369000	4371000	but yeah, Brie

4373000	4375000	but yes, thank you, you're still helping me out
4375000	4377000	but yeah, that's ultimately it
4377000	4379000	just come with the drive
4379000	4381000	and come with
4381000	4383000	a genuine attitude that you're
4383000	4385000	ready to make a difference
4385000	4387000	and show others what you know because we're
4387000	4389000	all about sharing knowledge
4389000	4391000	if you come with
4391000	4393000	that arrogant attitude, I'm gonna
4393000	4395000	wipe the floor with you and I'm gonna
4395000	4397000	I will ruin your day
4397000	4399000	I will be the original
4399000	4401000	ending in Mass Effect 3
4401000	4403000	and destroy many people's lives
4403000	4405000	you're gonna wish for an alternative
4405000	4407000	Let's focus on the positive
4407000	4409000	Yeah, and unlike
4409000	4411000	We're gonna make a game
4411000	4413000	I'm gonna put you in a fucking
4413000	4415000	special thanks
4415000	4417000	So
4417000	4419000	definitely come through with a great
4419000	4421000	attitude, you know, even if you're shy
4421000	4423000	I prefer shyness over nasty
4423000	4425000	arrogant crap, we don't have time
4425000	4427000	for all that, so yeah, so definitely
4427000	4429000	come through and check us out and I have to say
4429000	4431000	someone says something really really quick
4431000	4433000	then god, I don't want to take up too much
4433000	4435000	time on this one, someone says, oh, Dungeon
4435000	4437000	Buster, he made the quote, we're here to make games
4437000	4439000	not massage egos, thank you
4439000	4441000	that's it, that's precisely it
4441000	4443000	that's precisely it
4443000	4445000	That's precisely it
4445000	4447000	You want to be part of a team
4447000	4449000	Yeah, or even
4449000	4451000	feel that if you still want to be
4451000	4453000	a solo act in your
4453000	4455000	game development, that
4455000	4457000	you want to be
4457000	4459000	empowered, we talked about the feedback thing
4459000	4461000	earlier, you have to be prepared
4461000	4463000	for all this sort of thing, so we have to
4463000	4465000	be supportive and give each other that
4465000	4467000	constructive criticism, but
4467000	4469000	we're here to
4469000	4471000	empower each other, not push
4471000	4473000	each other aside, so absolutely
4473000	4475000	Alright, one last thing before
4475000	4477000	we move on with the rest of our show
4477000	4479000	Any teases for next year's indie arcade
4479000	4481000	event?
4481000	4483000	So, we will
4483000	4485000	99%
4485000	4487000	sure be
4487000	4489000	back at the West Sac Community Center
4489000	4491000	there is that 1%
4491000	4493000	opportunity
4493000	4495000	I can't say yet because
4495000	4497000	it's still early in discussion
4497000	4499000	My brain says you're going to outgrow that place by
4499000	4501000	next year
4501000	4503000	Some people have said we've already outgrown the West Sac
4503000	4505000	place, and it's like, wait, it's only our first time
4505000	4507000	They could have used the second floor, there's still more
4507000	4509000	room on the second floor they could have grown into
4509000	4511000	so I don't think you've quite filled that space
4511000	4513000	entirely, but I am worried
4513000	4515000	for you guys that you're growing
4515000	4517000	which is good, that's great
4517000	4519000	It's a great problem to have, and yeah
4519000	4521000	it's going to be interesting what happens for the next
4521000	4523000	one, we already have our keynote
4523000	4525000	speaker, she was
4525000	4527000	so you remember Michelle
4527000	4529000	Michelle the last speaker
4529000	4531000	she was on the team
4531000	4533000	that made Evolve, right?
4533000	4535000	Evolve and making Mafia 3
4535000	4537000	Michelle Smith from 2K Games
4537000	4539000	she's going to be our keynote
4539000	4541000	she was phenomenal, and she's a Sacramento
4541000	4543000	native, and there's no other
4543000	4545000	person I would ask to be our keynote for this upcoming
4545000	4547000	thing, so she's going to be our keynote
4547000	4549000	we're planning a number of other things
4549000	4551000	I will tease
4551000	4553000	I think I'm okay to say this
4553000	4555000	because it might happen
4555000	4557000	but we incorporated
4557000	4559000	the board game aspect
4559000	4561000	which had a great response for the board game
4561000	4563000	board game developers, we are planning
4563000	4565000	to incorporate pinball
4565000	4567000	for our next one
4567000	4569000	so stay tuned
4569000	4571000	Okay, I like that tease, that's good
4571000	4573000	by the way, if we want to talk about panels
4573000	4575000	maybe we want to get involved this year
4575000	4577000	I would love, it would be an honor to have you guys as a panel
4577000	4579000	please, be awesome
4579000	4581000	no pressure
4581000	4583000	I was going to ask y'all anyway
4583000	4585000	we'll be there with bells on no matter what
4585000	4587000	yes sir
4587000	4589000	let's move on, we've got plenty of news
4589000	4591000	we've got to cover, but of course we have to talk about
4591000	4593000	our gaming weeks, I was in
4593000	4595000	DragonCon last week, which is why we didn't have a show
4595000	4597000	I've got to talk a little bit about that
4597000	4599000	let's get into our gaming weeks, we'll try to
4599000	4601000	quickly move through this, but we'll see
4601000	4603000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
4603000	4605000	I wish I played a lot of stuff, but I didn't
4605000	4607000	I did stick with my I'm not playing
4607000	4609000	Tatami Katamari because it erased my progress
4609000	4611000	so I didn't, instead
4611000	4613000	I played Non-Stop Night
4613000	4615000	which is yet another mobile game
4615000	4617000	thankfully though, this is not a clicker game
4617000	4619000	because there's nothing you really click, except
4619000	4621000	for, you know, special abilities
4621000	4623000	every now and then, it's more of a
4623000	4625000	clicker game without the clicking, if that makes sense
4625000	4627000	and it's much more simplified, and it actually is
4627000	4629000	kind of fun, because it is
4629000	4631000	very easy to cheat in, so that
4631000	4633000	that's what I've
4633000	4635000	it's honestly though, the cheating
4635000	4637000	at this point, I'm like so high
4637000	4639000	level that it doesn't affect anything
4639000	4641000	but it's kind of neat
4641000	4643000	there's a little bit of strategy to it
4643000	4645000	so there's kind of that
4645000	4647000	but it's a good time waster
4647000	4649000	so I'm playing that, I played a
4649000	4651000	little bit of Ingress, not much
4651000	4653000	Pokemon Go, and
4653000	4655000	more stories later, but
4655000	4657000	I may not be playing much Pokemon Go
4657000	4659000	because I'm not too happy with Niantic right now
4659000	4661000	Alright
4661000	4663000	Hey Gabe, do you play
4663000	4665000	games besides just making them, what have you been playing?
4665000	4667000	Yeah, I've been
4667000	4669000	I've been
4669000	4671000	I've been dabbling more
4671000	4673000	again, and I seem to talk about
4673000	4675000	this every time I'm on this show
4675000	4677000	my Earth Defense 4 is 4.1 because they
4677000	4679000	just announced
4679000	4681000	unofficially part 5 is coming
4681000	4683000	out, which I expected to be a thing
4683000	4685000	and that's great, so I've been rocking
4685000	4687000	that on my PS4, I've
4687000	4689000	been playing Horizon 2
4689000	4691000	Forza Horizon 2 again because
4691000	4693000	the Horizon 3 demo came out
4693000	4695000	today, so
4695000	4697000	Yes, the demo came out, and the only reason
4697000	4699000	I know what you're going to be doing, Lee
4699000	4701000	I thought it was still in that soon area
4701000	4703000	Well, here's the thing, the only reason I knew is because
4703000	4705000	Microsoft sent me a code for the
4705000	4707000	Halo vehicle, the Warthog
4707000	4709000	They sent me a code that you could drive the Warthog
4709000	4711000	in Forza Horizon 3
4711000	4713000	It's insanity, so when I
4713000	4715000	redeemed the code, it took me to the page
4715000	4717000	that said, okay, you'll be able to use this here and here
4717000	4719000	but in the description
4719000	4721000	it said, this vehicle
4721000	4723000	will be applicable for
4723000	4725000	Forza Horizon 3
4725000	4727000	and all these different versions that they mentioned
4727000	4729000	and it said the different editions, and then at the bottom
4729000	4731000	it said a demo, I said, bullshit
4731000	4733000	what demo, so I clicked
4733000	4735000	further, and it said demo coming out
4735000	4737000	September 11th, I heard when it was coming
4737000	4739000	and I realized it was today, nice
4739000	4741000	Yeah, this evening, so I've been playing
4741000	4743000	that, and then
4743000	4745000	I've actually been, funny enough
4745000	4747000	I started playing
4747000	4749000	again, DuckTales Remastered
4749000	4751000	I was playing that again because I got stuck on the
4751000	4753000	very very last level, I just decided to start over
4753000	4755000	and then I've been playing Chrono Trigger
4755000	4757000	on my Super Nintendo
4757000	4759000	and
4759000	4761000	it's probably one of the best decisions
4761000	4763000	I've ever made, because God help me
4763000	4765000	that game, whoo, yeah
4765000	4767000	so that's what I've been rocking out
4767000	4769000	Look at you, going from new stuff to old school
4769000	4771000	love it, my gaming week
4771000	4773000	speaking of new stuff, okay, so I spent
4773000	4775000	the weekend at Dragon Con, which is why I wasn't here
4775000	4777000	which, by the way, I just want to give a quick shout out
4777000	4779000	to Dragon Con and the people that I met
4779000	4781000	there, had a great time on the podcasting
4781000	4783000	track, we did end up doing a panel
4783000	4785000	after all, on Sunday
4785000	4787000	about social media
4787000	4789000	and had a really good time, and
4789000	4791000	yeah, it was just, we have
4791000	4793000	presented the Parsec Awards, which was
4793000	4795000	great, because yet again, they gave
4795000	4797000	us the spot right at the very end
4797000	4799000	next to last
4799000	4801000	so it's really something to be on
4801000	4803000	the stage right before Richard
4803000	4805000	Garriott, aka Lord British
4805000	4807000	who like, made Ultima, which is a
4807000	4809000	series, you know, that I grew up with, it's just
4809000	4811000	an honor to be in his presence and so forth
4811000	4813000	and you know, all the great talent
4813000	4815000	that goes with podcasting and all that
4815000	4817000	so just, you know, my hat's off to
4817000	4819000	everything involved there
4819000	4821000	and Dragon Con this year, you know
4821000	4823000	that is not usually an event that's
4823000	4825000	big on gaming, you know, Dragon
4825000	4827000	Con has always been big on other types of
4827000	4829000	fandom, be it sci-fi
4829000	4831000	Dungeons and Dragons
4831000	4833000	board gaming
4833000	4835000	you know, but I was always told
4835000	4837000	ever since the first year I went, don't expect a
4837000	4839000	big video gaming presence, but I gotta say
4839000	4841000	this year, they started to step it up
4841000	4843000	quite a bit, and I think this is because of a partnership
4843000	4845000	they have with MomoCon, which also happens
4845000	4847000	in Atlanta
4847000	4849000	there's some type of strategic partnership thing going on there
4849000	4851000	so this year, they had Tokyo Attack
4851000	4853000	there, who actually had a 24-7
4853000	4855000	arcade running of
4855000	4857000	Japanese import video games
4857000	4859000	so I was playing Papa Music
4859000	4861000	over and over and over again, it was fun
4861000	4863000	they had Ubeat
4863000	4865000	like six machines, I finally got to play
4865000	4867000	a re-rave machine for the first time
4867000	4869000	so if Kyle's still out there somewhere, I finally
4869000	4871000	finally played a re-rave machine
4871000	4873000	for the first time, so yeah, that was just
4873000	4875000	that was an awesome addition to Dragon Con
4875000	4877000	did you meet dragons though?
4877000	4879000	there were definitely cosplays of dragons
4879000	4881000	they call Dragon Con
4881000	4883000	the Super Bowl of cosplay, and for good reason
4883000	4885000	there was some really just elaborate
4885000	4887000	stuff that happens there
4887000	4889000	so yeah, I
4889000	4891000	had a great time, there was also a classic gaming
4891000	4893000	arcade that was set up in the dealer hall
4893000	4895000	that wasn't 24 hour, but it was still nice to see
4895000	4897000	I got to play a
4897000	4899000	Mortal Kombat 2 machine, which I have in a
4899000	4901000	long time, and I still
4901000	4903000	remember how to chop somebody's head off with
4903000	4905000	Katana, and that felt really good
4905000	4907000	that's awesome, where you can remember and not have to
4907000	4909000	pull it up on your game FAQs, hell yeah
4909000	4911000	I actually got to beat some rando
4911000	4913000	guy, we were playing
4913000	4915000	Mortal Kombat, I think he was Johnny Cage
4915000	4917000	and I was Katana, and I remembered
4917000	4919000	block block block block block, high kick, and
4919000	4921000	bye bye, chopped off the head
4921000	4923000	I still remember that for scorpion, so kudos
4923000	4925000	to you man, that was great
4925000	4927000	alright, and let's see
4927000	4929000	JD in chat says, what do you think of the
4929000	4931000	what did you think of the re-raves guy, they have one at
4931000	4933000	Sunnyvale Golf Land by the way
4933000	4935000	I mean, if you've played the iPhone game
4935000	4937000	which, if you're a fan of music games, you
4937000	4939000	really ought to have by now, if you haven't
4939000	4941000	friendly reminder to try it, because
4941000	4943000	yeah, it's a great little
4943000	4945000	touch game, and you know, it just felt like
4945000	4947000	that, but on a much larger
4947000	4949000	touch screen, because this thing is huge
4949000	4951000	it's the size of a large television
4951000	4953000	but it's a touch pad, and so for that
4953000	4955000	it makes it almost harder for your eyes
4955000	4957000	to get a sense of what all is on
4957000	4959000	the play field at once, but
4959000	4961000	I'd like
4961000	4963000	to touch the big button, I like to
4963000	4965000	touch the big screen and touch it, it's fun
4965000	4967000	so yeah, I enjoyed it
4967000	4969000	let's see,
4969000	4971000	okay, so also at DragonCon, so Bobby
4971000	4973000	you know, he does a lot with
4973000	4975000	VR and AR and all that development
4975000	4977000	so our pal Bobby Blackwolf was there
4977000	4979000	and we had for the first time this year
4979000	4981000	what we were calling the VoG Suite
4981000	4983000	because we actually had a suite at one
4983000	4985000	of the host hotels, and so Bobby brought
4985000	4987000	his toys
4987000	4989000	and we all got to try them
4989000	4991000	so for the first time ever I got to
4991000	4993000	try the Vive, the HTC Vive
4993000	4995000	and I got to see some demos and that
4995000	4997000	that was cool, I mean
4997000	4999000	I was a fan of VR since I checked out
4999000	5001000	Oculus Rift for the first time, so it was just cool to see
5001000	5003000	some of the stuff in that, I watched other
5003000	5005000	people play Job Simulator, which was
5005000	5007000	cracking me up, we were laughing
5007000	5009000	until three in the morning playing Job Simulator
5009000	5011000	and I really like the
5011000	5013000	Angry Birds type thing they had, but it was
5013000	5015000	all Portal characters, which I think is a game
5015000	5017000	called The Lab that has, it's like
5017000	5019000	Valve's, you know, kind of
5019000	5021000	VR playground game, a la
5021000	5023000	Wii Sports sort of thing, so
5023000	5025000	that was cool to see, but I was really all about
5025000	5027000	because I got to try for the first time HoloLens
5027000	5029000	because he actually has a HoloLens dev kit
5029000	5031000	so for the first time I got to try HoloLens
5031000	5033000	and the game
5033000	5035000	that he had me play on HoloLens was called
5035000	5037000	Fragments and
5037000	5039000	it's pretty fucking cool, like
5039000	5041000	I'm smiling because one of our developers
5041000	5043000	actually has lent me
5043000	5045000	the HoloLens because he
5045000	5047000	got it, he got it as part of the pre-order
5047000	5049000	That's not a cheap blend by the way, I was told
5049000	5051000	how much those things cost and yes
5051000	5053000	Your life
5053000	5055000	It cost you your life
5055000	5057000	Well here's the thing, so the
5057000	5059000	HoloLens, you configure it
5059000	5061000	and it actually scans the room, so it knows
5061000	5063000	where couches are, it knows where tables are
5063000	5065000	it knows where things are, so this game
5065000	5067000	Fragments is like a crime scene
5067000	5069000	type game, so it's like a frozen moment
5069000	5071000	in time of a crime scene of a
5071000	5073000	kidnapping basically, I'm not going to spoil too much
5073000	5075000	but it's like a kidnapping basically, and so
5075000	5077000	you look, what you're trying to do is determine
5077000	5079000	where are they, because you can
5079000	5081000	see the kid and the
5081000	5083000	kidnapper and you're trying to determine where do you send
5083000	5085000	the cops, so you're investigating
5085000	5087000	things in the room and suddenly you might look at the
5087000	5089000	wall and oh there's a brick sticking out of the wall
5089000	5091000	so you actually pick up the brick
5091000	5093000	and turn it around and you might see that
5093000	5095000	it's N-O something
5095000	5097000	so it's New Orleans is where you're
5097000	5099000	supposed to go, type of thing is N-O
5099000	5101000	or you might find that
5101000	5103000	lying on the couch is a ticket
5103000	5105000	for the ferry or something
5105000	5107000	so you actually kind of have to look around the room
5107000	5109000	looking for things, and you even look up at the
5109000	5111000	ceiling and you can see that it's raining
5111000	5113000	so you know that the scene is happening somewhere
5113000	5115000	in the US right now
5115000	5117000	or it's raining, so there's little clues
5117000	5119000	like that that you have to put together, so I thought that that was
5119000	5121000	really cool, that was like playing like a
5121000	5123000	90's adventure game, but instead
5123000	5125000	of clicking on things that are
5125000	5127000	in the scene, you're looking around you
5127000	5129000	at the scene and actually touching
5129000	5131000	them and interacting with them, and I just thought that was
5131000	5133000	such a neat, that was
5133000	5135000	such a cool use, and then when you're actually watching
5135000	5137000	the cutscenes, here's the crazy shit, so
5137000	5139000	since it scanned the room already
5139000	5141000	you'll be watching like the chief and her
5141000	5143000	two assistants or whatever, they're all talking and having
5143000	5145000	conversation, one of them will be sitting on your
5145000	5147000	couch and then suddenly stand up
5147000	5149000	as part of the scene and stuff, it's like, okay
5149000	5151000	so like it knew that you had a couch
5151000	5153000	because it put this character on the couch and
5153000	5155000	so I just thought that was so rad, how like it
5155000	5157000	actually used the room
5157000	5159000	so I would, now here's
5159000	5161000	the thing, the one drawback to Hololens is that
5161000	5163000	the field of vision
5163000	5165000	very very small, it's like
5165000	5167000	sitting right in front of a big screen TV
5167000	5169000	type of thing, and
5169000	5171000	so you, you know, it's very
5171000	5173000	obvious where the
5173000	5175000	holographic stuff begins and where it ends
5175000	5177000	so I don't think it's ready for primetime
5177000	5179000	so to speak? Oh definitely not,
5179000	5181000	the plan with the Hololens was gonna be
5181000	5183000	that, and this is
5183000	5185000	why they released it now, and
5185000	5187000	the release is not because
5187000	5189000	the idea is that for the next
5189000	5191000	probably three years, three or
5191000	5193000	so years, we're gonna be, we're supposed to
5193000	5195000	us as developers are supposed to get completely
5195000	5197000	comfortable with the Hololens, and the
5197000	5199000	goal right now from what I've learned again,
5199000	5201000	this will obviously change
5201000	5203000	it's to be earlier or later, but
5203000	5205000	2019 is supposed to be
5205000	5207000	the year that the first actual
5207000	5209000	full on
5209000	5211000	games for the commercial
5211000	5213000	or consumer version
5213000	5215000	of the Hololens is supposed to be for 2019
5215000	5217000	at some point, so
5217000	5219000	I'm not totally, you know, the experience
5219000	5221000	I played was neat, I don't know
5221000	5223000	what other types of games are gonna be
5223000	5225000	doable on this, I mean it's
5225000	5227000	I already have one I'm gonna make for it, so yeah
5227000	5229000	it's, you have to think about
5229000	5231000	games differently, I think in order to
5231000	5233000	make for the Hololens, and you know, Bobby's
5233000	5235000	had this conversation about, well he sees it more as
5235000	5237000	something that's gonna benefit
5237000	5239000	in non-gaming types of areas
5239000	5241000	just like Kinect kinda had
5241000	5243000	some of its biggest successes
5243000	5245000	in hospitals and things like that, you know, things that had
5245000	5247000	nothing to do with games, and Hololens may end up
5247000	5249000	being very similar, and that may be true
5249000	5251000	but I think there's going to be some great gaming
5251000	5253000	experiences in this thing, and I think you're right, by them
5253000	5255000	getting it out so early at least, people
5255000	5257000	can really think about, you know, have plenty of time to
5257000	5259000	consider what's that game gonna look like, but I gotta say
5259000	5261000	I kinda, like
5261000	5263000	everything I had heard about Hololens
5263000	5265000	was pretty tepid, because I think
5265000	5267000	they were showing things, like here's the Halo experience
5267000	5269000	and everybody's too focused on, well you
5269000	5271000	can't see, I mean the field of vision sucks
5271000	5273000	da da da da, but this concept
5273000	5275000	for this game that I saw was like
5275000	5277000	okay, this shows me
5277000	5279000	something that you can't, you can't
5279000	5281000	even do this in VR
5281000	5283000	Right, no you can't, right, absolutely
5283000	5285000	and definitely sells the difference between
5285000	5287000	here's the difference between holographic gaming
5287000	5289000	and virtual reality, so I thought that was just,
5289000	5291000	I thought it was neat. Absolutely, and I saw the
5291000	5293000	I see the Hololens as a great, just like
5293000	5295000	VR, I see the Hololens as a great
5295000	5297000	supplemental piece for
5297000	5299000	game development and gaming, not
5299000	5301000	so much primary, which I think
5301000	5303000	that's what a lot of people are
5303000	5305000	quick, so quickly impulsively jumping
5305000	5307000	to, it's like, oh this is going to be the next great gaming
5307000	5309000	experience, I know, I think it's going to be a good supplemental
5309000	5311000	gaming experience, as an
5311000	5313000	as an add-on, but it, you know
5313000	5315000	Virtual Boy tried, and we
5315000	5317000	already saw what happened with that, so just don't
5317000	5319000	just don't do that. We've come a long way since then.
5319000	5321000	We've come a long way since then, yeah.
5321000	5323000	Quickly, I want to talk about some other games I've played this week
5323000	5325000	Overwatch is having a free weekend on
5325000	5327000	PlayStation 4, so I finally got to play
5327000	5329000	with some of my pals, like Exeter and Flaco Jones
5329000	5331000	on PlayStation
5331000	5333000	Xbox also. It is so, yeah, it is
5333000	5335000	on Xbox One, it is so fucking
5335000	5337000	hard to play on a controller when you've been playing on keyboard
5337000	5339000	and mouse for so long, like
5339000	5341000	it's just, it feels weird, especially
5341000	5343000	playing something like Pharah, where I'm used to using
5343000	5345000	the right mouse button to levitate, like
5345000	5347000	now in this, it's like, okay, I have to use L1
5347000	5349000	to fly up, and then L2 to
5349000	5351000	levitate, it's just, it took me a long time
5351000	5353000	to get used to, and my aim still feels
5353000	5355000	ridiculous, but, you know
5355000	5357000	playing with friends has been
5357000	5359000	fun. Am I going to double dip the $50
5359000	5361000	to buy it again? No, I'm sorry to my
5361000	5363000	friends on console, which is, I can't justify that.
5363000	5365000	And I think it's just, it's a little ridiculous
5365000	5367000	that Blizzard knows it's me.
5367000	5369000	No, because I tied my battle
5369000	5371000	tag to it a long time ago with
5371000	5373000	Diablo or something, which I
5373000	5375000	guess I did kind of double dip on, but in my
5375000	5377000	defense, the PC version had been free with
5377000	5379000	World of Warcraft, so.
5379000	5381000	So, but I'm not going to double dip on
5381000	5383000	Overwatch. If they knock the price down to 20 bucks,
5383000	5385000	maybe, but it's Blizzard, that's not going to happen
5385000	5387000	for a good long time.
5387000	5389000	But it was still fun to check out.
5389000	5391000	Speaking of World of Warcraft, I've been playing Legion
5391000	5393000	now that I'm back from Dragon Con.
5393000	5395000	Hey, the new expansion, pretty darn
5395000	5397000	good, I gotta say. And it
5397000	5399000	brought back, I think, 3
5399000	5401000	million new people
5401000	5403000	because of that expansion. You know,
5403000	5405000	it's very interesting how they've really
5405000	5407000	taken out a lot of the, you go
5407000	5409000	to this zone to do these levels,
5409000	5411000	and you go to this zone to do these levels,
5411000	5413000	and they've kind of taken more of an approach of, nah,
5413000	5415000	everything scales. Everything scales
5415000	5417000	until you get to 110, so you do things
5417000	5419000	in the order that you want to do for the story.
5419000	5421000	And that alone is really,
5421000	5423000	I don't know, it's just really changed a lot of the feel
5423000	5425000	of the game, and it kind of gets you more into the quests
5425000	5427000	and, you know, the dungeons
5427000	5429000	really feel now more like an end piece
5429000	5431000	to a storyline in a zone.
5431000	5433000	It's just, it's very, very interesting the way they've
5433000	5435000	done it. I'm into it. But isn't that,
5435000	5437000	and maybe this is a dumb question,
5437000	5439000	I apologize if this almost sounds ignorant,
5439000	5441000	but isn't that the point? Isn't that,
5441000	5443000	wasn't that what they should, what is, I don't,
5443000	5445000	again, I don't know what, how it was initially,
5445000	5447000	because I haven't touched, I've played,
5447000	5449000	I've played two hours of
5449000	5451000	WoW at the start, and that was, I couldn't do it anymore.
5451000	5453000	No, because you would kind of feel
5453000	5455000	this pressure to just, you know,
5455000	5457000	you know, fuck how you get there, you just need to
5457000	5459000	get to the max level as fast as you can.
5459000	5461000	So once you're ready to go to a new zone, you just
5461000	5463000	kind of stop where you're at and you go to that next zone.
5463000	5465000	That's been a lot of how you've
5465000	5467000	been playing MMOs in general
5467000	5469000	till today. This one kind of
5469000	5471000	stops, says, you know what, there's
5471000	5473000	no, you just do whatever you want
5473000	5475000	and everything's going to scale. And so
5475000	5477000	it's really kind of changed the game in that regard.
5477000	5479000	Interesting, that's nice. So I just, if you haven't played
5479000	5481000	WoW in a little while, Legion's kind of worth
5481000	5483000	checking out. I gotta say, I've been enjoying
5483000	5485000	it. I've enjoyed it more than Draenor
5485000	5487000	for sure.
5487000	5489000	Pandaria, I think
5489000	5491000	it's probably a better expansion than Pandaria,
5491000	5493000	probably a better expansion than Cataclysm.
5493000	5495000	It's a little early to say for sure, because I need to play
5495000	5497000	more of it and see what the end game looks like, and more importantly
5497000	5499000	what the support looks like.
5499000	5501000	But I'm very encouraged,
5501000	5503000	I'm very encouraged that they're already talking about
5503000	5505000	7.1. That's very
5505000	5507000	encouraging, that Blizzard may be remedying
5507000	5509000	what was their weakest point.
5509000	5511000	Still trying to play Final Fantasy 14
5511000	5513000	though, even with WoW, because Final Fantasy
5513000	5515000	14 had an anniversary event going on
5515000	5517000	and I had to check that out.
5517000	5519000	So, I'm a little MMO'd
5519000	5521000	out almost, but never, never.
5521000	5523000	Okay, one more thing I gotta talk about.
5523000	5525000	Luminous is out
5525000	5527000	on iPhone.
5527000	5529000	So, do you remember last week, or two weeks
5529000	5531000	ago we talked about Luminous and we were like, oh it's
5531000	5533000	new portrait mode, and we're like, no, that can't,
5533000	5535000	that's not the orientation. No, it is.
5535000	5537000	Portrait mode is the new orientation. You now play vertically
5537000	5539000	with Luminous, which was
5539000	5541000	kind of weird to see at first.
5541000	5543000	It works, but
5543000	5545000	oh, and Luminous on mobile phones
5545000	5547000	has Shinen. They've got the
5547000	5549000	classic pack that has all the old school
5549000	5551000	songs, very, very cool.
5551000	5553000	Here's the biggest problem with Luminous,
5553000	5555000	it's on a touch phone. That's the
5555000	5557000	biggest problem with Luminous, because again,
5557000	5559000	the direction,
5559000	5561000	the left-right movements and down
5561000	5563000	to move the piece down a touch, it's just not
5563000	5565000	responsive enough. And I need to remind
5565000	5567000	myself, any time that I think
5567000	5569000	a console experience is gonna make for
5569000	5571000	a good iPhone experience, it's
5571000	5573000	not. If it's just gonna be a port
5573000	5575000	or vice versa, which
5575000	5577000	y'all are gonna try to get me
5577000	5579000	in a few minutes here when we talk about one of the big stories
5579000	5581000	of the week from me just saying that, but
5581000	5583000	there's a big difference between porting
5583000	5585000	something that was originally on consoles
5585000	5587000	and designing something with
5587000	5589000	the mobile space in mind.
5589000	5591000	So, that
5591000	5593000	being said, I still think if you're a
5593000	5595000	fan of Luminous, it's what, three bucks?
5595000	5597000	It's worth checking out. It's far better than the one
5597000	5599000	they put out years ago
5599000	5601000	when I think the 4 was the iPhone that was
5601000	5603000	going around. It's far better and more responsive
5603000	5605000	than that, but from a
5605000	5607000	precision standpoint, I just think
5607000	5609000	if you're good at Luminous and you need the
5609000	5611000	precision that comes with being good, you're gonna get
5611000	5613000	really fucking frustrated that
5613000	5615000	it's touch controls. But
5615000	5617000	Shinen, that song
5617000	5619000	rocks!
5619000	5621000	That's a good call. That's a good call on that.
5621000	5623000	So yeah, good look on that.
5623000	5625000	So there you go. That was my gaming
5625000	5627000	week. Some quick announcements,
5627000	5629000	then we gotta get into the news. I gotta plug
5629000	5631000	GamerX4. We're gonna be there. We're gonna be at
5631000	5633000	GamerX4 at a table
5633000	5635000	in like three weeks. I can't believe
5635000	5637000	it's coming up that soon, but VOG Network will be
5637000	5639000	there at a table. Myself, Dark
5639000	5641000	Sakura, Shane now telling me he might go,
5641000	5643000	so that's pretty cool. And
5643000	5645000	a panel
5645000	5647000	Sunday, 2 o'clock,
5647000	5649000	the Indie Gamer Super Show with
5649000	5651000	myself, Dark Sakura, Captain Spike from
5651000	5653000	Gameboi.org, and whoever
5653000	5655000	else we pull onto our thing at the last minute.
5655000	5657000	Oh, congrats, man. That's gonna be
5657000	5659000	fun. Wonderful. I'm very excited.
5659000	5661000	Are you going? Because I know IGDA has a presence
5661000	5663000	this year. I've
5663000	5665000	heard bits and pieces
5665000	5667000	a bit about it, but I don't know. I tried
5667000	5669000	to myself get a table for NASA games, but
5669000	5671000	budget-wise, it was out of my budget at the time.
5671000	5673000	So I mean, I don't know
5673000	5675000	too much about that. I know there's been
5675000	5677000	a little more talk about the MagWest thing,
5677000	5679000	because apparently MagWest is doing, they're
5679000	5681000	having a gathering
5681000	5683000	later this month in San Jose. I think
5683000	5685000	they're doing the arcade
5685000	5687000	portion of whatever's going on at GamerX
5687000	5689000	too, so I think the early scenes. Oh, that makes sense.
5689000	5691000	Yeah. Which, by the way, I
5691000	5693000	don't know, since I haven't seen you in a little while,
5693000	5695000	I already have my hotel and tickets for
5695000	5697000	MagFest 2017, just so you know.
5697000	5699000	Nice. I'm gonna be there. I don't know if you're going back, but
5699000	5701000	I'm hoping they'll go back. I've reconnected with them
5701000	5703000	recently, so we're hoping.
5703000	5705000	Good. Good. Sounds good.
5705000	5707000	Alright, and then
5707000	5709000	the DragonCon Super Show. So we did
5709000	5711000	have a new show on VoG last
5711000	5713000	week. We actually taped in the VoG
5713000	5715000	suite. We did a special show
5715000	5717000	with hosts from this show,
5717000	5719000	Bobby Blackwolf, Pod Culture,
5719000	5721000	British Invaders, Critical Myth.
5721000	5723000	I'm leaving somebody out, and I'm gonna
5723000	5725000	hate myself for it later, but people came
5725000	5727000	together from all those shows, and
5727000	5729000	we did this Super Show
5729000	5731000	that's gonna be available.
5731000	5733000	Here's the thing, since it wasn't really something to
5733000	5735000	it's not gonna be on the podcast feed, it's gonna be on
5735000	5737000	YouTube. So Bobby's putting
5737000	5739000	that all together right now, putting on the B-roll
5739000	5741000	in. I don't know when, but it will be
5741000	5743000	on YouTube for you guys.
5743000	5745000	Yeah, I know, we're trying to get our
5745000	5747000	trying to warm up to that a little more. Do it!
5747000	5749000	I've been only pushing you since the day I met
5749000	5751000	you. I thought I said British
5751000	5753000	Invaders. Did I not say British Invaders? You said British Invaders.
5753000	5755000	I thought I did. That's what Brad from
5755000	5757000	Pod Culture said. So anyway, hopefully I didn't
5757000	5759000	leave anybody out, but yeah, we
5759000	5761000	did a fun little show there.
5761000	5763000	And that's probably a tradition we'll
5763000	5765000	continue next year. We'll see.
5765000	5767000	Okay, we gotta get to some gamer news. We're only
5767000	5769000	what, an hour and a half into the show? Let's get to some news.
5769000	5771000	Loki. So
5771000	5773000	Apple had their conference where they
5773000	5775000	talked about the new phone
5775000	5777000	and everything, but one of the announcements that they had
5777000	5779000	which was kind of odd was
5779000	5781000	Nintendo was there. It was like,
5781000	5783000	what the fuck? Why is Nintendo here?
5783000	5785000	And so they had some game announcements. The first
5785000	5787000	one is Super Mario Run,
5787000	5789000	which is going to be coming to iOS first.
5789000	5791000	It's a mobile game of Endless Runner,
5791000	5793000	if you will, where you're Mario
5793000	5795000	and you jump on platforms
5795000	5797000	and... Or you could just play
5797000	5799000	New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii U
5799000	5801000	and have a better experience.
5801000	5803000	Anyway, I'm done. I don't know.
5803000	5805000	I'm not so
5805000	5807000	ready to write it off because one of
5807000	5809000	Nintendo's biggest strengths, always has been,
5809000	5811000	always will be, is level design.
5811000	5813000	And so even though we're calling this
5813000	5815000	an Endless Runner, it's
5815000	5817000	not really endless because it looks like there's
5817000	5819000	definitely these setup stages and so forth
5819000	5821000	and it just looks like the way things are set up
5821000	5823000	there's going to be a definite, you know,
5823000	5825000	there's the obvious path and then there'll be
5825000	5827000	the path that includes all the red coins
5827000	5829000	and all that other fun stuff. And so I just
5829000	5831000	feel like there'll probably be more depth to this
5831000	5833000	than your typical quote-unquote
5833000	5835000	Endless Runner. So I'm curious,
5835000	5837000	I want to know what the price is going to be.
5837000	5839000	That's the big thing for me. Is this going to
5839000	5841000	be a $3 game? If so, fuck
5841000	5843000	yeah. It's going to have in-app purchases
5843000	5845000	though. Or is, no it's not. They've, they've
5845000	5847000	come, well, they wrote that off. It's a
5847000	5849000	free demo and the in-app purchase
5849000	5851000	is the game. That's it.
5851000	5853000	Yeah, they wrote off the in-app purchase
5853000	5855000	thing. They say we're not going to do that.
5855000	5857000	That's what the description said. Yeah, no, the description
5857000	5859000	says that because the game will be the one
5859000	5861000	level demo and then the in-app purchase is the rest
5861000	5863000	of it. Which a lot of other games do.
5863000	5865000	Yeah. But here's, you know, could it be
5865000	5867000	a $20 game? Because honest,
5867000	5869000	honestly, Nintendo could get away
5869000	5871000	with it. No. Square Enix
5871000	5873000	does. Yeah, and that's funny. You said
5873000	5875000	that I was going to actually, I was going to say they pulled it off
5875000	5877000	they did it with Final Fantasy. Yeah.
5877000	5879000	And everybody loves Square Enix for that. Be prepared.
5879000	5881000	I think they're going to charge $19.99
5881000	5883000	for it. I think they will. I think they're
5883000	5885000	going to be that bold. My hope is $9.99
5885000	5887000	but I fear you might be right
5887000	5889000	but I hope $9.99.
5889000	5891000	Yeah. Well that's good. They can charge rid of the
5891000	5893000	fuck they want for it. I'll still buy it. I will.
5893000	5895000	Part of the problem.
5895000	5897000	I will. I don't, I just, I know
5897000	5899000	it's going to be solid. Part of the problem, man. I know.
5899000	5901000	I know. However,
5901000	5903000	other things that were kind of in little footnotes
5903000	5905000	there, they're going to have a Fire Emblem game
5905000	5907000	and Animal Crossing.
5907000	5909000	Animal Crossing.
5909000	5911000	Well that's going to do
5911000	5913000	pretty well. Well
5913000	5915000	actually those games though, even though they
5915000	5917000	talked about those games, those games are supposed
5917000	5919000	to be out I believe by this holiday.
5919000	5921000	Yeah. And they just, they suddenly
5921000	5923000	put in there that Fire Emblem and
5923000	5925000	Animal Crossing are now going to be coming out before
5925000	5927000	the end of March 2017.
5927000	5929000	So those games quietly
5929000	5931000	getting delayed in favor of Super Mario.
5931000	5933000	Will mobile games be for the NX?
5933000	5935000	Could be. Well, who knows?
5935000	5937000	I think there's going to be, I made
5937000	5939000	I made a, I don't like, I hate
5939000	5941000	speculation but I had to have a little fun
5941000	5943000	with it anyway. I think there's going to be
5943000	5945000	I think whatever the NX
5945000	5947000	is going to be is going to have a straight up
5947000	5949000	tie into why they're
5949000	5951000	releasing the games on the iPhone.
5951000	5953000	I think they're going to try to pull almost
5953000	5955000	and please forgive
5955000	5957000	me for those who, please forgive
5957000	5959000	me guys, but I almost smell
5959000	5961000	the same approach that Ouya did
5961000	5963000	where the next console
5963000	5965000	is going to be, yeah you can play it on our console
5965000	5967000	you know, but you'll also be able to download it here
5967000	5969000	and play it here and there will be some maybe crossplay
5969000	5971000	or something like that. Yeah, it kind of vomited in my mouth
5971000	5973000	a little bit when you said that. That's why I
5973000	5975000	apologize in advance but I'm just saying because
5975000	5977000	like just these announcements are really
5977000	5979000	really weird. I gotta say, the
5979000	5981000	Mario thing, it did throw me
5981000	5983000	for a loop a little bit. I wasn't
5983000	5985000	yep, props to Apple, props to Nintendo.
5985000	5987000	I wasn't expecting that. Sorry Black Wolf
5987000	5989000	I see you're here. It was courageous of them
5989000	5991000	to put it on the platform.
5991000	5993000	Yeah it was, yeah.
5993000	5995000	Well just so you know though, they
5995000	5997000	did say it's coming to Android as well.
5997000	5999000	So you're not going to get left in the cold if you're on
5999000	6001000	Android. Thank God. It's just
6001000	6003000	iPhone first or something like that, right?
6003000	6005000	Who cares? But then
6005000	6007000	that raises the question about what happens
6007000	6009000	with the next DS.
6009000	6011000	That's what I want to know. That's why this
6011000	6013000	surprised me because I was like well wait, hold
6013000	6015000	hold up, hold up. If
6015000	6017000	the NX is going to be
6017000	6019000	portable then why
6019000	6021000	is suddenly Nintendo going
6021000	6023000	third party on another platform
6023000	6025000	and all of a sudden all this
6025000	6027000	endless ocean of wank
6027000	6029000	that we have on Twitter about
6029000	6031000	Nintendo should put Super Mario
6031000	6033000	on the PlayStation 4. It's like
6033000	6035000	shut up, that's never going to happen but it's like
6035000	6037000	it kind of just fucking did this week. If you
6037000	6039000	ever write a book you need to call it that.
6039000	6041000	My endless ocean of wank.
6043000	6045000	I thought that's what I tell the boys
6045000	6047000	on Grindr.
6047000	6049000	But we already had a similar title for that. Remember
6049000	6051000	it was like pissing in
6051000	6053000	an ocean of piss or something like that.
6053000	6055000	That's right.
6055000	6057000	That'll be the OLR documentary
6057000	6059000	or the Behind the
6059000	6061000	Music on the Making of Kinship.
6063000	6065000	Anyway, no. If they
6065000	6067000	ever did a documentary on the making of kinship you know
6067000	6069000	it's going to be called Special Thanks.
6069000	6071000	Word up.
6071000	6073000	You heard that fools.
6073000	6075000	Now here's the thing.
6075000	6077000	They made it very clear
6077000	6079000	it's not a traditional
6079000	6081000	Mario game because Mario is
6081000	6083000	obviously doing the endless running thing. You don't have to do
6083000	6085000	the left and right controls.
6085000	6087000	Having played Luminous let me tell you
6087000	6089000	it's not going to fucking work and I'm glad
6089000	6091000	they don't have Mario going left and right
6091000	6093000	and all that. This is how you make it work.
6093000	6095000	You have one
6095000	6097000	button. This game is played with one
6097000	6099000	button. Touch. Touch.
6099000	6101000	Touch. Touch. That's how the game
6101000	6103000	works. That's it. So if you want
6103000	6105000	a more in-depth Mario experience you're
6105000	6107000	going to have to go to the NX.
6107000	6109000	But at the same time
6109000	6111000	hasn't Nintendo told us that 2D Mario
6111000	6113000	is kind of like Mario Maker was
6113000	6115000	kind of the swong song for 2D Mario.
6115000	6117000	Here comes your encore during the week
6117000	6119000	we were off.
6119000	6121000	They're doing new Super Mario Brothers games
6121000	6123000	which are basically 2D Mario games.
6123000	6125000	They look dumb.
6125000	6127000	They're not 2D.
6127000	6129000	Seriously.
6129000	6131000	Fucking get the Rayman team on
6131000	6133000	a 2D Mario game or any
6133000	6135000	Zelda title.
6135000	6137000	Hand drawn, hand painted
6137000	6139000	Mario game.
6139000	6141000	I'm sorry. They did that already.
6141000	6143000	They had Wario Land shake.
6143000	6145000	Which was fantastic
6145000	6147000	looking. Just no one played it.
6147000	6149000	I put up a tweet
6149000	6151000	a couple days ago about
6151000	6153000	I know we'll talk later about this
6153000	6155000	with Interplay and them selling their
6155000	6157000	assets. And all I said
6157000	6159000	was Earthworm Jim
6159000	6161000	Ubisoft Rayman Origins
6161000	6163000	Legends team. That's what I need
6163000	6165000	to see. So yeah. That's what I want to see.
6165000	6167000	But I hope you're wrong
6167000	6169000	though. I hope the Mario
6169000	6171000	Maker is not the swong song
6171000	6173000	because I really would love to see
6173000	6175000	you know
6175000	6177000	those type of graphics
6177000	6179000	again. But yeah.
6179000	6181000	Let me go to some chat comments
6181000	6183000	over at live.vognetwork.com
6183000	6185000	Ranma in our chat says iPhone users
6185000	6187000	can lose their shit over Super Mario Run
6187000	6189000	but us Android users still have our
6189000	6191000	headphone jacks. Oh yes.
6191000	6193000	Here's the thing you Android users
6193000	6195000	get with your Note 7s. When you beat
6195000	6197000	Super Mario Run and the fireworks go off
6197000	6199000	at the end of the stage, your phone also
6199000	6201000	blows up. That's what you get
6201000	6203000	as a Note 7 user.
6203000	6205000	Well that's alright you know because at least we don't have
6205000	6207000	one of those iPhones that you can bend in half
6207000	6209000	like a cracker.
6209000	6211000	I thought
6211000	6213000	that joke is so 2014. Come on.
6213000	6215000	We're past the bendable
6215000	6217000	iPhone. Like those stupid
6217000	6219000	3.5mm
6219000	6221000	phone jacks or audio jacks.
6221000	6223000	Here's my thing. I'm actually
6223000	6225000	I have upgraded iPhone every time I'm
6225000	6227000	eligible. I'm not going to get an iPhone 7. It actually has
6227000	6229000	nothing to do with the headphone jack thing. It's just
6229000	6231000	okay. It's a new camera.
6231000	6233000	Yeah.
6233000	6235000	Yeah. My 6
6235000	6237000	My 6 is good enough for now.
6237000	6239000	It takes a better picture.
6239000	6241000	It takes a better selfie.
6241000	6243000	JD in chat says hey maybe they should port
6243000	6245000	Rhythm Tengoku Gold to touchscreen smartphones.
6245000	6247000	I'd be down with that. That would be a good franchise.
6247000	6249000	You know we know that Nintendo
6249000	6251000	was working on several. Well now we know
6251000	6253000	Mario was one of them apparently.
6253000	6255000	For whatever reason they've bumped this to the front of the line.
6255000	6257000	I'm not sure
6257000	6259000	maybe this has to do with Pokemon
6259000	6261000	and the fact that their stock went way up with Pokemon.
6261000	6263000	Namco. I could use some
6263000	6265000	Taiko no Tatujin.
6265000	6267000	All right.
6267000	6269000	Let's move on.
6269000	6271000	Loki what do you have next? Speaking of Pokemon
6271000	6273000	Go right? Yes.
6273000	6275000	Pokemon Go is getting an update.
6275000	6277000	They're updating finally to
6277000	6279000	0.37
6279000	6281000	or something. And what it's going to add is
6281000	6283000	the ability for players to turn
6283000	6285000	one of their Pokemon into a buddy. So you can basically
6285000	6287000	when you're walking or driving
6287000	6289000	or whatever they
6289000	6291000	earn candy for
6291000	6293000	the distance that you walk. Also apparently there's
6293000	6295000	a nice little easter egg where if you walk with
6295000	6297000	Pikachu for 10 kilometers he hops
6297000	6299000	on your shoulder. So that's kind of neat.
6299000	6301000	The update will
6301000	6303000	also I guess make it
6303000	6305000	easier to
6305000	6307000	choose smaller Pokemon on the map.
6307000	6309000	Also prevent eggs hatching
6309000	6311000	without animations
6311000	6313000	or something like that. And I want
6313000	6315000	to say that there was something that was supposed to make
6315000	6317000	leveling up easier. Oh
6317000	6319000	and fuck you for if you have a jailbroken
6319000	6321000	or rooted phone like my son
6321000	6323000	does because their fucking app
6323000	6325000	is not supported on that phone
6325000	6327000	despite the fact that it runs just
6327000	6329000	perfectly fine so I had to fucking root it
6329000	6331000	to get it on there. Oh but fuck him
6331000	6333000	because he must be a cheater because that's what they're assuming
6333000	6335000	because they're Niantic and don't want to fucking
6335000	6337000	fix their problems. Instead they're just going to blame
6337000	6339000	everybody that has a rooted phone for fucking
6339000	6341000	cheating. There's already a
6341000	6343000	workaround for it but it's a pain in the fucking
6343000	6345000	ass. And why should I have to
6345000	6347000	you know
6347000	6349000	spend all this effort to play your fucking
6349000	6351000	game that I paid money
6351000	6353000	for as well to
6353000	6355000	you know purchase items because I thought I would kick
6355000	6357000	you some money before making this game.
6357000	6359000	But then here's how you fucking repay
6359000	6361000	me by fucking me over.
6361000	6363000	Well what would you expect from a
6363000	6365000	studio that can't even
6365000	6367000	call its version version one?
6367000	6369000	It has to be 0.3 point
6369000	6371000	I mean what is this? I mean what
6371000	6373000	happened here? Because the game's not fucking
6373000	6375000	finished. It won't ever be done.
6375000	6377000	It's going to be another No Man's Sky.
6377000	6379000	So I mean it's like seriously.
6379000	6381000	That's unfortunate.
6381000	6383000	But you know what? You know what's good though?
6383000	6385000	I'm so glad that they focused
6385000	6387000	their shit on instead of fixing
6387000	6389000	the problems. They've got Pokemon
6389000	6391000	Go coming out for the new fucking
6391000	6393000	iWatch or
6393000	6395000	Apple thing. And oh it looks so
6395000	6397000	fucking fantastic on that tiny little fucking
6397000	6399000	screen. I'm so glad that they
6399000	6401000	could focus their fucking efforts on that.
6401000	6403000	But fuck all you guys. I guess fuck you
6403000	6405000	if you have your own stupid rooted phone.
6405000	6407000	You better fucking buy an iWatch because at least
6407000	6409000	that shit will work. Hey you want to know something fucking
6409000	6411000	funny? You're releasing this stupid
6411000	6413000	Pokemon Go Plus in what literally
6413000	6415000	days now that I'm going to fucking
6415000	6417000	hack the shit out of and there's not
6417000	6419000	a fucking thing you can do about it.
6419000	6421000	But you know go ahead and punish everybody
6421000	6423000	that has a fucking rooted phone because
6423000	6425000	they're the fucking hackers. I don't have a
6425000	6427000	rooted phone and I'm going to hack the shit out of your shit.
6427000	6429000	The following comments are not necessarily
6429000	6431000	of OLR and its affiliates.
6431000	6433000	Okay so here's the thing.
6433000	6435000	They actually counted how many fucks were in that
6435000	6437000	segment in our chat room. 15.
6437000	6439000	That's not enough.
6439000	6441000	So okay I will say this.
6441000	6443000	As cute as the Watch thing
6443000	6445000	looks and if I were into the Apple Watch
6445000	6447000	I'd probably be into the
6447000	6449000	if Jamie were here she'd be raging so hard right now.
6449000	6451000	But if I were into
6451000	6453000	the Apple Watch thing I'd probably be into
6453000	6455000	the Pokemon Go thing because it did look cute
6455000	6457000	you know for what the Watch does. That's awesome.
6457000	6459000	I can take both hands off the steering wheel when I play in the car.
6459000	6461000	Okay that's funny.
6461000	6463000	Okay but
6463000	6465000	it does seem a little bit reductive
6465000	6467000	to the
6467000	6469000	physical Pokemon Go
6469000	6471000	thing that Nintendo's trying to make money
6471000	6473000	off of that's coming out next week.
6473000	6475000	Like I don't fucking need that now
6475000	6477000	if I have an Apple Watch it sure seems like.
6477000	6479000	Well no you still do because you play the Apple Watch
6479000	6481000	one just like you do the actual game.
6481000	6483000	So you actually I think you throw balls and stuff like that.
6483000	6485000	No you still hatch eggs and all that stuff.
6485000	6487000	Yeah you still do all that.
6487000	6489000	Here's the thing is like I mean seriously like
6489000	6491000	like I've heard
6491000	6493000	rumors that one of the other reasons that they may have
6493000	6495000	you know blocked it for rooted people is
6495000	6497000	because they're going to like somehow abuse
6497000	6499000	the device. I'm like dude you don't even need a
6499000	6501000	rooted device. Hello look at
6501000	6503000	okay the way this device works is
6503000	6505000	it indicates any time that you have to
6505000	6507000	push the button. It flashes a light or
6507000	6509000	rumbles. There's electricity going
6509000	6511000	to that light there's electricity going to that rumble
6511000	6513000	motor. You fucking just
6513000	6515000	solder a goddamn wire from
6515000	6517000	that to the switch. Bada bing
6517000	6519000	eight fucking auto hacks your stupid
6519000	6521000	fucking pokey stops and auto catches
6521000	6523000	fucking Pokemon by one
6523000	6525000	fucking wire. He just went
6525000	6527000	sopranos on us. I'm with
6527000	6529000	William Murderface in our chat. Loki dropped out of
6529000	6531000	rant space. Someone vent the rant core
6531000	6533000	breach.
6533000	6535000	Good lord.
6535000	6537000	It's fucking disappointing.
6537000	6539000	Now I gotta explain to my son who fucking
6539000	6541000	loves playing Pokemon Go. I'm sorry
6541000	6543000	Niantic fucking hates you because you're a cheater
6543000	6545000	so you can't play anymore. You're not worthy
6545000	6547000	son. I mean
6547000	6549000	seriously he is fucking in the
6549000	6551000	Pokemon like crazy now because of Pokemon
6551000	6553000	Go and now sorry
6553000	6555000	fuck you. You don't get the play because
6555000	6557000	you're a fucking cheater. Thank you.
6557000	6559000	He's almost at 20. JD with the obvious question
6559000	6561000	in chat that I have to ask as well
6561000	6563000	live.vognorant.com just don't update the app
6563000	6565000	on his phone. Oh
6565000	6567000	I'm glad you thought of that except
6567000	6569000	Niantic also fucking thinks about that because
6569000	6571000	see I have this other app called Ingress
6571000	6573000	and if you don't fucking update it it doesn't
6573000	6575000	fucking work.
6575000	6577000	So that's what's gonna fucking happen is because
6577000	6579000	they'll check your version of it and I'm sorry
6579000	6581000	you need to update your fucking app to play this.
6581000	6583000	26
6583000	6585000	This is great.
6585000	6587000	Wow. And the most important
6587000	6589000	about what he just said
6589000	6591000	for those new to counting
6591000	6593000	numbers you've
6593000	6595000	just received a great lesson
6595000	6597000	on how to count. I'll put it in the review
6597000	6599000	of the app.
6601000	6603000	Oh my god.
6603000	6605000	Alright. Let's talk about something that
6605000	6607000	God I just wish he'd won
6607000	6609000	the goddamn techno motion machine.
6609000	6611000	It would have been half
6611000	6613000	the fucks. You'd be like I don't give
6613000	6615000	a fuck about it. I don't give a fuck but life
6615000	6617000	is great. I got a machine.
6617000	6619000	Alright. Let's talk about
6619000	6621000	Interplay. Gabe mentioned this earlier.
6621000	6623000	They are going to be selling their games
6623000	6625000	and intellectual property so
6625000	6627000	if you want to buy an intellectual
6627000	6629000	property such as Earthworm Jim
6629000	6631000	or MDK or Clay Fighter
6631000	6633000	fuck yeah. Oh my god.
6633000	6635000	Clay Fighter was awesome. Or Descent
6635000	6637000	or Battle Chess
6637000	6639000	get to it. You can
6639000	6641000	actually do that.
6641000	6643000	Let's see. Wedbush
6643000	6645000	Securities is going to be assisting Interplay with
6645000	6647000	the sales of the IP so I'm
6647000	6649000	very curious to see what happens in a couple months with
6649000	6651000	who buys what.
6651000	6653000	See it's moments like this
6653000	6655000	that I as a startup indie studio
6655000	6657000	wish I could afford to get something
6657000	6659000	like that because I know
6659000	6661000	that would be so beneficial for
6661000	6663000	my team. Especially for some of my team where
6663000	6665000	they're kind of the younger generation so they
6665000	6667000	don't know. They aren't familiar
6667000	6669000	with those older games back in the
6669000	6671000	early mid 90s
6671000	6673000	and so on and so forth. It'd be great to be like you have
6673000	6675000	no idea. Earthworm Jim
6675000	6677000	no idea. Clay Fighter
6677000	6679000	I need you to write me a theme
6679000	6681000	song like the Clay Fighter song
6681000	6683000	which actually if you remember on the
6683000	6685000	Super Nintendo I think had the vocal
6685000	6687000	Yeah it did.
6687000	6689000	It's like
6689000	6691000	everybody remembers that because like
6691000	6693000	when did the fucking new Super Nintendo talk
6693000	6695000	to you during Super Metroid and
6695000	6697000	during Clay Fighter. Well NBA Jam.
6697000	6699000	Ok one or two other times too.
6699000	6701000	Right.
6701000	6703000	Very true. Very true.
6705000	6707000	To register participation for this week's episode
6707000	6709000	of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com
6709000	6711000	use the passphrase
6711000	6713000	wolf. Anyhow, Loki what do you have
6713000	6715000	next for us. Alright
6715000	6717000	so the next thing I have we're going to talk a little
6717000	6719000	bit about is
6719000	6721000	Mario games
6721000	6723000	and Miyamoto basically saying
6723000	6725000	hey you know what
6725000	6727000	Mario's just not going to really work
6727000	6729000	out for VR. Damn right. It's not
6729000	6731000	going to be a good fit and I kind of I could see
6731000	6733000	that because I mean think
6733000	6735000	about it. It's platforming. It's lots of
6735000	6737000	movement. That's going to make people sick.
6737000	6739000	Basically saying you know I agree
6739000	6741000	that adapting Mario to new platforms is key
6741000	6743000	to keeping him relevant but we want families
6743000	6745000	to play together and virtual reality
6745000	6747000	which requires players to be closed off
6747000	6749000	from the real world doesn't really
6749000	6751000	fit in there. We also like people
6751000	6753000	playing for a long time and it's hard to do
6753000	6755000	that with VR. You don't need
6755000	6757000	VR to be closed off from the real world.
6757000	6759000	That's been happening since
6759000	6761000	the Atari days. That's an interesting statement.
6761000	6763000	I don't know if that's a good reason why not to do
6763000	6765000	it because if you think about it they can still
6765000	6767000	do like you know
6767000	6769000	like Sony's doing where they have you know
6769000	6771000	the multi-screenplay thing where it's
6771000	6773000	almost just like the Wii U where you add one person
6773000	6775000	on a gamepad. Everybody else is on the
6775000	6777000	TV. You know you could do that with VR.
6777000	6779000	Don't put Mario on VR. Yeah I was going to say but they're still
6779000	6781000	stationary and there
6781000	6783000	isn't the restriction other than
6783000	6785000	if you really want to vomit
6785000	6787000	fast you put Sonic in VR.
6787000	6789000	Like here's the thing.
6789000	6791000	That's just punishment. Holy shit. And this
6791000	6793000	goes back to what I was saying about you know
6793000	6795000	fragments and the AR space and
6795000	6797000	everything is that you know it's going to change the way
6797000	6799000	the game developers think about
6799000	6801000	games. It's like telling
6801000	6803000	a painter that now instead of
6803000	6805000	oil paints they have to paint with watercolor.
6805000	6807000	It's a whole new canvas so that doesn't mean
6807000	6809000	the same old ideas are going to necessarily work. I don't really
6809000	6811000	take a lot of this you know what he
6811000	6813000	says right now for
6813000	6815000	I don't know like how much of it
6815000	6817000	is just kind of a thing that he's saying right now because
6817000	6819000	if you think about it like if VR
6819000	6821000	becomes like the Del facto thing
6821000	6823000	of course they're going to put fucking Mario in VR.
6823000	6825000	I mean just like how they probably were saying oh
6825000	6827000	well we're not developing
6827000	6829000	mobile games because our games are too fucking awesome
6829000	6831000	for that and here they are developing a mobile
6831000	6833000	game so
6833000	6835000	I don't know. Did you say
6835000	6837000	Rob did you did I
6837000	6839000	maybe I was just
6839000	6841000	high but did you just say Mario
6841000	6843000	Paint by any chance?
6843000	6845000	No but I was comparing this to
6845000	6847000	painting so I can see why somebody would actually
6847000	6849000	come at the conclusion of Mario Paint. So okay
6849000	6851000	cool. So I wasn't entirely losing my mind
6851000	6853000	because I just had this wild thought like God
6853000	6855000	Mario Paint in VR which
6855000	6857000	that would be that would be freaking
6857000	6859000	awesome. By the way
6859000	6861000	perfect iOS Android
6861000	6863000	opportunity for Nintendo
6863000	6865000	just bring
6865000	6867000	back Mario Paint
6867000	6869000	and that most of all most
6869000	6871000	importantly that music generator thing they had
6871000	6873000	in Mario Paint. Oh my goodness yes.
6873000	6875000	And use the magic of the interwebs that
6875000	6877000	we can send our little Mario Paint
6877000	6879000	creations as text messages
6879000	6881000	and those silly little songs that we do in the
6881000	6883000	music generator we can send those
6883000	6885000	to each other somehow. Just food for thought.
6885000	6887000	And that'll never happen because it's too brilliant of a night.
6887000	6889000	Alright.
6889000	6891000	Anyhow speaking of VR
6891000	6893000	experiences this one would be worthy
6893000	6895000	of VR by the way. Space
6895000	6897000	Channel 5
6897000	6899000	Sega announced that there is
6899000	6901000	a Space Channel 5
6901000	6903000	VR called Ooki Ooki
6903000	6905000	Viewing Show and when I heard that Space Channel
6905000	6907000	5 was coming to
6907000	6909000	VR I about made an Ooki Ooki
6909000	6911000	in my pants because
6911000	6913000	I fucking love Space Channel 5
6913000	6915000	and so the thought of just getting
6915000	6917000	to you know strut along with
6917000	6919000	choo choo right along that
6919000	6921000	just I was so excited about that
6921000	6923000	um but
6923000	6925000	unfortunately it's actually not
6925000	6927000	the game the key word is
6927000	6929000	viewing show so you get to be
6929000	6931000	a program viewer of the report
6931000	6933000	show sadly it's not something
6933000	6935000	that lets you play the rhythm game. However
6935000	6937000	but see I still go
6937000	6939000	okay but it seems like they're testing
6939000	6941000	the waters if this does well
6941000	6943000	that's that right there though
6943000	6945000	see this type of thing is why I'm
6945000	6947000	hesitant with jumping
6947000	6949000	in on like Playstation VR because
6949000	6951000	all these games that come out are experiences
6951000	6953000	they're not a game
6953000	6955000	it's just like it's a thing
6955000	6957000	it's a small portion of what could be
6957000	6959000	a game it's basically like a
6959000	6961000	tech demo
6961000	6963000	that's just why
6963000	6965000	am I dropping $500
6965000	6967000	a platform for fucking tech demos
6967000	6969000	it's gonna be a Tokyo game show
6969000	6971000	so some folks will get to try that out
6971000	6973000	first hand and here's the interesting part
6973000	6975000	I just assumed it was Playstation VR
6975000	6977000	right it's actually not it's a Vive
6977000	6979000	um title so that kind of
6979000	6981000	surprised me but then again Sega's been doing
6981000	6983000	stuff for Steam so I guess it's
6983000	6985000	not as surprising but uh yeah
6985000	6987000	so it's actually an experience that's gonna be on the Vive
6987000	6989000	so some folks that are going to Tokyo Game
6989000	6991000	Show will get to check that out I don't know
6991000	6993000	if Akuma JP is going this year but if you are
6993000	6995000	you need to check that out for me please
6995000	6997000	alright
6997000	6999000	uh let's go to Loki
6999000	7001000	with another news story
7001000	7003000	so once again you know another reason like I'm
7003000	7005000	I bought Fallout
7005000	7007000	on Playstation 4 it's like sweet
7007000	7009000	cause I can my laptop
7009000	7011000	doesn't run these games that great
7011000	7013000	and you know I can also
7013000	7015000	do mods it's gonna be fucking awesome because
7015000	7017000	they talked about it at E3 and everything
7017000	7019000	yeah
7019000	7021000	unfortunately that's not gonna happen on Playstation 4
7021000	7023000	they did get they ended up releasing
7023000	7025000	mod support on Xbox
7025000	7027000	um back I wanna say in May
7027000	7029000	um it was supposed to be coming later
7029000	7031000	for Playstation 4 but
7031000	7033000	it's just not gonna happen anymore basically
7033000	7035000	as Bethesda put it on their website
7035000	7037000	after months of discussion with Sony we regret
7037000	7039000	to say that while we have long been
7039000	7041000	ready to offer mod support
7041000	7043000	on Playstation 4
7043000	7045000	Sony has informed us they will not approve
7045000	7047000	user mods the way they should work
7047000	7049000	where users can do anything they want
7049000	7051000	for either Fallout 4 or
7051000	7053000	Skyrim Special Edition
7053000	7055000	like you we are disappointed by Sony's decision
7055000	7057000	to give uh given the considerable
7057000	7059000	amount of time and effort we put into
7059000	7061000	the project and the amount
7061000	7063000	of time our fans have waited for mod
7063000	7065000	support to arrive we consider this
7065000	7067000	important initiative and we hope to find
7067000	7069000	other ways um user mods can be
7069000	7071000	available for the Playstation audience
7071000	7073000	however until Sony will allow us to
7073000	7075000	offer proper mod support for Playstation 4
7075000	7077000	that content for Fallout 4 and Skyrim
7077000	7079000	on Playstation 4 will not be available
7081000	7083000	thank you Sony
7083000	7085000	I appreciate this is really making me
7085000	7087000	warm up to your Playstation
7087000	7089000	platform
7089000	7091000	Sony's not having a good PR week
7091000	7093000	they kick so much ass
7093000	7095000	at E3 and god
7095000	7097000	help us with this
7097000	7099000	seriously though the ball is in their core for
7099000	7101000	a lot of shit that's just not fucking
7101000	7103000	working like Microsoft
7103000	7105000	saying hey you know what we would do
7105000	7107000	cross platform multiplayer
7107000	7109000	balls in your court Sony
7109000	7111000	fuck nothing
7111000	7113000	ok and then like
7113000	7115000	then this shit is just
7115000	7117000	oh I'm sorry we promised this
7117000	7119000	for our players you bought the game based
7119000	7121000	on this promise yeah
7121000	7123000	we're just not going to let you do that either
7123000	7125000	they're like so worried that their console is
7125000	7127000	going to get hacked or something or that this game would make
7127000	7129000	you know the game crash or something like that
7129000	7131000	who cares if it makes the game crash it's a mod
7131000	7133000	it may do that put a
7133000	7135000	fucking you know
7135000	7137000	someone might put
7137000	7139000	titties in the game
7139000	7141000	and then there would be titties
7141000	7143000	on your Playstation
7143000	7145000	and then somebody calls
7145000	7147000	channel 10 news because the
7147000	7149000	kindergartner at home saw titties
7149000	7151000	oh no they
7151000	7153000	saw titties what
7153000	7155000	god of war is fucking around the corner anyways
7155000	7157000	there's always titties in god of war I mean who cares
7157000	7159000	or there's titties in grand theft auto 4
7159000	7161000	right now or 5 I mean
7161000	7163000	so you know
7163000	7165000	what's the big deal there's titties already on there
7165000	7167000	it's a mature rated game
7167000	7169000	well we're not a mature rated
7169000	7171000	society that's the problem
7171000	7173000	so that's a good retort
7173000	7175000	I already have most of my people
7175000	7177000	in my you know settlements
7177000	7179000	without clothing anyways because
7179000	7181000	you can glitch it to do that
7181000	7183000	it's just a thing you do
7183000	7185000	so who cares I just think it's
7185000	7187000	stupid and this right here I'm not
7187000	7189000	buying Skyrim for Playstation 4
7189000	7191000	and if I do get an Xbox 1 I will be
7191000	7193000	buying multi platform games on
7193000	7195000	Xbox 1 because apparently they have their shit together
7195000	7197000	where Sony can't fucking
7197000	7199000	even emulate god damn Playstation 1 games
7199000	7201000	yet on their powerful fucking hardware
7201000	7203000	backwards compatibility folks remember that
7203000	7205000	it's stupid it's Playstation now
7205000	7207000	oh we got Playstation now no fuck
7207000	7209000	you I don't want Playstation now
7209000	7211000	I want this shit to fucking work because I bought it already
7211000	7213000	well Sony screwed themselves up anyway
7213000	7215000	because they built that Playstation 4 so
7215000	7217000	advanced thinking oh Xbox 1
7217000	7219000	they changed their architecture and they
7219000	7221000	essentially fell for the bluff
7221000	7223000	if you will saying oh well
7223000	7225000	Xbox 1 is not going to be able to play backwards compatibility
7225000	7227000	that means we're in the clear now because
7227000	7229000	Xbox because Microsoft said no
7229000	7231000	our next system is not going to be able to play 360 games
7231000	7233000	and then Microsoft went on Ninja
7233000	7235000	on Sony and said
7235000	7237000	hey surprise
7237000	7239000	through a nice software update and
7239000	7241000	Windows 10 we've just
7241000	7243000	not made a couple hundred games and that just screwed
7243000	7245000	Sony up it's sad they're doing backwards compatibility
7245000	7247000	better they're doing multiplayer
7247000	7249000	support better they're
7249000	7251000	supporting you know innovative
7251000	7253000	things on their platform it's just
7253000	7255000	weird that that's happening
7255000	7257000	it's also directly correlated
7257000	7259000	to when they threw one president out and got
7259000	7261000	another one yeah so
7261000	7263000	that's right knock down the 1%
7263000	7265000	fools all right DungeonBuster
7265000	7267000	in chat
7267000	7269000	saying Bethesda
7269000	7271000	pretty much threw Sony under the bus
7271000	7273000	yeah they did hell yeah that was
7273000	7275000	that was air that Bethesda put
7275000	7277000	Sony in the special thanks yes
7277000	7279000	they did there
7279000	7281000	were so because they put the
7281000	7283000	effort into it and Sony's like yeah
7283000	7285000	we're not doing it there were a bunch of issues
7285000	7287000	such as mods not having any sound because the
7287000	7289000	PlayStation 4 uses a proprietary sound format
7289000	7291000	that they needed to work around so
7291000	7293000	all
7293000	7295000	right anyhow uh
7295000	7297000	how would you like speaking of Microsoft
7297000	7299000	I mean how crazy would it be if suddenly
7299000	7301000	a Nintendo emulator came out
7301000	7303000	for the Xbox one then
7303000	7305000	boy Nintendo or excuse me
7305000	7307000	Microsoft even more fans if
7307000	7309000	they were to do that and it looked like
7309000	7311000	for a little bit this week that it might be happening
7311000	7313000	through the emulator
7313000	7315000	nest box actually
7315000	7317000	said on Twitter that their application
7317000	7319000	had passed Microsoft certification
7319000	7321000	process for the
7321000	7323000	Xbox and so it looked like
7323000	7325000	the nest box was going to be coming
7325000	7327000	out on the Xbox
7327000	7329000	one but a mere two days later
7329000	7331000	and I can't possibly imagine what happened
7331000	7333000	but a mere two days later all of a
7333000	7335000	sudden not only did this emulator get
7335000	7337000	yanked from
7337000	7339000	even potentially coming to the Xbox one
7339000	7341000	it got yanked from the mobile
7341000	7343000	phone and I think it's on the windows 10 store
7343000	7345000	or it's on one of the windows stores
7345000	7347000	fronts as well which
7347000	7349000	is interesting that okay
7349000	7351000	well we'll put emulators on those storefronts
7351000	7353000	you know nobody's paying
7353000	7355000	attention to windows phone anyway so
7355000	7357000	what the fuck we'll just let emulators on this platform
7357000	7359000	cause literally nobody's watching
7359000	7361000	so
7361000	7363000	but oh no the minute you say
7363000	7365000	you're going to put it on the Xbox now we're
7365000	7367000	going to have a problem that's what actually
7367000	7369000	happened here is that and the
7369000	7371000	reason was apps that are targeted
7371000	7373000	to Xbox one are primarily gaming
7373000	7375000	experiences must be approved
7375000	7377000	through the ID at Xbox program
7377000	7379000	and that was the excuse they used to yank it
7379000	7381000	all which makes sense because the ID at
7381000	7383000	Xbox one they only care about
7383000	7385000	the Xbox because do you know how many emulators
7385000	7387000	and roms are on the windows
7387000	7389000	mobile platform I had a windows phone I had no
7389000	7391000	idea do you know I oh my god it was so
7391000	7393000	easy to find super
7393000	7395000	mario world just a super mario world
7395000	7397000	and just play on my windows phone how is that legal
7397000	7399000	no one cared because
7399000	7401000	what because of the because what windows phone

7527000	7529000	the classic game of the week is tempest
7529000	7531000	not tempest 2000
7531000	7533000	which we've done before
7533000	7535000	not txk which is
7535000	7537000	fucking awesome and everyone needs to play it
7537000	7539000	get a vita right now it's the reason to have a vita
7539000	7541000	it's tempest
7541000	7543000	it came out in 1981
7543000	7545000	babies
7545000	7547000	oh then I was three just kidding okay whatever
7547000	7549000	let me feel old
7549000	7551000	it came out by atari
7551000	7553000	and it was designed by
7553000	7555000	some guy named dave
7555000	7557000	and my husband is texting me while
7557000	7559000	I am doing the classic game
7559000	7561000	um
7561000	7563000	dave thorough
7563000	7565000	it takes place on this kind
7565000	7567000	of tube thing
7567000	7569000	it is a three dimensional game but it
7569000	7571000	was done in vector
7571000	7573000	the original was
7573000	7575000	and so this surface
7575000	7577000	is sometimes a tube sometimes
7577000	7579000	it's planar
7579000	7581000	but you can basically move
7581000	7583000	this little claw shaped spaceship
7583000	7585000	named blaster
7585000	7587000	um around the play field
7587000	7589000	from segment to segment
7589000	7591000	um it was also
7591000	7593000	one of the first games that used atari's
7593000	7595000	color quadra scan vector
7595000	7597000	display and
7597000	7599000	you also got to choose your starting
7599000	7601000	level and it was called the skill step
7601000	7603000	that atari called it
7603000	7605000	um you also uh
7605000	7607000	could increase your maximum starting level
7607000	7609000	depending on your performance
7609000	7611000	in the previous game so you could keep
7611000	7613000	continuing from there and it was
7613000	7615000	so it was one of the first video games
7615000	7617000	that had progressive level design
7617000	7619000	um as far as the
7619000	7621000	way that the game the object of the game
7621000	7623000	you just basically have to survive as long as
7623000	7625000	possible and score as many points as
7625000	7627000	possible by cleaning off the screen
7627000	7629000	which is harder than it sounds oh my
7629000	7631000	god tempest is a whore
7631000	7633000	because you pay for it
7633000	7635000	you fucking pay for it
7635000	7637000	okay
7637000	7639000	anyway you get
7639000	7641000	who's tempest why are you calling her
7641000	7643000	such horrible things on this program dark
7643000	7645000	sagra tempest is a 50 year old drag
7645000	7647000	queen
7647000	7649000	sorry not sorry
7649000	7651000	um anyway um the players
7651000	7653000	ship uh gets to shoot
7653000	7655000	rapid fire shots down the screen
7655000	7657000	and little enemies are trying to come
7657000	7659000	up that segment that you happen to be
7659000	7661000	on you also get a thing called a
7661000	7663000	super zapper and
7663000	7665000	it destroys all the enemies on the field
7665000	7667000	um enemies will also
7667000	7669000	um have different
7669000	7671000	kinds of behaviors like one of them will leave
7671000	7673000	a spike as they travel up the
7673000	7675000	the little section um
7675000	7677000	and so when you're moving on to the next
7677000	7679000	play field the spike can impale you
7679000	7681000	impale
7681000	7683000	they also can go up to
7683000	7685000	the top of the screen and try to
7685000	7687000	capture your
7687000	7689000	little blaster ship
7689000	7691000	um and then when you
7691000	7693000	destroy all the enemies on the play field
7693000	7695000	you get warped to the next level
7695000	7697000	and so that's pretty much
7697000	7699000	tempest it has 16 screens
7699000	7701000	with different shapes on them
7701000	7703000	some like I said are closed
7703000	7705000	um and some of them are open fields
7705000	7707000	that have you know real end points
7707000	7709000	um
7709000	7711000	and each of them has a different color scheme
7711000	7713000	based on difficulty level
7713000	7715000	including invisible
7715000	7717000	which are for level 65
7717000	7719000	to 80 okay people actually
7719000	7721000	saw level 65 cause I never
7721000	7723000	I knew that there were like red
7723000	7725000	fields but like I never
7725000	7727000	saw anything but blue
7727000	7729000	stage wait I think maybe like one
7729000	7731000	time on a port of this game
7731000	7733000	maybe for like Commodore 64
7733000	7735000	I think I saw red which is
7735000	7737000	like the next highest up you see red when I play that
7737000	7739000	game
7739000	7741000	I just like playing this in the arcade
7741000	7743000	cause you have the little nub that you
7743000	7745000	would turn back and forth and you could just spin it
7745000	7747000	it felt like you liked playing
7747000	7749000	with the nub yeah I like playing with the nub
7749000	7751000	once in a while okay the nub like you played with
7753000	7755000	once in a while okay
7755000	7757000	anyway um
7757000	7759000	the game was supposed to be
7759000	7761000	in concept
7761000	7763000	a 3D remake of Space Invaders
7763000	7765000	but it had different
7765000	7767000	problems so
7767000	7769000	really cause it looks nothing like it
7769000	7771000	yeah so the um
7771000	7773000	the creator though said that
7773000	7775000	he got the design from a dream
7775000	7777000	where monsters were crawling out of a hole in the ground
7777000	7779000	so the game started off as
7779000	7781000	aliens to vortex and finally
7781000	7783000	it was Tempest and
7783000	7785000	there were different um
7785000	7787000	uh cases different
7787000	7789000	um cabinets for it
7789000	7791000	um there was the upright one
7791000	7793000	um there was also
7793000	7795000	uh a shorter
7795000	7797000	cabaret style cabinet
7797000	7799000	that um
7799000	7801000	it was a little
7801000	7803000	I don't think that they made as many of them
7803000	7805000	and then there was a cocktail style
7805000	7807000	that allowed uh two players
7807000	7809000	to play at opposite ends
7809000	7811000	um but the screen would
7811000	7813000	flip of course vertically for each of
7813000	7815000	the players not that it really mattered in this game
7815000	7817000	yeah
7817000	7819000	if the screen didn't flip oh well
7819000	7821000	except maybe left and right would kinda be
7821000	7823000	screwed up and that that would make your nub
7823000	7825000	turning a lot less fun
7825000	7827000	well Jeff Minter
7827000	7829000	um came later and created two
7829000	7831000	authorized sequels one of them was
7831000	7833000	Tempest 2000 which I have done his classic
7833000	7835000	game because it's awesome years ago
7835000	7837000	it was like one of the first classic games like years
7837000	7839000	ago yeah and um it
7839000	7841000	came out for the Atari Jaguar and
7841000	7843000	um the Playstation version was called
7843000	7845000	Tempest X3 was there anything else worth
7845000	7847000	owning on the Jaguar
7847000	7849000	what was it
7849000	7851000	besides Tempest 2000 wasn't it
7851000	7853000	like an Astol game no it was like an aliens
7853000	7855000	and predator game or something no I thought that there was
7855000	7857000	another like little 2D platformer that came
7857000	7859000	out on it was it it wasn't Astol
7859000	7861000	it was okay but seriously Tempest 2000
7861000	7863000	was the game was it Ristar maybe maybe
7863000	7865000	I don't know okay um
7865000	7867000	and then um there was Tempest 3000
7867000	7869000	uh for the new on DVD players
7869000	7871000	and then um Minter
7871000	7873000	did two more games that were inspired
7873000	7875000	by Tempest Space
7875000	7877000	Giraffe in 2007
7877000	7879000	and TXK which came out on the
7879000	7881000	Playstation Vita which
7881000	7883000	has been getting a lot of play in my house
7883000	7885000	now that I have a Playstation TV
7885000	7887000	that and Ultra Despair Girls
7887000	7889000	so um
7889000	7891000	it's had different ports it was the Atari
7891000	7893000	2600 and 5200 versions
7893000	7895000	um well
7895000	7897000	those were prototypes I actually do have
7897000	7899000	the 5200 prototype
7899000	7901000	and it's pretty pretty awesome
7901000	7903000	we play it with the trackball
7903000	7905000	um and then
7905000	7907000	um there was an Atari
7907000	7909000	Greatest Hits version
7909000	7911000	um there was also
7911000	7913000	Superior Software for the BBC Micro
7913000	7915000	and Acorn Electron
7915000	7917000	and one by
7917000	7919000	Electric Dreams for the ZX Spectrum
7919000	7921000	and Amstrad CPC
7921000	7923000	there's also been Windows versions
7923000	7925000	and different versions of the Playstation
7925000	7927000	Saturn, Super Nintendo
7927000	7929000	all kinds of different versions on it
7929000	7931000	so basically you can find
7931000	7933000	Tempest anywhere but play TXK
7933000	7935000	because it's really good and
7935000	7937000	Sony was kind of being dickish about
7937000	7939000	um wanting to sue the guy
7939000	7941000	I don't think that was Sony dear
7941000	7943000	Not Sony Atari
7943000	7945000	yeah whatever and Tempest
7945000	7947000	was actually featured in a Rush video
7947000	7949000	subdivisions
7949000	7951000	get out that's awesome
7951000	7953000	and as we know Rush is Canada's best export
7953000	7955000	that just made like an awesome game like
7955000	7957000	1.5 times as awesome
7957000	7959000	right? so that's your game
7959000	7961000	Tempest play it
7961000	7963000	right now play TXK
7963000	7965000	on all the things TXK
7965000	7967000	there it is your classic game of the week
7967000	7969000	Tempest originally in the arcade
7969000	7971000	but ported to
7971000	7973000	everything in the 1980's
7973000	7975000	everything
7979000	7981000	it's very great to have
7981000	7983000	Jamie on the show thanks to Radio Magic
7983000	7985000	so we'll see her back next week
7985000	7987000	for whatever next week's classic
7987000	7989000	game of the week might be meanwhile
7989000	7991000	we had a birthday this past week
7991000	7993000	actually just a couple
7993000	7995000	days ago which we just passed
7995000	7997000	Nine and Nine which not
7997000	7999000	only was the day for what
7999000	8001000	a new Lady Gaga single
8001000	8003000	and a Bastille album I think came out on that day
8003000	8005000	no way!
8005000	8007000	but it was also Dreamcast day
8007000	8009000	Nine Nine 99
8009000	8011000	was the big day the Dreamcast came out
8011000	8013000	in the US anyway
8013000	8015000	so a happy belated birthday to the Dreamcast
8015000	8017000	that would be 17 years ago
8017000	8019000	any Dreamcast memories from you Gabe?
8019000	8021000	I feel like we get into
8021000	8023000	Dreamcast memories every year around this time
8023000	8025000	but what about you Gabe?
8025000	8027000	I'll be honest I only
8027000	8029000	play the Dreamcast a little bit
8029000	8031000	this is probably
8031000	8033000	not the game people would expect
8033000	8035000	but Soul Calibur
8035000	8037000	when I played Soul Calibur the first time
8037000	8039000	and I heard the orchestrated music
8039000	8041000	I fell in love with that I was like oh my god
8041000	8043000	how is this playing such gorgeous
8043000	8045000	because that was N64 I was playing
8045000	8047000	Nintendo 64 and I was still so
8047000	8049000	used to music made in MIDI
8049000	8051000	and then to hear
8051000	8053000	fight music being played with
8053000	8055000	actual full CD orchestrated sound
8055000	8057000	I was like what is this?
8057000	8059000	I lost my mind
8059000	8061000	and then Virtua Fighter 2
8061000	8063000	or even 3
8063000	8065000	between those two games
8065000	8067000	there was an import game on the Dreamcast
8067000	8069000	that was partially inspired for Kinship
8069000	8071000	but I...
8071000	8073000	Border Down is what it's called but it never came to the states
8073000	8075000	it was for the Dreamcast called Border Down
8075000	8077000	thank god if someone has that game
8077000	8079000	for me the big one is going to forever and always be
8079000	8081000	Phantasy Star Online that just
8081000	8083000	blew my mind to have that type of experience
8083000	8085000	on consoles
8085000	8087000	we were kind of introduced to
8087000	8089000	the MMO experience a little bit
8089000	8091000	on PC with Ultima Online and so forth
8091000	8093000	but just to have that on
8093000	8095000	which some argue if
8095000	8097000	PSO was really an MMO or not
8097000	8099000	but at the end of the day the point is
8099000	8101000	that it was definitely something
8101000	8103000	a game that you could just
8103000	8105000	drop in at any time with other people
8105000	8107000	and experience together
8107000	8109000	it was so different for the time
8109000	8111000	that's why I had to have a Dreamcast
8111000	8113000	big social experiment and then
8113000	8115000	that game I cannot believe I forgot about
8115000	8117000	that game so yeah
8117000	8119000	my back to the PSO fans but yeah
8119000	8121000	that was a wonderful game
8121000	8123000	for it's time absolutely
8123000	8125000	you know we mentioned the Dreamcast
8125000	8127000	anniversary on our social media pages earlier

8141000	8143000	I still own one but I don't know if it
8143000	8145000	still works but I do have fond memories
8145000	8147000	of it and the games it has I
8147000	8149000	remember completing Crazy Taxi
8149000	8151000	haha yeah
8151000	8153000	of course like just a mainstay
8153000	8155000	game the first game I got for it
8155000	8157000	it took me a lot to do it but I managed
8157000	8159000	to I also remember playing
8159000	8161000	lots of fighting games with friends
8161000	8163000	lots of fun yeah wasn't
8163000	8165000	Capcom SNK 2 on Dreamcast
8165000	8167000	yes it was so fucking good god what a
8167000	8169000	great game seriously
8169000	8171000	wonderful over on
8171000	8173000	Facebook Ragenator
8173000	8175000	I think this says that I never bought a
8175000	8177000	Dreamcast something that I regret
8177000	8179000	to this day I do however have the
8179000	8181000	Dreamcast collection Nights into
8181000	8183000	Dreams Jet Set Radio all that stuff
8183000	8185000	on Steam I wish there
8185000	8187000	was more retro Sega stuff on
8187000	8189000	Steam like Mr. Bones and the Panzer
8189000	8191000	Dragoon games I've always wanted to play
8191000	8193000	those Hunter R
8193000	8195000	said I went through two different Dreamcast
8195000	8197000	consoles after dropping my original
8197000	8199000	Ray console thereby ruining the DVD
8199000	8201000	drive on the console I got the black
8201000	8203000	Sega Sports edition of the Dreamcast
8203000	8205000	remember they used to make
8205000	8207000	there was a Hello Kitty Dreamcast at one point
8207000	8209000	oh don't tell that to Brianna
8209000	8211000	Bri there's a Hello Kitty Dreamcast
8211000	8213000	out there it's probably on eBay
8213000	8215000	go quick
8215000	8217000	oh she's all about that
8217000	8219000	no it was awesome I remember I saw that
8219000	8221000	in like Japantown in LA once or something
8221000	8223000	and I was like it's cute
8223000	8225000	did that whole thing
8225000	8227000	it was awesome
8227000	8229000	long nights playing
8229000	8231000	Power Stone that was Loki's game right
8231000	8233000	Power Stone yeah Power Stone is pretty awesome
8233000	8235000	man I wish that's something that would come back
8235000	8237000	and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
8237000	8239000	of course
8239000	8241000	good memories it's just
8241000	8243000	it's hard to kind of pinpoint
8243000	8245000	like you know we have all these fond
8245000	8247000	memories of the Dreamcast yet it sure doesn't seem like
8247000	8249000	it lasted very long you know it did not and it's
8249000	8251000	unfortunate because I think that was a
8251000	8253000	console way ahead of itself yeah and
8253000	8255000	and what I think it fell
8255000	8257000	it just it fell during this
8257000	8259000	massive transition because it came
8259000	8261000	out
8261000	8263000	because it was in between like the N64 and the
8263000	8265000	PS2 at that point I think
8265000	8267000	when the PS2 was coming out and
8267000	8269000	and yeah and because of the
8269000	8271000	impact the first Playstation
8271000	8273000	made on everybody yeah I think it was
8273000	8275000	too little too late for Sega which is very very
8275000	8277000	unfortunate Bob C in our chat
8277000	8279000	says Tekken was never on Dreamcast
8279000	8281000	but didn't they have that tricky like was it
8281000	8283000	okay speaking of like software yeah there's Blingcast
8283000	8285000	right where you could you actually
8285000	8287000	did put Tekken it was this weird thing and
8287000	8289000	like you know we were joking about the Windows phone and the emulators
8289000	8291000	earlier but it's like a lot of that stuff was going on
8291000	8293000	on Dreamcast with the Blingcast
8293000	8295000	and then like one reason I got a Dreamcast
8295000	8297000	when it was only like 40 bucks I mean obviously
8297000	8299000	there was PSO and all that stuff you could just like
8299000	8301000	burn a disc with a Nintendo emulator on Dreamcast
8301000	8303000	and it worked for the most part
8303000	8305000	that's so weird that a Dreamcast
8305000	8307000	is capable of playing Playstation
8307000	8309000	1 games oh but a Playstation
8309000	8311000	4 alright I'm sorry here we go
8311000	8313000	simmer down
8313000	8315000	Jesus
8315000	8317000	and you see Bree freaked out we told her she's like
8317000	8319000	show me
8319000	8321000	see she's freaking out already but yeah
8321000	8323000	yeah you right about
8323000	8325000	yeah you mentioned yeah not Tekken
8325000	8327000	but yeah that's why I said Soul Calibur nevermind
8327000	8329000	alright nevermind I'm just drifting away
8329000	8331000	alright that's why the chatters are here

8427000	8429000	win any Emmys
8429000	8431000	I don't think it was nominated because I think it's too
8431000	8433000	early I think it came out too
8433000	8435000	after the like cut off or whatever
8435000	8437000	I think it'll be next year when it's eligible
8437000	8439000	yeah so how about
8439000	8441000	it could get Globes though I suppose
8441000	8443000	how about Kimmy Schmidt
8443000	8445000	I don't know if it was nominated I feel like Titus
8445000	8447000	had to get nominated again I think so yeah
8447000	8449000	but I don't know
8449000	8451000	I don't follow the Emmys that closely you know why
8451000	8453000	cause I do a show on Sunday nights
8453000	8455000	that keeps me from watching all that other crap
8455000	8457000	rock on fight the machine
8457000	8459000	alright moving on
8459000	8461000	to other rapid fire stories
8461000	8463000	Brie pay attention it's Hello Kitty

8489000	8491000	yeah she doesn't need a reason not
8491000	8493000	she doesn't need a reason to go to Japan
8493000	8495000	I just that's gonna be a reason for her to go back to Japan
8495000	8497000	okay now she's gonna go to Japan to get some
8497000	8499000	fucking cards that's pretty that's hard

8615000	8617000	I love Bubble Bobble but do we really
8617000	8619000	spawn on PlayStation 4? As long
8619000	8621000	as the boss will spawn on level 30?
8621000	8623000	Yes. Oh snap

8675000	8677000	and Xbox One and the Dead Rising
8677000	8679000	Triple Pack coming out on PlayStation 4
8679000	8681000	and Xbox One which makes me wonder why
8681000	8683000	isn't the
8683000	8685000	Dead Rising off the record
8685000	8687000	not by itself?
8687000	8689000	I thought that was the second one that was in there
8689000	8691000	No, off the record was the
8691000	8693000	it was the expansion of 2
8693000	8695000	Right, that's what
8695000	8697000	It wasn't a standalone though
8697000	8699000	Off the record was the alternate
8699000	8701000	Dead Rising 2 where you play
8701000	8703000	instead of
8703000	8705000	It was an alternate? I thought it was an expansion
8705000	8707000	No, it was an alternate because Dead Rising 2
8707000	8709000	you played a different dude
8709000	8711000	Right, but off the record
8711000	8713000	showed what happened to Frank
8713000	8715000	after part one
8715000	8717000	No, because the whole premise was like, here's how I would have done it
8717000	8719000	and that's basically the game
8719000	8721000	Interesting, okay
8721000	8723000	But yeah, those will be coming out this week
8723000	8725000	My Q, Labyrinth of Death

8767000	8769000	mandatory happiness
8769000	8771000	I feel like there should be an episode of OLR
8771000	8773000	where Loki has to
8773000	8775000	it's mandatory happiness for Loki
8775000	8777000	and we're just gonna throw fuckin' everything at him
8777000	8779000	every Apple story I've got, every Nintendo story I've got
8779000	8781000	and he has to be positive
8781000	8783000	we have to call it Happy Loki
8783000	8785000	he has to say something nice
8785000	8787000	for 15 minutes
8787000	8789000	I'm gonna do it when his kid's here
8789000	8791000	I can do it for the whole show
8791000	8793000	yeah, we can speak to him
8793000	8795000	we need to do that
8795000	8797000	okay, anyways
8797000	8799000	they're all yelling at me in chat to do it on episode 666
8799000	8801000	that would be evil
8801000	8803000	and then, let's see
8803000	8805000	we've got ReCore coming out this week

8827000	8829000	just a small little underground title
8829000	8831000	this is kind of a cool title
8831000	8833000	Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor
8833000	8835000	I'm wondering if that's like that Visceral Cleanup
8835000	8837000	game or whatever
8837000	8839000	that's gonna be coming out on PC
8839000	8841000	Dragon Quest 7
8841000	8843000	of the Forgotten Past on 3DS
8843000	8845000	Christ, this is a big week
8845000	8847000	and finally, that's it
8847000	8849000	I want that fucking Dragon Quest game too
8849000	8851000	and I kinda want Persona
8851000	8853000	oh my god, it's a busy week
8853000	8855000	alright, let's go over to Japan
8855000	8857000	it's a busy week there too in Japan
8857000	8859000	the Bioshock Collection makes its way to Japan
8859000	8861000	the new PlayStation 4
8861000	8863000	little Slim version is out in Japan
8863000	8865000	this week on the 15th as well
8865000	8867000	and Persona 5 in a regular
8867000	8869000	20th anniversary edition and accessories set
8869000	8871000	all of that hits Japan as well on the 15th
8871000	8873000	so yeah, very busy
8873000	8875000	week in Japan, World Soccer winning 11
8875000	8877000	as well in Japan this week
8877000	8879000	so it looks like Japan kinda mirrors us a little bit this week
8879000	8881000	on the PlayStation 4
8881000	8883000	sadly, the only release on the Wii U this week
8883000	8885000	is Terraria, but you know things on the Wii U
8885000	8887000	are kinda dying down a little bit
8887000	8889000	on the PlayStation Vita
8889000	8891000	which basic question, they haven't gotten Terraria yet?
8891000	8893000	not in a retail release
8893000	8895000	that whole thing, yeah
8895000	8897000	PlayStation Vita
8897000	8899000	taken over there with Hightaka no Psychedelica
8899000	8901000	comes out in a limited edition in Japan this week
8901000	8903000	and Yunohana Spring, Cherishing Time
8903000	8905000	also out in Japan this week
8905000	8907000	lastly on the 3DS this week
8907000	8909000	there's a brand new 2DS
8909000	8911000	in both Lavender and Pink
8911000	8913000	and Red and Blue
8913000	8915000	there's lots of new 2DS colors out this week
8915000	8917000	but you can also get a price reduction
8917000	8919000	on Zelda no Densetsu
8919000	8921000	Toki no Ocarina 3D
8921000	8923000	which of course is the Ocarina of Time 3D
8923000	8925000	in Japan with a price reduction there
8925000	8927000	and
8927000	8929000	Cho Sentochu Kyokyu no Shinobu
8929000	8931000	to battle player Choju Kesenn
8931000	8933000	comes out this week
8933000	8935000	Battle for Money
8935000	8937000	is what that translates to
8937000	8939000	loosely there
8939000	8941000	so that is out on the 3DS this week
8941000	8943000	so that's what's in Japan
8943000	8945000	with Dark Soccer being absent
8945000	8947000	from the show for a little while
8947000	8949000	Loki's gonna step in and
8949000	8951000	take a trip over to Europe for us
8951000	8953000	with the UK dates
8953000	8955000	I guess I will
8955000	8957000	I guess I will if you're making me
8957000	8959000	so in the UK
8959000	8961000	let's see what we got coming out
8961000	8963000	XCOM 2
8963000	8965000	on Playstation 4 and
8965000	8967000	Xbox One
8967000	8969000	Police Tactics Empyro
8969000	8971000	on PC
8971000	8973000	and let's see
8973000	8975000	that was the 7th so that was last week
8975000	8977000	this week ReCore on
8977000	8979000	PC and Xbox One
8979000	8981000	Pro Evolution also coming out over there
8981000	8983000	as well on Xbox 360
8983000	8985000	Playstation 3, Playstation 4
8985000	8987000	Xbox One and PC
8987000	8989000	Bioshock the collection
8989000	8991000	on PC, Playstation 4
8991000	8993000	and Xbox One
8993000	8995000	and that's it
8995000	8997000	Now the chatters
8997000	8999000	are actually saying, there's a couple of people in chat saying this
8999000	9001000	that Persona 5 is actually not
9001000	9003000	out here in the
9003000	9005000	states this week Loki, your list may be wrong
9005000	9007000	because apparently it's out in Japan
9007000	9009000	this week, that part was correct but it was actually
9009000	9011000	delayed for the rest of the world until
9011000	9013000	February, several people saying that in chat
9013000	9015000	are you telling me that Wikipedia is incorrect?
9015000	9017000	I don't believe you
9017000	9019000	because even I'm looking at another Wikipedia
9019000	9021000	page that says that it's
9021000	9023000	out worldwide on Valentine's Day
9023000	9025000	it will be out multiple weeks if it has to
9025000	9027000	ok?
9027000	9029000	and listen, I am like a weatherman
9029000	9031000	I'm telling you what the weather is going to be like
9031000	9033000	and then it will be like something it decides
9033000	9035000	you know what, it probably still made your list
9035000	9037000	because there's that many people that are planning on
9037000	9039000	recording it this week over on this side
9039000	9041000	honestly, but
9041000	9043000	just want to clarify that
9043000	9045000	it will be out in a secret location that you have no access to
9045000	9047000	it's still coming out though
9047000	9049000	that list is 100%
9049000	9051000	accurate
9051000	9053000	let's get to our emails
9055000	9057000	every week you guys email us
9057000	9059000	participate at orangeloungeradio.com
9059000	9061000	and we read some of our favorite
9061000	9063000	emails here on the show and respond
9063000	9065000	to them if appropriate
9065000	9067000	is this appropriate?
9067000	9069000	for these emails?
9069000	9071000	or do you not know yet?
9071000	9073000	yes, well I've just given them the
9073000	9075000	once over
9075000	9077000	meaning I open them up to make sure they didn't say
9077000	9079000	fuck you, you fucking fuck
9079000	9081000	but that could have been from Loki though
9081000	9083000	or I had to make sure
9083000	9085000	it wasn't something that said buy Viagra
9085000	9087000	cheap
9087000	9089000	we need to talk about that
9089000	9091000	Viagra has a sponsor, FOLR
9091000	9093000	no!
9093000	9095000	hi
9095000	9097000	but we do have some fabulous emails from listeners
9097000	9099000	this week starting with Andy R
9099000	9101000	who starts us off this week saying
9101000	9103000	I'm sure you're already sick of talking about it this
9103000	9105000	late in the podcast but after replying to the
9105000	9107000	Facebook post I was musing more about the
9107000	9109000	PlayStation 4 Pro and felt like
9109000	9111000	emailing with some more thoughts
9111000	9113000	mainly because I was watching a video gamer
9113000	9115000	Eurogamer put up
9115000	9117000	a video that Eurogamer put up about the event
9117000	9119000	one guy talking had been to the event and the
9119000	9121000	other, like most of us, only saw what was streamed
9121000	9123000	the guy who only saw the stream was very much
9123000	9125000	in line with the internet consensus, namely
9125000	9127000	the I don't see the point or I don't see a huge
9127000	9129000	change sentiment that is going around
9129000	9131000	interestingly though, the guy
9131000	9133000	who had been at the event seemed fairly impressed
9133000	9135000	with what Sony had managed to coax out of a
9135000	9137000	$400 box
9137000	9139000	which got me to thinking, this reminds me a lot
9139000	9141000	of VR, in general it seems like the
9141000	9143000	people I talk to about VR tend to fall into
9143000	9145000	two camps, ones who have tried it and
9145000	9147000	think it is cool or ones that haven't tried it
9147000	9149000	and don't see what the hubble is about
9149000	9151000	in the case of PS4 Pro, watching
9151000	9153000	footage of a 4K HDR game on
9153000	9155000	a stream probably doesn't do
9155000	9157000	justice, much like not having
9157000	9159000	actually tried a VR headset
9159000	9161000	I know I personally streamed the PS4
9161000	9163000	P meeting to on my phone
9163000	9165000	over a cell signal which clearly
9165000	9167000	wouldn't hold a candle to the kind of TVs the
9167000	9169000	Pro is designed for, like VR
9169000	9171000	Sony has probably got an uphill
9171000	9173000	battle convincing people that this is the thing
9173000	9175000	they need, especially since this one
9175000	9177000	requires not only the box itself
9177000	9179000	but a TV capable of really taking
9179000	9181000	advantage of the box, maybe they're banking
9181000	9183000	on people who don't have the TV yet
9183000	9185000	future proofing and just going for the Pro
9185000	9187000	anyway, at least we've seen the
9187000	9189000	PlayStation 4's will fly off the shelves at
9189000	9191000	$399 in the past, so getting it to that price
9191000	9193000	point was a smart move, anyway
9193000	9195000	just a few thoughts for the conversation, this
9195000	9197000	holiday is going to be pretty interesting I imagine
9197000	9199000	that email again from Andiar
9199000	9201000	that is a very good point
9201000	9203000	I really like the comparison
9203000	9205000	about that VR
9205000	9207000	can be a hard sell until you've tried it
9207000	9209000	so considering that very few
9209000	9211000	of us probably watched the PlayStation
9211000	9213000	Pro thing on a
9213000	9215000	4K TV, maybe
9215000	9217000	we are not really seeing the message
9217000	9219000	whereas the people that were there
9219000	9221000	well I'm sure Sony had 4K projection
9221000	9223000	in that room taken care of, so people
9223000	9225000	were very happy with what they saw I'm sure
9225000	9227000	so very interesting perspective
9227000	9229000	although that being said
9229000	9231000	that fantastic
9231000	9233000	demo that they had of
9233000	9235000	Horizon Zero Dawn
9235000	9237000	or whatever that is
9237000	9239000	looked awesome
9239000	9241000	Shadow of the Colossus
9241000	9243000	awesome, it did look awesome
9243000	9245000	so this tells me that Sony now needs to
9245000	9247000	get PlayStation 4 Pros
9247000	9249000	running on 4K TVs in every Best Buy
9249000	9251000	around the nation, because that's really the best way
9251000	9253000	all I need to hear is, hey Grand Theft Auto 5
9253000	9255000	is going to be one of those supported
9255000	9257000	higher resolution games
9257000	9259000	would that really do it for you?
9259000	9261000	what about The Last of Us
9261000	9263000	I haven't played The Last of Us
9263000	9265000	because they're doing it with The Last of Us, they're adding
9265000	9267000	4K textures for The Last of Us
9267000	9269000	because why not
9269000	9271000	see for me, but Mass Effect, you know
9271000	9273000	that's kind of my version of Loki's Grand Theft Auto
9273000	9275000	you know, that, seeing that
9275000	9277000	as part of it does kind of make me go
9277000	9279000	maybe I do need a Pro, maybe I do need
9279000	9281000	to future proof, but maybe I am
9281000	9283000	a little worried that by the time I get a 4K TV
9283000	9285000	Sony will have another console
9285000	9287000	in three years, that's where I'm starting
9287000	9289000	to worry, that sounds like it, because if
9289000	9291000	it's a ten year cycle is what it's supposed to be
9291000	9293000	you've already, we're not even
9293000	9295000	halfway there and you're giving me a new console
9295000	9297000	you're giving me an upgraded console, so
9297000	9299000	speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5
9299000	9301000	uh huh
9301000	9303000	so how much Grand Theft Auto 5 have you?
9303000	9305000	to be fair, not a lot, it's one of those
9305000	9307000	things that I think about playing it and then
9307000	9309000	ooh, shiny, I get distracted by something else
9309000	9311000	you know how it goes, I do
9311000	9313000	alright, one more email this week
9313000	9315000	from Dark Tetsuya, who says
9315000	9317000	hey OLR, I thought I'd write you guys about a neat
9317000	9319000	new indie film that came out while you guys
9319000	9321000	were on break, it's called The Outrunners
9321000	9323000	so basically the plot is our hero
9323000	9325000	Eli was visiting the arcade with his friend
9325000	9327000	one day and got to talking to a girl
9327000	9329000	but the resident bully and his gang caught wind of it
9329000	9331000	and challenged him to a high stakes race in
9331000	9333000	Sega's The Outrunners, winner stays
9333000	9335000	loser leaves the arcade for good
9335000	9337000	it's a pretty neat film if you enjoy
9337000	9339000	classic arcades and the racing games
9339000	9341000	they had back in the 90's, because this sounds
9341000	9343000	like a plot out of the 90's to be quite honest
9343000	9345000	but um, there's
9345000	9347000	even some subtle nods to anime like
9347000	9349000	Initial D, like they actually
9349000	9351000	used some of the music in the end racing scenes
9351000	9353000	and Eli's car is the same car that
9353000	9355000	the star of the Initial D drives
9355000	9357000	the director told me on Facebook that
9357000	9359000	Initial D was one of his favorite anime
9359000	9361000	the film is available for free on YouTube
9361000	9363000	and be sure to check them out on Facebook as well
9363000	9365000	the gaming blogs haven't really said
9365000	9367000	a lot about this, but I thought if I sent you guys
9367000	9369000	an email, I could get more people to check
9369000	9371000	this out, uh, you're right
9371000	9373000	the dozens and dozens of people that listen to OLR
9373000	9375000	will hopefully check this out
9375000	9377000	so thank you for the heads up there
9377000	9379000	that is again called The Outrunners
9379000	9381000	well hey, I like old Sega 90 game
9381000	9383000	let me ask this, since it is an ode to
9383000	9385000	90's racing game classics
9385000	9387000	will we get to hear in this movie the
9387000	9389000	doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
9389000	9391000	like is that what plays
9391000	9393000	as the 20th Century Fox logo
9393000	9395000	comes, well I guess not, because it's not a 20th Century Fox movie
9395000	9397000	but you know, that's what you expect
9397000	9399000	right?
9399000	9401000	Daytona
9401000	9403000	hell yeah, heck yeah
9403000	9405000	anyway, that would be a fantastic
9405000	9407000	game for the remake
9407000	9409000	seriously
9409000	9411000	hell yeah
9411000	9413000	alright, there it is, your emails
9413000	9415000	participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9415000	9417000	if you want to send us an email
9417000	9419000	for consideration in a future week
9419000	9421000	alright, remake Daytona
9421000	9423000	they did on the 360
9423000	9425000	and it was gorgeous
9425000	9427000	it wasn't remade
9427000	9429000	because 4k is where it's at
9429000	9431000	720p
9431000	9433000	special thanks
9433000	9435000	it was no, those are just the HD versions
9435000	9437000	of like the Dreamcast games
9437000	9439000	or whatever they had, or Saturn games
9439000	9441000	no, but they like redid that from the ground up
9441000	9443000	and they added a couple new things too
9443000	9445000	it was great game, if you want the HD
9445000	9447000	remake, play the 360 version
9447000	9449000	it was good, that's the best I can give you
9449000	9451000	I can't give you much else, so can't please you
9451000	9453000	clearly, so it's all good
9453000	9455000	alright, s2100matt posting a link there
9455000	9457000	in our chatroom by the way
9457000	9459000	some folks I'm sure will be watching that
9459000	9461000	after the show
9461000	9463000	or is Loki trying to watch it during the show
9463000	9465000	I thought that's what Gabe was
9465000	9467000	peering over and looking out of there
9467000	9469000	no, I'm looking in the chatroom, someone said
9469000	9471000	would a new EDF in 4k
9471000	9473000	there would be no frame rate
9473000	9475000	those games are so horribly optimized
9475000	9477000	it would just be like
9477000	9479000	it's just like nothing, in fact
9479000	9481000	at the very least, Playstation 4 Pro
9481000	9483000	would maybe bring it up to like
9483000	9485000	20 frames per second, I mean
9485000	9487000	the 4.1
9487000	9489000	it was way better than
9489000	9491000	the PS3 version
9491000	9493000	because the PS3 version in 2025
9493000	9495000	was terrible, so that had frame
9495000	9497000	rate issues from the 20
9497000	9499000	I like 2025 part
9499000	9501000	of the way, it's just
9501000	9503000	I don't know, it's not
9503000	9505000	the same
9505000	9507000	it was its own thing I guess
9507000	9509000	but it was nice to have the co-op
9509000	9511000	and stuff, I just haven't played co-op
9511000	9513000	alright, let's get back into some other
9513000	9515000	gaming news, Loki, that's fine
9515000	9517000	we're such nerds
9517000	9519000	anyways, so
9519000	9521000	speaking of
9521000	9523000	every
9523000	9525000	Playstation 4, this is kind of
9525000	9527000	a neat little thing to throw in there
9527000	9529000	you don't have to buy a new system to get
9529000	9531000	that wonderful HDR, so be able
9531000	9533000	to support the wider range
9533000	9535000	of color and everything
9535000	9537000	the pictures will kind of pop more
9537000	9539000	that's coming in a free update
9539000	9541000	if you already have a Playstation 4, you can enjoy
9541000	9543000	that right away, assuming
9543000	9545000	they have a TV new enough to actually take advantage
9545000	9547000	of that, which I don't
9547000	9549000	again, we face
9549000	9551000	this technical
9551000	9553000	issue, and I almost begin to
9553000	9555000	wonder if
9555000	9557000	that's the mentality
9557000	9559000	with these bigger game companies
9559000	9561000	honestly though, it's been a long time since I had a
9561000	9563000	TV, I got this TV, actually thankfully
9563000	9565000	it was a promo thing from Sony
9565000	9567000	ironically enough, it's a Sony
9567000	9569000	HDTV, but they gave that
9569000	9571000	to all of the employees
9571000	9573000	of the company I worked for, and so I had a nice
9573000	9575000	new HDTV from that, and at the time it was
9575000	9577000	cutting edge, but
9577000	9579000	now it's pretty old
9579000	9581000	so I mean, I could use a new
9581000	9583000	TV, it's just
9583000	9585000	you're justifying buying a new one
9585000	9587000	my concern is again,
9587000	9589000	is a
9589000	9591000	new console no longer enough
9591000	9593000	do we have to have
9593000	9595000	you gotta have a very powerful TV
9595000	9597000	and here's what we can provide too, because
9597000	9599000	now you're costing me
9599000	9601000	not just four or five hundred dollars
9601000	9603000	to enjoy a new gaming experience
9603000	9605000	now I gotta pay a grand
9605000	9607000	essentially, you know
9607000	9609000	and on top of that, like why should I be dropping
9609000	9611000	money on a new TV and a new
9611000	9613000	system and VR and all this stuff
9613000	9615000	for Sony, when
9615000	9617000	you know, they can't even get
9617000	9619000	like mod support working and stuff
9619000	9621000	something that was promised to people like a long time ago
9621000	9623000	well that's ultimately my point, because
9623000	9625000	invest in a PC instead, I mean
9625000	9627000	well even the original PS4 was supposed to do
9627000	9629000	4K, and
9629000	9631000	that just
9631000	9633000	disappeared into the
9633000	9635000	nothing. The menus are 4K
9635000	9637000	That's it. Right?
9637000	9639000	And again, that's a whole other thing
9639000	9641000	I appreciate the fact that these newer consoles
9641000	9643000	and I said this earlier, okay fine
9643000	9645000	you're gonna be able to display
9645000	9647000	show off 4K and things like that
9647000	9649000	but I can't wait to see how few
9649000	9651000	developers actually utilize that
9651000	9653000	that's gonna be the best part, so anyway
9653000	9655000	I digress
9655000	9657000	So, I mean
9657000	9659000	if my TV doesn't really support
9659000	9661000	this thing, then this patch does nothing for me
9661000	9663000	or will I get to see some subtle differences
9663000	9665000	or what? No. Brighter blues
9665000	9667000	brighter blues and reds
9667000	9669000	that's about it. Because I bought my, like my TV
9669000	9671000	is pretty fucking nice I think, it's a
9671000	9673000	2014 model apparently
9673000	9675000	and so it doesn't have this. Maybe it supports it.
9675000	9677000	I looked on the Amazon thing, because I actually went back
9677000	9679000	and looked at the TV I bought on Amazon
9679000	9681000	which, just an interesting
9681000	9683000	side story, I was gonna buy the TV
9683000	9685000	at Sears, and it was on the display
9685000	9687000	for it and everything, and then they told me, like, we don't have it
9687000	9689000	like, they didn't
9689000	9691000	they wanted me to go to another Sears
9691000	9693000	on the other end of town, and I was like
9693000	9695000	okay, I'll head over there now. I'm sorry, but the TV you're looking for
9695000	9697000	is at another Sears. Yeah, it's in another castle
9697000	9699000	right? So I just
9699000	9701000	I came home and I bought it on Amazon, like
9701000	9703000	anybody else would have done it
9703000	9705000	Why are department stores dying?
9705000	9707000	Or just go to Best Buy and have them
9707000	9709000	price match Amazon. Uh, yeah
9709000	9711000	I guess I could have done it, but anyway, it doesn't matter, because I got a fucking TV
9711000	9713000	like two years ago, no, last year
9713000	9715000	and it's a two year old model, but apparently, yeah, it doesn't do
9715000	9717000	but it does do 3D
9717000	9719000	Blu-rays and all that stuff
9719000	9721000	Oh, goody goody. I have, like, two movies
9721000	9723000	I can watch in 3D
9723000	9725000	Tron's one of them, so
9725000	9727000	Do you have the glasses for it? I do, but
9727000	9729000	fuck if they ever seem to work
9729000	9731000	I tried to use them on the ongoing, I was like
9731000	9733000	these don't even really work
9733000	9735000	And that's what I mean right there
9735000	9737000	like, that's what I mean, you know, the other thing
9737000	9739000	that made me push so hard on 3D
9739000	9741000	Yeah, right? Look how well that worked out
9741000	9743000	Boy oh boy
9743000	9745000	Anyhow, um, well I still
9745000	9747000	you know, I'm excited for the update to see if
9747000	9749000	it'll do anything for me, but
9749000	9751000	God, again, my TV is not that old
9751000	9753000	and it doesn't support any of this
9753000	9755000	Well, the 4K support ends are pretty nice, I mean, just even watching the little demos
9755000	9757000	walking through Best Buy and stuff like that, it's like
9757000	9759000	damn, that's a nice clear picture
9759000	9761000	but it's just like, damn, is that gonna be the
9761000	9763000	same nice clear picture when I stream it through Netflix
9763000	9765000	on this crappy boxy they have? Nope
9765000	9767000	I'm gonna need like, you know, a nicer
9767000	9769000	new platform to be able to stream in 4K
9769000	9771000	and a nicer new internet provider
9771000	9773000	that's gonna be able to handle that
9773000	9775000	bandwidth, but not Comcast
9775000	9777000	Alright, well another big birthday
9777000	9779000	that happened this week was the 50th anniversary
9779000	9781000	of Star Trek
9781000	9783000	and how appropriate that just this past week
9783000	9785000	Star Trek Online
9785000	9787000	has come out for consoles
9787000	9789000	Star Trek Online
9789000	9791000	what, came out, what is it
9791000	9793000	like January 2012
9793000	9795000	when free to play, I think it had actually been out
9795000	9797000	as a pay game maybe a year or two before that
9797000	9799000	and then it was free to play in 2012
9799000	9801000	well now it is out on PlayStation 4
9801000	9803000	and Xbox One
9803000	9805000	so it took a little while for it to come out
9805000	9807000	but what a good way to get an older
9807000	9809000	MMO some new attention
9809000	9811000	than by being right there for download
9811000	9813000	on the consoles
9813000	9815000	DC Universe Online
9815000	9817000	kind of did this same type of thing a while ago
9817000	9819000	as well, so anyhow
9819000	9821000	Star Trek Online is now available
9821000	9823000	and I think the audience over there
9823000	9825000	seems to be growing a little bit, probably
9825000	9827000	these console releases are helping
9827000	9829000	so now might be a good time to check that out
9829000	9831000	so, what's cool is that they actually have some of the
9831000	9833000	cast from the movies, it's like voice over
9833000	9835000	oh really, oh that's awesome
9835000	9837000	that's pretty cool, I wanna say
9837000	9839000	I may be wrong, I don't wanna step out of line
9839000	9841000	but I wanna say they were able to get Leonard Nimoy
9841000	9843000	in the game before he had passed
9843000	9845000	well cause again this game's been out
9845000	9847000	since 2010, so I wanna say
9847000	9849000	he was in it, and they had at one point
9849000	9851000	Zachary Kinto was in it too
9851000	9853000	because he was Spock
9853000	9855000	in the new movies, I think he was in the game when it
9855000	9857000	first came out as well, so
9857000	9859000	uh yeah, Kaijuto in chat says did they
9859000	9861000	make the game better cause on PC
9861000	9863000	it blows, and Fifth Dream confirms yes
9863000	9865000	Nimoy is in the intro in the first five
9865000	9867000	minutes, so that's pretty cool
9867000	9869000	it might be worth checking out all on its own
9869000	9871000	I'm curious if uh
9871000	9873000	any of our friends from Starboard Power Coupling
9873000	9875000	uh check that out on consoles cause I know some
9875000	9877000	of them play Star Trek Online, I don't know if they
9877000	9879000	went and checked it out on consoles though
9879000	9881000	so uh let's move on, Loki
9881000	9883000	so uh this is kinda cool
9883000	9885000	there was a slight tease or a positive
9885000	9887000	leaked tease that Earth Defense
9887000	9889000	Force 5 might be a thing
9889000	9891000	um apparently this was coming
9891000	9893000	from um a count, they had a countdown
9893000	9895000	teaser actually on
9895000	9897000	the D3 publisher site, and I wanna say that this
9897000	9899000	also leaked out from like another publication
9899000	9901000	that it was out there
9901000	9903000	um so
9903000	9905000	yeah, it'd be
9905000	9907000	interesting to check it out

9919000	9921000	something to play together cause Gabe's definitely
9921000	9923000	a fan as well
9923000	9925000	nothing, that game
9925000	9927000	just warms my soul
9927000	9929000	so much destruction
9929000	9931000	so goddamn hard
9931000	9933000	alright we are gonna open up the
9933000	9935000	pipeline to you guys, Orange Lounge Radio
9935000	9937000	all one word on Skype, if you wanna give us a call
9937000	9939000	and talk about anything that we've talked about
9939000	9941000	tonight, maybe you wanna ask Gabe a question
9941000	9943000	or uh anything else that might
9943000	9945000	be on your mind, you can go ahead and give us a call
9945000	9947000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype
9947000	9949000	um while we wait for some calls to come in
9949000	9951000	um Gabe let me ask you about this
9951000	9953000	uh locally with Sacramento
9953000	9955000	and development and all that, I know we had talked about
9955000	9957000	earlier in the show, we mentioned that Sacramento
9957000	9959000	can be seen by those in other areas
9959000	9961000	it's kinda like, you know
9961000	9963000	not as lucrative of an area
9963000	9965000	or whatever, which seems a little silly to me
9965000	9967000	cause it seems like, you know, we're growing a little bit
9967000	9969000	with our, even our triple A game development
9969000	9971000	right, which um, you know
9971000	9973000	I forget what they were called back in the day, what, Click Play
9973000	9975000	or Click and Play or something, Click Nation
9975000	9977000	that's it, they grew into now Capital Games
9977000	9979000	EA Capital Games, which
9979000	9981000	uh I believe based on one of the trailers
9981000	9983000	they showed recently, they're doing work with the
9983000	9985000	Star Wars mobile development, right, yes they are
9985000	9987000	yes they are, so that's pretty cool, do we know of any
9987000	9989000	other like big big studios that are establishing
9989000	9991000	a presence here locally? Um, I know
9991000	9993000	so on the indie side
9993000	9995000	um, on the indie side you've got Skirmish
9995000	9997000	who just recently got a little office
9997000	9999000	uh, so I think somewhere
9999000	10001000	in Rancho or Sacramento, something like that
10001000	10003000	I wanna, yeah, somewhere nearby for here
10003000	10005000	I think, um, I know the other big one
10005000	10007000	Fifth Planet Games, they're up in Rockland
10007000	10009000	they were in Roseville, they moved up
10009000	10011000	to Rockland, um, they've uh
10011000	10013000	they've trimmed down a little bit on the size
10013000	10015000	of their studio, but they're
10015000	10017000	still a pretty significant size studio, Fifth Planet
10017000	10019000	Games, and big shout out to
10019000	10021000	Rob, um, you know, Rob Winkler
10021000	10023000	he was one of our speakers for the
10023000	10025000	first indie arcade, um, but yeah
10025000	10027000	Fifth Planet is definitely one of the other
10027000	10029000	well known studios
10029000	10031000	so with their, um, oh my goodness
10031000	10033000	I can't even think of their freaking game name right now
10033000	10035000	but yeah, you can find them on Newgrounds and so on and so forth
10035000	10037000	but, yeah, so there's a few
10037000	10039000	but we definitely need
10039000	10041000	more, I wish we connected with EA
10041000	10043000	because, you know,
10043000	10045000	that would have been great to establish
10045000	10047000	something with them more, but we'll see
10047000	10049000	alright, we'll see, well in the meantime let's get
10049000	10051000	to the phones because they are ringing, hi you're on Orange
10051000	10053000	Launch Radio, who's this?
10053000	10055000	Hey what's up guys, this is Kaijuto
10055000	10057000	Hey Kaijuto, what's on your mind buddy?
10057000	10059000	I got some game recommendations for you
10059000	10061000	First off, I just want to say that
10061000	10063000	I've been playing the
10063000	10065000	Rumble, what is it, Rumble in
10065000	10067000	the Rocket League
10067000	10069000	that thing is great, I don't know if you guys tried that
10069000	10071000	I haven't, I've heard about, God, the
10071000	10073000	Rocket League, they have really done a great job
10073000	10075000	Just continuing moving that game forward
10075000	10077000	ever since its original release, I need to check
10077000	10079000	that out
10079000	10081000	There is some trouble in paradise with that game
10081000	10083000	because now the fans
10083000	10085000	are pissed off because they decided to go
10085000	10087000	with the whole
10087000	10089000	you got unlockables, but you have a
10089000	10091000	crate that you have to open and you have to buy
10091000	10093000	keys to open that crate
10093000	10095000	Oh, pissed off
10095000	10097000	because they're claiming that they need the money
10097000	10099000	because they want to make it into an esport
10099000	10101000	but fans are not buying that
10101000	10103000	They're like pissed off
10103000	10105000	There's some real Rocket League hate going on right now
10105000	10107000	A lot of fans got that free
10107000	10109000	from Playstation Plus
10109000	10111000	but then again, Playstation Plus not really free
10111000	10113000	so, alright
10113000	10115000	Nothing ever is
10115000	10117000	My game recommendations
10117000	10119000	going to the Star Trek, the 50th
10119000	10121000	anniversary thing
10121000	10123000	I found this game, I think it just came out a couple
10123000	10125000	of days ago, it's called
10125000	10127000	Halcyon 6
10127000	10129000	and that game
10129000	10131000	is so much fun, it's fantastic
10131000	10133000	You got to think of
10133000	10135000	that game that came out for the
10135000	10137000	tablet, Trexels
10137000	10139000	remember that game?
10139000	10141000	It was like a
10141000	10143000	remake of some other game, Pixels
10143000	10145000	or some crap
10145000	10147000	Think of that game as
10147000	10149000	Trexels, but a lot better, it has a story
10149000	10151000	there's humor in there
10151000	10153000	there's base building, if you're the type of person
10153000	10155000	you're all into that base building that they did
10155000	10157000	with XCOM and that type of stuff
10157000	10159000	they have that in there, they have away missions
10159000	10161000	you can send your away team out there to have
10161000	10163000	battles, for all you Final Fantasy
10163000	10165000	fans, it has the whole
10165000	10167000	type of turn-based system that
10167000	10169000	Final Fantasy kind of invented
10169000	10171000	where you have your three party
10171000	10173000	members and then you fight either
10173000	10175000	three monsters or two monsters
10175000	10177000	they have that in there, it's all turn-based
10177000	10179000	it's a lot of fun, it's 2D, it's not
10179000	10181000	3D, but
10181000	10183000	there aren't any type of platforming
10183000	10185000	that type of crap, you don't have to run and jump on
10185000	10187000	stuff, you're basically
10187000	10189000	trying to battle
10189000	10191000	Is it space sci-fi, which is why you're tying this to
10191000	10193000	Star Trek?
10193000	10195000	No, it's basically a Star Trek, because you have
10195000	10197000	your science officer, you have your captain
10197000	10199000	your communications officer, they have the
10199000	10201000	different colored suits
10201000	10203000	you have spaceships that you're flying
10203000	10205000	it's Star Trek
10205000	10207000	Alright, I gotcha
10207000	10209000	that's a good recommendation
10209000	10211000	This is on Steam by the way
10211000	10213000	and the second game is a matter of murder
10213000	10215000	which I think is like
10215000	10217000	$2.99, really affordable game
10217000	10219000	and if you love the game Clue
10219000	10221000	you're gonna love this game because
10221000	10223000	it's basically Clue
10223000	10225000	it has endless replayability because
10225000	10227000	every time you play you can generate a new
10227000	10229000	mystery, and it plays
10229000	10231000	just like Clue, they have the mansion
10231000	10233000	you gotta investigate, you gotta find
10233000	10235000	the weapon, find the suspect, find the motive
10235000	10237000	and then when you think you have
10237000	10239000	all that together
10239000	10241000	then you go into the accusation phase and then you have
10241000	10243000	all the characters, they all come together in one room
10243000	10245000	and then you have to
10245000	10247000	retell what happened, like who committed
10247000	10249000	the murder and why and all that stuff and if you got it
10249000	10251000	right, then you get rewarded for it
10251000	10253000	it's a really fun game, it has some
10253000	10255000	really shitty art
10255000	10257000	but it makes it funny
10257000	10259000	it looks like a three year old
10259000	10261000	kid drew the game, but that's part of the trauma
10261000	10263000	I love it
10263000	10265000	and the thing with the body
10265000	10267000	it's hilarious because they don't show
10267000	10269000	the entire body, you just see
10269000	10271000	the feet
10271000	10273000	the tasteful dead person
10273000	10275000	just the legs sticking out from under the carpet
10275000	10277000	yeah, yeah
10277000	10279000	and the game makes fun of itself because when you do the
10279000	10281000	tutorial
10281000	10283000	I guess it's the maid or something
10283000	10285000	she's like, what are you freaking out about?
10285000	10287000	it's just a body, that seems to happen a lot in this place
10287000	10289000	right away
10289000	10291000	you're gonna be solving multiple murders
10291000	10293000	just people being killed in that house
10293000	10295000	so it doesn't have the board game element still
10295000	10297000	where you roll a die to move around
10297000	10299000	there's no dice
10299000	10301000	it's almost like a point and click
10301000	10303000	you're clicking the characters
10303000	10305000	you're talking to them
10305000	10307000	but the writing is done so well
10307000	10309000	that you actually get involved
10309000	10311000	they'll tell you stuff
10311000	10313000	if you ask a guy a question
10313000	10315000	he's nervously stroking his moustache
10315000	10317000	to give you little hints that he may be lying
10317000	10319000	it's a really cool deductive game
10319000	10321000	because what I found out is when I played the game
10321000	10323000	I was doing the tutorial
10323000	10325000	and the guy was like
10325000	10327000	I was in the pool room with so and so
10327000	10329000	we were playing pool, so I went to the pool room
10329000	10331000	and there was a guy in there and he confirmed
10331000	10333000	his story that his alibi was legit
10333000	10335000	because they were both playing pool
10335000	10337000	but then you speak to another guy
10337000	10339000	and that person's like, yeah, I was playing pool too
10339000	10341000	and I'm like, no, you weren't playing
10341000	10343000	it was just these two guys in there
10343000	10345000	so that's how I knew that they were the murderer
10345000	10347000	just cool stuff like that
10347000	10349000	alright, so Matter of Murder
10349000	10351000	I gotta check that out on Steam, so three bucks
10351000	10353000	alright, very cool
10353000	10355000	thanks, the one thing I'm ready to buy
10355000	10357000	alright, Kaishudo, thanks for the call
10357000	10359000	alright, later
10359000	10361000	have a good one, bye
10361000	10363000	alright
10363000	10365000	we have the phones ringing, so let's get to another call
10365000	10367000	hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio, who's this?
10367000	10369000	hey guys, it's Jason
10369000	10371000	what up?
10371000	10373000	I am currently barreling down the east side of the Rockies
10373000	10375000	which is why your voice was missed
10375000	10377000	from the intro this evening
10377000	10379000	as you're in your car, zooming down a mountain
10379000	10381000	that is responsibly
10381000	10383000	responsibly, I am answering both hands around the wheel
10383000	10385000	I promise, alright, fair enough, fair enough
10385000	10387000	what's on your mind?
10387000	10389000	even if my car is magical enough that I technically don't have to
10389000	10391000	I still do have both hands on the wheel
10391000	10393000	you guys have brought up a couple of cons
10393000	10395000	con things and VR things
10395000	10397000	and so I just kind of wanted to chime in with my two cents
10397000	10399000	of the last couple of weeks
10399000	10401000	while you were down at Dragon Con
10401000	10403000	I was quite literally in the opposite end of the US
10403000	10405000	at PAX West
10405000	10407000	oh yes, the other thing that happened over Labor Day
10407000	10409000	how was it?
10409000	10411000	the other four days of madness
10411000	10413000	this was my first West
10413000	10415000	as many of you know, it's been called Prime
10415000	10417000	up until this year and now they're calling it West
10417000	10419000	for consistency
10419000	10421000	between East, West and South
10421000	10423000	my first West, my second PAX
10423000	10425000	I went to PAX South at the start of this year
10425000	10427000	it was definitely a lot more hectic
10427000	10429000	but at the same time
10429000	10431000	a lot bigger
10431000	10433000	a lot more events
10433000	10435000	still very social
10435000	10437000	largely to do with the fact of the
10437000	10439000	more and more people I'm meeting
10439000	10441000	in various communities
10441000	10443000	Twitch spearheaded or not, but a number of those people
10443000	10445000	are also involved with the games
10445000	10447000	with the larger gaming community
10447000	10449000	business wise
10449000	10451000	so it just kind of steamrolls from there
10451000	10453000	the show floor
10453000	10455000	itself was nice and big
10455000	10457000	very tiring
10457000	10459000	everybody had their space
10459000	10461000	you see all the
10461000	10463000	Twitch and their mammoth
10463000	10465000	streaming center and partner center
10465000	10467000	Intel, Blizzard
10467000	10469000	even
10469000	10471000	Tiny Build had a
10471000	10473000	shockingly good presence
10473000	10475000	considering their up and up over the last couple of years
10475000	10477000	but a lot of familiar faces
10477000	10479000	but still a bunch of hidden gems
10479000	10481000	and the Indie Mega Booth
10481000	10483000	Mega Box I think it technically is
10483000	10485000	and then various other locations
10487000	10489000	tying specifically to the show
10489000	10491000	there were two things that you guys have touched on
10491000	10493000	that I wanted to bring up
10493000	10495000	I don't know exactly who
10495000	10497000	the individuals are, but with the story
10497000	10499000	about Interplay going under
10499000	10501000	and selling off IPs
10501000	10503000	the founding members
10503000	10505000	the founding creators
10505000	10507000	of Descent have already moved on
10507000	10509000	from Interplay and they were
10509000	10511000	exhibiting their own game called
10511000	10513000	Overload in VR
10513000	10515000	at PAX West
10515000	10517000	I don't think it was ever really covered on the show
10517000	10519000	before, but they had a Kickstarter as
10519000	10521000	one does, they're still offering pre-orders
10521000	10523000	that count towards stretch goals
10523000	10525000	but they have very
10525000	10527000	significant plans
10527000	10529000	a very great Vive
10529000	10531000	backed demonstration of
10531000	10533000	what Overload is
10533000	10535000	going to do and it is
10535000	10537000	six degrees of freedom
10537000	10539000	multiplayer, robot
10539000	10541000	zero gravity
10541000	10543000	dogfighting
10543000	10545000	I unfortunately didn't really feel like queuing up
10545000	10547000	in the line, but watching it was
10547000	10549000	absolutely spectacular
10549000	10551000	and I absolutely am looking forward to another
10551000	10553000	Descent game as well
10553000	10555000	yeah, you're not the first one to say that logically
10555000	10557000	those guys should be the ones that
10557000	10559000	try to bid for that Descent
10559000	10561000	IP, whether they have the money to do so or not
10561000	10563000	we'll see, but
10563000	10565000	yeah, it would make a lot of sense
10565000	10567000	that they should probably try to make a play for it
10567000	10569000	that would be quite a stretch goal
10569000	10571000	fund our
10571000	10573000	IP acquisition attempt
10573000	10575000	well, you never know
10575000	10577000	there might be a magical publisher out there
10577000	10579000	who's willing to marry the two together
10579000	10581000	like will front the money
10581000	10583000	for this if
10583000	10585000	that would be
10585000	10587000	one of the better
10587000	10589000	stories, like one of the most
10589000	10591000	monumental stories that I've heard in the last
10591000	10593000	jeez, decade I guess, I don't know
10593000	10595000	if you guys
10595000	10597000	want to look up more information, media
10597000	10599000	and all that stuff, playoverload.com
10599000	10601000	plenty
10601000	10603000	plenty of media there to go up, screenshots
10603000	10605000	screenshots, a little bit of gameplay video
10605000	10607000	demonstration of what it does in and out
10607000	10609000	of VR and then the common
10609000	10611000	game's gonna have multiplayer and
10611000	10613000	epic robot battles
10613000	10615000	and huge boss battles, etc.
10615000	10617000	VR
10617000	10619000	more generally
10619000	10621000	I, prior to PAX West
10621000	10623000	I had only ever used
10623000	10625000	Oculus Dead Kit 1
10625000	10627000	I never, I didn't queue up at
10627000	10629000	E3 for
10629000	10631000	VR, I haven't seen HoloLens
10631000	10633000	and I haven't
10633000	10635000	bumped anybody nearby to see
10635000	10637000	their Vive or anything of the sort
10637000	10639000	up on the sixth floor, which is
10639000	10641000	where a lot of
10641000	10643000	indie, both publishers
10643000	10645000	and developers were exhibiting
10645000	10647000	there was a little corner for
10647000	10649000	University of Washington, UW I think
10649000	10651000	it was, their game development
10651000	10653000	program, I got
10653000	10655000	talking to a couple of people because they just had
10655000	10657000	a free throw
10657000	10659000	a three point shootout simulator game
10659000	10661000	and that was my first experience
10661000	10663000	using the Vive and it was
10663000	10665000	it was
10665000	10667000	Loki was talking earlier about how
10667000	10669000	everything with a big name attached to
10669000	10671000	is an experience and so it's
10671000	10673000	kind of less interesting
10673000	10675000	but this game, like I said
10675000	10677000	free throw or three point shootout
10677000	10679000	I'm not quite sure where on the line it was
10679000	10681000	but it was a basketball simulator running
10681000	10683000	Vive called Nothing But Net
10683000	10685000	or Nothing But Net
10685000	10687000	and
10687000	10689000	it was, I
10689000	10691000	hadn't actually really paid attention to the
10691000	10693000	controllers yet, but to extend those
10693000	10695000	as your hands and use it for
10695000	10697000	just simple
10697000	10699000	ball grabbing, basketball
10699000	10701000	grabbing, not that other
10701000	10703000	kind, basketball grabbing
10703000	10705000	oh my
10705000	10707000	basketball
10707000	10709000	grabbing, flick and release and
10709000	10711000	the world that they created
10711000	10713000	which was just like a high school
10713000	10715000	gym, fairly nondescript
10715000	10717000	but it still felt very good to be in it
10717000	10719000	it was a very limited
10719000	10721000	demo, you just had
10721000	10723000	60 or 90 seconds to
10723000	10725000	shoot
10725000	10727000	to make shots
10727000	10729000	and
10729000	10731000	but it was fun, it was cute
10731000	10733000	it reminded me
10733000	10735000	both of you
10735000	10737000	possibly all three of you have talked about
10737000	10739000	video game renaissance and
10739000	10741000	I have played basketball in real life
10741000	10743000	I played for a season in elementary
10743000	10745000	school
10745000	10747000	basketball has obviously
10747000	10749000	been a part of American media forever
10749000	10751000	and I played some basketball
10751000	10753000	games on and off, it's never been my primary sport
10753000	10755000	but it was still fun
10755000	10757000	when talking
10757000	10759000	to the developers of this Nothing But Net game
10759000	10761000	I was talking to them about
10761000	10763000	this very, very basic
10763000	10765000	arcadey
10765000	10767000	three point shootout game for DOS
10767000	10769000	called Three Point Shootout
10769000	10771000	and to see
10771000	10773000	the progression of gaming all
10773000	10775000	over again to take
10775000	10777000	basic concepts to introduce
10777000	10779000	developers, players and everybody else
10779000	10781000	to how these
10781000	10783000	things actually work out in 3D and finally
10783000	10785000	being able to put
10785000	10787000	full body motion
10787000	10789000	into this kind of thing
10789000	10791000	it really tickled me in a really
10791000	10793000	really happy way and that was
10793000	10795000	definitely one of my
10795000	10797000	underrated gems of the show
10797000	10799000	that I just enjoyed
10799000	10801000	I just kind of hovered around listening to
10801000	10803000	conversations, I had a great conversation with
10803000	10805000	the husband and wife
10805000	10807000	development pair
10807000	10809000	talked about some of their plans
10809000	10811000	what they could do, gave them reference
10811000	10813000	to prior art and plenty of things
10813000	10815000	the demo was
10815000	10817000	just a single round of shots, they talked about
10817000	10819000	a lot of other things like horse
10819000	10821000	and multiplayer and
10821000	10823000	MMO-esque simulation
10823000	10825000	because it is a gem with multiple hoops and maybe
10825000	10827000	maybe even going on into
10827000	10829000	like a two on two NBA Jam style
10829000	10831000	thing maybe
10831000	10833000	but it was fun, it was simple
10833000	10835000	it was conventional and it hit all of
10835000	10837000	the spots to be able to take
10837000	10839000	a basic
10839000	10841000	concept and apply it into the VR
10841000	10843000	world in such a
10843000	10845000	simple but
10845000	10847000	excellent way
10847000	10849000	so it sounds like you had a pretty
10849000	10851000	successful PAX West
10851000	10853000	it's no longer PAX Prime
10853000	10855000	I heard that's
10855000	10857000	because PAX East is the real PAX Prime at
10857000	10859000	this point but I won't go there
10859000	10861000	how were the panels, did you go any panels
10861000	10863000	any of that stuff? I did zero
10863000	10865000	panels, I was
10865000	10867000	incredibly line averse so
10867000	10869000	the guide book was
10869000	10871000	a map reference for me and I
10871000	10873000	just didn't pay attention to any of the panels
10873000	10875000	which is a little weird
10875000	10877000	for me I guess, sort of, but I don't know
10877000	10879000	I was there for the people
10879000	10881000	I was there for the people and friends first
10881000	10883000	that I don't get to see in person nearly enough
10883000	10885000	and in between
10885000	10887000	that I made my own adventure across
10887000	10889000	the show floor
10889000	10891000	very quickly I guess one of my
10891000	10893000	other underrated ones that I haven't even
10893000	10895000	been thinking about, talking about
10895000	10897000	for some stupid reason
10897000	10899000	if anybody knows the
10899000	10901000	old Neo Geo game
10901000	10903000	Windjammers, one of the
10903000	10905000	multi game, multi game arcade machines
10905000	10907000	we saw in
10907000	10909000	mini golf and bowling alleys and all those
10909000	10911000	kinds of things, that game is
10911000	10913000	coming back to PC and
10913000	10915000	PS4 in the form
10915000	10917000	of a disc jam by people who
10917000	10919000	also grew up with the game and loved it
10919000	10921000	and are turning it into
10921000	10923000	a little
10923000	10925000	steep down
10925000	10927000	pong that I break up a little bit
10927000	10929000	yeah you're breaking up a little bit but you're back now
10929000	10931000	that sounds
10931000	10933000	disc jam
10933000	10935000	already in some gamers hands
10935000	10937000	PC and PS4
10937000	10939000	Windjammers-esque with an updated
10939000	10941000	look and feel and
10941000	10943000	that was quite a treat to be able
10943000	10945000	to talk to other fans that
10945000	10947000	finally did something with the game and moved into it
10947000	10949000	and yeah
10949000	10951000	alright, very cool, alright well sounds like you had a
10951000	10953000	good time, TwitchCon are you doing that
10953000	10955000	in a few weeks, isn't that the same weekend
10955000	10957000	as GamerX right I heard?
10957000	10959000	it is the last, it's like September 30th
10959000	10961000	into the start of October
10961000	10963000	same weekend as
10963000	10965000	GamerX, that's some unfortunate timing
10965000	10967000	I
10967000	10969000	am
10969000	10971000	I should be doing TwitchCon, I am
10971000	10973000	tentatively doing it, I'm
10973000	10975000	actually, I wasn't supposed to be heading home
10975000	10977000	I was supposed to still be along
10977000	10979000	the Pacific Coast, quite possibly in the
10979000	10981000	studio
10981000	10983000	next weekend, but I had
10983000	10985000	a little home incident occur
10985000	10987000	so that's why I am currently barreling down
10987000	10989000	the east side of the Rockies
10989000	10991000	I hope everything's okay, so
10991000	10993000	alright, well I'm gonna go ahead and let you go, okay?
10993000	10995000	Sounds good, have a good night!
10995000	10997000	Alright, thanks for calling, take care
10997000	10999000	Alright,
10999000	11001000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype
11001000	11003000	Looking quickly, some chat comments
11003000	11005000	Kajuda says, OMG, Twitch has a con too?
11005000	11007000	What do they all do, meet up on
11007000	11009000	Skype and stream? No, I
11009000	11011000	went last year, actually because of Jason
11011000	11013000	Jason was like, I have an extra ticket, are you
11013000	11015000	sure you don't want to go? Because in San Francisco
11015000	11017000	it would be very easy for you to go, so I was like
11017000	11019000	sure I'll go, I thought it was interesting
11019000	11021000	I actually, I left a little
11021000	11023000	more motivated to do more streaming, which
11023000	11025000	has been hit and miss, some weeks
11025000	11027000	I'm able to do a bunch, I probably haven't done
11027000	11029000	one in a month, just because, you know, I
11029000	11031000	am doing four podcasts on
11031000	11033000	and off, so it's kind of like a lot of my creative energy
11033000	11035000	time goes into that, so
11035000	11037000	alright, let's try to sneak in at least one more quick call here
11037000	11039000	before we call it a night, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
11039000	11041000	Hey, this is Akdeft
11041000	11043000	Hi Akdeft, how are you?
11043000	11045000	Really great, really great
11045000	11047000	What's on your mind?
11047000	11049000	Well, anyways, I want to talk about
11049000	11051000	the Super Mario
11051000	11053000	Run announcement
11053000	11055000	What do you think?
11055000	11057000	Well, basically, it's
11057000	11059000	not something that
11059000	11061000	necessarily
11061000	11063000	is
11063000	11065000	well, I had the idea
11065000	11067000	in my head, and
11067000	11069000	I kind of
11069000	11071000	missed my train of thought
11071000	11073000	but basically
11073000	11075000	what they're trying to do, or I think
11075000	11077000	what they're trying to do is basically
11077000	11079000	like, cross-promotion
11079000	11081000	of some sort
11081000	11083000	because they're not
11083000	11085000	and this is something I was talking
11085000	11087000	with other friends
11087000	11089000	they're not offering the full game
11089000	11091000	right now, it's
11091000	11093000	even if you see like
11093000	11095000	Super Mario Run as a full game
11095000	11097000	it kind of isn't because
11097000	11099000	it isn't like the full Super Mario
11099000	11101000	experience
11101000	11103000	and we can see it like
11103000	11105000	in stuff like Super Mario Maker or
11105000	11107000	New Super Mario Bros
11107000	11109000	and all that stuff
11109000	11111000	but something that was curious
11111000	11113000	and this relates also to
11113000	11115000	Pokémon GO
11115000	11117000	that the 3DS sales
11117000	11119000	went up
11119000	11121000	I think for July, and I don't think
11121000	11123000	for August, I don't know
11123000	11125000	but many people
11125000	11127000	pre-ordered in expectation
11127000	11129000	of Pokémon Sun and Moon
11129000	11131000	so I'm
11131000	11133000	trying to guess
11133000	11135000	here that basically they
11135000	11137000	did this
11137000	11139000	maybe because they want part of the
11139000	11141000	mobile market, maybe that's something
11141000	11143000	like
11143000	11145000	secondary
11145000	11147000	but I think
11147000	11149000	they're trying to like
11149000	11151000	promote their own stuff through
11151000	11153000	other media
11153000	11155000	I don't know if that makes sense
11155000	11157000	You know, that's something that I
11157000	11159000	this is Gabriel, good to meet you man
11159000	11161000	this is
11161000	11163000	something that I was mentioning
11163000	11165000	earlier with my little
11165000	11167000	speculation
11167000	11169000	about the NX
11169000	11171000	and me getting the
11171000	11173000	impression that
11173000	11175000	that's what I think Nintendo's trying to do
11175000	11177000	I think them releasing
11177000	11179000	this Mario game
11179000	11181000	on iOS is a hint
11181000	11183000	of what's coming for NX
11183000	11185000	to an extent, that's just my impression
11185000	11187000	of it, so I
11187000	11189000	I really just need them to fucking reveal the
11189000	11191000	NX already, get this fucking time
11191000	11193000	Tokyo Game Show is in two
11193000	11195000	weeks, I'm sick of the speculation
11195000	11197000	all this wank
11197000	11199000	you know I love that word
11199000	11201000	all this Twitter wank
11201000	11203000	granted, we've been no help either
11203000	11205000	we have the wank and the tinfoil hats on this show
11205000	11207000	as well, I'm fucking sick of it
11207000	11209000	it's after labor day
11209000	11211000	no more white shoes
11211000	11213000	and a goddamn NX announcement
11213000	11215000	let's do it
11215000	11217000	Hey Act, can I ask
11217000	11219000	that's just
11219000	11221000	by the word of Rob
11221000	11223000	can I ask you something really quick because you mentioned
11223000	11225000	something that I found
11225000	11227000	very intriguing
11227000	11229000	as a
11229000	11231000	mobile, you play games on mobile
11231000	11233000	I take it
11233000	11235000	right? Yeah. Okay. Do you
11235000	11237000	feel that
11237000	11239000	as a mobile gamer
11239000	11241000	the price
11241000	11243000	that you pay
11243000	11245000	do you feel it's fair to say that
11245000	11247000	one should still expect
11247000	11249000	the full game experience
11249000	11251000	on mobile
11251000	11253000	or should it really just be
11253000	11255000	are you really just paying for something
11255000	11257000	that's going to be a quick
11257000	11259000	time consuming thing and then we move on
11259000	11261000	I mean do you fully expect
11261000	11263000	do you fully expect the full
11263000	11265000	video game experience on a mobile, should you
11265000	11267000	expect that on a mobile phone?
11267000	11269000	I think we
11269000	11271000	should expect something like that
11271000	11273000	it's not
11273000	11275000	it's not necessarily like
11275000	11277000	exclusive to a console
11277000	11279000	or in this case to a mobile game
11279000	11281000	but I think
11281000	11283000	my point is
11283000	11285000	because we have seen runners
11285000	11287000	in consoles
11287000	11289000	we have the bit trip
11289000	11291000	runner series
11291000	11293000	like for example
11293000	11295000	maybe even Rayman
11295000	11297000	I don't consider it a runner
11297000	11299000	but they do have mobile
11299000	11301000	versions that pretty much are runners
11301000	11303000	right
11303000	11305000	but my point was
11305000	11307000	you don't get the full
11307000	11309000	experience
11309000	11311000	as in you only go
11311000	11313000	right instead of going
11313000	11315000	left to
11315000	11317000	you don't have full control over Mario
11317000	11319000	in this case
11319000	11321000	where in a console
11321000	11323000	in even a portable version
11323000	11325000	of Mario you have full control
11325000	11327000	of what you can
11327000	11329000	what Mario does
11329000	11331000	in the game
11331000	11333000	so I
11333000	11335000	I don't see like
11335000	11337000	Super Mario Run like a bad thing
11337000	11339000	at all
11339000	11341000	it seems interesting enough
11341000	11343000	but yeah
11343000	11345000	I don't think Nintendo is
11345000	11347000	putting all the
11347000	11349000	all their money into the mobile market
11349000	11351000	at least just yet
11351000	11353000	and at one point it's exactly
11353000	11355000	the next part
11355000	11357000	or point of this
11357000	11359000	yeah there's got to be a correlation
11359000	11361000	somehow and there was a comment in the chat
11361000	11363000	that I just seen when they
11363000	11365000	I didn't see who it was that mentioned
11365000	11367000	was the NX going to be running Android
11367000	11369000	hardware they were going to be using
11369000	11371000	a processor
11371000	11373000	chip that
11373000	11375000	can that fuels Android
11375000	11377000	but not necessarily
11377000	11379000	that doesn't necessarily mean you know it's going to be
11379000	11381000	an Android based thing it's just a processor
11381000	11383000	I can't remember what it was called
11383000	11385000	similar parts but not necessarily how they function
11385000	11387000	right like a Tegra or something like that
11387000	11389000	it's like a Tegra processor
11389000	11391000	but for me I think
11391000	11393000	this is a way for Nintendo to be making money
11393000	11395000	this holiday season when
11395000	11397000	the Wii U is not going to be expected to
11397000	11399000	really do anything I think this is something
11399000	11401000	Nintendo is under a lot of pressure to do
11401000	11403000	and I think again that's why you see them
11403000	11405000	coming up with all these other creative ways to make money
11405000	11407000	this holiday to keep their investors
11407000	11409000	happy is oh we have the classic NES
11409000	11411000	which we know stands to do well oh we have the
11411000	11413000	Pokemon Go bracelet oh we have
11413000	11415000	you know the mobile venture
11415000	11417000	you know we're going to put our biggest thing
11417000	11419000	on mobile so maybe this is why
11419000	11421000	they bumped Mario up to this year
11421000	11423000	was to kind of show that they're
11423000	11425000	going to still be productive through this holiday
11425000	11427000	so maybe even if the
11427000	11429000	NX tanks which you know
11429000	11431000	I don't want to see that happen I don't think
11431000	11433000	any gaming fan would want that
11433000	11435000	although I just want to know what the fuck it is already
11435000	11437000	I think
11437000	11439000	you know Nintendo can show that they as a company
11439000	11441000	could still stay afloat no matter what
11441000	11443000	definitely so anyway
11443000	11445000	I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show
11445000	11447000	but thanks for the call and for the insight
11447000	11449000	hey thanks for having me
11449000	11451000	alright that's going to do it for the

11461000	11463000	and say our good nights we have to make sure
11463000	11465000	that we get any residual angst
11465000	11467000	out of our system so that we can successfully
11467000	11469000	start a new week

11657000	11659000	you can't really remaster the game too much
11659000	11661000	I mean it's
11661000	11663000	clearly they can't make a new one so
11663000	11665000	might as well keep doing what works

11889000	11891000	most welcome
11891000	11893000	Loki my friend that's it we made it
11893000	11895000	to the end of an episode here it's not
11895000	11897000	longer episode but a good one uh any
11897000	11899000	final thoughts for our listeners tonight I'm just tired
11899000	11901000	now yeah I'm depressed
11901000	11903000	tired of eBay it'll be okay
11903000	11905000	well happy birthday though you know what we have some
11905000	11907000	awesome some listeners were saying we should you know what we
11907000	11909000	should all put 25 bucks in and help
11909000	11911000	Loki get the damn DDR machine that's
11911000	11913000	not the thing that's why it was such a disappointment
11913000	11915000	because those those cabinets and granted
11915000	11917000	it was slightly broken I would have needed to
11917000	11919000	you know fix up some stuff but that's
11919000	11921000	fine I mean like a new cabinet
11921000	11923000	goes for over a thousand dollars it's
11923000	11925000	like yeah that's why it stings so bad
11925000	11927000	because it's it's like that's
11927000	11929000	actually more cost effective to do it that way
11929000	11931000	than it would have been to build pads
11931000	11933000	I got build pads but now you're reminding
11933000	11935000	me like oh you know if I you know now
11935000	11937000	that I'm not upgrading my phone this year
11937000	11939000	now that it looks like I'm probably not going to get the PlayStation
11939000	11941000	4 Pro and I may not even get the VR
11941000	11943000	at this point we'll see I'm kind of on the fence with that
11943000	11945000	maybe this is the year Rob's finally
11945000	11947000	going to get his cocktail cabinet because I really I really
11947000	11949000	kind of want one I was gonna say you practically have the
11949000	11951000	money for that for a cocktail cabinet now
11951000	11953000	if you don't get those two things yeah I know you've got the
11953000	11955000	money for that now only only if
11955000	11957000	get it on Amazon you can pre-order it and then
11957000	11959000	part of me is like you should save that money to
11959000	11961000	do responsible things like home buying
11961000	11963000	oh come on who needs adulthood we need
11963000	11965000	cocktail tables come on man
11965000	11967000	priorities exactly what future you got
11967000	11969000	a bar top that I built oh
11969000	11971000	well there you go you're halfway there man I know I
11971000	11973000	know all right
11973000	11975000	my final thought tonight I
11975000	11977000	I can't think of an awful lot I'm just gonna say
11977000	11979000	I'm gonna I'm gonna try to play
11979000	11981000	more Overwatch which will make Alan very
11981000	11983000	happy because Alan plays a fucking ton of
11983000	11985000	Overwatch I think it's like all he
11985000	11987000	ever he plays that and then I'll see him play No Man's
11987000	11989000	Sky a little bit and he's back to playing Overwatch
11989000	11991000	he plays a lot of fucking Overwatch and he has like
11991000	11993000	like bro friends he made playing
11993000	11995000	Overwatch and everything that he
11995000	11997000	gets on there and he bro chats
11997000	11999000	about how you know there's a reaper back
11999000	12001000	behind the thing I just I'm like wow he's
12001000	12003000	like really really good and when I
12003000	12005000	play with him I'm fucking terrible so
12005000	12007000	I need to up a game
12007000	12009000	on Overwatch so I might be working on
12009000	12011000	that this week or I might play
12011000	12013000	Grand Theft Auto 5 to keep Loki happy
12013000	12015000	and after all it is his birthday
12015000	12017000	yes I hope you
12017000	12019000	had a good birthday all things considered
12019000	12021000	Loki indeed if not maybe maybe
12021000	12023000	this week will be good too
12023000	12025000	I have to go back to the call center
12025000	12027000	in a few weeks so that's not making me too happy
12027000	12029000	well enjoy the few weeks that you know you don't have to
12029000	12031000	be there so it's like here's how
12031000	12033000	frustrating it is yes we would love
12033000	12035000	to hire you for this department
12035000	12037000	but because of some corporate
12037000	12039000	tree bullshit we've got
12039000	12041000	to not hire people even though
12041000	12043000	we desperately need people because some higher
12043000	12045000	up person thinks it's a good
12045000	12047000	idea not to spend money of course
12047000	12049000	unlike corporate
12049000	12051000	America which is also what your wife
12051000	12053000	says it's a good idea not to spend money right
12053000	12055000	and she says that about everything
12055000	12057000	we can have like billions of dollars
12057000	12059000	like don't spend any of it it's like
12059000	12061000	I'm not I'm not gonna do that
12061000	12063000	alright alright
12063000	12065000	that's gonna do it have a great week happy gaming
12065000	12067000	everybody we will see you back here in
12067000	12069000	seven days and by the way
12069000	12071000	I don't know how many of you long time listeners notice
