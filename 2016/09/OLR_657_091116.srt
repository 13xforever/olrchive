My name is Rob Roberts joining you here in Studio N7

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000

and with me in studio, as he always is, say hello to Techmaster Loki

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hi

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm alright

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Happy birthday! Today is your birthday

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I know there's other historical events weighing heavy on people's minds today for good reason

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and you know, obviously our thoughts go out to those that are affected all these years later

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but, you know, things go on and we still do our podcast

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and you still celebrate birthdays

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which is today

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And what did you do to celebrate? How was your day?

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, I...

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This does not sound like a happy birthday

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'd like to say I did something fun

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but it really was just the wife was stressed out about the kids all day long

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so she was in a really fantastic mood this morning

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so I went out and got breakfast for her

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and then we went grocery shopping

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and the kids were just acting up like they usually do

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and then we bought stuff to make food

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
she wanted me to make salmon wellingtons

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
so I made salmon wellingtons

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and then she didn't want to buy, this week for some reason, the frozen macaroni

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
or not macaroni cheese, spaghetti and meat sauce for our kids

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
because it has MSG in it

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
so I also had to make spaghetti with a meat sauce

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
for two hours standing up, didn't eat lunch

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
felt like shit until I had some cereal

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
so I wouldn't pass out from stress

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which we'll get into in a little bit

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
why I'm so fucking stressed

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and then...

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't worry about this, alright

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I mean, I guess we could talk about it now, why not?

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why not? Let's talk briefly about why are you so stressed out?

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you need a hug?

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, so here's what happened

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes, you need a hug?

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What happened?

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, obviously it's my birthday today

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and so I typically every year

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
because I'm weird like this

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I buy myself something for my birthday

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why not?

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Because everybody else is the excuse

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know what they get you, you know, whatever

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
so that's fine

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I get myself awesome birthday presents

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I treat myself the way I deserve to be treated

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Exactly

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
My friends are very generous too

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
but I know I'm gonna buy myself something

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And just on a whim

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and I don't even know what prompted it

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
it was just like I was at work one day and I was on a whim

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and I was like, you know

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I haven't checked eBay in a while

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
because I used to go on eBay and I used to go look at DDR stuff

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
just for the hell of it

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And this is where it started

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So in Rancho Cordova there was a guy selling a TechnoMotion machine

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
for $99 starting

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and I was like, holy shit

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm never gonna be able to find something this perfect

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I feel like I already know the punchline that's coming

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and I'm really worried

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Go ahead

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, it gets worse

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, it gets worse

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm already upset about it

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So anyways, the whole week I'm stressing out

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm like, oh, I can't possibly do this

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My wife would kill me if I got this

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There's no way

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So we were just at Best Buy yesterday

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
because we went out to dinner

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
because we have to kill time because the kids are there

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and she's like, well, let's go get you something at Best Buy

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm like, okay, we'll go walk around, look at stuff

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and I didn't know what I really wanted, so whatever

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and so I brought up, I'm like, well, you know

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it'd be cool if I could get this, this cabinet

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I mean, it's really huge

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and she's constantly complaining, stressed out about how our house is a mess

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
because there's just clutter everywhere

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
which happens when you have kids, but yeah

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and she wants to get rid of it

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and I've already set up to throw away some of that

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
but I still wanted this cabinet and stuff

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
so earlier today I was talking with her about it

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and I'm like, at that point it was up to, I think, 102.50 or something like that

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or no, 205 is what it was sitting at

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and it was sitting at that for a few days

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and so I was like, okay

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
so I gotta run this by the wife and see if I can get an okay

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and if it's okay, maybe I'll try, you know, bidding on it

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
so reluctantly after, you know, she's very not happy with this idea

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
she's like, fine, whatever, just do whatever you want

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and so, and then she finally kind of warmed up to it a little bit

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
after she was like, you know, once she got in the car and drove away with the kids

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
so I got basically the green light to go ahead and bid on this

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and I was gonna basically cap it at about $300

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I may have gone a little higher than that just to see if I could, you know, get it

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
so I'm getting everything ready

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I've got my computer up on the eBay page, ready to go

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and I'm putting away clothes and stuff

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and I'm watching the clock and the clock in our room's not right

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
so it's about three minutes before I need to get there

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
so I'm going to the living room

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I notice the clock in the kitchen says it's one minute before, not three minutes before

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I look at my computer, it's 30 seconds before the auction ends

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
so it's like, oh shit, put in my bid, highest bidder

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
but the problem was I put it in about 10 seconds too early

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I got outbid

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
so I had it for $250

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I had it for $250 for 10 seconds

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and then I got outbid and if I only fucking waited a few more seconds

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I would have had a fucking DDR machine

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
whatever

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
well sorry to hear it

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
it's so frustrating though

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I always thought eBay worked

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
like you're supposed to put in the most you're going to pay anyway

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
no, it's bid sniping, it's always bid sniping

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you always got to bid snipe

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I decided to shop eBay

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I remember doing eBay

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but it was so perfect, like it was cheap

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I bought a copy of Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
it was cheap and it was fucking local

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
like cheap and local and it was a Technomotion machine

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and the screen, the monitor didn't work on it

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
or it may have not worked, something didn't work

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
like the hardware for the Technomotion didn't work

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
but it's a fucking seller on PC

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is basically what Technomotion is

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
it's a seller on PC with an old ass video card

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm like, that's fucking perfect

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
just rip it out, throw a new PC in there

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
step mania done

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and then you know, fix up the pads

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you know, possibly put metal over the other pads

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
or you know, we're golden

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
it just wasn't to be, unfortunately

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and it would have been so fucking perfect

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
but I was so stressed out because I had to talk to my wife about it

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and it's, you know, a big auction lady

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and it's so stressed out

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
but now, okay, so you lost this one

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
okay, caeser-a-ser-a

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
but now, like, don't you kind of have like this pass

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
like, don't you get to put that card in your pocket

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
like, hey honey, remember when you said I could get the machine

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
no, it doesn't work that way

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
it doesn't work that way at all

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
but it's fine, you know, because like

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you know, we're throwing away stuff in the garage

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and I gotta move my arcade cabinet out there anyways

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
because, you know, the kids

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and originally I wanted to like set up

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
you know, dance pads with it

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
but it would have been so perfect not having to build

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
because it was the same price to build those pads

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
as it is to buy a whole fucking machine

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
so, it's like

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you know, why not

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I mean, I wouldn't have picked Technomotion as my first choice

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
but

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
whatever, it's basically DDR machines

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
some folks in our chat

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
let me, of course, formally introduce the chat room

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
hello chatters, and you can chat along with our show live

194
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we do tape live every Sunday night

195
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and if you are listening live

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
participating with our show, you can join our chat

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
over at live.vognetwork.com

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
so, real quick

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
so I, here's what it actually went for

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
so I bid $350

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
even though we agreed on $300, I still wanted to have a margin

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
okay, because some folks wanted to know

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
what does a little higher mean, so

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and I really should have counterbid

208
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but who knows if I would even want it

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
it went for $366

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
it's still not that much

211
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
no, it's not

212
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
but whatever, I mean

213
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
it's techno motion though

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
it's a copy of a copy

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
but it doesn't matter, I wanted it for the hardware

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't give a shit about that

217
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you deserve a prime DDR machine

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you deserve something legit

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I didn't, I mean, it's basically

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the pads are exactly the same, you just

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
cover up the other

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the other buttons

223
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Tech 2030 in our chat wants to know a little more

224
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
if eBay automatically lets the highest bidder win

225
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
at the end of the auction

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
how do you still snipe people?

227
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
because what it is, is you put in basically

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
say

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
say someone wants to pay

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
$250 for something

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and yes, you could think, okay

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
$250 is all I can pay, you know, here's what I'm going to put in

233
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but

234
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
you know,

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I would have paid

236
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
a few extra, if I knew it was going to go for $366

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I would put $367 in

238
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I mean, obviously, that's what it would have done

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and so, it would have stated that

240
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
because, see, the problem was he had

241
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the person that had time to respond

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
to, he saw I got outbid, and he had

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
time to put in another bid

244
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the trick, when an early bid on that stuff, is you wait

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
until like, there's 10 seconds left

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and there's no time, you, if you're lucky

247
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
enough to be high enough, then you get it

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and there's no time for them to react

249
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
it's all some damn psychological game

250
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you guys turned it into something way sicker

251
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
but that's how you

252
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
get stuff for cheaper though, because

253
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
if you just put in, I want to pay $250

254
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
for it, then it's going to sit at $250

255
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and someone's just going to pay $250

256
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
but it's all psychological, because you're like

257
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
$250 is the most I'm willing to pay

258
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
but then when you see somebody, some little fucker snipes you

259
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and gets $251, then you're like

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
well shit, I'd pay $252

261
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
so, aha, $250 isn't the most

262
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you'd pay, you're actually willing to pay more

263
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that's the psychological game

264
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
is, how much are you

265
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
willing to pay for this shit

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
is, how much are you really willing to pay for this

267
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
it's a sick game

268
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
it is, but see, I'm out of practice

269
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
it's been several, it's been at least a couple

270
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
of years since I've actually bit sniped somebody

271
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and I was panicked because

272
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I almost missed it, because I was putting away clothes

273
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
from the laundry

274
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and I was like, shit, there's like 28 seconds

275
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
left, I'm like holy fuck, I'm glad

276
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I got you here in time, I just like

277
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I put stuff in and I was like, worried

278
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
because sometimes you put in a bid, they're like

279
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
oh, please sign back in again, you know, because

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
make sure that you're signed in

281
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
or some shit, and you know, if that

282
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
comes in there with 10 seconds left, it could fuck you

283
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
with, you know, not being able to actually place a bid

284
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I do want to introduce our guest

285
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
who's been sitting here very patiently listening

286
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
to the horrors of your

287
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
eBay day, but I do

288
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
want to quickly acknowledge some folks may have

289
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
forgot, where's DarkSakura?

290
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Remember DarkSakura, this is her first

291
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
week of her hiatus from the show, she will

292
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
be gone from the show for a couple of months

293
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
due to an arrangement

294
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
with her day job, she's just unable to

295
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
make the show for a couple of months, however

296
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
we will be hearing her a little later on

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
during the Classic Game of the Week through the Magic Radio

298
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
she will still be joining us every week for that

299
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and she did confirm to me this week

300
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
she got November 20th off

301
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
so she can be here for episode 666

302
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
so at least she's making sure that the important

303
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
stuff is covered, so

304
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
yeah, that's, literally, hell yeah

305
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
so, anyway

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
meanwhile, we

307
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
have a guest here in studio with us and it's

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
a friend of the show who's been here a couple of times before

309
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but we're really excited to welcome him back, it's always

310
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
a good time to welcome to the show

311
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Gabe from Nascent Games

312
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
creators of Crumple

313
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Kinship and whatever

314
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
other projects this man takes on

315
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
because he does games like I do podcasts

316
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and also

317
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
involved with Sacramento

318
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
IGDA, what's your role with

319
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
SACIGDA? I'm the founder and chair of

320
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
IGDA, you're the Grand Pooba

321
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
basically, you are

322
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you are SACIGDA

323
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
so I put it like

324
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm the face of

325
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
IGDA Sacramento and then I have my

326
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
vice chair of Brianna who's the

327
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
voice of IGDA

328
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Sacramento because she's the vice chair

329
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
that's a very good way of putting it because I know Brianna works her little

330
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
fanny off for IGDA, she does

331
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
great work, and hello Brianna

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
if you're listening out there

333
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
so I definitely want to talk to you a little

334
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
bit about what's going on with Nascent Games and Crumple

335
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and all that, we're going to get to our kickoff topic

336
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
first, I'm sure you have some things to say about this

337
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
as well, one or two

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Loki, let's talk about

339
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
what Sony unveiled this week in our kickoff topic

340
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
so Sony had their little

341
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
press conference if you will

342
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
they unveiled basically

343
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
hey, you know that Playstation Slim

344
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
that came out, or that got leaked out and had

345
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
reviewed and all that stuff, yeah it's real

346
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
basically going to be replacing

347
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
the Playstation 4 that's

348
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
available now

349
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and I want to say that it was

350
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
$2.99, and then

351
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
they've got the

352
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Playstation Pro

353
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
which is basically their

354
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Playstation Neo, it's what they're calling it now

355
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000

356
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
well

357
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
is it?

358
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
no, because that's just the first

359
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
thing I thought of when they announced that

360
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
would you like a Pro card instead?

361
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
that's a page out of

362
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Microsoft's playbook right there

363
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
the Xbox Elite

364
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and the Xbox Pro system

365
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
everything is Pro

366
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm okay with the name

367
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I didn't think it was actually going to be called Neo

368
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
it's basically $3.99

369
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it's more powerful

370
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
it will do

371
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
output to 4K

372
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
not natively

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
up res stuff, but it will be

374
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
better looking than

375
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the other stuff is now

376
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and will supposedly

377
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
help enhance

378
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
VR

379
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and stuff like that

380
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
not even you can say it in a complete

381
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
sentence without just

382
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
foaming at the mouth

383
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and that's precisely how Sony sounded

384
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
because not even they can be like

385
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
they just used a bunch of technobabble

386
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
no one gave a shit about it

387
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
it's just like

388
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
talking about

389
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
all this stuff and how they're gonna

390
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
maybe at the end of the day it's like

391
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
how much better are these games gonna look

392
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and a lot of these games are gonna be supporting

393
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
these enhancements including

394
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
starting off with Call of Duty for third party

395
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Call of Duty

396
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and even Black Ops 3 that came out last year

397
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
will get a patch to support

398
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the higher resolution

399
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
gameplay

400
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but will they be free?

401
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
yes

402
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I heard that some publishers

403
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
are gonna be free

404
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
there's a story out there somewhere

405
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
that Sony's saying

406
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
that publishers can essentially set

407
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
whatever price they want for it

408
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
no they retracted that

409
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
oh okay well that's good

410
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think the first company to do it would have gotten

411
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
a lot of internet BS

412
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
yeah I can see them doing that

413
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
so it's gonna be something

414
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
that's gonna be available

415
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
coming out in October

416
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and

417
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not really interested in picking it up

418
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
because I have a system

419
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
already and I don't

420
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
have a 4K TV although I did look at 4K TVs

421
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
yesterday because I was at Best Buy

422
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and there's some pretty nice 4K TVs that aren't too expensive

423
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
so

424
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
you know what caught my eye amongst that whole

425
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
press conference was the fact that they actually

426
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
showed the first Mass Effect Andromeda

427
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
like in-game footage and so

428
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
that definitely had me laying on the couch

429
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
going awwww

430
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I didn't know what any of it meant

431
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
it didn't look interesting at all

432
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I was living for it

433
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
every minute I was very happy

434
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
it's very pretty

435
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
oh my god and they're purposely obscuring

436
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
some of the characters and so forth

437
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
but I thought it looked great and so

438
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm certainly sitting there going okay

439
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
well if Andromeda

440
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
is gonna look better

441
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
on a pro

442
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
maybe I do need to get a PlayStation 4

443
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
pro but now

444
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
here's where I'm stuck now is because

445
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
okay yes

446
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
these games like Final Fantasy 15 even

447
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I think they showed in the sizzle footage

448
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
a lot of games coming up that people are

449
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
very hyped for that will supposedly look

450
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
better on the pro but then I worry

451
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
my television even though I bought it

452
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
last year as a 2014

453
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
model it doesn't do 4K

454
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and I don't think it does this

455
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
other coloring stuff they were talking about

456
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
so am I gonna get any benefit

457
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
from the PlayStation Pro

458
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and I kind of feel like that message

459
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
was garbled like I

460
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
know they said oh yes conventional

461
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
TVs will also see a benefit

462
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
because down sampling

463
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think is what they're talking about

464
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
basically it's gonna be a little bit clearer of a picture

465
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but is that really

466
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
worth selling your system and buying another

467
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
system for $100 more?

468
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No it's not and honestly

469
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
cause it's not just the system it's the

470
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
TV too you gotta get a TV

471
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and that's gonna

472
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
display that kind of content

473
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and there just isn't sufficient content

474
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
right now period other than Netflix

475
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
but even the discs

476
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
it won't play 4K Blu-ray disc

477
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
which was the dumbest

478
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
thing ever because Sony came up with

479
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Blu-ray and they're the

480
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
ones and oh yeah we beat HD DVD

481
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
but now here you are coming out

482
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
with PlayStation 4.5

483
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
instead of waiting like you should

484
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and they just

485
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
they put the limitation

486
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
on their own format

487
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
which is ridiculous

488
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
for them to have left

489
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
the door open for Microsoft

490
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
to be able to say hey our

491
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
entry level Xbox One S system

492
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
will do that that was a

493
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
real faux pas

494
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Microsoft jumped

495
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
on that like I mean they jumped on

496
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
that it was that was hilarious

497
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
yeah not this in particular

498
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but there's other things that have really gotten me

499
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
like pro Microsoft camp now

500
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
mainly one thing

501
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and we'll get to that later but

502
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
there's one thing I'm like really

503
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you can't do this like this bullshit

504
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
you can't fucking handle this

505
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Microsoft can do this no problem

506
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
but Sony oh poor Sony can't fucking

507
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
handle this shit and on top of

508
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
like all this other nonsense

509
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm like maybe I should get an Xbox One

510
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
then I can get this game on there instead

511
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
because I would be purchasing all my games

512
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
on Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4

513
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
with their multi-platform you know we asked our

514
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
users on Facebook in our community

515
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
over at Facebook.com slash Orange

516
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Lounge Radio about the PlayStation 4 Pro

517
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and here's some of the responses we got from our listeners

518
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
about what they feel about

519
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
this whole you know press

520
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
conference and if they want a PlayStation 4

521
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Pro or not our pal Critical Myth

522
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
said it's not clear to me what the benefit

523
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
of this console would be versus the

524
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
existing PlayStation 4 they have a

525
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
long way to go before I'm sold on the

526
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
need for it you know I'm kind of in a similar

527
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
spot with that because

528
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
what really got me was when

529
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I went back to go watch the

530
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Mass Effect footage on YouTube

531
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
or whatever it actually

532
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
the president of BioWare or whoever

533
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
it was sorry I forget who it was in the video actually

534
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
said if you're not on a 4K

535
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
TV to see this

536
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
go to one and

537
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
replay this or you know it's kind of like

538
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
stop now and go to a 4K TV and I'm

539
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
sitting here like oh okay

540
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
let me just run to Best Buy and get one

541
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
yeah let me just drop eight nine hundred

542
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
thousand dollars you know because that's you know

543
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because you know you're the one percent

544
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
so thank you in a weird way

545
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
actually have them down about like four

546
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
dollars yeah I kind of feel like if you bought a TV

547
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
in the past maybe two years

548
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
that was one of the past two years model you

549
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
probably got I mean TVs are

550
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
getting more reasonable yeah I'm surprised how

551
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
cheap they were I mean they had those

552
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
all did HDR and all that stuff but even

553
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm not gonna go drop a grand on a new TV

554
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
just for this right and so

555
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
you know and honestly I think it was

556
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
that more than anything for

557
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
me that said

558
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
maybe I don't need this PlayStation

559
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Pro because I'm not gonna drop the money

560
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
on a 4K TV then this guy is

561
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
actually saying I'm gonna need one to

562
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
see the difference

563
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
so is Andromeda coming out whether

564
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
that was the message Sony wanted to convey

565
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
or not I'm sorry but that dude from BioWare

566
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that's how he phrased it Andromeda coming out on

567
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
PC it is

568
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and don't don't think

569
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I haven't thought that exactly I need to

570
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
go to that's like my thing right there

571
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
like I actually started thinking about like

572
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
why do I have a PlayStation 4

573
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
is it because of you know Sony

574
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
first party exclusives that were like I

575
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
was really interested in and I started thinking

576
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
what Sony first party exclusives do I have

577
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
that was really interested in oh no man

578
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
sky well that came out of fucking PC anyways

579
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so

580
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
ah infamous

581
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
yeah that wasn't very good

582
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
um

583
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
nope don't have anything so

584
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I was like well

585
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
why I forgot a war

586
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
got a war is alright but

587
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
you don't buy a system for one game

588
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Zelda so

589
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't know we'll have to see

590
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
let me get through a couple other

591
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
comments on this from Facebook

592
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
some different perspectives here Tiger

593
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Claude said I currently own the regular

594
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
PlayStation 4 and don't have a 4K TV

595
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
so I don't need it however

596
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I heard that the PS4 Pro does not

597
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
support 4K Blu-ray media

598
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
so it's going to be a deal breaker for those who

599
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
want to watch their 4K Blu-ray disc

600
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
on the 4K TVs

601
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Degenerate Johnny had a very similar response

602
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
to that talking about that 4K

603
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
digital content from Netflix and Hulu but

604
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
not physical content from 4K

605
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Blu-ray you know

606
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
wasn't Microsoft placed in the hot seat years

607
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
ago for doing something similar favoring

608
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
digital content over physical content

609
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
digital content's all good and stuff if you

610
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
have the fucking bandwidth to do it

611
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
yeah and we've already hearing what

612
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you know we hear what um

613
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
our home IPs you know the

614
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
ISPs are doing like Comcast and stuff

615
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
they're putting a cap

616
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
on bandwidth

617
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
you know on a monthly basis already too

618
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
so what's you know so now we

619
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
so now we run into this

620
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
conundrum of you know

621
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
this rapid fire advancement

622
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
in technology and

623
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and clarity in gaming and

624
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
movies but now you've got you know

625
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
the ISP saying well

626
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
we're only going to let you enjoy it for a limited

627
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
amount of bandwidth before we kind of start capping

628
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
you so we're running

629
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
into a problem here so it's like

630
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
yeah it you know so

631
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
we've become so obsessed and dependent on

632
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the streaming aspect of it you know

633
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
um yeah

634
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
but here we are you know

635
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
you know questioning are we

636
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
willing to drop another four hundred dollars

637
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
on essentially minuscule

638
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
upgrades well and then there's this thing

639
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
about one more one more response from Facebook

640
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
um Andy Ard said since I don't have

641
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
a 4K TV I don't see too much

642
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
of a reason to get one sure we'll have some

643
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
improvements for 1080 TVs but not

644
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
enough in my opinion plus I'd

645
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
rather get PlayStation VR this

646
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
fall and I don't have the funds to drop

647
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
on two four hundred dollar boxes

648
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and that for me puts the nail

649
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
in the coffin of why I think this it's

650
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
this was not the right time well here's

651
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
the other thing too now it has been wondering

652
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
how well is this running on

653
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
how well is PlayStation VR running on the

654
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
regular PlayStation 4 I

655
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
don't know yet well like how

656
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
what they're demoing it and best buys

657
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
on a regular yes I know I got there a few

658
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
minutes too late yesterday so

659
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I was like oh hey oh

660
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
man yeah but I

661
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
mean I think for the most part I

662
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
feel like I actually feel okay

663
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
that the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to

664
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
support the VR stuff okay

665
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
but um you know I think that's a very

666
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
good point is that Sony's putting out

667
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
two new four hundred dollar products

668
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
this year and I'm not sure that's the

669
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
brightest thing to do especially

670
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
when it seems too early for this

671
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
4K thing exactly and Microsoft's

672
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
coming out with theirs probably I'd say next fall

673
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
so

674
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
already I mean technology is going

675
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
to be so much better like or at least

676
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
cheaper than what they've got there

677
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and they can put out a system that's more

678
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
powerful same price

679
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
when actually more people have content

680
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and like the devices actually

681
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
watch this stuff on I just don't

682
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I it's too damn early

683
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
it's like when they try to push that fucking 3D

684
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
TV shit they actually had hey look

685
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
it's the PlayStation TV and it's

686
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
you know got fucking 3D

687
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
you know TV and something it's a

688
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
shitty

689
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
small TV that did their 3D

690
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
stuff and then they're like ah

691
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
fuck 3D you know VR

692
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but do you want to hear the hilarious part of this

693
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I pre-ordered one on

694
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Amazon anyway you can because

695
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
as you said

696
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
you can just go on there and click

697
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
pre-order I don't have to give them any money or commitment

698
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
or anything and I can go in and cancel

699
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
if I change my mind which I

700
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
kind of think I'm going to do but Sony

701
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
has 30 months to make

702
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
me change my or 30 months 30 days or so

703
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
to make me change my mind I just

704
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I still maybe change my mind on PlayStation

705
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
VR yeah because the more I think

706
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
about it I'm like what am I really getting

707
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
out of this and I'm kind of wondering

708
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
maybe if I should just wait and see

709
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
if

710
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
there's something if they're going to you know handle

711
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
this like they did 3D

712
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I was hoping to hear a little

713
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
more you know a lot of folks had said that this

714
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
PlayStation conference they did this week felt

715
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
very short and I was surprised

716
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
they didn't talk more about VR

717
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
considering that is coming out in a

718
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
month you know

719
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
obviously they talked about it in conjunction

720
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
with the pro but they didn't really

721
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
talk a lot about that kind of

722
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
surprised me how is it better though is it just

723
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you know a higher frame rate and even still

724
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
it's like that's kind of

725
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
lame I think it's the same sort of

726
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
textures improved and you know

727
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
those sorts of like I don't

728
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
understand why I would drop that kind of

729
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
money for that I just

730
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I don't know it's just

731
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
that's all you've got

732
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
for me is that your games aren't

733
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
that innovative it's just it's slightly

734
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
prettier it's going to look much

735
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
brighter you're going to be able to see the details

736
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
but that's on any system though HDR

737
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
is going to be supported you know

738
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
on anything but

739
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
we'll get into that a little bit later but I'm just

740
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
saying what's the point in dropping money for

741
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
this pro thing because you're not going to

742
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't know I don't really think there's any

743
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
immediate

744
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
needs for that and look at the titles

745
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
that are going to support it yeah Call of Duty

746
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
is going to support it but is it everything out of the

747
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
gate I mean how many titles are going to be supporting

748
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
this right away and not everybody

749
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
has to support it

750
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm really curious what's going to happen

751
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
for those households that don't have

752
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
PlayStation 4s at all right now because

753
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I mean at first glance you would think oh

754
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
well if I didn't have a PlayStation 4

755
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
at all then great I'm just going to buy the pro

756
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
because it just makes sense but at the same

757
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
time does it because now these households

758
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
are faced with do I get

759
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
the PlayStation 4 pro or do I

760
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
save a hundred bucks and get a slim

761
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
is this worth a hundred dollars

762
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
that's going to be the question that these

763
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
holiday sales numbers are going to be very interesting

764
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and for most families yes it is going to be a huge

765
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
huge difference because I mean

766
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that's why Nintendo meanwhile

767
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Nintendo's in the background in the

768
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
in the darkness just laughing

769
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
maniacally like haha we're still going to be

770
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
cheaper than all of you

771
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
it does

772
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
really feel like Nintendo is just riding

773
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
off this well I shouldn't say they're riding off this holiday

774
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
they're riding off the Wii U

775
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
for this holiday but you're starting to see

776
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
all these other plans

777
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
like it's like okay well since

778
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
our mega beast won't be available

779
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
we're going to send all these other

780
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
little gremlins out you know between

781
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the classic NES and the

782
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the thing we'll get into with the iPhone later

783
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
on that I'm sure you all already know about

784
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
with that and

785
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
what else

786
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
the physical Pokemon Go thing

787
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
you know they're going to start attacking holiday

788
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
from all these other angles I think instead

789
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and I think Wii U is just kind of like

790
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you know well

791
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
come on down to your old

792
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
old Wii U saloon

793
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
not so much the Wii U just Nintendo in general

794
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
with their next announcement

795
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and I mean because I think that's what

796
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
more I was referring to just because

797
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
you know they did pretty well last

798
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
year you know with them being

799
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
the cheapest at the time even though it didn't make

800
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
a huge difference

801
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
now but

802
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
you know but still

803
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think that you know Sony shot themselves

804
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
in the foot majorly with this

805
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Microsoft's going to do

806
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
a lot better which is kind of sad

807
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
because the slim wasn't really necessary to begin

808
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
with anyway but

809
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
you know but yeah so we'll see

810
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
yeah we will definitely see especially

811
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
you know the games are going to be very

812
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
important I know the last month

813
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
of sales figures showed that

814
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Xbox One outsold PlayStation

815
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
4 now to be fair

816
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Xbox One put out that new S

817
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and that figure is

818
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the old one and the new one

819
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
combined

820
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
but still

821
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
you know that is not

822
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
a trend that Sony would want to see continue

823
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and here's the thing what's really amazing about the Pro

824
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
is it's able to output

825
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
you know 4K images

826
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you know upscaled but it's

827
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
you know higher than 1080p

828
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
greater detail

829
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
more fidelity in the picture

830
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
but

831
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
still can't fucking run PlayStation

832
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
1 games or can't run

833
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
PlayStation 2 games yet a

834
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
fucking PSP can

835
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
run a PlayStation 1 so what you're telling me

836
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
is that system is fucking weaker than a

837
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
PSP yeah the only thing yeah

838
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
what was that the emotion chip in the

839
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
PlayStation 2 that made all the difference with the

840
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
virus compatibility but they

841
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
still have now it's software emulated

842
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
stuff on the PlayStation 3 so don't tell me that

843
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
that fucking powerful ass fucking

844
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
system can't play PlayStation

845
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
2 games oh but PlayStation Now

846
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
has just no fuck you I am not buying

847
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
your fucking PlayStation now well it does play

848
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
select PlayStation 2 games available

849
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
for $9.99 I am not subscribing to PlayStation Now

850
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
ever fucking ever

851
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I am never ever subscribing to

852
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
that more like PlayStation I'm gonna save that clip

853
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
for when he subscribes a year from now I will never

854
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
subscribe to it more like PlayStation

855
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
never all right uh let's

856
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
see Dungeon Buster in chat says

857
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
it's been barely three years since the PlayStation

858
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
4 came out this still feels

859
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
like a knee-jerk reaction to a changing

860
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
market I just okay

861
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
here's the weird thing for me I've

862
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
been following video games for

863
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
even longer than this show has

864
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
existed 15 plus years at

865
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
this point right what what

866
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
is the what is the changing market

867
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I didn't understand that there

868
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
there isn't there isn't they believe

869
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
that there isn't there absolutely isn't

870
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and and it's the cell phones are fucking everything

871
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
yeah I think I think it's the

872
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
advancements of the smartphones and

873
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and you know the you know the the bigger

874
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
publishers are like uh we can't we need

875
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
to keep them at home we can't let them go

876
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
out people think because

877
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
people drop hundreds of dollars every other year

878
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
on a nominal cell phone upgrade they're gonna do

879
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
the same thing right they have the

880
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
apple mentality and they like they think that that's

881
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
okay but even we're seeing with Apple themselves

882
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
it's like it's Apple's losing sales

883
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
from the subs from the six because of

884
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
you know these sort of things and you know

885
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
it's gonna change it's it's gonna change

886
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
after a while people are gonna get tired

887
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
of spending five six hundred dollars

888
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
a year because it's gonna it's gonna happen to Xbox

889
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
as well that's that project Scorpio

890
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
that better be something crazy

891
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
good because because we're hyping

892
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
the slim but now we're gonna have

893
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
extra you know an

894
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
xxl version of the

895
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
one next year and it's like

896
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
well rumor is and take

897
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
this with a giant salt lick because

898
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
rumor doesn't mean much but

899
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
that Scorpio's like an expensive

900
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
motherfucker like it's gonna be a seven hundred dollar thing

901
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
like it is for gamers

902
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that are dedicated and need the power

903
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
but you know we laugh but

904
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
check out how much steam boxes cost

905
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
you know like there's people willing to pay the

906
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
higher end power and you want to play Xbox games

907
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
buy a PC

908
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I mean seriously that they were

909
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
fucking pimping that shit

910
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
all fucking E3

911
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Windows 10 and Xbox One

912
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
exclusive then fuck you

913
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
don't need them if you want a more powerful

914
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
system why are you gonna drop money

915
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
on an Xbox that you can't fucking upgrade

916
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
unless you buy a brand new system

917
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
buy a PC that's probably that's the

918
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
thing is like that's why I was like oh I'll buy an Xbox

919
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
One no way actually no I will

920
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
buy a PC because why would

921
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I buy an Xbox One that you're gonna

922
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
try to sell me a new one later on and I don't understand

923
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
the point of this new PlayStation

924
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
system because

925
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
once again what is it

926
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
what are they meeting I mean are there people

927
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
out there going well that PlayStation 4 just

928
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
doesn't look good enough I'm not buying it

929
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
no one is saying that

930
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
nobody is doing that

931
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I mean people might be like oh yeah

932
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I wish it was 4K well

933
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
it fucking isn't and you know what it's still

934
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
not fucking 4K it just

935
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
outputs upscales to 4K

936
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
it's not 4K but there's just still not enough

937
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
content to justify you know 4K

938
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
like that again other than Netflix and such but

939
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
that's it like it's just it's like

940
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
we all said earlier it's just too soon

941
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and you know who I pity the most and you know

942
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
of course this is gonna come from me

943
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
of course it's the developers

944
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
the developers who've been so focused on

945
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
even developing for the PlayStation

946
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
platform as it is and then

947
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
to hear now you're

948
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
getting two different hardware upgrades

949
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
or options and I remember hearing

950
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
some point earlier this year that

951
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I remember

952
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't know if it was Game of Sutra

953
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
or somewhere else were saying

954
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
that for any

955
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
new developers on Sony

956
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Sony

957
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
made the developer sign this like

958
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
exclusivity thing where it's like

959
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
your games have to be

960
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
4K ready as an option

961
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
like it can't just not

962
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
have 4K option and

963
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
you know or something along those lines

964
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
it was very concerning

965
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
because as a developer making

966
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
a game in even

967
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
1080 is tough

968
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
because you know because it's like you know there's so many

969
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
limitations you know whatever you know

970
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
as powerful as the consoles are you know

971
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
we as indie developers

972
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
only have such

973
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
a limited amount of budget you know

974
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
to make a game as pretty as possible

975
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I mean you know

976
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I mean for God's sake look at what happened to No Man's

977
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Sky as pretty as it was

978
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
you know what I'm saying and the approach that they made with it

979
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
they have a long way to go but they

980
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
but they fell big time because

981
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
of all the crap that they went through

982
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and they barely got by on the

983
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
PC version but look what happened

984
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
between PC and Playstation 4

985
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
all that stuff but my point is that

986
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
there's

987
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
there's a cost there's a huge

988
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
cost to creating

989
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
4K textures

990
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
1080p textures and of course

991
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
the people who are playing they're not thinking

992
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
about that but people like

993
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
myself that's a huge

994
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
that's a huge hit on our

995
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
budget because it's like we

996
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
budget our games you know

997
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
hopefully to get it right

998
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
we hope to get it right and

999
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
you know let's put our game in

1000
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
1080p but now we're in 4K

1001
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and it's so difficult

1002
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
to get 4K textures

1003
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
you know 4K textures

1004
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
implemented properly especially when

1005
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
we've never made you know

1006
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
huge games we don't have the support

1007
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
we don't have the size of a

1008
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
AAA studio and that's the other

1009
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
big problem too like that's where I was concerned

1010
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
with Sony announcing this

1011
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
because it's like how many developers

1012
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
are actually going to utilize

1013
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
that 4K?

1014
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Can I tinfoil hat something for a minute because

1015
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
no just your line of thinking

1016
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
here kind of made me think of something

1017
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
is it possible that No Man's

1018
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Sky you know because

1019
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
obviously people have their issues with

1020
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
some of the quality checks and things like that

1021
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
is it possible that No Man's Sky

1022
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
was rushed to market try not

1023
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
to laugh because I realized the game was delayed like five

1024
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
times but was it

1025
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
possible that No Man's Sky had

1026
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
to release now to

1027
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
get around this 4K directive? I think

1028
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
they did but I do

1029
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
think

1030
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I think where they failed the most

1031
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
is that they

1032
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
they tried to

1033
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
they were trying to create an imagination

1034
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
imaginary world this massive

1035
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
not even world universe they were trying to create

1036
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
this imaginary universe and

1037
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
the procedural generation approach

1038
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
in the on the development

1039
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
side that's a really inexpensive

1040
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
way to create a massive

1041
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
to create a massive world a massive

1042
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
universe because procedural generation

1043
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
it's all in programming it's just all in programming

1044
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
but the problem the problem with them

1045
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
is I think partly you're right

1046
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
about that you know on the on the back

1047
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
end because they're like you know because even with

1048
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
myself with my kinship game kinship

1049
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
when I started kinship kinship was initially

1050
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
going to be on the 360 and then

1051
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
we hear about when they when Microsoft

1052
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
moved to Xbox One and they weren't bringing

1053
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
it wasn't supposed to be backward compatible

1054
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
so anything coming out on Xbox

1055
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Indie wasn't going to be able to be played

1056
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
because they changed the whole architecture for

1057
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Xbox One then the Nintendo opportunity

1058
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
came up with you know for Wii U we were like

1059
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
alright great you know you know this is our

1060
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
second chance but now Wii U is dissolving

1061
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
into the nether

1062
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and now here we are again like

1063
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
well what's going to happen with NX

1064
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
let's see what happens with NX so now we've

1065
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I've just ultimately decided we're just going to make it for PC

1066
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
and see what happens from that point

1067
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
but you come to the you know

1068
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
it is an extremely frustrating process

1069
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
because you know yeah

1070
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
at some point you know

1071
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
they No Man's Sky was so

1072
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
far in especially with the size

1073
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
of their game if their game

1074
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
was just a regular you know 10

1075
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
level game you know couple worlds game maybe

1076
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
a six eight hour game they

1077
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
probably would have delayed it again but they were

1078
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
they were in too deep with No Man's Sky

1079
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and they were like and they knew

1080
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
they didn't want to become

1081
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and again this is

1082
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm probably putting my tinfoil hat on myself

1083
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
but they probably didn't want to be a star citizen

1084
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Well I still like

1085
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
No Man's Sky for what it is

1086
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and you know I stand by my early impressions and review

1087
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
of that game but what I don't

1088
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
like is all of a sudden there's like some

1089
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
massive radio silence coming out of that company

1090
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
like after they patched the PC thing

1091
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
then like you check the Twitter

1092
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it's like dead like and I

1093
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
realize okay you put out a game that you've been

1094
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
working on for years maybe you need a little vacation

1095
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
but you rotate

1096
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
that vacation so somebody can

1097
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
keep us in the loop of what the hell's going on

1098
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Not for that kind and that's what I'm saying

1099
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
not for that kind of game they

1100
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
try to be and that's one you know even

1101
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
even when I do my meetups

1102
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
this is why I'm really

1103
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
proud to be to have

1104
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
founded the chapter because that's one of the

1105
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
things we talk about in our different chapter

1106
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
meetup sessions the one thing you

1107
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
don't ever want to do

1108
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
as your first game is

1109
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
make an MMO

1110
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
that's like game development

1111
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
101 your first game should

1112
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
never be a World of Warcraft

1113
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
you just don't do that unless you're an

1114
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
inheritance baby but even then

1115
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
you still have to know what you're doing

1116
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's too much to chew

1117
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's huge and you don't have

1118
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
it's not just the skill

1119
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
set because one can have the skill set

1120
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
to make that scale

1121
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
of a game but you have to

1122
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
the one thing you know nerds

1123
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
a lot of nerds and especially

1124
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
developers don't have

1125
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
especially at the start of all this

1126
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
is discipline you need

1127
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
a mental discipline to make

1128
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
that to make a game of that scale

1129
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and with everything those guys went

1130
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
through with No Man's Sky yeah they

1131
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
they should have

1132
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
they should have brought it out and you know they should have

1133
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
brought it on bits and pieces they would have been so much

1134
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
better off I think they kind of did

1135
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
well well

1136
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I mean efficiently not just

1137
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
not just sloppy but you know

1138
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
okay well okay let's let's

1139
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
shift a little bit to talking a little more about you and what

1140
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
you're involved with and all this stuff so obviously you

1141
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
are you know founder and such

1142
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
as the Sakai GDA how are things going has

1143
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
there been growth here locally with developers

1144
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
absolutely yeah absolutely I mean

1145
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
we you know the

1146
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
the proof is always in

1147
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
you know our indie arcade event

1148
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
you know we we the I

1149
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
founded the chapter three and a half years

1150
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
ago and the whole point of the chapter

1151
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
founding the chapter was

1152
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
we needed

1153
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I needed our game our

1154
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Sacramento game developer group to be taken seriously

1155
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I was tired of us getting laughed

1156
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
at by by our neighbors

1157
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
why would you laugh because we're Sacramento

1158
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
because we're Sacramento we we

1159
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
we are we are the red-headed

1160
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
stepchild of of California because we're also

1161
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
like if I'm not mistaken we are a

1162
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
top 20 media market right top 25 media

1163
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
market right but it's something something

1164
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
like that but I mean again but she's still on

1165
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
gigabit earn it though yeah but

1166
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
like San Francisco is right next to us sorry

1167
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
our houses are affordable right well

1168
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
yeah they won't be for long no we won't be really because

1169
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
all the Bay Area people are coming here no it's the

1170
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
fucking arena's fault yeah it is the arena's

1171
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
fault and and and you know and that's how

1172
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you talk like a Sacramento

1173
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
playing everything on that goddamn arena well that's what I do

1174
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and I'm from New Jersey and I already know better

1175
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
it's like no will the arena make them

1176
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
play better no it won't and

1177
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and my and and I'm only I'm

1178
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
not going any further with the king's stuff other than

1179
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
in the arena suffer than this statement and

1180
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I've said it a few times and it's racing my

1181
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
brows and I'm gonna do it again because I don't care my

1182
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
opinion on it is that the Kings the

1183
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
new arena should not have been a bit should not have

1184
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
been built until the Kings won something

1185
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
period so no arena should

1186
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
have been built for an average team period

1187
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
win a championship and then you get then you get a

1188
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
great Christmas gift a newer well

1189
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
to be fair counterpoint they've promised

1190
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
to bring the Monarchs back yeah

1191
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Monarchs were able to win a champ yeah

1192
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and God promised me to be six three with

1193
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
six pack sometimes that hasn't happened

1194
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
sometimes you need a woman to get it done

1195
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
well

1196
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
anyway

1197
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I just showed you

1198
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
receipts

1199
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
right so but

1200
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
so nonetheless like

1201
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
so one of the biggest things was making

1202
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
sure that our game developer group was taken seriously

1203
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
and more importantly we weren't losing

1204
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
great talent you know

1205
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
you know a lot of talent leaving Sacramento

1206
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
to go to all the you know to go to all these

1207
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
different locations and such which I again

1208
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I respect that you know they want to work you know

1209
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
they want to work for you know insert you know

1210
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
triple big triple A studio here whatever

1211
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
but if we had an opportunity to

1212
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
to create a job

1213
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
market here at SAC and

1214
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
make them be like whoa I don't have

1215
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
to leave home I can stay and

1216
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
not have to worry about paying three thousand

1217
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
dollars a month for a studio in San Francisco

1218
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
if I get lucky and

1219
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
excuse me so we'd like so that the idea was

1220
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
was that you know we

1221
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
have been nurturing and developing this chapter

1222
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and it has

1223
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
expanded into wonderful proportions

1224
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I just put out a newsletter last

1225
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
week and on our meetup group

1226
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
we we are over

1227
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
a thousand members now now it

1228
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
is both and I said this in the newsletter

1229
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
it is both a very interesting milestone

1230
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
but it's also a concerning

1231
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
one because we don't see a thousand

1232
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
members at a time ever but

1233
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
we have seen a lot more I will say

1234
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
that in our newest indie arcade

1235
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
oh yeah

1236
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
yeah see the next event

1237
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
that might change but for the moment

1238
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
we'll see what happens but with our most

1239
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
recent indie arcade back in April

1240
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
in West Sacramento you know

1241
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
we had about five hundred fifty attendees

1242
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
which was more than double

1243
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
the other two indie arcades

1244
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000

1245
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000

four hours of sleep at night which is just

1269
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I hear sedatives are pretty good

1270
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
but anyway I digress so the idea

1271
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
is is that have you

1272
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
got just quickly have you guys had some games

1273
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
that have that like people might

1274
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
recognize like the downloaded that have come out

1275
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
of Sac IG members oh my god

1276
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the one I think of I just

1277
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
saw because Monsters and Monocles

1278
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
that guy in Davis

1279
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
that put that together in fact I need to invite him

1280
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
on the show that

1281
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
that just released on the

1282
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
steam early access and I know he was at

1283
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
the arcade event a couple years ago so

1284
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
you're starting to see and they were at PAX

1285
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
they went to PAX West while I was at Dragon Con

1286
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and I know they had a lot of success there

1287
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
so I mean that's a really great success story

1288
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and I'm sure you've got more because based on

1289
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
the games I saw at arcade

1290
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
yeah Venture 4th almost

1291
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Venture 4th is done

1292
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Venture 4th is done Venture 4th was out and actually

1293
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm actually glad you said that because we're actually doing

1294
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
a meetup later this month in

1295
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Elk Grove I believe it's in Elk Grove

1296
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
at Elk Grove and Ed at the

1297
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Innogrove co-working space where we're going to

1298
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
do a Q&A for

1299
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Skirmish Studios

1300
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
as well as ArcLight for the Venture

1301
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
4th game and because they did very

1302
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
they both ran recently very successful

1303
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Kickstarter campaigns and

1304
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
we're going to be talking to them and

1305
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
interviewing them to see why

1306
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
what went right what went

1307
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
wrong and what they could have done better so on and so forth

1308
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
but yeah I mean Monsters and Monocles is

1309
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
definitely one of those games

1310
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
that's done so well and

1311
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
yeah we've had a slew

1312
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
more and in fact we had

1313
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
we had a mystery

1314
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
judge who she used to work at Xbox

1315
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I don't know if you were there for that

1316
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
but she came through

1317
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and was like

1318
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
you know I'm going to look around I want to see what's

1319
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
going on but no one knew that someone from

1320
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
that used to work for Xbox she works for

1321
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
a subsidiary of Wargaming and

1322
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
she came through and was like

1323
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
here's you know I'm going to tap

1324
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
you guys and I feel so horrible I cannot

1325
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
remember the name of the game if Bree's in the chat

1326
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't know if she's listening or in the chat right now

1327
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Was that the one that was like a runner with polarity

1328
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
type of thing like it was black and white?

1329
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yes absolutely and I feel

1330
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
so bad we have the studios listening

1331
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm so sorry guys because my mind

1332
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
my mind is just upon the mess

1333
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Which one? The one that won that prize

1334
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
from the Microsoft developer that was

1335
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
that was really good it was the

1336
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
like you had like a

1337
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
it was like a black and white type of game

1338
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and then like in the white spots would be the black

1339
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
character that's running through and then the white

1340
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
spots would be the white character

1341
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I got the demo for that it was like the

1342
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
rabbit and the owl

1343
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
rabbit and the owl that's it

1344
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
yeah they

1345
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
they have been kicking butt

1346
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
they've been doing great they got selected

1347
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Bree's actually in our chat I just realized

1348
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
she's the anonymous chatter in there

1349
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
she's like screaming at the top of her lungs

1350
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Thanks Bree

1351
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Thank you Bree so

1352
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
but again ultimately

1353
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
there's been a ton of growth here and

1354
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
we've started our most

1355
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
recent progressive game jam

1356
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and a slew of new teams

1357
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
a slew of new faces as well as

1358
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
as well as the veterans that were there last year

1359
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and the year before that

1360
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
it's been a tremendous

1361
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
tremendous thing and

1362
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
even now with myself I'm proud to say that now

1363
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I can finally be a part of that with my crumple

1364
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
game coming out within the next

1365
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
month and a half-ish

1366
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I'm so happy for you

1367
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I was starting to

1368
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
wonder if your game was kind of like one of Loki's games

1369
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
we were going to see it come out

1370
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I don't release stuff that's not fun

1371
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
and I am so mentally working on

1372
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
stuff so every day

1373
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I think about my game and every day

1374
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
you know jot stuff down

1375
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and I do research every day

1376
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
well maybe that's the problem

1377
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
every day I think about mowing the lawn

1378
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
alright

1379
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
no I don't actually

1380
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
who really does that?

1381
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
that's alright I'm one step ahead of you

1382
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I just don't water the lawn so it doesn't grow

1383
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
well technically you're obeying the law

1384
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
because we're in California

1385
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
so fuck the lawn

1386
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
so yeah with crumple

1387
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
yeah

1388
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I announced it

1389
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
maybe even 3-4 weeks ago

1390
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
that crumple's over

1391
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
90% done now

1392
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
we're working on

1393
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
90% left now

1394
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
we're working on

1395
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
the actual ending for the first

1396
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
episode since crumple for some

1397
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
who've been keeping

1398
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
close lock on our game

1399
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
crumple's going to be released in episodes

1400
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
and so the first episode is

1401
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
like I mentioned a little over 90% done

1402
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
we're working on the ending to how episode 1 will

1403
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
end it's going to be really

1404
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
pretty intense and

1405
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
we're just putting the final touches of any

1406
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
bugs squashing in the code but

1407
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
yeah we're almost done

1408
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
you wouldn't think a game starring an envelope would be intense

1409
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
but

1410
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
see one thing about me

1411
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and this is something that

1412
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
this is another reason why I started this chapter

1413
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
because I came in as the

1414
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
idea guy I do not

1415
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
have any art skill I do not have

1416
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
any coding skill but I could tell a

1417
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
story because I've done poetry and I

1418
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
have a wacky imagination the thing

1419
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
with me it's about what's on the inside

1420
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and that's anthrax

1421
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
let him finish

1422
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
shut up

1423
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
so what happens

1424
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
is

1425
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
you know what's on your inside? pepperoni

1426
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I don't eat pepperoni it's all

1427
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
garlic and parmesan

1428
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
so what happens is

1429
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
that for me it was

1430
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
you know even if you have the imagination

1431
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and the idea you can make something

1432
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
beautiful you can make something very intense

1433
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
and I mean I think we've seen

1434
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I mean you know

1435
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
a lot of games that seem

1436
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
simple on the surface are actually very

1437
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
very intense Limbo which was part

1438
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
inspiration for Crumple comes to mind

1439
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
like okay a 10 year old boy black and white

1440
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
silhouette okay what's why

1441
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and that game turned out to be incredibly

1442
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
intense and atmospheric so

1443
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
to be able to achieve that on

1444
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Crumple knowing we were making it on

1445
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
a flash

1446
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
it's like how are we going to pull this off but

1447
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
we've been able to do it and I can't wait

1448
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
when we show the little

1449
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
progression reel of how Crumple

1450
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
started how it looked when it first started

1451
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
as compared to how it looks now with all

1452
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
the sounds and you know the

1453
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
attention to detail I'm excited to play it again

1454
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I think the last time I played it was almost a year ago

1455
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
at that Reno thing oh my goodness

1456
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
yeah yeah you can

1457
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
actually play the demo now

1458
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
there's been a demo for probably

1459
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
near a year now on Newgrounds

1460
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and well as a listener of this fine program

1461
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
please tell me where I can get this demo

1462
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
so oh man I

1463
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
did you have something on good old games

1464
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
though I thought or no

1465
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm thinking of the other one Desura

1466
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
so the demo started on Desura

1467
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
went just dissipated into

1468
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
had some problems yes dissipated

1469
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
quietly so yes

1470
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
we'll call it um but yeah we

1471
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
so there's actually a demo on itch itch.io

1472
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
as well but I don't really remember

1473
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
but so it but on Newgrounds

1474
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
and they've been super supportive Newgrounds have

1475
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
actually been retweeting and liking my stuff

1476
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
as well which is pretty cool but on new

1477
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
but I don't have the exact link off the top of my

1478
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
head because it's like numerical so just

1479
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Newgrounds go on Newgrounds.com

1480
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
on the search type Crumple

1481
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
it'll be the first link you'll see it

1482
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
you don't need to sign up for an account

1483
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
on Newgrounds you can just play it and

1484
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
yeah it's it's not the newest

1485
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
newest version but it

1486
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
it's pretty it's it's

1487
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
generally pretty close to where we're at we've made

1488
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
a number of upgrades and touch-ups

1489
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
since then but you'll still be able to give

1490
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000

1517

00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
very we're very fortunate here at O.L.R.

1525
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
that we have some pretty pretty decent minded

1526
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
people in this program thank you decent

1527
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
minded adults or children whichever

1528
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
that's great glad to glad to

1529
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
hear that well a lot of them did start off as children

1530
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and now we're adults

1531
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
you have to have a little bit of a thick skin to put up a

1532
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Loki's crap three hours three hours a week I have

1533
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
four sisters man he does not need they

1534
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
know he can do that hasn't already happened

1535
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
uh tell us briefly about kinship what what is

1536
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
kinship where's where's this at kinship

1537
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
right now um it you know just

1538
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
like any almost anything in the game development it has

1539
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
suffered its setbacks um

1540
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
you know both on a technological tech

1541
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
uh tech standpoint you know as

1542
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
well as um who

1543
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
who's able to help and and and you

1544
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
know so on and so forth and it's

1545
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
kinship is um it's

1546
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
funny because kinship initially started as

1547
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
a the original idea with kinship was

1548
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
that it was going to be a fan remake

1549
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
of Gradius 3 and

1550
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I then I decided no fan remakes

1551
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I can't be doing that I need to do

1552
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
something original if I'm going to spend three years making

1553
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
something might as well make something new and original

1554
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
you can come up with something Gabriel do

1555
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
something so I did so so here we

1556
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
are now again you know as we

1557
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
talked earlier kinship started as a 360

1558
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
game you know was becoming

1559
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
what's going to hopefully be a Wii U game

1560
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
that's not going to happen now so now

1561
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
we we look at just PC for the moment

1562
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and then console wise see what

1563
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
what comes from that um

1564
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
on the I've do you have

1565
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
your 4k textures ready to go hell no

1566
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
4k you know

1567
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
can whatever so anyway so 4k

1568
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
this so the idea is is that

1569
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
um you know I've

1570
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
involved myself more in the

1571
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
development side I've actually learned

1572
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
how to do environments

1573
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
and build levels out so I'm not

1574
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I was gonna I was gonna say and I just to back up

1575
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
a little bit I was very blown away when you

1576
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
just said now because I didn't even realize

1577
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
this you said that you didn't code

1578
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
crumple and I always had this

1579
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
thing in my mind that oh you you coded

1580
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
right in there with the best of them but you you're

1581
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
more of like a project manager is kind of what you're

1582
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
doing right you're making you see the plan

1583
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
and you're making sure all the moving parts

1584
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
are doing this but it sounds like you got your

1585
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
hands a little dirtier with kinship you actually

1586
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
got in there and and did some more

1587
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
of the environments yeah I've been

1588
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
developing more of the environments um if

1589
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
you look at it's not it's not

1590
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
a very very recent trailer but well

1591
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
actually no I actually posted a gameplay

1592
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
trailer back in March before the indie arcade

1593
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
event I posted a game our first gameplay

1594
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
trailer on our YouTube channel um

1595
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
youtube.com slash nascent games

1596
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
go there and and look up the

1597
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
stage three for kinship

1598
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
gameplay I actually created that

1599
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
that that it was a space

1600
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
you know just kind of the easiest thing to create

1601
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
first but I did but yeah it was

1602
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
a great place to start and you're gonna get to see

1603
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
get an idea of what kinship

1604
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
looks like how it feels so on and so forth

1605
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
and I I saw Bree's comment about the soundtrack

1606
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
yes uh we have

1607
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
definitely check our soundtrack on Bandcamp

1608
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
we have um a compilation soundtrack

1609
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
um and I just released a demo track on

1610
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
there now um yeah nascent games

1611
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
dot com dot excuse me nascent games

1612
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
dot bandcamp dot

1613
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
com yes definitely thank you

1614
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
so anyway so kinship um

1615
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
kinship is gonna end up

1616
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I'm working on the next trailer now for kinship

1617
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
uh it's going to be

1618
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
it's gonna become much more

1619
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
personal for me because I've gone through

1620
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
both the technical setbacks

1621
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
as well as the personal setbacks

1622
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
with with with the development of this game

1623
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
when this game comes out

1624
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
it's probably gonna piss off a couple

1625
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
of people who know they were involved with

1626
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
it and were no longer involved with it

1627
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and there's gonna be messages to them

1628
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
in very subtle subtle ways

1629
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
wait whoa whoa whoa whoa

1630
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
what fucking dynasty unfolding

1631
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
here dynasty in space unfolding here

1632
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
so you're are you wearing dirty laundry

1633
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
here on this project you did so you had

1634
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
people that you were working on this game with

1635
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
that are no longer a part of the project

1636
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
for I'm assuming creative differences

1637
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
is always politically correct yeah

1638
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
those two words but you are you're flat out saying

1639
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
listen listen all y'all

1640
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I've left I left I left you bitches

1641
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
some messages in my game

1642
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
yeah the idea here yeah

1643
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
you're like the fucking Taylor Swift of

1644
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
video games

1645
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I I hopefully don't want to go

1646
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
that way yeah snake

1647
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
game some more like a solid snake

1648
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
a sneaky snake fuck you

1649
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
so any good

1650
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
thank you good so here's

1651
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
so here's my whole thing with with that I

1652
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
don't I I I'm always

1653
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
grateful for both the good and the bad

1654
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
experiences whatever whatever we go through

1655
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
the one thing I mean

1656
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
we've seen it happen to so many game

1657
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
developers you know especially those

1658
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
who kind of

1659
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
kind of had their hands you know

1660
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
just by themselves and then they decide to sneak

1661
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
one more person in you know

1662
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and I mean we won't you know I'm sure we can

1663
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
all we can all think of immediately who

1664
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
who we think of when I when I say that

1665
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
um you know uh

1666
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
anyway so nonetheless it's like we think

1667
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
about what we think about what happened

1668
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
you know what happened with

1669
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
those challenges with me

1670
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
it's not it with me

1671
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
it was more you

1672
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
it was a couple of things you had

1673
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
you had those who

1674
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
had the drive but

1675
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
didn't you know they they had the drive

1676
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
but their ego got in the way

1677
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
but then you had those who

1678
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
you know who were very humble

1679
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
but not

1680
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
not at all confident in their skill

1681
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
set and it affects you during your

1682
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
game development and after a while

1683
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
you know you try to

1684
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
you try to empower them

1685
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
there's one thing I learned

1686
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
very early on with this is that because

1687
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I don't know anything about development

1688
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
you know I had to make sure

1689
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I came at this from a very

1690
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
from you know from a very reasonable point

1691
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
of view and very empowering point of view

1692
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and you know this

1693
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
year you know

1694
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and I've run into the issue a few times

1695
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I mean you know to the point where someone

1696
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
and this was very early on in development not

1697
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
recently but to the point where

1698
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
someone actually sat down with me

1699
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
and asked me to make them

1700
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
the producer of my game

1701
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
they asked me to make them a producer of my game

1702
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and they hadn't actually made anything for me yet

1703
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
and they hadn't even graduated school yet

1704
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I said why would I make you that

1705
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
why would I make you that at all

1706
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
because they were like well I need to have that on my resume

1707
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I'm like no you need to earn it

1708
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and we run into

1709
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
those egos and that's part of the

1710
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
biggest problem one of the biggest problems with

1711
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
this is that

1712
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
you know we

1713
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
you know I run into those things and

1714
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I'm left speechless like what the hell do I

1715
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
how do I even respond to this sort of thing

1716
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
so for me you know it became

1717
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
and it's very frustrating because

1718
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
it's like again with the ton of other

1719
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
setbacks that I already had

1720
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
you know now that

1721
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
becomes you don't want to take it personal

1722
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
but it's like I don't share

1723
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
my story with why I'm

1724
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
making my games to just anybody

1725
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
you know unless I'm selling

1726
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
you the game and you want to understand

1727
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
why but if I'm asking you to help me make this game

1728
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and I share my story it's for real

1729
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
and to just kind of for those

1730
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
things to happen is a big slap

1731
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
in the face but I

1732
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
don't vent about that sort of thing

1733
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
online I'm not typing multiple messages online

1734
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
or anything like that here

1735
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
us as friends we talk

1736
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
about that because and it's something I share

1737
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
with the people in my chapter too when we talk about

1738
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
that it's you know

1739
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
it's a thing was you have to be ready for

1740
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
that you're going to come across people like that

1741
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and you have to know how to handle yourself

1742
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
when something like that happens

1743
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
that's part of life and also part of business is that

1744
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
there's going to be people that you have unfortunate

1745
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
you know run-ins with and circumstances

1746
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
with and you you know you

1747
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
learn from every experience

1748
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
so what I'm understanding here is I'm going to be the executive producer

1749
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
on this game that's fantastic

1750
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
but what I

1751
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
but what I do like about this and you know

1752
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
well I mean not that this

1753
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
story is unfortunate and everything but

1754
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
what I do like about what you know you're talking

1755
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
about with the story and how you

1756
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
were not really coding for crumple but you got

1757
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
in there a little more with kinship and I think this is a

1758
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
very very very important point that we don't always

1759
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
talk about but it does seem

1760
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
to come up whenever you or Brie

1761
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
are on the show and it's it's definitely

1762
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
worth repeating is that you don't

1763
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
necessarily have to be a and I'm gonna use

1764
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
my quote-y fingers code monkey right

1765
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
to get and no offense to the code monkeys

1766
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
of the world we wouldn't have gaming

1767
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
for y'all but here's

1768
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
the and it's a great Jonathan Colton song it is

1769
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
however

1770
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
however you don't necessarily have to

1771
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
already know

1772
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
unity you don't know

1773
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
uh

1774
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
c++ you don't have to know

1775
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
visual game makers on sale this week

1776
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
you don't have to know one dollar in order

1777
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
to make a game because sometimes the key

1778
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
part to making a game is networking

1779
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
with the right people that you want

1780
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
to make a game with but then that turns

1781
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
into a family and sometimes you get

1782
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
family problems right game

1783
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
development is all about

1784
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
chemistry no matter no

1785
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
no coding no coding skill

1786
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
no art skill no

1787
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
animation skill no 3d modeling skill

1788
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
or two or you know 2d or 2d

1789
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
our art assets go describing me right now

1790
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
none of that is gonna matter

1791
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
if you don't have the chemistry with

1792
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
your people and you know

1793
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
and that has to come from both ends and

1794
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and and with that chemistry has to come

1795
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
accountability and part of the issue

1796
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
um with my with my past

1797
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
uh with the past issues I've run into

1798
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
has mainly been between

1799
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
you know the the just filthy

1800
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
arrogance and the and the filthy lack

1801
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
of accountability because it's

1802
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
you know you you know

1803
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I myself start questioning

1804
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
my own capabilities

1805
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
on what what I can what

1806
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I've been doing and the impact

1807
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I've been leaving with both the community and my

1808
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
own games and it took me long

1809
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
it took me so long

1810
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
to finally decide

1811
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
what part of game development was I

1812
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
gonna do because I tried to get into

1813
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
animation back in the late 90s you know or

1814
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
mid 90s when when Donkey Kong Country

1815
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
came out on the Super Nintendo how

1816
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
inspired I was to like oh my god

1817
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I want to do this seeing what they did

1818
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
to make that silicone graphics was my friend

1819
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I wanted them I wanted to marry

1820
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
them and but as I got

1821
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
doesn't right well of course

1822
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
indeed but the idea was is that

1823
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I as I learned more and more about animation

1824
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
what it took I like I can't

1825
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
draw so for the next

1826
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
15 years I gave

1827
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
up on myself and just

1828
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
went with a regular life and I was part of

1829
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
the sheep and just worked and then

1830
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and put my dreams aside and now

1831
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
here I am at this point where I'm so close

1832
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
now and I've got crumple coming

1833
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
out and and I

1834
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
turned 40 at the end of November

1835
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and November 28th

1836
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
that crumple

1837
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
is going to be out through

1838
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
hell or high water before

1839
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I turn 40 and

1840
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
and I'm telling you with all these things that I've

1841
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
gone through that you know

1842
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
that's why it's like we learn from this

1843
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
we chalk it up to the experience and

1844
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
when we put the credits when the

1845
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
when kinship finally is done

1846
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and we put those credits up and in

1847
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
that special thanks section you know how you see

1848
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
the special thanks and all these different

1849
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
the special thanks are going to be to all those people

1850
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
who didn't do an effing thing for me

1851
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and I can't wait I can't wait but it's also

1852
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
going to be mixed with the good people who were supportive

1853
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
and all that stuff but it's going to be a great guessing game

1854
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
because it's going to be like wow wow

1855
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
which one of them really pissed him off and which one

1856
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
actually supported him you'll never know

1857
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and it's a beautiful thing so

1858
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
but anyway all that aside so

1859
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I don't know how to follow that up

1860
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
but I'm excited to play

1861
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
that game

1862
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
and kinship which will be out

1863
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
so come hell or high water

1864
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
before your 40th birthday

1865
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
what's interesting in hearing you talk and say all that story

1866
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
is it was so funny to me in a way

1867
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
not funny haha but ironic

1868
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
is you could just replace like everything you said

1869
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
with radio and hey it's me

1870
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
because that's what I went to college to do

1871
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
was to do radio well originally

1872
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
it started that originally

1873
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
originally it started I was going to be a weatherman

1874
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
so was when I was a little kid

1875
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
when the weather channel came out oh my

1876
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
god I was so obsessed with that so you're not alone

1877
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
can you imagine Rob Roberts with the weather

1878
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
so there was and then I actually

1879
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I did broadcast journalism

1880
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I actually interned at a television

1881
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
station in the town where I went to school

1882
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
and I learned about how fucking miserable

1883
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
everybody was there

1884
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
and I started to realize like I don't know

1885
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
if this is really for me and then you start to get into

1886
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
radio and this was right

1887
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
when the internet was starting to boom and all this other stuff

1888
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
and there's this very like ho-hum

1889
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
attitude in radio and it's like you know

1890
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
you can work your way

1891
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
you can work and work and work and work all these hours

1892
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
but if you don't suck the right dick you're just not

1893
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
going to get anywhere with radio and I'm just kind of like

1894
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I don't know if this is

1895
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I don't know if this is the life I son of

1896
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
but here we are

1897
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Bree who's big in radio

1898
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
now in TV she could totally

1899
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
tell you all you just got called out Rob Roberts

1900
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Roker that's what he put

1901
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
you know and I have

1902
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
mad respect for people

1903
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
like Bree who stayed in

1904
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
that industry and have really

1905
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
worked on that from the inside

1906
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
for me I was like

1907
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
eh I'm going to just

1908
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
go work a temp job and see

1909
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
what I can do with my life and figure this out

1910
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
another way and started

1911
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
radio as a fun little thing on the side

1912
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
and shit here we are

1913
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I'm going to be turning 40 in a couple years and

1914
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
we got some podcasts

1915
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
but I love it you know

1916
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I've been able to do all this on my terms

1917
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Absolutely and no one can

1918
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
ever take that away from you and that

1919
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
is the same thing with game development and that's the same

1920
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
thing that I have to tell myself

1921
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
everyday and that's the same thing I have to

1922
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
tell other people like this is going to probably be

1923
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
the one and only platform

1924
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
that I'm going to share kind of the more

1925
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
personal stuff that I kind of did here

1926
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
no one's ever going to hear this again because I got to

1927
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
keep going forward but I think this was healthy

1928
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
for me because I haven't really been able to

1929
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
share this because

1930
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I'm glad we can be your psychological outlet

1931
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
you like how we have a couch here in the studio?

1932
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I just, I'm not, should I put my feet up?

1933
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
If you want, make some home

1934
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Put my feet up and lay back, that's just awesome

1935
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Definitely, so thank you

1936
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
for that by the way

1937
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I just feel a little weird that you

1938
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
talk about some of those difficulties and we

1939
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
follow that up with, hey but you should all try

1940
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
to get into game development

1941
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
No they have to be ready for that

1942
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
you have to be ready for the good and bad

1943
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
And that is life, you could be involved

1944
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
in sports, you could be involved

1945
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
in podcasting

1946
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
you could be involved, and there's going to be

1947
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
people that are

1948
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
great, that you work with great like Loki and

1949
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Dark Soccer and there's going to be people in your life

1950
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
that you don't work with so well, greatly

1951
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and that's just going to happen

1952
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
although honestly, like I don't want to

1953
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I've made it sound shady

1954
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
like everybody's going to go try to figure out who does

1955
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Rob Roberts not work well with, actually I've been

1956
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
pretty fortunate in the podcasting thing that everybody's

1957
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
been pretty decent, so I can't

1958
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah and I've

1959
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
had my, again I've had

1960
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
dealing with my bad eggs and you know

1961
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
it's good, the important thing is that

1962
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I can complain about that and this is why I don't really

1963
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
ever talk about it, this way today was kind of the

1964
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
exception and I'm happy I was able to

1965
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
but once it happens

1966
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I chalk it up to the experience

1967
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and I just simply ask myself who

1968
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
am I not going to, what type of personality

1969
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
am I not going to deal with going ahead

1970
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
because they're not going to stop me

1971
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
from going forward in what I've got to do

1972
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I've got a game to make and I've got games to release

1973
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
and I've got people waiting to play my game

1974
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
and no one is going to remove

1975
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
that dream of mine because I

1976
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I'm the only one in control of that whether I decide

1977
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
to stop it or not and I'm not

1978
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
because as I said I did that for 20 years and that's

1979
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
not happening again so and I've got

1980
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
a community rooting me on

1981
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
waiting for me to get this

1982
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
done so, like you guys

1983
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
so hell yeah

1984
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Well that's one of the most raw interviews we've probably had here on Orange

1985
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Lawn Radio but I, no I appreciate it

1986
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I love it, you know

1987
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I appreciate it more, man

1988
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
If people want to get involved with making

1989
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
games, you know, again, and we just want to

1990
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
emphasize, you know, even though

1991
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Gabe's talking about some dramatic experiences

1992
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
that he's had, you're going to get that

1993
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
with anything and you have to be prepared for it

1994
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
but there's a lot of great rewards

1995
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I've gotten great rewards from podcasting

1996
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
you've gotten great rewards from

1997
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
making games and the best is yet to come

1998
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
when these things actually release, so keep

1999
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
an eye out at Nascent Games on

2000
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Twitter and

2001
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
websites, nascentgames.net, right?

2002
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
nascentgames.net, that's our new website

2003
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
you can actually see the most

2004
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
up-to-date crumple gameplay trailer

2005
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
first thing on the video there, there's a lot

2006
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
more I'm going to be doing to that website

2007
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I had to revamp it from the ground up

2008
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
but it's nice for what it is

2009
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
right now at the time, for the time being

2010
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
our YouTube, we're

2011
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
going to be posting more on that soon

2012
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
youtube.com slash nascentgames

2013
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
our Bandcamp where

2014
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
again, we have a compilation album right now

2015
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
to hear the different

2016
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
music tracks that we're making for the couple

2017
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
different games we're working on

2018
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
nascentgames.bandcamp.com

2019
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I also posted a new demo track

2020
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
for our Kinship game

2021
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
it's free, so be sure to, I just posted

2022
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I think a week or so ago, so be sure

2023
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
to have a listen to that, it's a demo

2024
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
track, but it's a good track, so be

2025
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
able to, be sure to catch that

2026
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
and then

2027
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
we're on Twitch, and we're actually going to

2028
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
be doing an extra

2029
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
livestream on this Tuesday

2030
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
at the Cafe Colonial

2031
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
we're going to be doing a livestream for Extra Life

2032
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
on Bioshock

2033
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
the Bioshock collection which comes out on Tuesday

2034
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I'll be jamming out to Bioshock 1

2035
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
because I love the hell out of that game

2036
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and so that's how

2037
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
we're going to be repping the community a bit

2038
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
this Tuesday, I don't know

2039
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
if I'll be able to beat the whole game

2040
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
oh I will, I definitely will

2041
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I don't know if I'm going to be able to beat all of Part 1

2042
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
in one sitting on Tuesday, I'm going to try

2043
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
but yeah

2044
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
twitch.com slash nassongames

2045
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and the Extra Life

2046
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Brie if you have, thank you

2047
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Brie if you find

2048
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
if you get the link for the

2049
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
yeah, because we're part of the

2050
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Sac Indie Arcade team, because we have a

2051
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
team on Extra Life for Sac Indie Arcade

2052
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
and I'm one of the people for that

2053
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I don't know if she'll be able to pull that up

2054
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
but if you're in the chat

2055
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
be sure to keep an eye on that

2056
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
but otherwise, yeah, so

2057
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
those are all my links

2058
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
two other quick questions and I've really got to move on with the show

2059
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
because we're running a little long, but that's okay

2060
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
so one, I'm

2061
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
sitting here, I'm passionate about

2062
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
games, I want to get involved with games

2063
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
hearing this has made me realize

2064
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I don't necessarily have to know code to get

2065
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
involved with games, I need to meet

2066
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
people at my local IGDA

2067
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
how do I find them? So our meetup

2068
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
group, meetup.com

2069
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
slash game developer

2070
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
it is as easy as that, is that good anywhere

2071
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
in the world? Yeah, yeah, anywhere in the world

2072
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
but yeah, meetup.com slash game developer

2073
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
that's our chapters meetup

2074
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
group, be sure to check us out there

2075
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
there's other links for

2076
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
our Facebook, our Instagram and so on and so forth

2077
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
but definitely go there

2078
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and yes, you

2079
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
the two things I ask

2080
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
for if you're going to come talk to us

2081
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
you need to be in this for the

2082
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
love of the development

2083
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I don't need you walking up in my group saying

2084
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I've got this great money making idea

2085
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
because I've had a few people do that

2086
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I've happily showed them the door

2087
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
like don't come back because this is not why

2088
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
we're doing this, we hope to make money

2089
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
but that's not why I need you here

2090
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
we're trying to create a job market right now

2091
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
and if that's how you're going to be

2092
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I can't have that right now

2093
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I'm laughing because again

2094
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
the parallels to my own world are just

2095
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
uncanny. Yeah, it's crazy

2096
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
it's crazy stuff but I mean

2097
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
and yes, the extra life link

2098
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
oh man, I can't even follow that

2099
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
so yeah, sorry, if you're in the chat

2100
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
yeah, so extralife.org

2101
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
or .org. Does that game developer

2102
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
meet up, is that, like, if I

2103
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
remember our audience is all over the world

2104
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
let's say I've got somebody in New York City

2105
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
we have a few listeners there that wants to join

2106
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
the New York City IGDA of which I'm sure there's

2107
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
one in every borough, how could they find

2108
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
the IGDA in their area?

2109
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Yeah, so IGDA.org

2110
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
and there's a section for chapters

2111
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and there's a ton

2112
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
of chapters

2113
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
go there, check it out

2114
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
and even the, I haven't been there in a while

2115
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
but the chapters list the actual

2116
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
chapter head for each location

2117
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
and yeah, you'll be able

2118
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
to reach out to them. She posted a more

2119
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
friendly link

2120
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
to the Extra Life, so it's

2121
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
www.extra-life.org

2122
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
slash team

2123
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
slash sacindiarcade

2124
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Yes, thank you. Brie's like our living

2125
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
breathing Rolodex. And thank you Brie

2126
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
because yeah, I know. Bring her with you next time

2127
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
where is she? I know she's home

2128
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Yeah, she's home right now, but you know

2129
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
with her work schedule

2130
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
too, she works so much earlier

2131
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
but yeah, Brie

2132
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I saw what you said, I know even though you're not here

2133
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
but yes, thank you, you're still helping me out

2134
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
but yeah, that's ultimately it

2135
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
just come with the drive

2136
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
and come with

2137
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
a genuine attitude that you're

2138
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
ready to make a difference

2139
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
and show others what you know because we're

2140
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
all about sharing knowledge

2141
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
if you come with

2142
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
that arrogant attitude, I'm gonna

2143
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
wipe the floor with you and I'm gonna

2144
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I will ruin your day

2145
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I will be the original

2146
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
ending in Mass Effect 3

2147
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
and destroy many people's lives

2148
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
you're gonna wish for an alternative

2149
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Let's focus on the positive

2150
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Yeah, and unlike

2151
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
We're gonna make a game

2152
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I'm gonna put you in a fucking

2153
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
special thanks

2154
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So

2155
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
definitely come through with a great

2156
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
attitude, you know, even if you're shy

2157
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I prefer shyness over nasty

2158
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
arrogant crap, we don't have time

2159
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
for all that, so yeah, so definitely

2160
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
come through and check us out and I have to say

2161
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
someone says something really really quick

2162
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
then god, I don't want to take up too much

2163
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
time on this one, someone says, oh, Dungeon

2164
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Buster, he made the quote, we're here to make games

2165
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
not massage egos, thank you

2166
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
that's it, that's precisely it

2167
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
that's precisely it

2168
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
That's precisely it

2169
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
You want to be part of a team

2170
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah, or even

2171
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
feel that if you still want to be

2172
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
a solo act in your

2173
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
game development, that

2174
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
you want to be

2175
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
empowered, we talked about the feedback thing

2176
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
earlier, you have to be prepared

2177
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
for all this sort of thing, so we have to

2178
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
be supportive and give each other that

2179
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
constructive criticism, but

2180
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
we're here to

2181
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
empower each other, not push

2182
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
each other aside, so absolutely

2183
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Alright, one last thing before

2184
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
we move on with the rest of our show

2185
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Any teases for next year's indie arcade

2186
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
event?

2187
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So, we will

2188
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
99%

2189
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
sure be

2190
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
back at the West Sac Community Center

2191
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
there is that 1%

2192
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
opportunity

2193
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I can't say yet because

2194
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
it's still early in discussion

2195
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
My brain says you're going to outgrow that place by

2196
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
next year

2197
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Some people have said we've already outgrown the West Sac

2198
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
place, and it's like, wait, it's only our first time

2199
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
They could have used the second floor, there's still more

2200
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
room on the second floor they could have grown into

2201
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
so I don't think you've quite filled that space

2202
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
entirely, but I am worried

2203
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
for you guys that you're growing

2204
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
which is good, that's great

2205
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
It's a great problem to have, and yeah

2206
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
it's going to be interesting what happens for the next

2207
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
one, we already have our keynote

2208
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
speaker, she was

2209
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
so you remember Michelle

2210
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Michelle the last speaker

2211
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
she was on the team

2212
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
that made Evolve, right?

2213
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Evolve and making Mafia 3

2214
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Michelle Smith from 2K Games

2215
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
she's going to be our keynote

2216
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
she was phenomenal, and she's a Sacramento

2217
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
native, and there's no other

2218
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
person I would ask to be our keynote for this upcoming

2219
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
thing, so she's going to be our keynote

2220
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
we're planning a number of other things

2221
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I will tease

2222
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think I'm okay to say this

2223
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
because it might happen

2224
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
but we incorporated

2225
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
the board game aspect

2226
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
which had a great response for the board game

2227
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
board game developers, we are planning

2228
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
to incorporate pinball

2229
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
for our next one

2230
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
so stay tuned

2231
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Okay, I like that tease, that's good

2232
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
by the way, if we want to talk about panels

2233
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
maybe we want to get involved this year

2234
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I would love, it would be an honor to have you guys as a panel

2235
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
please, be awesome

2236
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
no pressure

2237
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I was going to ask y'all anyway

2238
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
we'll be there with bells on no matter what

2239
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
yes sir

2240
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
let's move on, we've got plenty of news

2241
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
we've got to cover, but of course we have to talk about

2242
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
our gaming weeks, I was in

2243
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
DragonCon last week, which is why we didn't have a show

2244
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I've got to talk a little bit about that

2245
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
let's get into our gaming weeks, we'll try to

2246
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
quickly move through this, but we'll see

2247
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

2248
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I wish I played a lot of stuff, but I didn't

2249
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I did stick with my I'm not playing

2250
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Tatami Katamari because it erased my progress

2251
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
so I didn't, instead

2252
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I played Non-Stop Night

2253
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
which is yet another mobile game

2254
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
thankfully though, this is not a clicker game

2255
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
because there's nothing you really click, except

2256
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
for, you know, special abilities

2257
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
every now and then, it's more of a

2258
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
clicker game without the clicking, if that makes sense

2259
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
and it's much more simplified, and it actually is

2260
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
kind of fun, because it is

2261
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
very easy to cheat in, so that

2262
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
that's what I've

2263
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
it's honestly though, the cheating

2264
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
at this point, I'm like so high

2265
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
level that it doesn't affect anything

2266
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
but it's kind of neat

2267
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
there's a little bit of strategy to it

2268
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
so there's kind of that

2269
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
but it's a good time waster

2270
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
so I'm playing that, I played a

2271
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
little bit of Ingress, not much

2272
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Pokemon Go, and

2273
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
more stories later, but

2274
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I may not be playing much Pokemon Go

2275
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
because I'm not too happy with Niantic right now

2276
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Alright

2277
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Hey Gabe, do you play

2278
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
games besides just making them, what have you been playing?

2279
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Yeah, I've been

2280
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I've been

2281
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I've been dabbling more

2282
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
again, and I seem to talk about

2283
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
this every time I'm on this show

2284
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
my Earth Defense 4 is 4.1 because they

2285
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
just announced

2286
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
unofficially part 5 is coming

2287
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
out, which I expected to be a thing

2288
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
and that's great, so I've been rocking

2289
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
that on my PS4, I've

2290
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
been playing Horizon 2

2291
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Forza Horizon 2 again because

2292
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
the Horizon 3 demo came out

2293
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
today, so

2294
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yes, the demo came out, and the only reason

2295
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I know what you're going to be doing, Lee

2296
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I thought it was still in that soon area

2297
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Well, here's the thing, the only reason I knew is because

2298
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Microsoft sent me a code for the

2299
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Halo vehicle, the Warthog

2300
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
They sent me a code that you could drive the Warthog

2301
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
in Forza Horizon 3

2302
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
It's insanity, so when I

2303
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
redeemed the code, it took me to the page

2304
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
that said, okay, you'll be able to use this here and here

2305
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
but in the description

2306
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
it said, this vehicle

2307
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
will be applicable for

2308
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Forza Horizon 3

2309
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
and all these different versions that they mentioned

2310
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and it said the different editions, and then at the bottom

2311
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
it said a demo, I said, bullshit

2312
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
what demo, so I clicked

2313
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
further, and it said demo coming out

2314
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
September 11th, I heard when it was coming

2315
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
and I realized it was today, nice

2316
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Yeah, this evening, so I've been playing

2317
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
that, and then

2318
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I've actually been, funny enough

2319
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I started playing

2320
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
again, DuckTales Remastered

2321
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I was playing that again because I got stuck on the

2322
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
very very last level, I just decided to start over

2323
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and then I've been playing Chrono Trigger

2324
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
on my Super Nintendo

2325
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
and

2326
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
it's probably one of the best decisions

2327
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I've ever made, because God help me

2328
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
that game, whoo, yeah

2329
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
so that's what I've been rocking out

2330
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Look at you, going from new stuff to old school

2331
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
love it, my gaming week

2332
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
speaking of new stuff, okay, so I spent

2333
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
the weekend at Dragon Con, which is why I wasn't here

2334
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
which, by the way, I just want to give a quick shout out

2335
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
to Dragon Con and the people that I met

2336
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
there, had a great time on the podcasting

2337
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
track, we did end up doing a panel

2338
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
after all, on Sunday

2339
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
about social media

2340
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
and had a really good time, and

2341
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
yeah, it was just, we have

2342
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
presented the Parsec Awards, which was

2343
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
great, because yet again, they gave

2344
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
us the spot right at the very end

2345
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
next to last

2346
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
so it's really something to be on

2347
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
the stage right before Richard

2348
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Garriott, aka Lord British

2349
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
who like, made Ultima, which is a

2350
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
series, you know, that I grew up with, it's just

2351
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
an honor to be in his presence and so forth

2352
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
and you know, all the great talent

2353
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
that goes with podcasting and all that

2354
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
so just, you know, my hat's off to

2355
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
everything involved there

2356
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
and Dragon Con this year, you know

2357
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
that is not usually an event that's

2358
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
big on gaming, you know, Dragon

2359
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Con has always been big on other types of

2360
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
fandom, be it sci-fi

2361
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Dungeons and Dragons

2362
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
board gaming

2363
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
you know, but I was always told

2364
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
ever since the first year I went, don't expect a

2365
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
big video gaming presence, but I gotta say

2366
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
this year, they started to step it up

2367
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
quite a bit, and I think this is because of a partnership

2368
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
they have with MomoCon, which also happens

2369
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
in Atlanta

2370
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
there's some type of strategic partnership thing going on there

2371
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
so this year, they had Tokyo Attack

2372
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
there, who actually had a 24-7

2373
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
arcade running of

2374
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Japanese import video games

2375
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
so I was playing Papa Music

2376
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
over and over and over again, it was fun

2377
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
they had Ubeat

2378
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
like six machines, I finally got to play

2379
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
a re-rave machine for the first time

2380
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
so if Kyle's still out there somewhere, I finally

2381
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
finally played a re-rave machine

2382
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
for the first time, so yeah, that was just

2383
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
that was an awesome addition to Dragon Con

2384
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
did you meet dragons though?

2385
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
there were definitely cosplays of dragons

2386
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
they call Dragon Con

2387
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
the Super Bowl of cosplay, and for good reason

2388
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
there was some really just elaborate

2389
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
stuff that happens there

2390
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
so yeah, I

2391
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
had a great time, there was also a classic gaming

2392
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
arcade that was set up in the dealer hall

2393
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
that wasn't 24 hour, but it was still nice to see

2394
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I got to play a

2395
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Mortal Kombat 2 machine, which I have in a

2396
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
long time, and I still

2397
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
remember how to chop somebody's head off with

2398
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Katana, and that felt really good

2399
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
that's awesome, where you can remember and not have to

2400
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
pull it up on your game FAQs, hell yeah

2401
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I actually got to beat some rando

2402
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
guy, we were playing

2403
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Mortal Kombat, I think he was Johnny Cage

2404
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
and I was Katana, and I remembered

2405
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
block block block block block, high kick, and

2406
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
bye bye, chopped off the head

2407
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I still remember that for scorpion, so kudos

2408
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
to you man, that was great

2409
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
alright, and let's see

2410
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
JD in chat says, what do you think of the

2411
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
what did you think of the re-raves guy, they have one at

2412
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Sunnyvale Golf Land by the way

2413
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I mean, if you've played the iPhone game

2414
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
which, if you're a fan of music games, you

2415
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
really ought to have by now, if you haven't

2416
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
friendly reminder to try it, because

2417
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
yeah, it's a great little

2418
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
touch game, and you know, it just felt like

2419
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
that, but on a much larger

2420
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
touch screen, because this thing is huge

2421
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
it's the size of a large television

2422
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
but it's a touch pad, and so for that

2423
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
it makes it almost harder for your eyes

2424
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
to get a sense of what all is on

2425
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
the play field at once, but

2426
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I'd like

2427
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
to touch the big button, I like to

2428
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
touch the big screen and touch it, it's fun

2429
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
so yeah, I enjoyed it

2430
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
let's see,

2431
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
okay, so also at DragonCon, so Bobby

2432
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
you know, he does a lot with

2433
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
VR and AR and all that development

2434
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
so our pal Bobby Blackwolf was there

2435
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
and we had for the first time this year

2436
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
what we were calling the VoG Suite

2437
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
because we actually had a suite at one

2438
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
of the host hotels, and so Bobby brought

2439
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
his toys

2440
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
and we all got to try them

2441
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
so for the first time ever I got to

2442
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
try the Vive, the HTC Vive

2443
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and I got to see some demos and that

2444
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
that was cool, I mean

2445
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I was a fan of VR since I checked out

2446
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Oculus Rift for the first time, so it was just cool to see

2447
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
some of the stuff in that, I watched other

2448
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
people play Job Simulator, which was

2449
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
cracking me up, we were laughing

2450
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
until three in the morning playing Job Simulator

2451
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
and I really like the

2452
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Angry Birds type thing they had, but it was

2453
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
all Portal characters, which I think is a game

2454
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
called The Lab that has, it's like

2455
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Valve's, you know, kind of

2456
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
VR playground game, a la

2457
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Wii Sports sort of thing, so

2458
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
that was cool to see, but I was really all about

2459
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
because I got to try for the first time HoloLens

2460
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
because he actually has a HoloLens dev kit

2461
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
so for the first time I got to try HoloLens

2462
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
and the game

2463
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
that he had me play on HoloLens was called

2464
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Fragments and

2465
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
it's pretty fucking cool, like

2466
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I'm smiling because one of our developers

2467
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
actually has lent me

2468
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
the HoloLens because he

2469
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
got it, he got it as part of the pre-order

2470
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
That's not a cheap blend by the way, I was told

2471
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
how much those things cost and yes

2472
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Your life

2473
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It cost you your life

2474
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Well here's the thing, so the

2475
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
HoloLens, you configure it

2476
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
and it actually scans the room, so it knows

2477
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
where couches are, it knows where tables are

2478
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
it knows where things are, so this game

2479
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Fragments is like a crime scene

2480
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
type game, so it's like a frozen moment

2481
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
in time of a crime scene of a

2482
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
kidnapping basically, I'm not going to spoil too much

2483
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
but it's like a kidnapping basically, and so

2484
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
you look, what you're trying to do is determine

2485
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
where are they, because you can

2486
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
see the kid and the

2487
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
kidnapper and you're trying to determine where do you send

2488
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
the cops, so you're investigating

2489
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
things in the room and suddenly you might look at the

2490
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
wall and oh there's a brick sticking out of the wall

2491
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
so you actually pick up the brick

2492
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
and turn it around and you might see that

2493
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
it's N-O something

2494
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
so it's New Orleans is where you're

2495
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
supposed to go, type of thing is N-O

2496
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
or you might find that

2497
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
lying on the couch is a ticket

2498
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
for the ferry or something

2499
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
so you actually kind of have to look around the room

2500
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
looking for things, and you even look up at the

2501
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
ceiling and you can see that it's raining

2502
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
so you know that the scene is happening somewhere

2503
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
in the US right now

2504
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
or it's raining, so there's little clues

2505
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
like that that you have to put together, so I thought that that was

2506
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
really cool, that was like playing like a

2507
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
90's adventure game, but instead

2508
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
of clicking on things that are

2509
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
in the scene, you're looking around you

2510
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
at the scene and actually touching

2511
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
them and interacting with them, and I just thought that was

2512
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
such a neat, that was

2513
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
such a cool use, and then when you're actually watching

2514
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
the cutscenes, here's the crazy shit, so

2515
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
since it scanned the room already

2516
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
you'll be watching like the chief and her

2517
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
two assistants or whatever, they're all talking and having

2518
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
conversation, one of them will be sitting on your

2519
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
couch and then suddenly stand up

2520
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
as part of the scene and stuff, it's like, okay

2521
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
so like it knew that you had a couch

2522
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
because it put this character on the couch and

2523
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
so I just thought that was so rad, how like it

2524
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
actually used the room

2525
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
so I would, now here's

2526
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
the thing, the one drawback to Hololens is that

2527
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
the field of vision

2528
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
very very small, it's like

2529
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
sitting right in front of a big screen TV

2530
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
type of thing, and

2531
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
so you, you know, it's very

2532
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
obvious where the

2533
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
holographic stuff begins and where it ends

2534
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
so I don't think it's ready for primetime

2535
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
so to speak? Oh definitely not,

2536
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
the plan with the Hololens was gonna be

2537
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
that, and this is

2538
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
why they released it now, and

2539
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
the release is not because

2540
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
the idea is that for the next

2541
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
probably three years, three or

2542
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
so years, we're gonna be, we're supposed to

2543
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
us as developers are supposed to get completely

2544
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
comfortable with the Hololens, and the

2545
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
goal right now from what I've learned again,

2546
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
this will obviously change

2547
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
it's to be earlier or later, but

2548
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
2019 is supposed to be

2549
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
the year that the first actual

2550
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
full on

2551
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
games for the commercial

2552
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
or consumer version

2553
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
of the Hololens is supposed to be for 2019

2554
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
at some point, so

2555
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I'm not totally, you know, the experience

2556
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I played was neat, I don't know

2557
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
what other types of games are gonna be

2558
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
doable on this, I mean it's

2559
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I already have one I'm gonna make for it, so yeah

2560
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
it's, you have to think about

2561
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
games differently, I think in order to

2562
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
make for the Hololens, and you know, Bobby's

2563
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
had this conversation about, well he sees it more as

2564
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
something that's gonna benefit

2565
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
in non-gaming types of areas

2566
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
just like Kinect kinda had

2567
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
some of its biggest successes

2568
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
in hospitals and things like that, you know, things that had

2569
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
nothing to do with games, and Hololens may end up

2570
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
being very similar, and that may be true

2571
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
but I think there's going to be some great gaming

2572
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
experiences in this thing, and I think you're right, by them

2573
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
getting it out so early at least, people

2574
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
can really think about, you know, have plenty of time to

2575
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
consider what's that game gonna look like, but I gotta say

2576
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I kinda, like

2577
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
everything I had heard about Hololens

2578
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
was pretty tepid, because I think

2579
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
they were showing things, like here's the Halo experience

2580
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
and everybody's too focused on, well you

2581
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
can't see, I mean the field of vision sucks

2582
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
da da da da, but this concept

2583
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
for this game that I saw was like

2584
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
okay, this shows me

2585
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
something that you can't, you can't

2586
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
even do this in VR

2587
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Right, no you can't, right, absolutely

2588
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
and definitely sells the difference between

2589
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
here's the difference between holographic gaming

2590
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
and virtual reality, so I thought that was just,

2591
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I thought it was neat. Absolutely, and I saw the

2592
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I see the Hololens as a great, just like

2593
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
VR, I see the Hololens as a great

2594
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
supplemental piece for

2595
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
game development and gaming, not

2596
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
so much primary, which I think

2597
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
that's what a lot of people are

2598
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
quick, so quickly impulsively jumping

2599
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
to, it's like, oh this is going to be the next great gaming

2600
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
experience, I know, I think it's going to be a good supplemental

2601
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
gaming experience, as an

2602
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
as an add-on, but it, you know

2603
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Virtual Boy tried, and we

2604
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
already saw what happened with that, so just don't

2605
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
just don't do that. We've come a long way since then.

2606
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
We've come a long way since then, yeah.

2607
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Quickly, I want to talk about some other games I've played this week

2608
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Overwatch is having a free weekend on

2609
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
PlayStation 4, so I finally got to play

2610
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
with some of my pals, like Exeter and Flaco Jones

2611
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
on PlayStation

2612
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Xbox also. It is so, yeah, it is

2613
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
on Xbox One, it is so fucking

2614
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
hard to play on a controller when you've been playing on keyboard

2615
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
and mouse for so long, like

2616
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
it's just, it feels weird, especially

2617
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
playing something like Pharah, where I'm used to using

2618
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
the right mouse button to levitate, like

2619
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
now in this, it's like, okay, I have to use L1

2620
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
to fly up, and then L2 to

2621
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
levitate, it's just, it took me a long time

2622
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
to get used to, and my aim still feels

2623
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
ridiculous, but, you know

2624
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
playing with friends has been

2625
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
fun. Am I going to double dip the $50

2626
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
to buy it again? No, I'm sorry to my

2627
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
friends on console, which is, I can't justify that.

2628
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And I think it's just, it's a little ridiculous

2629
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
that Blizzard knows it's me.

2630
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
No, because I tied my battle

2631
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
tag to it a long time ago with

2632
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Diablo or something, which I

2633
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
guess I did kind of double dip on, but in my

2634
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
defense, the PC version had been free with

2635
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
World of Warcraft, so.

2636
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So, but I'm not going to double dip on

2637
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Overwatch. If they knock the price down to 20 bucks,

2638
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
maybe, but it's Blizzard, that's not going to happen

2639
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
for a good long time.

2640
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
But it was still fun to check out.

2641
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Speaking of World of Warcraft, I've been playing Legion

2642
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
now that I'm back from Dragon Con.

2643
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Hey, the new expansion, pretty darn

2644
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
good, I gotta say. And it

2645
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
brought back, I think, 3

2646
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
million new people

2647
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
because of that expansion. You know,

2648
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
it's very interesting how they've really

2649
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
taken out a lot of the, you go

2650
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
to this zone to do these levels,

2651
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
and you go to this zone to do these levels,

2652
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
and they've kind of taken more of an approach of, nah,

2653
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
everything scales. Everything scales

2654
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
until you get to 110, so you do things

2655
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
in the order that you want to do for the story.

2656
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
And that alone is really,

2657
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I don't know, it's just really changed a lot of the feel

2658
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
of the game, and it kind of gets you more into the quests

2659
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and, you know, the dungeons

2660
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
really feel now more like an end piece

2661
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
to a storyline in a zone.

2662
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
It's just, it's very, very interesting the way they've

2663
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
done it. I'm into it. But isn't that,

2664
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
and maybe this is a dumb question,

2665
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I apologize if this almost sounds ignorant,

2666
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
but isn't that the point? Isn't that,

2667
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
wasn't that what they should, what is, I don't,

2668
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
again, I don't know what, how it was initially,

2669
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
because I haven't touched, I've played,

2670
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I've played two hours of

2671
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
WoW at the start, and that was, I couldn't do it anymore.

2672
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
No, because you would kind of feel

2673
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
this pressure to just, you know,

2674
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
you know, fuck how you get there, you just need to

2675
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
get to the max level as fast as you can.

2676
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
So once you're ready to go to a new zone, you just

2677
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
kind of stop where you're at and you go to that next zone.

2678
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
That's been a lot of how you've

2679
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
been playing MMOs in general

2680
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
till today. This one kind of

2681
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
stops, says, you know what, there's

2682
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
no, you just do whatever you want

2683
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
and everything's going to scale. And so

2684
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
it's really kind of changed the game in that regard.

2685
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Interesting, that's nice. So I just, if you haven't played

2686
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
WoW in a little while, Legion's kind of worth

2687
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
checking out. I gotta say, I've been enjoying

2688
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
it. I've enjoyed it more than Draenor

2689
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
for sure.

2690
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Pandaria, I think

2691
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
it's probably a better expansion than Pandaria,

2692
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
probably a better expansion than Cataclysm.

2693
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
It's a little early to say for sure, because I need to play

2694
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
more of it and see what the end game looks like, and more importantly

2695
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
what the support looks like.

2696
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
But I'm very encouraged,

2697
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I'm very encouraged that they're already talking about

2698
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
7.1. That's very

2699
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
encouraging, that Blizzard may be remedying

2700
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
what was their weakest point.

2701
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Still trying to play Final Fantasy 14

2702
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
though, even with WoW, because Final Fantasy

2703
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
14 had an anniversary event going on

2704
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
and I had to check that out.

2705
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So, I'm a little MMO'd

2706
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
out almost, but never, never.

2707
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Okay, one more thing I gotta talk about.

2708
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Luminous is out

2709
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
on iPhone.

2710
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
So, do you remember last week, or two weeks

2711
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
ago we talked about Luminous and we were like, oh it's

2712
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
new portrait mode, and we're like, no, that can't,

2713
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
that's not the orientation. No, it is.

2714
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Portrait mode is the new orientation. You now play vertically

2715
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
with Luminous, which was

2716
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
kind of weird to see at first.

2717
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
It works, but

2718
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
oh, and Luminous on mobile phones

2719
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
has Shinen. They've got the

2720
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
classic pack that has all the old school

2721
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
songs, very, very cool.

2722
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Here's the biggest problem with Luminous,

2723
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
it's on a touch phone. That's the

2724
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
biggest problem with Luminous, because again,

2725
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
the direction,

2726
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
the left-right movements and down

2727
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
to move the piece down a touch, it's just not

2728
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
responsive enough. And I need to remind

2729
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
myself, any time that I think

2730
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
a console experience is gonna make for

2731
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
a good iPhone experience, it's

2732
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
not. If it's just gonna be a port

2733
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
or vice versa, which

2734
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
y'all are gonna try to get me

2735
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
in a few minutes here when we talk about one of the big stories

2736
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
of the week from me just saying that, but

2737
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
there's a big difference between porting

2738
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
something that was originally on consoles

2739
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
and designing something with

2740
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
the mobile space in mind.

2741
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
So, that

2742
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
being said, I still think if you're a

2743
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
fan of Luminous, it's what, three bucks?

2744
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It's worth checking out. It's far better than the one

2745
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
they put out years ago

2746
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
when I think the 4 was the iPhone that was

2747
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
going around. It's far better and more responsive

2748
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
than that, but from a

2749
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
precision standpoint, I just think

2750
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
if you're good at Luminous and you need the

2751
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
precision that comes with being good, you're gonna get

2752
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
really fucking frustrated that

2753
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
it's touch controls. But

2754
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Shinen, that song

2755
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
rocks!

2756
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
That's a good call. That's a good call on that.

2757
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
So yeah, good look on that.

2758
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
So there you go. That was my gaming

2759
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
week. Some quick announcements,

2760
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
then we gotta get into the news. I gotta plug

2761
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
GamerX4. We're gonna be there. We're gonna be at

2762
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
GamerX4 at a table

2763
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
in like three weeks. I can't believe

2764
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
it's coming up that soon, but VOG Network will be

2765
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
there at a table. Myself, Dark

2766
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Sakura, Shane now telling me he might go,

2767
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
so that's pretty cool. And

2768
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
a panel

2769
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Sunday, 2 o'clock,

2770
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
the Indie Gamer Super Show with

2771
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
myself, Dark Sakura, Captain Spike from

2772
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Gameboi.org, and whoever

2773
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
else we pull onto our thing at the last minute.

2774
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Oh, congrats, man. That's gonna be

2775
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
fun. Wonderful. I'm very excited.

2776
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Are you going? Because I know IGDA has a presence

2777
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
this year. I've

2778
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
heard bits and pieces

2779
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
a bit about it, but I don't know. I tried

2780
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
to myself get a table for NASA games, but

2781
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
budget-wise, it was out of my budget at the time.

2782
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
So I mean, I don't know

2783
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
too much about that. I know there's been

2784
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
a little more talk about the MagWest thing,

2785
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
because apparently MagWest is doing, they're

2786
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
having a gathering

2787
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
later this month in San Jose. I think

2788
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
they're doing the arcade

2789
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
portion of whatever's going on at GamerX

2790
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
too, so I think the early scenes. Oh, that makes sense.

2791
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Yeah. Which, by the way, I

2792
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
don't know, since I haven't seen you in a little while,

2793
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I already have my hotel and tickets for

2794
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
MagFest 2017, just so you know.

2795
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Nice. I'm gonna be there. I don't know if you're going back, but

2796
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I'm hoping they'll go back. I've reconnected with them

2797
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
recently, so we're hoping.

2798
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Good. Good. Sounds good.

2799
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Alright, and then

2800
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
the DragonCon Super Show. So we did

2801
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
have a new show on VoG last

2802
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
week. We actually taped in the VoG

2803
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
suite. We did a special show

2804
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
with hosts from this show,

2805
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Bobby Blackwolf, Pod Culture,

2806
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
British Invaders, Critical Myth.

2807
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I'm leaving somebody out, and I'm gonna

2808
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
hate myself for it later, but people came

2809
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
together from all those shows, and

2810
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
we did this Super Show

2811
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
that's gonna be available.

2812
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Here's the thing, since it wasn't really something to

2813
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
it's not gonna be on the podcast feed, it's gonna be on

2814
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
YouTube. So Bobby's putting

2815
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
that all together right now, putting on the B-roll

2816
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
in. I don't know when, but it will be

2817
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
on YouTube for you guys.

2818
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Yeah, I know, we're trying to get our

2819
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
trying to warm up to that a little more. Do it!

2820
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I've been only pushing you since the day I met

2821
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
you. I thought I said British

2822
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Invaders. Did I not say British Invaders? You said British Invaders.

2823
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I thought I did. That's what Brad from

2824
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Pod Culture said. So anyway, hopefully I didn't

2825
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
leave anybody out, but yeah, we

2826
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
did a fun little show there.

2827
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And that's probably a tradition we'll

2828
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
continue next year. We'll see.

2829
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Okay, we gotta get to some gamer news. We're only

2830
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
what, an hour and a half into the show? Let's get to some news.

2831
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Loki. So

2832
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Apple had their conference where they

2833
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
talked about the new phone

2834
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
and everything, but one of the announcements that they had

2835
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
which was kind of odd was

2836
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Nintendo was there. It was like,

2837
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
what the fuck? Why is Nintendo here?

2838
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
And so they had some game announcements. The first

2839
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
one is Super Mario Run,

2840
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
which is going to be coming to iOS first.

2841
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
It's a mobile game of Endless Runner,

2842
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
if you will, where you're Mario

2843
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
and you jump on platforms

2844
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
and... Or you could just play

2845
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii U

2846
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
and have a better experience.

2847
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Anyway, I'm done. I don't know.

2848
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I'm not so

2849
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
ready to write it off because one of

2850
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Nintendo's biggest strengths, always has been,

2851
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
always will be, is level design.

2852
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And so even though we're calling this

2853
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
an Endless Runner, it's

2854
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
not really endless because it looks like there's

2855
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
definitely these setup stages and so forth

2856
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
and it just looks like the way things are set up

2857
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
there's going to be a definite, you know,

2858
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
there's the obvious path and then there'll be

2859
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
the path that includes all the red coins

2860
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
and all that other fun stuff. And so I just

2861
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
feel like there'll probably be more depth to this

2862
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
than your typical quote-unquote

2863
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Endless Runner. So I'm curious,

2864
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I want to know what the price is going to be.

2865
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
That's the big thing for me. Is this going to

2866
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
be a $3 game? If so, fuck

2867
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
yeah. It's going to have in-app purchases

2868
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
though. Or is, no it's not. They've, they've

2869
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
come, well, they wrote that off. It's a

2870
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
free demo and the in-app purchase

2871
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
is the game. That's it.

2872
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Yeah, they wrote off the in-app purchase

2873
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
thing. They say we're not going to do that.

2874
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
That's what the description said. Yeah, no, the description

2875
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
says that because the game will be the one

2876
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
level demo and then the in-app purchase is the rest

2877
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
of it. Which a lot of other games do.

2878
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Yeah. But here's, you know, could it be

2879
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
a $20 game? Because honest,

2880
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
honestly, Nintendo could get away

2881
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
with it. No. Square Enix

2882
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
does. Yeah, and that's funny. You said

2883
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
that I was going to actually, I was going to say they pulled it off

2884
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
they did it with Final Fantasy. Yeah.

2885
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And everybody loves Square Enix for that. Be prepared.

2886
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I think they're going to charge $19.99

2887
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
for it. I think they will. I think they're

2888
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
going to be that bold. My hope is $9.99

2889
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
but I fear you might be right

2890
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
but I hope $9.99.

2891
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Yeah. Well that's good. They can charge rid of the

2892
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
fuck they want for it. I'll still buy it. I will.

2893
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Part of the problem.

2894
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I will. I don't, I just, I know

2895
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
it's going to be solid. Part of the problem, man. I know.

2896
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I know. However,

2897
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
other things that were kind of in little footnotes

2898
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
there, they're going to have a Fire Emblem game

2899
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
and Animal Crossing.

2900
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Animal Crossing.

2901
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Well that's going to do

2902
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
pretty well. Well

2903
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
actually those games though, even though they

2904
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
talked about those games, those games are supposed

2905
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
to be out I believe by this holiday.

2906
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Yeah. And they just, they suddenly

2907
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
put in there that Fire Emblem and

2908
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Animal Crossing are now going to be coming out before

2909
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
the end of March 2017.

2910
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
So those games quietly

2911
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
getting delayed in favor of Super Mario.

2912
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Will mobile games be for the NX?

2913
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Could be. Well, who knows?

2914
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I think there's going to be, I made

2915
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I made a, I don't like, I hate

2916
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
speculation but I had to have a little fun

2917
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
with it anyway. I think there's going to be

2918
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I think whatever the NX

2919
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
is going to be is going to have a straight up

2920
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
tie into why they're

2921
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
releasing the games on the iPhone.

2922
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I think they're going to try to pull almost

2923
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
and please forgive

2924
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
me for those who, please forgive

2925
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
me guys, but I almost smell

2926
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
the same approach that Ouya did

2927
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
where the next console

2928
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
is going to be, yeah you can play it on our console

2929
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
you know, but you'll also be able to download it here

2930
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
and play it here and there will be some maybe crossplay

2931
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
or something like that. Yeah, it kind of vomited in my mouth

2932
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
a little bit when you said that. That's why I

2933
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
apologize in advance but I'm just saying because

2934
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
like just these announcements are really

2935
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
really weird. I gotta say, the

2936
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Mario thing, it did throw me

2937
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
for a loop a little bit. I wasn't

2938
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
yep, props to Apple, props to Nintendo.

2939
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I wasn't expecting that. Sorry Black Wolf

2940
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I see you're here. It was courageous of them

2941
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
to put it on the platform.

2942
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Yeah it was, yeah.

2943
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Well just so you know though, they

2944
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
did say it's coming to Android as well.

2945
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
So you're not going to get left in the cold if you're on

2946
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Android. Thank God. It's just

2947
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
iPhone first or something like that, right?

2948
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Who cares? But then

2949
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
that raises the question about what happens

2950
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
with the next DS.

2951
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
That's what I want to know. That's why this

2952
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
surprised me because I was like well wait, hold

2953
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
hold up, hold up. If

2954
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
the NX is going to be

2955
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
portable then why

2956
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
is suddenly Nintendo going

2957
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
third party on another platform

2958
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
and all of a sudden all this

2959
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
endless ocean of wank

2960
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
that we have on Twitter about

2961
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Nintendo should put Super Mario

2962
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
on the PlayStation 4. It's like

2963
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
shut up, that's never going to happen but it's like

2964
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
it kind of just fucking did this week. If you

2965
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
ever write a book you need to call it that.

2966
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
My endless ocean of wank.

2967
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I thought that's what I tell the boys

2968
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
on Grindr.

2969
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
But we already had a similar title for that. Remember

2970
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
it was like pissing in

2971
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
an ocean of piss or something like that.

2972
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
That's right.

2973
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
That'll be the OLR documentary

2974
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
or the Behind the

2975
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Music on the Making of Kinship.

2976
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Anyway, no. If they

2977
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
ever did a documentary on the making of kinship you know

2978
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
it's going to be called Special Thanks.

2979
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Word up.

2980
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
You heard that fools.

2981
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Now here's the thing.

2982
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
They made it very clear

2983
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
it's not a traditional

2984
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Mario game because Mario is

2985
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
obviously doing the endless running thing. You don't have to do

2986
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
the left and right controls.

2987
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Having played Luminous let me tell you

2988
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
it's not going to fucking work and I'm glad

2989
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
they don't have Mario going left and right

2990
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
and all that. This is how you make it work.

2991
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
You have one

2992
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
button. This game is played with one

2993
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
button. Touch. Touch.

2994
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Touch. Touch. That's how the game

2995
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
works. That's it. So if you want

2996
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
a more in-depth Mario experience you're

2997
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
going to have to go to the NX.

2998
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
But at the same time

2999
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
hasn't Nintendo told us that 2D Mario

3000
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
is kind of like Mario Maker was

3001
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
kind of the swong song for 2D Mario.

3002
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Here comes your encore during the week

3003
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
we were off.

3004
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
They're doing new Super Mario Brothers games

3005
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
which are basically 2D Mario games.

3006
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
They look dumb.

3007
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
They're not 2D.

3008
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Seriously.

3009
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Fucking get the Rayman team on

3010
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
a 2D Mario game or any

3011
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Zelda title.

3012
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Hand drawn, hand painted

3013
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Mario game.

3014
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I'm sorry. They did that already.

3015
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
They had Wario Land shake.

3016
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Which was fantastic

3017
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
looking. Just no one played it.

3018
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I put up a tweet

3019
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
a couple days ago about

3020
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I know we'll talk later about this

3021
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
with Interplay and them selling their

3022
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
assets. And all I said

3023
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
was Earthworm Jim

3024
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Ubisoft Rayman Origins

3025
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Legends team. That's what I need

3026
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
to see. So yeah. That's what I want to see.

3027
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
But I hope you're wrong

3028
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
though. I hope the Mario

3029
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Maker is not the swong song

3030
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
because I really would love to see

3031
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
you know

3032
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
those type of graphics

3033
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
again. But yeah.

3034
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Let me go to some chat comments

3035
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
over at live.vognetwork.com

3036
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Ranma in our chat says iPhone users

3037
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
can lose their shit over Super Mario Run

3038
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
but us Android users still have our

3039
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
headphone jacks. Oh yes.

3040
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Here's the thing you Android users

3041
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
get with your Note 7s. When you beat

3042
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Super Mario Run and the fireworks go off

3043
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
at the end of the stage, your phone also

3044
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
blows up. That's what you get

3045
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
as a Note 7 user.

3046
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Well that's alright you know because at least we don't have

3047
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
one of those iPhones that you can bend in half

3048
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
like a cracker.

3049
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I thought

3050
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
that joke is so 2014. Come on.

3051
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
We're past the bendable

3052
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
iPhone. Like those stupid

3053
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
3.5mm

3054
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
phone jacks or audio jacks.

3055
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Here's my thing. I'm actually

3056
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I have upgraded iPhone every time I'm

3057
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
eligible. I'm not going to get an iPhone 7. It actually has

3058
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
nothing to do with the headphone jack thing. It's just

3059
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
okay. It's a new camera.

3060
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yeah.

3061
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Yeah. My 6

3062
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
My 6 is good enough for now.

3063
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
It takes a better picture.

3064
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
It takes a better selfie.

3065
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
JD in chat says hey maybe they should port

3066
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Rhythm Tengoku Gold to touchscreen smartphones.

3067
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I'd be down with that. That would be a good franchise.

3068
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
You know we know that Nintendo

3069
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
was working on several. Well now we know

3070
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Mario was one of them apparently.

3071
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
For whatever reason they've bumped this to the front of the line.

3072
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I'm not sure

3073
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
maybe this has to do with Pokemon

3074
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
and the fact that their stock went way up with Pokemon.

3075
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Namco. I could use some

3076
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Taiko no Tatujin.

3077
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
All right.

3078
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Let's move on.

3079
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Loki what do you have next? Speaking of Pokemon

3080
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Go right? Yes.

3081
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Pokemon Go is getting an update.

3082
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
They're updating finally to

3083
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
0.37

3084
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
or something. And what it's going to add is

3085
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
the ability for players to turn

3086
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
one of their Pokemon into a buddy. So you can basically

3087
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
when you're walking or driving

3088
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
or whatever they

3089
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
earn candy for

3090
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
the distance that you walk. Also apparently there's

3091
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
a nice little easter egg where if you walk with

3092
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Pikachu for 10 kilometers he hops

3093
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
on your shoulder. So that's kind of neat.

3094
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
The update will

3095
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
also I guess make it

3096
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
easier to

3097
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
choose smaller Pokemon on the map.

3098
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Also prevent eggs hatching

3099
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
without animations

3100
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
or something like that. And I want

3101
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
to say that there was something that was supposed to make

3102
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
leveling up easier. Oh

3103
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
and fuck you for if you have a jailbroken

3104
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
or rooted phone like my son

3105
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
does because their fucking app

3106
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
is not supported on that phone

3107
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
despite the fact that it runs just

3108
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
perfectly fine so I had to fucking root it

3109
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
to get it on there. Oh but fuck him

3110
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
because he must be a cheater because that's what they're assuming

3111
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
because they're Niantic and don't want to fucking

3112
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
fix their problems. Instead they're just going to blame

3113
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
everybody that has a rooted phone for fucking

3114
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
cheating. There's already a

3115
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
workaround for it but it's a pain in the fucking

3116
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
ass. And why should I have to

3117
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
you know

3118
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
spend all this effort to play your fucking

3119
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
game that I paid money

3120
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
for as well to

3121
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
you know purchase items because I thought I would kick

3122
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
you some money before making this game.

3123
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
But then here's how you fucking repay

3124
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
me by fucking me over.

3125
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Well what would you expect from a

3126
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
studio that can't even

3127
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
call its version version one?

3128
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
It has to be 0.3 point

3129
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I mean what is this? I mean what

3130
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
happened here? Because the game's not fucking

3131
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
finished. It won't ever be done.

3132
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
It's going to be another No Man's Sky.

3133
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
So I mean it's like seriously.

3134
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
That's unfortunate.

3135
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
But you know what? You know what's good though?

3136
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
I'm so glad that they focused

3137
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
their shit on instead of fixing

3138
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
the problems. They've got Pokemon

3139
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Go coming out for the new fucking

3140
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
iWatch or

3141
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Apple thing. And oh it looks so

3142
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
fucking fantastic on that tiny little fucking

3143
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
screen. I'm so glad that they

3144
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
could focus their fucking efforts on that.

3145
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
But fuck all you guys. I guess fuck you

3146
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
if you have your own stupid rooted phone.

3147
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
You better fucking buy an iWatch because at least

3148
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
that shit will work. Hey you want to know something fucking

3149
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
funny? You're releasing this stupid

3150
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Pokemon Go Plus in what literally

3151
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
days now that I'm going to fucking

3152
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
hack the shit out of and there's not

3153
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
a fucking thing you can do about it.

3154
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
But you know go ahead and punish everybody

3155
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
that has a fucking rooted phone because

3156
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
they're the fucking hackers. I don't have a

3157
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
rooted phone and I'm going to hack the shit out of your shit.

3158
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
The following comments are not necessarily

3159
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
of OLR and its affiliates.

3160
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Okay so here's the thing.

3161
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
They actually counted how many fucks were in that

3162
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
segment in our chat room. 15.

3163
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
That's not enough.

3164
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
So okay I will say this.

3165
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
As cute as the Watch thing

3166
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
looks and if I were into the Apple Watch

3167
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I'd probably be into the

3168
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
if Jamie were here she'd be raging so hard right now.

3169
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
But if I were into

3170
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
the Apple Watch thing I'd probably be into

3171
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
the Pokemon Go thing because it did look cute

3172
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
you know for what the Watch does. That's awesome.

3173
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I can take both hands off the steering wheel when I play in the car.

3174
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Okay that's funny.

3175
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Okay but

3176
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
it does seem a little bit reductive

3177
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
to the

3178
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
physical Pokemon Go

3179
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
thing that Nintendo's trying to make money

3180
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
off of that's coming out next week.

3181
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Like I don't fucking need that now

3182
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
if I have an Apple Watch it sure seems like.

3183
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Well no you still do because you play the Apple Watch

3184
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
one just like you do the actual game.

3185
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
So you actually I think you throw balls and stuff like that.

3186
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
No you still hatch eggs and all that stuff.

3187
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Yeah you still do all that.

3188
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Here's the thing is like I mean seriously like

3189
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
like I've heard

3190
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
rumors that one of the other reasons that they may have

3191
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
you know blocked it for rooted people is

3192
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
because they're going to like somehow abuse

3193
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
the device. I'm like dude you don't even need a

3194
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
rooted device. Hello look at

3195
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
okay the way this device works is

3196
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
it indicates any time that you have to

3197
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
push the button. It flashes a light or

3198
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
rumbles. There's electricity going

3199
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
to that light there's electricity going to that rumble

3200
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
motor. You fucking just

3201
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
solder a goddamn wire from

3202
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
that to the switch. Bada bing

3203
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
eight fucking auto hacks your stupid

3204
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
fucking pokey stops and auto catches

3205
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
fucking Pokemon by one

3206
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
fucking wire. He just went

3207
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
sopranos on us. I'm with

3208
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
William Murderface in our chat. Loki dropped out of

3209
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
rant space. Someone vent the rant core

3210
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
breach.

3211
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Good lord.

3212
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
It's fucking disappointing.

3213
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Now I gotta explain to my son who fucking

3214
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
loves playing Pokemon Go. I'm sorry

3215
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Niantic fucking hates you because you're a cheater

3216
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
so you can't play anymore. You're not worthy

3217
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
son. I mean

3218
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
seriously he is fucking in the

3219
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Pokemon like crazy now because of Pokemon

3220
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Go and now sorry

3221
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
fuck you. You don't get the play because

3222
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
you're a fucking cheater. Thank you.

3223
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
He's almost at 20. JD with the obvious question

3224
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
in chat that I have to ask as well

3225
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
live.vognorant.com just don't update the app

3226
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
on his phone. Oh

3227
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I'm glad you thought of that except

3228
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Niantic also fucking thinks about that because

3229
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
see I have this other app called Ingress

3230
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
and if you don't fucking update it it doesn't

3231
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
fucking work.

3232
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
So that's what's gonna fucking happen is because

3233
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
they'll check your version of it and I'm sorry

3234
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
you need to update your fucking app to play this.

3235
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
26

3236
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
This is great.

3237
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Wow. And the most important

3238
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
about what he just said

3239
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
for those new to counting

3240
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
numbers you've

3241
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
just received a great lesson

3242
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
on how to count. I'll put it in the review

3243
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
of the app.

3244
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Oh my god.

3245
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Alright. Let's talk about something that

3246
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
God I just wish he'd won

3247
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
the goddamn techno motion machine.

3248
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
It would have been half

3249
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
the fucks. You'd be like I don't give

3250
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
a fuck about it. I don't give a fuck but life

3251
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
is great. I got a machine.

3252
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Alright. Let's talk about

3253
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Interplay. Gabe mentioned this earlier.

3254
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
They are going to be selling their games

3255
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
and intellectual property so

3256
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
if you want to buy an intellectual

3257
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
property such as Earthworm Jim

3258
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
or MDK or Clay Fighter

3259
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
fuck yeah. Oh my god.

3260
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Clay Fighter was awesome. Or Descent

3261
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
or Battle Chess

3262
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
get to it. You can

3263
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
actually do that.

3264
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Let's see. Wedbush

3265
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Securities is going to be assisting Interplay with

3266
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
the sales of the IP so I'm

3267
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
very curious to see what happens in a couple months with

3268
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
who buys what.

3269
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
See it's moments like this

3270
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
that I as a startup indie studio

3271
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
wish I could afford to get something

3272
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
like that because I know

3273
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
that would be so beneficial for

3274
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
my team. Especially for some of my team where

3275
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
they're kind of the younger generation so they

3276
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
don't know. They aren't familiar

3277
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
with those older games back in the

3278
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
early mid 90s

3279
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
and so on and so forth. It'd be great to be like you have

3280
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
no idea. Earthworm Jim

3281
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
no idea. Clay Fighter

3282
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I need you to write me a theme

3283
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
song like the Clay Fighter song

3284
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
which actually if you remember on the

3285
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Super Nintendo I think had the vocal

3286
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Yeah it did.

3287
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
It's like

3288
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
everybody remembers that because like

3289
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
when did the fucking new Super Nintendo talk

3290
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
to you during Super Metroid and

3291
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
during Clay Fighter. Well NBA Jam.

3292
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Ok one or two other times too.

3293
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Right.

3294
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Very true. Very true.

3295
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
To register participation for this week's episode

3296
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

3297
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
use the passphrase

3298
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
wolf. Anyhow, Loki what do you have

3299
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
next for us. Alright

3300
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
so the next thing I have we're going to talk a little

3301
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
bit about is

3302
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Mario games

3303
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
and Miyamoto basically saying

3304
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
hey you know what

3305
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Mario's just not going to really work

3306
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
out for VR. Damn right. It's not

3307
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
going to be a good fit and I kind of I could see

3308
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
that because I mean think

3309
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
about it. It's platforming. It's lots of

3310
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
movement. That's going to make people sick.

3311
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Basically saying you know I agree

3312
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
that adapting Mario to new platforms is key

3313
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
to keeping him relevant but we want families

3314
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
to play together and virtual reality

3315
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
which requires players to be closed off

3316
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
from the real world doesn't really

3317
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
fit in there. We also like people

3318
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
playing for a long time and it's hard to do

3319
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
that with VR. You don't need

3320
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
VR to be closed off from the real world.

3321
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
That's been happening since

3322
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
the Atari days. That's an interesting statement.

3323
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I don't know if that's a good reason why not to do

3324
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
it because if you think about it they can still

3325
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
do like you know

3326
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
like Sony's doing where they have you know

3327
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
the multi-screenplay thing where it's

3328
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
almost just like the Wii U where you add one person

3329
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
on a gamepad. Everybody else is on the

3330
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
TV. You know you could do that with VR.

3331
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Don't put Mario on VR. Yeah I was going to say but they're still

3332
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
stationary and there

3333
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
isn't the restriction other than

3334
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
if you really want to vomit

3335
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
fast you put Sonic in VR.

3336
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Like here's the thing.

3337
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
That's just punishment. Holy shit. And this

3338
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
goes back to what I was saying about you know

3339
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
fragments and the AR space and

3340
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
everything is that you know it's going to change the way

3341
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
the game developers think about

3342
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
games. It's like telling

3343
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
a painter that now instead of

3344
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
oil paints they have to paint with watercolor.

3345
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It's a whole new canvas so that doesn't mean

3346
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
the same old ideas are going to necessarily work. I don't really

3347
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
take a lot of this you know what he

3348
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
says right now for

3349
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I don't know like how much of it

3350
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
is just kind of a thing that he's saying right now because

3351
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
if you think about it like if VR

3352
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
becomes like the Del facto thing

3353
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
of course they're going to put fucking Mario in VR.

3354
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I mean just like how they probably were saying oh

3355
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
well we're not developing

3356
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
mobile games because our games are too fucking awesome

3357
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
for that and here they are developing a mobile

3358
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
game so

3359
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I don't know. Did you say

3360
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Rob did you did I

3361
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
maybe I was just

3362
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
high but did you just say Mario

3363
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Paint by any chance?

3364
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
No but I was comparing this to

3365
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
painting so I can see why somebody would actually

3366
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
come at the conclusion of Mario Paint. So okay

3367
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
cool. So I wasn't entirely losing my mind

3368
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
because I just had this wild thought like God

3369
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Mario Paint in VR which

3370
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
that would be that would be freaking

3371
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
awesome. By the way

3372
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
perfect iOS Android

3373
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
opportunity for Nintendo

3374
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
just bring

3375
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
back Mario Paint

3376
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
and that most of all most

3377
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
importantly that music generator thing they had

3378
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
in Mario Paint. Oh my goodness yes.

3379
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
And use the magic of the interwebs that

3380
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
we can send our little Mario Paint

3381
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
creations as text messages

3382
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
and those silly little songs that we do in the

3383
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
music generator we can send those

3384
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
to each other somehow. Just food for thought.

3385
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And that'll never happen because it's too brilliant of a night.

3386
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Alright.

3387
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Anyhow speaking of VR

3388
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
experiences this one would be worthy

3389
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
of VR by the way. Space

3390
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Channel 5

3391
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Sega announced that there is

3392
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
a Space Channel 5

3393
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
VR called Ooki Ooki

3394
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Viewing Show and when I heard that Space Channel

3395
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
5 was coming to

3396
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
VR I about made an Ooki Ooki

3397
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
in my pants because

3398
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I fucking love Space Channel 5

3399
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
and so the thought of just getting

3400
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
to you know strut along with

3401
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
choo choo right along that

3402
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
just I was so excited about that

3403
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
um but

3404
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
unfortunately it's actually not

3405
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
the game the key word is

3406
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
viewing show so you get to be

3407
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
a program viewer of the report

3408
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
show sadly it's not something

3409
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
that lets you play the rhythm game. However

3410
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
but see I still go

3411
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
okay but it seems like they're testing

3412
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
the waters if this does well

3413
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
that's that right there though

3414
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
see this type of thing is why I'm

3415
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
hesitant with jumping

3416
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
in on like Playstation VR because

3417
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
all these games that come out are experiences

3418
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
they're not a game

3419
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
it's just like it's a thing

3420
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
it's a small portion of what could be

3421
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
a game it's basically like a

3422
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
tech demo

3423
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
that's just why

3424
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
am I dropping $500

3425
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
a platform for fucking tech demos

3426
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
it's gonna be a Tokyo game show

3427
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
so some folks will get to try that out

3428
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
first hand and here's the interesting part

3429
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I just assumed it was Playstation VR

3430
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
right it's actually not it's a Vive

3431
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
um title so that kind of

3432
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
surprised me but then again Sega's been doing

3433
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
stuff for Steam so I guess it's

3434
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
not as surprising but uh yeah

3435
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
so it's actually an experience that's gonna be on the Vive

3436
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
so some folks that are going to Tokyo Game

3437
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Show will get to check that out I don't know

3438
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
if Akuma JP is going this year but if you are

3439
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
you need to check that out for me please

3440
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
alright

3441
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
uh let's go to Loki

3442
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
with another news story

3443
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
so once again you know another reason like I'm

3444
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I bought Fallout

3445
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
on Playstation 4 it's like sweet

3446
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
cause I can my laptop

3447
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
doesn't run these games that great

3448
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
and you know I can also

3449
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
do mods it's gonna be fucking awesome because

3450
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
they talked about it at E3 and everything

3451
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
yeah

3452
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
unfortunately that's not gonna happen on Playstation 4

3453
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
they did get they ended up releasing

3454
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
mod support on Xbox

3455
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
um back I wanna say in May

3456
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
um it was supposed to be coming later

3457
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
for Playstation 4 but

3458
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
it's just not gonna happen anymore basically

3459
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
as Bethesda put it on their website

3460
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
after months of discussion with Sony we regret

3461
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
to say that while we have long been

3462
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
ready to offer mod support

3463
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
on Playstation 4

3464
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Sony has informed us they will not approve

3465
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
user mods the way they should work

3466
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
where users can do anything they want

3467
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
for either Fallout 4 or

3468
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Skyrim Special Edition

3469
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
like you we are disappointed by Sony's decision

3470
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
to give uh given the considerable

3471
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
amount of time and effort we put into

3472
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
the project and the amount

3473
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
of time our fans have waited for mod

3474
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
support to arrive we consider this

3475
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
important initiative and we hope to find

3476
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
other ways um user mods can be

3477
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
available for the Playstation audience

3478
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
however until Sony will allow us to

3479
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
offer proper mod support for Playstation 4

3480
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
that content for Fallout 4 and Skyrim

3481
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
on Playstation 4 will not be available

3482
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
thank you Sony

3483
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
I appreciate this is really making me

3484
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
warm up to your Playstation

3485
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
platform

3486
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Sony's not having a good PR week

3487
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
they kick so much ass

3488
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
at E3 and god

3489
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
help us with this

3490
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
seriously though the ball is in their core for

3491
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
a lot of shit that's just not fucking

3492
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
working like Microsoft

3493
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
saying hey you know what we would do

3494
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
cross platform multiplayer

3495
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
balls in your court Sony

3496
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
fuck nothing

3497
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
ok and then like

3498
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
then this shit is just

3499
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
oh I'm sorry we promised this

3500
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
for our players you bought the game based

3501
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
on this promise yeah

3502
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
we're just not going to let you do that either

3503
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
they're like so worried that their console is

3504
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
going to get hacked or something or that this game would make

3505
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
you know the game crash or something like that

3506
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
who cares if it makes the game crash it's a mod

3507
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
it may do that put a

3508
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
fucking you know

3509
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
someone might put

3510
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
titties in the game

3511
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
and then there would be titties

3512
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
on your Playstation

3513
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and then somebody calls

3514
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
channel 10 news because the

3515
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
kindergartner at home saw titties

3516
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
oh no they

3517
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
saw titties what

3518
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
god of war is fucking around the corner anyways

3519
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
there's always titties in god of war I mean who cares

3520
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
or there's titties in grand theft auto 4

3521
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
right now or 5 I mean

3522
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
so you know

3523
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
what's the big deal there's titties already on there

3524
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
it's a mature rated game

3525
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
well we're not a mature rated

3526
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
society that's the problem

3527
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
so that's a good retort

3528
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I already have most of my people

3529
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
in my you know settlements

3530
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
without clothing anyways because

3531
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
you can glitch it to do that

3532
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
it's just a thing you do

3533
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
so who cares I just think it's

3534
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
stupid and this right here I'm not

3535
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
buying Skyrim for Playstation 4

3536
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
and if I do get an Xbox 1 I will be

3537
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
buying multi platform games on

3538
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Xbox 1 because apparently they have their shit together

3539
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
where Sony can't fucking

3540
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
even emulate god damn Playstation 1 games

3541
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
yet on their powerful fucking hardware

3542
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
backwards compatibility folks remember that

3543
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
it's stupid it's Playstation now

3544
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
oh we got Playstation now no fuck

3545
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
you I don't want Playstation now

3546
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I want this shit to fucking work because I bought it already

3547
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
well Sony screwed themselves up anyway

3548
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
because they built that Playstation 4 so

3549
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
advanced thinking oh Xbox 1

3550
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
they changed their architecture and they

3551
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
essentially fell for the bluff

3552
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
if you will saying oh well

3553
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Xbox 1 is not going to be able to play backwards compatibility

3554
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
that means we're in the clear now because

3555
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Xbox because Microsoft said no

3556
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
our next system is not going to be able to play 360 games

3557
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
and then Microsoft went on Ninja

3558
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
on Sony and said

3559
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
hey surprise

3560
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
through a nice software update and

3561
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Windows 10 we've just

3562
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
not made a couple hundred games and that just screwed

3563
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Sony up it's sad they're doing backwards compatibility

3564
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
better they're doing multiplayer

3565
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
support better they're

3566
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
supporting you know innovative

3567
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
things on their platform it's just

3568
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
weird that that's happening

3569
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
it's also directly correlated

3570
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
to when they threw one president out and got

3571
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
another one yeah so

3572
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
that's right knock down the 1%

3573
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
fools all right DungeonBuster

3574
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
in chat

3575
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
saying Bethesda

3576
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
pretty much threw Sony under the bus

3577
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
yeah they did hell yeah that was

3578
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
that was air that Bethesda put

3579
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Sony in the special thanks yes

3580
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
they did there

3581
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
were so because they put the

3582
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
effort into it and Sony's like yeah

3583
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
we're not doing it there were a bunch of issues

3584
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
such as mods not having any sound because the

3585
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
PlayStation 4 uses a proprietary sound format

3586
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
that they needed to work around so

3587
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
all

3588
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
right anyhow uh

3589
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
how would you like speaking of Microsoft

3590
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I mean how crazy would it be if suddenly

3591
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
a Nintendo emulator came out

3592
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
for the Xbox one then

3593
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
boy Nintendo or excuse me

3594
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Microsoft even more fans if

3595
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
they were to do that and it looked like

3596
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
for a little bit this week that it might be happening

3597
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
through the emulator

3598
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
nest box actually

3599
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
said on Twitter that their application

3600
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
had passed Microsoft certification

3601
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
process for the

3602
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Xbox and so it looked like

3603
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
the nest box was going to be coming

3604
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
out on the Xbox

3605
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
one but a mere two days later

3606
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
and I can't possibly imagine what happened

3607
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
but a mere two days later all of a

3608
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
sudden not only did this emulator get

3609
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
yanked from

3610
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
even potentially coming to the Xbox one

3611
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
it got yanked from the mobile

3612
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
phone and I think it's on the windows 10 store

3613
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
or it's on one of the windows stores

3614
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
fronts as well which

3615
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
is interesting that okay

3616
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
well we'll put emulators on those storefronts

3617
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
you know nobody's paying

3618
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
attention to windows phone anyway so

3619
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
what the fuck we'll just let emulators on this platform

3620
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
cause literally nobody's watching

3621
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
so

3622
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
but oh no the minute you say

3623
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
you're going to put it on the Xbox now we're

3624
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
going to have a problem that's what actually

3625
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
happened here is that and the

3626
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
reason was apps that are targeted

3627
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
to Xbox one are primarily gaming

3628
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
experiences must be approved

3629
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
through the ID at Xbox program

3630
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
and that was the excuse they used to yank it

3631
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
all which makes sense because the ID at

3632
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Xbox one they only care about

3633
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
the Xbox because do you know how many emulators

3634
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
and roms are on the windows

3635
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
mobile platform I had a windows phone I had no

3636
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
idea do you know I oh my god it was so

3637
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
easy to find super

3638
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
mario world just a super mario world

3639
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
and just play on my windows phone how is that legal

3640
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
no one cared because

3641
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
what because of the because what windows phone

3642
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
it was a windows phone that you know two people none

3643
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
of the seven people were that that were

3644
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
playing it you know that have the phone

3645
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
we're going to be like oh my god microsoft look what's happening

3646
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
oh no so yeah no absolutely

3647
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
not so I'm not yeah so that's the only reason they got

3648
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
called out was because of exactly that

3649
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
it you know they added it to Xbox if it was

3650
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
on the windows 10 the UWP

3651
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
the universal windows platform

3652
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
wouldn't none would have happened none would have

3653
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
happened at all that's just hilarious

3654
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
all right well all this talk of emulators

3655
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
and things in the past makes

3656
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
me think it's time to open

3657
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
the gaming vault with the classic

3658
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000

it's tempest

3711
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
it came out in 1981

3712
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
babies

3713
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
oh then I was three just kidding okay whatever

3714
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
let me feel old

3715
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
it came out by atari

3716
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
and it was designed by

3717
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
some guy named dave

3718
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
and my husband is texting me while

3719
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I am doing the classic game

3720
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
um

3721
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
dave thorough

3722
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
it takes place on this kind

3723
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
of tube thing

3724
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
it is a three dimensional game but it

3725
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
was done in vector

3726
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
the original was

3727
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
and so this surface

3728
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
is sometimes a tube sometimes

3729
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
it's planar

3730
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
but you can basically move

3731
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
this little claw shaped spaceship

3732
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
named blaster

3733
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
um around the play field

3734
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
from segment to segment

3735
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
um it was also

3736
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
one of the first games that used atari's

3737
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
color quadra scan vector

3738
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
display and

3739
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
you also got to choose your starting

3740
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
level and it was called the skill step

3741
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
that atari called it

3742
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
um you also uh

3743
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
could increase your maximum starting level

3744
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
depending on your performance

3745
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
in the previous game so you could keep

3746
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
continuing from there and it was

3747
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
so it was one of the first video games

3748
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
that had progressive level design

3749
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
um as far as the

3750
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
way that the game the object of the game

3751
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
you just basically have to survive as long as

3752
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
possible and score as many points as

3753
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
possible by cleaning off the screen

3754
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
which is harder than it sounds oh my

3755
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
god tempest is a whore

3756
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
because you pay for it

3757
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
you fucking pay for it

3758
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
okay

3759
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
anyway you get

3760
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
who's tempest why are you calling her

3761
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
such horrible things on this program dark

3762
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
sagra tempest is a 50 year old drag

3763
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
queen

3764
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
sorry not sorry

3765
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
um anyway um the players

3766
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
ship uh gets to shoot

3767
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
rapid fire shots down the screen

3768
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
and little enemies are trying to come

3769
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
up that segment that you happen to be

3770
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
on you also get a thing called a

3771
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
super zapper and

3772
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
it destroys all the enemies on the field

3773
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
um enemies will also

3774
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
um have different

3775
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
kinds of behaviors like one of them will leave

3776
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
a spike as they travel up the

3777
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
the little section um

3778
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
and so when you're moving on to the next

3779
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
play field the spike can impale you

3780
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
impale

3781
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
they also can go up to

3782
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
the top of the screen and try to

3783
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
capture your

3784
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
little blaster ship

3785
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
um and then when you

3786
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
destroy all the enemies on the play field

3787
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
you get warped to the next level

3788
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
and so that's pretty much

3789
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
tempest it has 16 screens

3790
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
with different shapes on them

3791
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
some like I said are closed

3792
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
um and some of them are open fields

3793
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
that have you know real end points

3794
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
um

3795
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
and each of them has a different color scheme

3796
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
based on difficulty level

3797
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
including invisible

3798
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
which are for level 65

3799
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
to 80 okay people actually

3800
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
saw level 65 cause I never

3801
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
I knew that there were like red

3802
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
fields but like I never

3803
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
saw anything but blue

3804
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
stage wait I think maybe like one

3805
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
time on a port of this game

3806
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
maybe for like Commodore 64

3807
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I think I saw red which is

3808
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
like the next highest up you see red when I play that

3809
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
game

3810
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
I just like playing this in the arcade

3811
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
cause you have the little nub that you

3812
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
would turn back and forth and you could just spin it

3813
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
it felt like you liked playing

3814
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
with the nub yeah I like playing with the nub

3815
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
once in a while okay the nub like you played with

3816
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
once in a while okay

3817
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
anyway um

3818
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
the game was supposed to be

3819
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
in concept

3820
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
a 3D remake of Space Invaders

3821
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
but it had different

3822
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
problems so

3823
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
really cause it looks nothing like it

3824
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
yeah so the um

3825
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
the creator though said that

3826
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
he got the design from a dream

3827
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
where monsters were crawling out of a hole in the ground

3828
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
so the game started off as

3829
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
aliens to vortex and finally

3830
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
it was Tempest and

3831
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
there were different um

3832
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
uh cases different

3833
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
um cabinets for it

3834
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
um there was the upright one

3835
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
um there was also

3836
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
uh a shorter

3837
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
cabaret style cabinet

3838
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
that um

3839
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
it was a little

3840
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I don't think that they made as many of them

3841
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
and then there was a cocktail style

3842
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
that allowed uh two players

3843
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
to play at opposite ends

3844
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
um but the screen would

3845
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
flip of course vertically for each of

3846
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
the players not that it really mattered in this game

3847
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
yeah

3848
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
if the screen didn't flip oh well

3849
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
except maybe left and right would kinda be

3850
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
screwed up and that that would make your nub

3851
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
turning a lot less fun

3852
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
well Jeff Minter

3853
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
um came later and created two

3854
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
authorized sequels one of them was

3855
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Tempest 2000 which I have done his classic

3856
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
game because it's awesome years ago

3857
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
it was like one of the first classic games like years

3858
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
ago yeah and um it

3859
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
came out for the Atari Jaguar and

3860
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
um the Playstation version was called

3861
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Tempest X3 was there anything else worth

3862
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
owning on the Jaguar

3863
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
what was it

3864
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
besides Tempest 2000 wasn't it

3865
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
like an Astol game no it was like an aliens

3866
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
and predator game or something no I thought that there was

3867
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
another like little 2D platformer that came

3868
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
out on it was it it wasn't Astol

3869
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
it was okay but seriously Tempest 2000

3870
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
was the game was it Ristar maybe maybe

3871
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I don't know okay um

3872
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
and then um there was Tempest 3000

3873
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
uh for the new on DVD players

3874
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
and then um Minter

3875
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
did two more games that were inspired

3876
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
by Tempest Space

3877
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Giraffe in 2007

3878
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
and TXK which came out on the

3879
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Playstation Vita which

3880
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
has been getting a lot of play in my house

3881
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
now that I have a Playstation TV

3882
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
that and Ultra Despair Girls

3883
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
so um

3884
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
it's had different ports it was the Atari

3885
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
2600 and 5200 versions

3886
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
um well

3887
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
those were prototypes I actually do have

3888
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
the 5200 prototype

3889
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
and it's pretty pretty awesome

3890
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
we play it with the trackball

3891
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
um and then

3892
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
um there was an Atari

3893
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Greatest Hits version

3894
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
um there was also

3895
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Superior Software for the BBC Micro

3896
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
and Acorn Electron

3897
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
and one by

3898
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Electric Dreams for the ZX Spectrum

3899
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
and Amstrad CPC

3900
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
there's also been Windows versions

3901
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
and different versions of the Playstation

3902
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Saturn, Super Nintendo

3903
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
all kinds of different versions on it

3904
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
so basically you can find

3905
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Tempest anywhere but play TXK

3906
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
because it's really good and

3907
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Sony was kind of being dickish about

3908
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
um wanting to sue the guy

3909
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
I don't think that was Sony dear

3910
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Not Sony Atari

3911
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
yeah whatever and Tempest

3912
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
was actually featured in a Rush video

3913
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
subdivisions

3914
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
get out that's awesome

3915
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
and as we know Rush is Canada's best export

3916
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
that just made like an awesome game like

3917
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
1.5 times as awesome

3918
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
right? so that's your game

3919
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Tempest play it

3920
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
right now play TXK

3921
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
on all the things TXK

3922
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
there it is your classic game of the week

3923
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Tempest originally in the arcade

3924
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
but ported to

3925
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
everything in the 1980's

3926
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
everything

3927
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
it's very great to have

3928
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Jamie on the show thanks to Radio Magic

3929
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
so we'll see her back next week

3930
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
for whatever next week's classic

3931
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
game of the week might be meanwhile

3932
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
we had a birthday this past week

3933
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
actually just a couple

3934
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
days ago which we just passed

3935
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Nine and Nine which not

3936
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
only was the day for what

3937
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
a new Lady Gaga single

3938
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
and a Bastille album I think came out on that day

3939
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
no way!

3940
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
but it was also Dreamcast day

3941
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Nine Nine 99

3942
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
was the big day the Dreamcast came out

3943
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
in the US anyway

3944
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
so a happy belated birthday to the Dreamcast

3945
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
that would be 17 years ago

3946
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
any Dreamcast memories from you Gabe?

3947
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I feel like we get into

3948
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Dreamcast memories every year around this time

3949
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
but what about you Gabe?

3950
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
I'll be honest I only

3951
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
play the Dreamcast a little bit

3952
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
this is probably

3953
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
not the game people would expect

3954
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
but Soul Calibur

3955
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
when I played Soul Calibur the first time

3956
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
and I heard the orchestrated music

3957
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I fell in love with that I was like oh my god

3958
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
how is this playing such gorgeous

3959
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
because that was N64 I was playing

3960
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Nintendo 64 and I was still so

3961
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
used to music made in MIDI

3962
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
and then to hear

3963
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
fight music being played with

3964
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
actual full CD orchestrated sound

3965
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
I was like what is this?

3966
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I lost my mind

3967
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
and then Virtua Fighter 2

3968
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
or even 3

3969
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
between those two games

3970
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
there was an import game on the Dreamcast

3971
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
that was partially inspired for Kinship

3972
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
but I...

3973
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Border Down is what it's called but it never came to the states

3974
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
it was for the Dreamcast called Border Down

3975
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
thank god if someone has that game

3976
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
for me the big one is going to forever and always be

3977
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Phantasy Star Online that just

3978
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
blew my mind to have that type of experience

3979
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
on consoles

3980
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
we were kind of introduced to

3981
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
the MMO experience a little bit

3982
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
on PC with Ultima Online and so forth

3983
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
but just to have that on

3984
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
which some argue if

3985
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
PSO was really an MMO or not

3986
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
but at the end of the day the point is

3987
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
that it was definitely something

3988
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
a game that you could just

3989
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
drop in at any time with other people

3990
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
and experience together

3991
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
it was so different for the time

3992
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
that's why I had to have a Dreamcast

3993
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
big social experiment and then

3994
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
that game I cannot believe I forgot about

3995
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
that game so yeah

3996
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
my back to the PSO fans but yeah

3997
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
that was a wonderful game

3998
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
for it's time absolutely

3999
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
you know we mentioned the Dreamcast

4000
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000

Google Plus Act Def did mention this week

4008
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
I still own one but I don't know if it

4009
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
still works but I do have fond memories

4010
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
of it and the games it has I

4011
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
remember completing Crazy Taxi

4012
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
haha yeah

4013
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
of course like just a mainstay

4014
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
game the first game I got for it

4015
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
it took me a lot to do it but I managed

4016
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
to I also remember playing

4017
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
lots of fighting games with friends

4018
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
lots of fun yeah wasn't

4019
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Capcom SNK 2 on Dreamcast

4020
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
yes it was so fucking good god what a

4021
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
great game seriously

4022
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
wonderful over on

4023
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Facebook Ragenator

4024
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
I think this says that I never bought a

4025
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Dreamcast something that I regret

4026
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
to this day I do however have the

4027
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Dreamcast collection Nights into

4028
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Dreams Jet Set Radio all that stuff

4029
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
on Steam I wish there

4030
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
was more retro Sega stuff on

4031
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Steam like Mr. Bones and the Panzer

4032
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Dragoon games I've always wanted to play

4033
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
those Hunter R

4034
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
said I went through two different Dreamcast

4035
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
consoles after dropping my original

4036
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Ray console thereby ruining the DVD

4037
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
drive on the console I got the black

4038
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Sega Sports edition of the Dreamcast

4039
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
remember they used to make

4040
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
there was a Hello Kitty Dreamcast at one point

4041
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
oh don't tell that to Brianna

4042
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Bri there's a Hello Kitty Dreamcast

4043
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
out there it's probably on eBay

4044
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
go quick

4045
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
oh she's all about that

4046
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
no it was awesome I remember I saw that

4047
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
in like Japantown in LA once or something

4048
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
and I was like it's cute

4049
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
did that whole thing

4050
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
it was awesome

4051
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
long nights playing

4052
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Power Stone that was Loki's game right

4053
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Power Stone yeah Power Stone is pretty awesome

4054
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
man I wish that's something that would come back

4055
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater

4056
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
of course

4057
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
good memories it's just

4058
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
it's hard to kind of pinpoint

4059
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
like you know we have all these fond

4060
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
memories of the Dreamcast yet it sure doesn't seem like

4061
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
it lasted very long you know it did not and it's

4062
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
unfortunate because I think that was a

4063
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
console way ahead of itself yeah and

4064
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
and what I think it fell

4065
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
it just it fell during this

4066
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
massive transition because it came

4067
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
out

4068
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
because it was in between like the N64 and the

4069
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
PS2 at that point I think

4070
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
when the PS2 was coming out and

4071
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
and yeah and because of the

4072
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
impact the first Playstation

4073
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
made on everybody yeah I think it was

4074
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
too little too late for Sega which is very very

4075
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
unfortunate Bob C in our chat

4076
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
says Tekken was never on Dreamcast

4077
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
but didn't they have that tricky like was it

4078
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
okay speaking of like software yeah there's Blingcast

4079
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
right where you could you actually

4080
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
did put Tekken it was this weird thing and

4081
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
like you know we were joking about the Windows phone and the emulators

4082
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
earlier but it's like a lot of that stuff was going on

4083
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
on Dreamcast with the Blingcast

4084
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
and then like one reason I got a Dreamcast

4085
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
when it was only like 40 bucks I mean obviously

4086
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
there was PSO and all that stuff you could just like

4087
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
burn a disc with a Nintendo emulator on Dreamcast

4088
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
and it worked for the most part

4089
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
that's so weird that a Dreamcast

4090
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
is capable of playing Playstation

4091
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
1 games oh but a Playstation

4092
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
4 alright I'm sorry here we go

yeah you right about

4099
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
yeah you mentioned yeah not Tekken

4100
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
but yeah that's why I said Soul Calibur nevermind

02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000

4116
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
you're gonna have to wait until 2018

4117
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
to play it what a fucking shock

4118
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I'm gonna die from that surprise

4119
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
and I backed the game I did I did too

4120
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I backed a huge I was a huge backer

4121
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
well it looks like it would be Mighty No. 10

4122
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
alright you know what you know what

4123
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I've demo already plays

4124
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
better than Mighty No. 9 I'm just half kidding

4125
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
if it's good

4126
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
let it simmer oh definitely

4127
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
let it cook take your time

4128
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
make sure there's an internal temperature of 160

4129
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
degrees or higher

4130
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
it's safe to consume based it well

4131
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I'm fine we're waiting a little longer

4132
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
it's fine definitely

4133
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Oculus had this

4134
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
animated 3D like viewing

4135
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
experience called Henry

4136
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
and they won

4137
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
they won an Emmy for it

4138
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
no kidding

4139
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
so that's pretty awesome

4140
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
best original interactive

4141
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
program

4142
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
nice congratulations

4143
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
breaking news do you know who else won an Emmy today

4144
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
RuPaul won the

4145
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Emmy for best reality TV show

4146
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
host that's fantastic work

4147
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
so excited

4148
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
cover girl

4149
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
now the question is did Stranger Things

4150
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
win any Emmys

4151
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I don't think it was nominated because I think it's too

4152
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
early I think it came out too

4153
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
after the like cut off or whatever

4154
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I think it'll be next year when it's eligible

4155
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
yeah so how about

4156
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
it could get Globes though I suppose

4157
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
how about Kimmy Schmidt

4158
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
I don't know if it was nominated I feel like Titus

4159
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
had to get nominated again I think so yeah

4160
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
but I don't know

4161
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
I don't follow the Emmys that closely you know why

4162
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
cause I do a show on Sunday nights

4163
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
that keeps me from watching all that other crap

4164
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
rock on fight the machine

4165
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
alright moving on

4166
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
to other rapid fire stories

4167
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Brie pay attention it's Hello Kitty

4168
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Hello Kitty is coming to

4169
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Animal Crossing New Leaf what

4170
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
yeah that's right

4171
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Hello Kitty well

4172
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
simmer your expectations

4173
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
in Japan anyway

4174
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
so the Hello Kitty characters will

4175
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
be on themed items that are coming to the game

4176
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
there's furniture that's gonna be

4177
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
unlocked using Sanrio amiibo

4178
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
cards going on sale

4179
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
in Japan November 3rd

4180
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I kinda have to fucking have them like I just do

4181
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
yeah she doesn't need a reason not

4182
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
she doesn't need a reason to go to Japan

4183
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I just that's gonna be a reason for her to go back to Japan

4184
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
okay now she's gonna go to Japan to get some

4185
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
fucking cards that's pretty that's hard

4186
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
more hardcore than me that's her homeland anyway

4187
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I just bat my

4188
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
eyelashes if my dear friend Akuma

4189
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
will help me out or I think I think Amazon Japan

4190
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
did that thing a while ago where now they will

4191
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
ship over here directly

4192
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Japan and China

4193
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
you know you don't have to worry about that as much

4194
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
anymore

4195
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
anyway there was a

4196
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I guess Animal Crossing Nintendo

4197
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Direct that has a little bit more on this so that's

4198
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
pretty cool

4199
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
also

4200
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
PlayStation 4 Arcade

4201
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Archives is growing you know these games

4202
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
don't get featured a lot but essentially

4203
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
arcade ports of classic

4204
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
games such as Gradius 2

4205
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I think was one I did a live stream of not that

4206
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
long ago you know there's actually a

4207
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
growing library of really kinda like

4208
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
under the I mean cause none

4209
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
of the games out I can think of off the top of my head

4210
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
anywhere like huge releases but

4211
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
a lot of like really kinda like under the radar

4212
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
stuff well some of these

4213
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
releases are gonna get pretty big because

4214
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
one of the games that's actually coming out for

4215
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
PlayStation 4 very soon I guess

4216
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Bubble Bobble's coming out soon if it's not already

4217
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
oh I used to love that game

4218
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
yes that's that's

4219
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
that might already be out

4220
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
and I missed it I have to go back and look

4221
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
The Legend of Kage was

4222
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
in that list as well but this is huge

4223
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Haunted Castle

4224
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
is coming now you

4225
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
might not know that from the name

4226
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
that is the arcade version of Castlevania

4227
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
so

4228
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
when you see Haunted Castle on

4229
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
PlayStation 4 that's fucking Castlevania

4230
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
on the PlayStation 4

4231
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
that's gonna be pretty awesome that's also

4232
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
gonna join some other releases

4233
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Thunder Cross, Terra Force,

4234
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Ark Area, Mutant Knight

4235
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
you know again not a bunch of like

4236
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
you know huge titles in name

4237
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
so could we possibly get

4238
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
like a Silent Hill game called like

4239
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Misty Spooky Town or something like that

4240
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
you know it's

4241
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
basically like the arcade version of

4242
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Silent Hill

4243
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com asks

4244
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I love Bubble Bobble but do we really

4245
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
spawn on PlayStation 4? As long

4246
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
as the boss will spawn on level 30?

4247
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Yes. Oh snap

4248
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
That was a long time ago on the end

4249
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I feel like I need one of those flowcharts

4250
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Do we need

4251
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Do we need Bubble Bobble on this

4252
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
console? Next thing

4253
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Does the boss spawn on level 30?

4254
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
No. If the answer is no

4255
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
No we don't. Yes

4256
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Of course we do

4257
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
I need a Lego one of those levels

4258
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Alright let's

4259
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
travel around the world and check out some

4260
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
release dates of some games coming out in a country

4261
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
near you starting with the US

4262
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Alright so we're getting a little bit busier

4263
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
So we've got Bioshock Collection coming out this week

4264
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One

4265
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Remember PC? You don't have to really buy it

4266
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
if you already own it so it's all good

4267
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
free upgrade

4268
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Dead Rising coming out on

4269
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

4270
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
that's the remastered version of that

4271
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
also coming out as well, PlayStation 4

4272
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
and Xbox One and the Dead Rising

4273
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Triple Pack coming out on PlayStation 4

4274
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
and Xbox One which makes me wonder why

4275
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
isn't the

4276
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Dead Rising off the record

4277
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
not by itself?

4278
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I thought that was the second one that was in there

4279
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
No, off the record was the

4280
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
it was the expansion of 2

4281
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Right, that's what

4282
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
It wasn't a standalone though

4283
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Off the record was the alternate

4284
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Dead Rising 2 where you play

4285
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
instead of

4286
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
It was an alternate? I thought it was an expansion

4287
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
No, it was an alternate because Dead Rising 2

4288
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
you played a different dude

4289
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Right, but off the record

4290
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
showed what happened to Frank

4291
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
after part one

4292
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
No, because the whole premise was like, here's how I would have done it

4293
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
and that's basically the game

4294
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Interesting, okay

4295
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
But yeah, those will be coming out this week

mandatory happiness

4319
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
I feel like there should be an episode of OLR

4320
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
where Loki has to

4321
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
it's mandatory happiness for Loki

4322
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
and we're just gonna throw fuckin' everything at him

every Apple story I've got, every Nintendo story I've got

4324
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
and he has to be positive

4325
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
we have to call it Happy Loki

4326
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
he has to say something nice

4327
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
for 15 minutes

4328
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I'm gonna do it when his kid's here

4329
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I can do it for the whole show

4330
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
yeah, we can speak to him

4331
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
we need to do that

4332
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
okay, anyways

4333
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
they're all yelling at me in chat to do it on episode 666

4334
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
that would be evil

4335
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
and then, let's see

4336
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
we've got ReCore coming out this week

4337
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000

Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor

4351
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000

02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000

and finally, that's it

4358
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
I want that fucking Dragon Quest game too

4359
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
and I kinda want Persona

4360
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
oh my god, it's a busy week

4361
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
alright, let's go over to Japan

4362
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
it's a busy week there too in Japan

4363
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
the Bioshock Collection makes its way to Japan

4364
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
the new PlayStation 4

4365
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
little Slim version is out in Japan

4366
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
this week on the 15th as well

4367
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
and Persona 5 in a regular

4368
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
20th anniversary edition and accessories set

4369
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
all of that hits Japan as well on the 15th

4370
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
so yeah, very busy

4371
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
week in Japan, World Soccer winning 11

4372
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
as well in Japan this week

4373
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
so it looks like Japan kinda mirrors us a little bit this week

4374
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
on the PlayStation 4

4375
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
sadly, the only release on the Wii U this week

4376
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
is Terraria, but you know things on the Wii U

4377
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
are kinda dying down a little bit

4378
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
on the PlayStation Vita

4379
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
which basic question, they haven't gotten Terraria yet?

4380
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
not in a retail release

4381
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
that whole thing, yeah

4382
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
PlayStation Vita

4383
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
taken over there with Hightaka no Psychedelica

4384
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
comes out in a limited edition in Japan this week

4385
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
and Yunohana Spring, Cherishing Time

4386
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
also out in Japan this week

4387
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
lastly on the 3DS this week

4388
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
there's a brand new 2DS

4389
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
in both Lavender and Pink

4390
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
and Red and Blue

4391
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
there's lots of new 2DS colors out this week

4392
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
but you can also get a price reduction

4393
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
on Zelda no Densetsu

4394
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Toki no Ocarina 3D

4395
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
which of course is the Ocarina of Time 3D

4396
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
in Japan with a price reduction there

4397
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
and

4398
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Cho Sentochu Kyokyu no Shinobu

4399
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
to battle player Choju Kesenn

4400
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
comes out this week

4401
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Battle for Money

4402
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
is what that translates to

4403
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
loosely there

4404
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
so that is out on the 3DS this week

4405
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
so that's what's in Japan

4406
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
with Dark Soccer being absent

4407
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
from the show for a little while

4408
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Loki's gonna step in and

4409
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
take a trip over to Europe for us

4410
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
with the UK dates

4411
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I guess I will

4412
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I guess I will if you're making me

4413
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
so in the UK

4414
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
let's see what we got coming out

4415
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
XCOM 2

4416
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
on Playstation 4 and

4417
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000

4418
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Police Tactics Empyro

4419
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
on PC

4420
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
and let's see

4421
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
that was the 7th so that was last week

4422
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
this week ReCore on

4423
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
PC and Xbox One

4424
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Pro Evolution also coming out over there

4425
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
as well on Xbox 360

4426
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Playstation 3, Playstation 4

4427
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Xbox One and PC

4428
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Bioshock the collection

4429
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
on PC, Playstation 4

4430
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
and Xbox One

4431
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
and that's it

4432
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Now the chatters

4433
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
are actually saying, there's a couple of people in chat saying this

4434
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
that Persona 5 is actually not

4435
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
out here in the

4436
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
states this week Loki, your list may be wrong

4437
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
because apparently it's out in Japan

4438
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
this week, that part was correct but it was actually

4439
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
delayed for the rest of the world until

4440
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
February, several people saying that in chat

4441
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
are you telling me that Wikipedia is incorrect?

4442
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
I don't believe you

4443
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
because even I'm looking at another Wikipedia

4444
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
page that says that it's

4445
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
out worldwide on Valentine's Day

4446
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
it will be out multiple weeks if it has to

4447
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
ok?

4448
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
and listen, I am like a weatherman

4449
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I'm telling you what the weather is going to be like

4450
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
and then it will be like something it decides

4451
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
you know what, it probably still made your list

4452
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
because there's that many people that are planning on

4453
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
recording it this week over on this side

4454
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
honestly, but

4455
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
just want to clarify that

4456
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
it will be out in a secret location that you have no access to

4457
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
it's still coming out though

4458
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
that list is 100%

4459
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
accurate

4460
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
let's get to our emails

4461
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
every week you guys email us

4462
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

4463
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
and we read some of our favorite

4464
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
emails here on the show and respond

4465
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
to them if appropriate

4466
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
is this appropriate?

4467
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
for these emails?

4468
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
or do you not know yet?

4469
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
yes, well I've just given them the

4470
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
once over

4471
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
meaning I open them up to make sure they didn't say

4472
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
fuck you, you fucking fuck

4473
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
but that could have been from Loki though

4474
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
or I had to make sure

4475
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
it wasn't something that said buy Viagra

4476
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
cheap

4477
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
we need to talk about that

4478
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Viagra has a sponsor, FOLR

4479
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
no!

4480
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
hi

4481
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
but we do have some fabulous emails from listeners

4482
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
this week starting with Andy R

4483
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
who starts us off this week saying

4484
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I'm sure you're already sick of talking about it this

4485
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
late in the podcast but after replying to the

4486
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Facebook post I was musing more about the

4487
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
PlayStation 4 Pro and felt like

4488
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
emailing with some more thoughts

4489
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
mainly because I was watching a video gamer

4490
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Eurogamer put up

4491
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
a video that Eurogamer put up about the event

4492
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
one guy talking had been to the event and the

4493
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
other, like most of us, only saw what was streamed

4494
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
the guy who only saw the stream was very much

4495
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
in line with the internet consensus, namely

4496
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
the I don't see the point or I don't see a huge

4497
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
change sentiment that is going around

4498
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
interestingly though, the guy

4499
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
who had been at the event seemed fairly impressed

4500
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
with what Sony had managed to coax out of a

4501
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
$400 box

4502
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
which got me to thinking, this reminds me a lot

4503
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
of VR, in general it seems like the

4504
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
people I talk to about VR tend to fall into

4505
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
two camps, ones who have tried it and

4506
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
think it is cool or ones that haven't tried it

4507
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
and don't see what the hubble is about

4508
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
in the case of PS4 Pro, watching

4509
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
footage of a 4K HDR game on

4510
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
a stream probably doesn't do

4511
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
justice, much like not having

4512
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
actually tried a VR headset

4513
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I know I personally streamed the PS4

4514
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
P meeting to on my phone

4515
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
over a cell signal which clearly

4516
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
wouldn't hold a candle to the kind of TVs the

4517
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Pro is designed for, like VR

4518
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Sony has probably got an uphill

4519
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
battle convincing people that this is the thing

4520
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
they need, especially since this one

4521
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
requires not only the box itself

4522
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
but a TV capable of really taking

4523
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
advantage of the box, maybe they're banking

4524
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
on people who don't have the TV yet

4525
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
future proofing and just going for the Pro

4526
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
anyway, at least we've seen the

4527
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
PlayStation 4's will fly off the shelves at

4528
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
$399 in the past, so getting it to that price

4529
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
point was a smart move, anyway

4530
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
just a few thoughts for the conversation, this

4531
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
holiday is going to be pretty interesting I imagine

4532
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
that email again from Andiar

4533
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
that is a very good point

4534
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
I really like the comparison

4535
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
about that VR

4536
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
can be a hard sell until you've tried it

4537
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
so considering that very few

4538
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
of us probably watched the PlayStation

4539
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Pro thing on a

4540
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
4K TV, maybe

4541
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
we are not really seeing the message

4542
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
whereas the people that were there

4543
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
well I'm sure Sony had 4K projection

4544
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
in that room taken care of, so people

4545
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
were very happy with what they saw I'm sure

4546
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
so very interesting perspective

4547
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
although that being said

4548
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
that fantastic

4549
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
demo that they had of

4550
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Horizon Zero Dawn

4551
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
or whatever that is

4552
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
looked awesome

4553
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Shadow of the Colossus

4554
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
awesome, it did look awesome

4555
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
so this tells me that Sony now needs to

4556
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
get PlayStation 4 Pros

4557
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
running on 4K TVs in every Best Buy

4558
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
around the nation, because that's really the best way

4559
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
all I need to hear is, hey Grand Theft Auto 5

4560
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
is going to be one of those supported

4561
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
higher resolution games

4562
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
would that really do it for you?

4563
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
what about The Last of Us

4564
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I haven't played The Last of Us

4565
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
because they're doing it with The Last of Us, they're adding

4566
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
4K textures for The Last of Us

4567
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
because why not

4568
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
see for me, but Mass Effect, you know

4569
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
that's kind of my version of Loki's Grand Theft Auto

4570
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
you know, that, seeing that

4571
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
as part of it does kind of make me go

4572
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
maybe I do need a Pro, maybe I do need

4573
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
to future proof, but maybe I am

4574
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
a little worried that by the time I get a 4K TV

4575
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Sony will have another console

4576
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
in three years, that's where I'm starting

4577
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
to worry, that sounds like it, because if

4578
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
it's a ten year cycle is what it's supposed to be

4579
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
you've already, we're not even

4580
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
halfway there and you're giving me a new console

4581
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
you're giving me an upgraded console, so

4582
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5

4583
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
uh huh

4584
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
so how much Grand Theft Auto 5 have you?

4585
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
to be fair, not a lot, it's one of those

4586
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
things that I think about playing it and then

4587
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
ooh, shiny, I get distracted by something else

4588
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
you know how it goes, I do

4589
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
alright, one more email this week

4590
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
from Dark Tetsuya, who says

4591
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
hey OLR, I thought I'd write you guys about a neat

4592
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
new indie film that came out while you guys

4593
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
were on break, it's called The Outrunners

4594
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
so basically the plot is our hero

4595
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Eli was visiting the arcade with his friend

4596
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
one day and got to talking to a girl

4597
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
but the resident bully and his gang caught wind of it

4598
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
and challenged him to a high stakes race in

4599
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Sega's The Outrunners, winner stays

4600
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
loser leaves the arcade for good

4601
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
it's a pretty neat film if you enjoy

4602
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
classic arcades and the racing games

4603
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
they had back in the 90's, because this sounds

4604
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
like a plot out of the 90's to be quite honest

4605
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
but um, there's

4606
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
even some subtle nods to anime like

4607
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Initial D, like they actually

4608
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
used some of the music in the end racing scenes

4609
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
and Eli's car is the same car that

4610
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
the star of the Initial D drives

4611
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
the director told me on Facebook that

4612
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Initial D was one of his favorite anime

4613
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
the film is available for free on YouTube

4614
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
and be sure to check them out on Facebook as well

4615
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
the gaming blogs haven't really said

4616
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
a lot about this, but I thought if I sent you guys

4617
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
an email, I could get more people to check

4618
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
this out, uh, you're right

4619
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
the dozens and dozens of people that listen to OLR

4620
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
will hopefully check this out

4621
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
so thank you for the heads up there

4622
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
that is again called The Outrunners

4623
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
well hey, I like old Sega 90 game

4624
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
let me ask this, since it is an ode to

4625
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
90's racing game classics

4626
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
will we get to hear in this movie the

4627
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

4628
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
like is that what plays

4629
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
as the 20th Century Fox logo

4630
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
comes, well I guess not, because it's not a 20th Century Fox movie

4631
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
but you know, that's what you expect

4632
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
right?

4633
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Daytona

4634
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
hell yeah, heck yeah

4635
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
anyway, that would be a fantastic

4636
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
game for the remake

4637
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
seriously

4638
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
hell yeah

4639
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
alright, there it is, your emails

4640
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4641
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
if you want to send us an email

4642
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
for consideration in a future week

4643
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
alright, remake Daytona

4644
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
they did on the 360

4645
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
and it was gorgeous

4646
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
it wasn't remade

4647
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
because 4k is where it's at

4648
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
720p

4649
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
special thanks

4650
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
it was no, those are just the HD versions

4651
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
of like the Dreamcast games

4652
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
or whatever they had, or Saturn games

4653
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
no, but they like redid that from the ground up

4654
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
and they added a couple new things too

4655
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
it was great game, if you want the HD

4656
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
remake, play the 360 version

4657
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
it was good, that's the best I can give you

4658
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I can't give you much else, so can't please you

4659
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
clearly, so it's all good

4660
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
alright, s2100matt posting a link there

4661
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
in our chatroom by the way

4662
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
some folks I'm sure will be watching that

4663
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
after the show

4664
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
or is Loki trying to watch it during the show

4665
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I thought that's what Gabe was

4666
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
peering over and looking out of there

4667
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
no, I'm looking in the chatroom, someone said

4668
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
would a new EDF in 4k

4669
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
there would be no frame rate

4670
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
those games are so horribly optimized

4671
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
it would just be like

4672
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
it's just like nothing, in fact

4673
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
at the very least, Playstation 4 Pro

4674
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
would maybe bring it up to like

4675
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
20 frames per second, I mean

4676
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
the 4.1

4677
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
it was way better than

4678
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
the PS3 version

4679
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
because the PS3 version in 2025

4680
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
was terrible, so that had frame

4681
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
rate issues from the 20

4682
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I like 2025 part

4683
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
of the way, it's just

4684
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
I don't know, it's not

4685
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
the same

4686
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
it was its own thing I guess

4687
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
but it was nice to have the co-op

4688
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
and stuff, I just haven't played co-op

4689
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
alright, let's get back into some other

4690
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
gaming news, Loki, that's fine

4691
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
we're such nerds

4692
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
anyways, so

4693
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
speaking of

4694
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
every

4695
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Playstation 4, this is kind of

4696
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
a neat little thing to throw in there

4697
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
you don't have to buy a new system to get

4698
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
that wonderful HDR, so be able

4699
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
to support the wider range

4700
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
of color and everything

4701
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
the pictures will kind of pop more

4702
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
that's coming in a free update

4703
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
if you already have a Playstation 4, you can enjoy

4704
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
that right away, assuming

4705
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
they have a TV new enough to actually take advantage

4706
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
of that, which I don't

4707
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
again, we face

4708
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
this technical

4709
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
issue, and I almost begin to

4710
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
wonder if

4711
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
that's the mentality

4712
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
with these bigger game companies

4713
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
honestly though, it's been a long time since I had a

4714
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
TV, I got this TV, actually thankfully

4715
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
it was a promo thing from Sony

4716
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
ironically enough, it's a Sony

4717
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
HDTV, but they gave that

4718
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
to all of the employees

4719
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
of the company I worked for, and so I had a nice

4720
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
new HDTV from that, and at the time it was

4721
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
cutting edge, but

4722
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
now it's pretty old

4723
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
so I mean, I could use a new

4724
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
TV, it's just

4725
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
you're justifying buying a new one

4726
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
my concern is again,

4727
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
is a

4728
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
new console no longer enough

4729
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
do we have to have

4730
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
you gotta have a very powerful TV

4731
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
and here's what we can provide too, because

4732
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
now you're costing me

4733
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
not just four or five hundred dollars

4734
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
to enjoy a new gaming experience

4735
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
now I gotta pay a grand

4736
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
essentially, you know

4737
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
and on top of that, like why should I be dropping

4738
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
money on a new TV and a new

4739
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
system and VR and all this stuff

4740
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
for Sony, when

4741
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
you know, they can't even get

4742
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
like mod support working and stuff

4743
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
something that was promised to people like a long time ago

4744
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
well that's ultimately my point, because

4745
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
invest in a PC instead, I mean

4746
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
well even the original PS4 was supposed to do

4747
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
4K, and

4748
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
that just

4749
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
disappeared into the

4750
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
nothing. The menus are 4K

4751
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
That's it. Right?

4752
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
And again, that's a whole other thing

4753
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
I appreciate the fact that these newer consoles

4754
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
and I said this earlier, okay fine

4755
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
you're gonna be able to display

4756
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
show off 4K and things like that

4757
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
but I can't wait to see how few

4758
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
developers actually utilize that

4759
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
that's gonna be the best part, so anyway

4760
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
I digress

4761
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
So, I mean

4762
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
if my TV doesn't really support

4763
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
this thing, then this patch does nothing for me

4764
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
or will I get to see some subtle differences

4765
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
or what? No. Brighter blues

4766
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
brighter blues and reds

4767
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
that's about it. Because I bought my, like my TV

4768
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
is pretty fucking nice I think, it's a

4769
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
2014 model apparently

4770
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
and so it doesn't have this. Maybe it supports it.

4771
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
I looked on the Amazon thing, because I actually went back

4772
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
and looked at the TV I bought on Amazon

4773
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
which, just an interesting

4774
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
side story, I was gonna buy the TV

4775
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
at Sears, and it was on the display

4776
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
for it and everything, and then they told me, like, we don't have it

4777
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
like, they didn't

4778
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
they wanted me to go to another Sears

4779
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
on the other end of town, and I was like

4780
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
okay, I'll head over there now. I'm sorry, but the TV you're looking for

4781
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
is at another Sears. Yeah, it's in another castle

4782
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
right? So I just

4783
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I came home and I bought it on Amazon, like

4784
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
anybody else would have done it

4785
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Why are department stores dying?

4786
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Or just go to Best Buy and have them

4787
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
price match Amazon. Uh, yeah

4788
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I guess I could have done it, but anyway, it doesn't matter, because I got a fucking TV

4789
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
like two years ago, no, last year

4790
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
and it's a two year old model, but apparently, yeah, it doesn't do

4791
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
but it does do 3D

4792
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Blu-rays and all that stuff

4793
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Oh, goody goody. I have, like, two movies

4794
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
I can watch in 3D

4795
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Tron's one of them, so

4796
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Do you have the glasses for it? I do, but

4797
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
fuck if they ever seem to work

4798
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
I tried to use them on the ongoing, I was like

4799
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
these don't even really work

4800
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
And that's what I mean right there

4801
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
like, that's what I mean, you know, the other thing

4802
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
that made me push so hard on 3D

4803
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Yeah, right? Look how well that worked out

4804
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Boy oh boy

4805
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Anyhow, um, well I still

4806
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
you know, I'm excited for the update to see if

4807
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
it'll do anything for me, but

4808
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
God, again, my TV is not that old

4809
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
and it doesn't support any of this

4810
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Well, the 4K support ends are pretty nice, I mean, just even watching the little demos

4811
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
walking through Best Buy and stuff like that, it's like

4812
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
damn, that's a nice clear picture

4813
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
but it's just like, damn, is that gonna be the

4814
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
same nice clear picture when I stream it through Netflix

4815
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
on this crappy boxy they have? Nope

4816
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
I'm gonna need like, you know, a nicer

4817
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
new platform to be able to stream in 4K

4818
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
and a nicer new internet provider

4819
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
that's gonna be able to handle that

4820
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
bandwidth, but not Comcast

4821
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Alright, well another big birthday

4822
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
that happened this week was the 50th anniversary

4823
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
of Star Trek

4824
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
and how appropriate that just this past week

4825
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Star Trek Online

4826
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
has come out for consoles

4827
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Star Trek Online

4828
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
what, came out, what is it

4829
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
like January 2012

4830
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
when free to play, I think it had actually been out

4831
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
as a pay game maybe a year or two before that

4832
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
and then it was free to play in 2012

4833
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
well now it is out on PlayStation 4

4834
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
and Xbox One

4835
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
so it took a little while for it to come out

4836
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
but what a good way to get an older

4837
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
MMO some new attention

4838
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
than by being right there for download

4839
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
on the consoles

4840
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
DC Universe Online

4841
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
kind of did this same type of thing a while ago

4842
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
as well, so anyhow

4843
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Star Trek Online is now available

4844
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
and I think the audience over there

4845
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
seems to be growing a little bit, probably

4846
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
these console releases are helping

4847
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
so now might be a good time to check that out

4848
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
so, what's cool is that they actually have some of the

4849
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
cast from the movies, it's like voice over

4850
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
oh really, oh that's awesome

4851
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
that's pretty cool, I wanna say

4852
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
I may be wrong, I don't wanna step out of line

4853
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
but I wanna say they were able to get Leonard Nimoy

4854
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
in the game before he had passed

4855
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
well cause again this game's been out

4856
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
since 2010, so I wanna say

4857
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
he was in it, and they had at one point

4858
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Zachary Kinto was in it too

4859
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
because he was Spock

4860
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
in the new movies, I think he was in the game when it

4861
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
first came out as well, so

4862
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
uh yeah, Kaijuto in chat says did they

4863
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
make the game better cause on PC

4864
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
it blows, and Fifth Dream confirms yes

4865
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Nimoy is in the intro in the first five

4866
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
minutes, so that's pretty cool

4867
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
it might be worth checking out all on its own

4868
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
I'm curious if uh

4869
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
any of our friends from Starboard Power Coupling

4870
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
uh check that out on consoles cause I know some

4871
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
of them play Star Trek Online, I don't know if they

4872
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
went and checked it out on consoles though

4873
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
so uh let's move on, Loki

4874
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
so uh this is kinda cool

4875
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
there was a slight tease or a positive

4876
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
leaked tease that Earth Defense

4877
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Force 5 might be a thing

4878
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
um apparently this was coming

4879
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
from um a count, they had a countdown

4880
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
teaser actually on

4881
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
the D3 publisher site, and I wanna say that this

4882
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
also leaked out from like another publication

4883
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
that it was out there

4884
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
um so

4885
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
yeah, it'd be

4886
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
interesting to check it out

4887
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
the moon

4888
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
hell yeah, EDF 5 baby

4889
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
oh boy

4890
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
you gonna pick this one up when it comes to Earth?

4891
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
of course you are

4892
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
alright it sounds like you and Gabe will have

4893
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
something to play together cause Gabe's definitely

4894
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
a fan as well

4895
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
nothing, that game

4896
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
just warms my soul

4897
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
so much destruction

4898
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
so goddamn hard

4899
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
alright we are gonna open up the

4900
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
pipeline to you guys, Orange Lounge Radio

4901
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
all one word on Skype, if you wanna give us a call

4902
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
and talk about anything that we've talked about

4903
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
tonight, maybe you wanna ask Gabe a question

4904
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
or uh anything else that might

4905
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
be on your mind, you can go ahead and give us a call

4906
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

4907
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
um while we wait for some calls to come in

4908
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
um Gabe let me ask you about this

4909
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
uh locally with Sacramento

4910
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
and development and all that, I know we had talked about

4911
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
earlier in the show, we mentioned that Sacramento

4912
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
can be seen by those in other areas

4913
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
it's kinda like, you know

4914
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
not as lucrative of an area

4915
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
or whatever, which seems a little silly to me

4916
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
cause it seems like, you know, we're growing a little bit

4917
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
with our, even our triple A game development

4918
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
right, which um, you know

4919
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
I forget what they were called back in the day, what, Click Play

4920
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
or Click and Play or something, Click Nation

4921
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
that's it, they grew into now Capital Games

4922
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
EA Capital Games, which

4923
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
uh I believe based on one of the trailers

4924
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
they showed recently, they're doing work with the

4925
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Star Wars mobile development, right, yes they are

4926
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
yes they are, so that's pretty cool, do we know of any

4927
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
other like big big studios that are establishing

4928
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
a presence here locally? Um, I know

4929
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
so on the indie side

4930
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
um, on the indie side you've got Skirmish

4931
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
who just recently got a little office

4932
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
uh, so I think somewhere

4933
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
in Rancho or Sacramento, something like that

4934
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
I wanna, yeah, somewhere nearby for here

4935
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
I think, um, I know the other big one

4936
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Fifth Planet Games, they're up in Rockland

4937
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
they were in Roseville, they moved up

4938
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
to Rockland, um, they've uh

4939
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
they've trimmed down a little bit on the size

4940
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
of their studio, but they're

4941
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
still a pretty significant size studio, Fifth Planet

4942
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Games, and big shout out to

4943
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Rob, um, you know, Rob Winkler

4944
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
he was one of our speakers for the

4945
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
first indie arcade, um, but yeah

4946
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Fifth Planet is definitely one of the other

4947
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
well known studios

4948
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
so with their, um, oh my goodness

4949
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
I can't even think of their freaking game name right now

4950
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
but yeah, you can find them on Newgrounds and so on and so forth

4951
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
but, yeah, so there's a few

4952
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
but we definitely need

4953
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
more, I wish we connected with EA

4954
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
because, you know,

4955
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
that would have been great to establish

4956
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
something with them more, but we'll see

4957
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
alright, we'll see, well in the meantime let's get

4958
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
to the phones because they are ringing, hi you're on Orange

4959
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Launch Radio, who's this?

4960
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Hey what's up guys, this is Kaijuto

4961
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
Hey Kaijuto, what's on your mind buddy?

4962
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
I got some game recommendations for you

4963
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
First off, I just want to say that

4964
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
I've been playing the

4965
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Rumble, what is it, Rumble in

4966
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
the Rocket League

4967
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
that thing is great, I don't know if you guys tried that

4968
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
I haven't, I've heard about, God, the

4969
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Rocket League, they have really done a great job

4970
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Just continuing moving that game forward

4971
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
ever since its original release, I need to check

4972
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
that out

4973
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
There is some trouble in paradise with that game

4974
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
because now the fans

4975
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
are pissed off because they decided to go

4976
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
with the whole

4977
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
you got unlockables, but you have a

4978
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
crate that you have to open and you have to buy

4979
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
keys to open that crate

4980
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Oh, pissed off

4981
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
because they're claiming that they need the money

4982
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
because they want to make it into an esport

4983
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
but fans are not buying that

4984
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
They're like pissed off

4985
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
There's some real Rocket League hate going on right now

4986
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
A lot of fans got that free

4987
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
from Playstation Plus

4988
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
but then again, Playstation Plus not really free

4989
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
so, alright

4990
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Nothing ever is

4991
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
My game recommendations

4992
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
going to the Star Trek, the 50th

4993
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
anniversary thing

4994
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
I found this game, I think it just came out a couple

4995
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
of days ago, it's called

4996
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Halcyon 6

4997
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
and that game

4998
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
is so much fun, it's fantastic

4999
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
You got to think of

5000
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
that game that came out for the

5001
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
tablet, Trexels

5002
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
remember that game?

5003
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
It was like a

5004
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
remake of some other game, Pixels

5005
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
or some crap

5006
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Think of that game as

5007
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Trexels, but a lot better, it has a story

5008
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
there's humor in there

5009
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
there's base building, if you're the type of person

5010
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
you're all into that base building that they did

5011
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
with XCOM and that type of stuff

5012
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
they have that in there, they have away missions

5013
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
you can send your away team out there to have

5014
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
battles, for all you Final Fantasy

5015
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
fans, it has the whole

5016
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
type of turn-based system that

5017
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Final Fantasy kind of invented

5018
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
where you have your three party

5019
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
members and then you fight either

5020
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
three monsters or two monsters

5021
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
they have that in there, it's all turn-based

5022
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
it's a lot of fun, it's 2D, it's not

5023
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
3D, but

5024
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
there aren't any type of platforming

5025
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
that type of crap, you don't have to run and jump on

5026
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
stuff, you're basically

5027
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
trying to battle

5028
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Is it space sci-fi, which is why you're tying this to

5029
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Star Trek?

5030
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
No, it's basically a Star Trek, because you have

5031
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
your science officer, you have your captain

5032
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
your communications officer, they have the

5033
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
different colored suits

5034
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
you have spaceships that you're flying

5035
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
it's Star Trek

5036
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Alright, I gotcha

5037
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
that's a good recommendation

5038
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
This is on Steam by the way

5039
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
and the second game is a matter of murder

5040
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
which I think is like

5041
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
$2.99, really affordable game

5042
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
and if you love the game Clue

5043
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
you're gonna love this game because

5044
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
it's basically Clue

5045
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
it has endless replayability because

5046
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
every time you play you can generate a new

5047
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
mystery, and it plays

5048
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
just like Clue, they have the mansion

5049
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
you gotta investigate, you gotta find

5050
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
the weapon, find the suspect, find the motive

5051
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
and then when you think you have

5052
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
all that together

5053
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
then you go into the accusation phase and then you have

5054
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
all the characters, they all come together in one room

5055
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
and then you have to

5056
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
retell what happened, like who committed

5057
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
the murder and why and all that stuff and if you got it

5058
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
right, then you get rewarded for it

5059
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
it's a really fun game, it has some

5060
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
really shitty art

5061
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
but it makes it funny

5062
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
it looks like a three year old

5063
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
kid drew the game, but that's part of the trauma

5064
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
I love it

5065
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
and the thing with the body

5066
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
it's hilarious because they don't show

5067
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
the entire body, you just see

5068
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
the feet

5069
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
the tasteful dead person

5070
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
just the legs sticking out from under the carpet

5071
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
yeah, yeah

5072
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
and the game makes fun of itself because when you do the

5073
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
tutorial

5074
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
I guess it's the maid or something

5075
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
she's like, what are you freaking out about?

5076
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
it's just a body, that seems to happen a lot in this place

5077
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
right away

5078
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
you're gonna be solving multiple murders

5079
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
just people being killed in that house

5080
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
so it doesn't have the board game element still

5081
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
where you roll a die to move around

5082
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
there's no dice

5083
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
it's almost like a point and click

5084
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
you're clicking the characters

5085
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
you're talking to them

5086
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
but the writing is done so well

5087
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
that you actually get involved

5088
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
they'll tell you stuff

5089
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
if you ask a guy a question

5090
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
he's nervously stroking his moustache

5091
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
to give you little hints that he may be lying

5092
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
it's a really cool deductive game

5093
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
because what I found out is when I played the game

5094
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
I was doing the tutorial

5095
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
and the guy was like

5096
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
I was in the pool room with so and so

5097
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
we were playing pool, so I went to the pool room

5098
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
and there was a guy in there and he confirmed

5099
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
his story that his alibi was legit

5100
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
because they were both playing pool

5101
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
but then you speak to another guy

5102
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
and that person's like, yeah, I was playing pool too

5103
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
and I'm like, no, you weren't playing

5104
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
it was just these two guys in there

5105
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
so that's how I knew that they were the murderer

5106
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
just cool stuff like that

5107
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
alright, so Matter of Murder

5108
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
I gotta check that out on Steam, so three bucks

5109
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
alright, very cool

5110
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
thanks, the one thing I'm ready to buy

5111
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
alright, Kaishudo, thanks for the call

5112
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
alright, later

5113
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
have a good one, bye

5114
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
alright

5115
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
we have the phones ringing, so let's get to another call

5116
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio, who's this?

5117
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
hey guys, it's Jason

5118
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
what up?

5119
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
I am currently barreling down the east side of the Rockies

5120
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
which is why your voice was missed

5121
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
from the intro this evening

5122
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
as you're in your car, zooming down a mountain

5123
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
that is responsibly

5124
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
responsibly, I am answering both hands around the wheel

5125
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
I promise, alright, fair enough, fair enough

5126
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
what's on your mind?

5127
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
even if my car is magical enough that I technically don't have to

5128
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I still do have both hands on the wheel

5129
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
you guys have brought up a couple of cons

5130
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
con things and VR things

5131
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
and so I just kind of wanted to chime in with my two cents

5132
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
of the last couple of weeks

5133
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
while you were down at Dragon Con

5134
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
I was quite literally in the opposite end of the US

5135
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
at PAX West

5136
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
oh yes, the other thing that happened over Labor Day

5137
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
how was it?

5138
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
the other four days of madness

5139
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
this was my first West

5140
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
as many of you know, it's been called Prime

5141
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
up until this year and now they're calling it West

5142
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
for consistency

5143
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
between East, West and South

5144
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
my first West, my second PAX

5145
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
I went to PAX South at the start of this year

5146
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
it was definitely a lot more hectic

5147
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
but at the same time

5148
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
a lot bigger

5149
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
a lot more events

5150
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
still very social

5151
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
largely to do with the fact of the

5152
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
more and more people I'm meeting

5153
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
in various communities

5154
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Twitch spearheaded or not, but a number of those people

5155
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
are also involved with the games

5156
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
with the larger gaming community

5157
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
business wise

5158
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
so it just kind of steamrolls from there

5159
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
the show floor

5160
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
itself was nice and big

5161
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
very tiring

5162
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
everybody had their space

5163
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
you see all the

5164
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Twitch and their mammoth

5165
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
streaming center and partner center

5166
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Intel, Blizzard

5167
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
even

5168
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
Tiny Build had a

5169
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
shockingly good presence

5170
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
considering their up and up over the last couple of years

5171
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
but a lot of familiar faces

5172
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
but still a bunch of hidden gems

5173
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
and the Indie Mega Booth

5174
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Mega Box I think it technically is

5175
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
and then various other locations

5176
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
tying specifically to the show

5177
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
there were two things that you guys have touched on

5178
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
that I wanted to bring up

5179
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
I don't know exactly who

5180
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
the individuals are, but with the story

5181
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
about Interplay going under

5182
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
and selling off IPs

5183
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
the founding members

5184
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
the founding creators

5185
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
of Descent have already moved on

5186
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
from Interplay and they were

5187
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
exhibiting their own game called

5188
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Overload in VR

5189
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
at PAX West

5190
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
I don't think it was ever really covered on the show

5191
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
before, but they had a Kickstarter as

5192
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
one does, they're still offering pre-orders

5193
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
that count towards stretch goals

5194
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
but they have very

5195
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
significant plans

5196
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
a very great Vive

5197
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
backed demonstration of

5198
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
what Overload is

5199
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
going to do and it is

5200
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
six degrees of freedom

5201
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
multiplayer, robot

5202
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
zero gravity

5203
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
dogfighting

5204
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
I unfortunately didn't really feel like queuing up

5205
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
in the line, but watching it was

5206
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
absolutely spectacular

5207
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
and I absolutely am looking forward to another

5208
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Descent game as well

5209
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
yeah, you're not the first one to say that logically

5210
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
those guys should be the ones that

5211
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
try to bid for that Descent

5212
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
IP, whether they have the money to do so or not

5213
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
we'll see, but

5214
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
yeah, it would make a lot of sense

5215
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
that they should probably try to make a play for it

5216
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
that would be quite a stretch goal

5217
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
fund our

5218
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
IP acquisition attempt

5219
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
well, you never know

5220
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
there might be a magical publisher out there

5221
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
who's willing to marry the two together

5222
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
like will front the money

5223
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
for this if

5224
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
that would be

5225
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
one of the better

5226
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
stories, like one of the most

5227
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
monumental stories that I've heard in the last

5228
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
jeez, decade I guess, I don't know

5229
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
if you guys

5230
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
want to look up more information, media

5231
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
and all that stuff, playoverload.com

5232
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
plenty

5233
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
plenty of media there to go up, screenshots

5234
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
screenshots, a little bit of gameplay video

5235
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
demonstration of what it does in and out

5236
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
of VR and then the common

5237
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
game's gonna have multiplayer and

5238
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
epic robot battles

5239
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
and huge boss battles, etc.

5240
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
VR

5241
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
more generally

5242
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
I, prior to PAX West

5243
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
I had only ever used

5244
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Oculus Dead Kit 1

5245
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
I never, I didn't queue up at

5246
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
E3 for

5247
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
VR, I haven't seen HoloLens

5248
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
and I haven't

5249
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
bumped anybody nearby to see

5250
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
their Vive or anything of the sort

5251
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
up on the sixth floor, which is

5252
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
where a lot of

5253
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
indie, both publishers

5254
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
and developers were exhibiting

5255
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
there was a little corner for

5256
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
University of Washington, UW I think

5257
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
it was, their game development

5258
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
program, I got

5259
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
talking to a couple of people because they just had

5260
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
a free throw

5261
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
a three point shootout simulator game

5262
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
and that was my first experience

5263
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
using the Vive and it was

5264
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
it was

5265
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Loki was talking earlier about how

5266
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
everything with a big name attached to

5267
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
is an experience and so it's

5268
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
kind of less interesting

5269
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
but this game, like I said

5270
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
free throw or three point shootout

5271
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
I'm not quite sure where on the line it was

5272
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
but it was a basketball simulator running

5273
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Vive called Nothing But Net

5274
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
or Nothing But Net

5275
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
and

5276
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
it was, I

5277
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
hadn't actually really paid attention to the

5278
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
controllers yet, but to extend those

5279
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
as your hands and use it for

5280
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
just simple

5281
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
ball grabbing, basketball

5282
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
grabbing, not that other

5283
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
kind, basketball grabbing

5284
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
oh my

5285
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
basketball

5286
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
grabbing, flick and release and

5287
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
the world that they created

5288
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
which was just like a high school

5289
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
gym, fairly nondescript

5290
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
but it still felt very good to be in it

5291
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
it was a very limited

5292
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
demo, you just had

5293
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
60 or 90 seconds to

5294
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
shoot

5295
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
to make shots

5296
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
and

5297
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
but it was fun, it was cute

5298
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
it reminded me

5299
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
both of you

5300
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
possibly all three of you have talked about

5301
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
video game renaissance and

5302
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
I have played basketball in real life

5303
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
I played for a season in elementary

5304
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
school

5305
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
basketball has obviously

5306
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
been a part of American media forever

5307
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
and I played some basketball

5308
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
games on and off, it's never been my primary sport

5309
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
but it was still fun

5310
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
when talking

5311
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
to the developers of this Nothing But Net game

5312
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
I was talking to them about

5313
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
this very, very basic

5314
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
arcadey

5315
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
three point shootout game for DOS

5316
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
called Three Point Shootout

5317
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
and to see

5318
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
the progression of gaming all

5319
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
over again to take

5320
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
basic concepts to introduce

5321
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
developers, players and everybody else

5322
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
to how these

5323
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
things actually work out in 3D and finally

5324
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
being able to put

5325
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
full body motion

5326
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
into this kind of thing

5327
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
it really tickled me in a really

5328
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
really happy way and that was

5329
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
definitely one of my

5330
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
underrated gems of the show

5331
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
that I just enjoyed

5332
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
I just kind of hovered around listening to

5333
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
conversations, I had a great conversation with

5334
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
the husband and wife

5335
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
development pair

5336
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
talked about some of their plans

5337
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
what they could do, gave them reference

5338
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
to prior art and plenty of things

5339
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
the demo was

5340
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
just a single round of shots, they talked about

5341
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
a lot of other things like horse

5342
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
and multiplayer and

5343
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
MMO-esque simulation

5344
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
because it is a gem with multiple hoops and maybe

5345
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
maybe even going on into

5346
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
like a two on two NBA Jam style

5347
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
thing maybe

5348
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
but it was fun, it was simple

5349
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
it was conventional and it hit all of

5350
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
the spots to be able to take

5351
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
a basic

5352
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
concept and apply it into the VR

5353
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
world in such a

5354
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
simple but

5355
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
excellent way

5356
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
so it sounds like you had a pretty

5357
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
successful PAX West

5358
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
it's no longer PAX Prime

5359
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
I heard that's

5360
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
because PAX East is the real PAX Prime at

5361
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
this point but I won't go there

5362
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
how were the panels, did you go any panels

5363
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
any of that stuff? I did zero

5364
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
panels, I was

5365
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
incredibly line averse so

5366
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
the guide book was

5367
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
a map reference for me and I

5368
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
just didn't pay attention to any of the panels

5369
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
which is a little weird

5370
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
for me I guess, sort of, but I don't know

5371
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
I was there for the people

5372
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
I was there for the people and friends first

5373
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
that I don't get to see in person nearly enough

5374
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
and in between

5375
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
that I made my own adventure across

5376
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
the show floor

5377
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
very quickly I guess one of my

5378
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
other underrated ones that I haven't even

5379
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
been thinking about, talking about

5380
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
for some stupid reason

5381
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
if anybody knows the

5382
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
old Neo Geo game

5383
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Windjammers, one of the

5384
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
multi game, multi game arcade machines

5385
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
we saw in

5386
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
mini golf and bowling alleys and all those

5387
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
kinds of things, that game is

5388
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
coming back to PC and

5389
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
PS4 in the form

5390
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
of a disc jam by people who

5391
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
also grew up with the game and loved it

5392
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
and are turning it into

5393
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
a little

5394
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
steep down

5395
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
pong that I break up a little bit

5396
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
yeah you're breaking up a little bit but you're back now

5397
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
that sounds

5398
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
disc jam

5399
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
already in some gamers hands

5400
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
PC and PS4

5401
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
Windjammers-esque with an updated

5402
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
look and feel and

5403
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
that was quite a treat to be able

5404
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
to talk to other fans that

5405
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
finally did something with the game and moved into it

5406
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
and yeah

5407
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
alright, very cool, alright well sounds like you had a

5408
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
good time, TwitchCon are you doing that

5409
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
in a few weeks, isn't that the same weekend

5410
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
as GamerX right I heard?

5411
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
it is the last, it's like September 30th

5412
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
into the start of October

5413
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
same weekend as

5414
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
GamerX, that's some unfortunate timing

5415
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
I

5416
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
am

5417
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
I should be doing TwitchCon, I am

5418
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
tentatively doing it, I'm

5419
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
actually, I wasn't supposed to be heading home

5420
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
I was supposed to still be along

5421
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
the Pacific Coast, quite possibly in the

5422
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
studio

5423
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
next weekend, but I had

5424
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
a little home incident occur

5425
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
so that's why I am currently barreling down

5426
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
the east side of the Rockies

5427
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
I hope everything's okay, so

5428
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
alright, well I'm gonna go ahead and let you go, okay?

5429
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Sounds good, have a good night!

5430
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Alright, thanks for calling, take care

5431
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
Alright,

5432
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype

5433
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
Looking quickly, some chat comments

5434
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
Kajuda says, OMG, Twitch has a con too?

5435
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
What do they all do, meet up on

5436
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
Skype and stream? No, I

5437
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
went last year, actually because of Jason

5438
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
Jason was like, I have an extra ticket, are you

5439
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
sure you don't want to go? Because in San Francisco

5440
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
it would be very easy for you to go, so I was like

5441
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
sure I'll go, I thought it was interesting

5442
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
I actually, I left a little

5443
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
more motivated to do more streaming, which

5444
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
has been hit and miss, some weeks

5445
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
I'm able to do a bunch, I probably haven't done

5446
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
one in a month, just because, you know, I

5447
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
am doing four podcasts on

5448
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
and off, so it's kind of like a lot of my creative energy

5449
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
time goes into that, so

5450
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
alright, let's try to sneak in at least one more quick call here

5451
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
before we call it a night, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

5452
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
Hey, this is Akdeft

5453
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
Hi Akdeft, how are you?

5454
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
Really great, really great

5455
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
What's on your mind?

5456
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
Well, anyways, I want to talk about

5457
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
the Super Mario

5458
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
Run announcement

5459
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
What do you think?

5460
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
Well, basically, it's

5461
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
not something that

5462
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
necessarily

5463
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
is

5464
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
well, I had the idea

5465
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
in my head, and

5466
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
I kind of

5467
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
missed my train of thought

5468
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
but basically

5469
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
what they're trying to do, or I think

5470
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
what they're trying to do is basically

5471
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
like, cross-promotion

5472
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
of some sort

5473
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
because they're not

5474
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
and this is something I was talking

5475
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
with other friends

5476
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
they're not offering the full game

5477
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
right now, it's

5478
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
even if you see like

5479
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
Super Mario Run as a full game

5480
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
it kind of isn't because

5481
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
it isn't like the full Super Mario

5482
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
experience

5483
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
and we can see it like

5484
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
in stuff like Super Mario Maker or

5485
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
New Super Mario Bros

5486
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
and all that stuff

5487
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
but something that was curious

5488
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
and this relates also to

5489
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Pokémon GO

5490
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
that the 3DS sales

5491
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
went up

5492
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
I think for July, and I don't think

5493
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
for August, I don't know

5494
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
but many people

5495
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
pre-ordered in expectation

5496
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
of Pokémon Sun and Moon

5497
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
so I'm

5498
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
trying to guess

5499
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
here that basically they

5500
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
did this

5501
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
maybe because they want part of the

5502
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
mobile market, maybe that's something

5503
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
like

5504
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
secondary

5505
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
but I think

5506
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
they're trying to like

5507
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
promote their own stuff through

5508
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
other media

5509
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
I don't know if that makes sense

5510
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
You know, that's something that I

5511
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
this is Gabriel, good to meet you man

5512
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
this is

5513
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
something that I was mentioning

5514
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
earlier with my little

5515
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
speculation

5516
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
about the NX

5517
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
and me getting the

5518
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
impression that

5519
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
that's what I think Nintendo's trying to do

5520
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
I think them releasing

5521
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
this Mario game

5522
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
on iOS is a hint

5523
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
of what's coming for NX

5524
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
to an extent, that's just my impression

5525
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
of it, so I

5526
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
I really just need them to fucking reveal the

5527
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
NX already, get this fucking time

5528
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
Tokyo Game Show is in two

5529
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
weeks, I'm sick of the speculation

5530
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
all this wank

5531
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
you know I love that word

5532
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
all this Twitter wank

5533
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
granted, we've been no help either

5534
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
we have the wank and the tinfoil hats on this show

5535
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
as well, I'm fucking sick of it

5536
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
it's after labor day

5537
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
no more white shoes

5538
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
and a goddamn NX announcement

5539
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
let's do it

5540
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Hey Act, can I ask

5541
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
that's just

5542
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
by the word of Rob

5543
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
can I ask you something really quick because you mentioned

5544
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
something that I found

5545
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
very intriguing

5546
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
as a

5547
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
mobile, you play games on mobile

5548
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
I take it

5549
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
right? Yeah. Okay. Do you

5550
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
feel that

5551
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
as a mobile gamer

5552
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
the price

5553
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
that you pay

5554
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
do you feel it's fair to say that

5555
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
one should still expect

5556
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
the full game experience

5557
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
on mobile

5558
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
or should it really just be

5559
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
are you really just paying for something

5560
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
that's going to be a quick

5561
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
time consuming thing and then we move on

5562
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
I mean do you fully expect

5563
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
do you fully expect the full

5564
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
video game experience on a mobile, should you

5565
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
expect that on a mobile phone?

5566
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
I think we

5567
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
should expect something like that

5568
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
it's not

5569
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
it's not necessarily like

5570
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
exclusive to a console

5571
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
or in this case to a mobile game

5572
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
but I think

5573
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
my point is

5574
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
because we have seen runners

5575
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
in consoles

5576
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
we have the bit trip

5577
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
runner series

5578
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
like for example

5579
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
maybe even Rayman

5580
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
I don't consider it a runner

5581
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
but they do have mobile

5582
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
versions that pretty much are runners

5583
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
right

5584
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
but my point was

5585
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
you don't get the full

5586
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
experience

5587
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
as in you only go

5588
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
right instead of going

5589
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
left to

5590
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
you don't have full control over Mario

5591
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
in this case

5592
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
where in a console

5593
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
in even a portable version

5594
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
of Mario you have full control

5595
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
of what you can

5596
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
what Mario does

5597
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
in the game

5598
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
so I

5599
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
I don't see like

5600
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
Super Mario Run like a bad thing

5601
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
at all

5602
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
it seems interesting enough

5603
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
but yeah

5604
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
I don't think Nintendo is

5605
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
putting all the

5606
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
all their money into the mobile market

5607
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
at least just yet

5608
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
and at one point it's exactly

5609
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
the next part

5610
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
or point of this

5611
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
yeah there's got to be a correlation

5612
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
somehow and there was a comment in the chat

5613
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
that I just seen when they

5614
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
I didn't see who it was that mentioned

5615
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
was the NX going to be running Android

5616
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
hardware they were going to be using

5617
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
a processor

5618
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
chip that

5619
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
can that fuels Android

5620
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
but not necessarily

5621
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
that doesn't necessarily mean you know it's going to be

5622
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
an Android based thing it's just a processor

5623
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
I can't remember what it was called

5624
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
similar parts but not necessarily how they function

5625
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
right like a Tegra or something like that

5626
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
it's like a Tegra processor

5627
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
but for me I think

5628
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
this is a way for Nintendo to be making money

5629
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
this holiday season when

5630
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
the Wii U is not going to be expected to

5631
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
really do anything I think this is something

5632
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
Nintendo is under a lot of pressure to do

5633
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
and I think again that's why you see them

5634
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
coming up with all these other creative ways to make money

5635
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
this holiday to keep their investors

5636
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
happy is oh we have the classic NES

5637
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
which we know stands to do well oh we have the

5638
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
Pokemon Go bracelet oh we have

5639
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
you know the mobile venture

5640
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
you know we're going to put our biggest thing

5641
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
on mobile so maybe this is why

5642
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
they bumped Mario up to this year

5643
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
was to kind of show that they're

5644
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
going to still be productive through this holiday

5645
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
so maybe even if the

5646
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
NX tanks which you know

5647
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
I don't want to see that happen I don't think

5648
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
any gaming fan would want that

5649
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
although I just want to know what the fuck it is already

5650
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
I think

5651
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
you know Nintendo can show that they as a company

5652
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
could still stay afloat no matter what

5653
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
definitely so anyway

5654
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,000
I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show

5655
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
but thanks for the call and for the insight

5656
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
hey thanks for having me

5657
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
alright that's going to do it for the

5658
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
skype line tonight but if you didn't get through tonight

5659
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
do consider sending us an email for a future week

5660
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

5661
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
alright

5662
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
now before we wrap up the show

5663
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
and say our good nights we have to make sure

5664
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
that we get any residual angst

5665
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
out of our system so that we can successfully

5666
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
start a new week

5667
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
nice and fresh and on a clean

5668
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
slate so we empty

5669
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
and reset our pallets with a segment we call

5670
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
here the FUs of the week

5671
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000

music

5673
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
music

5674
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
music

5675
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
music

5676
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
music

5677
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
music

5678
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,000
low key your FUs of the week

5679
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
I don't know I just have to be

5680
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
myself for being 10 seconds

5681
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
too early

5682
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
music

5683
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,000
there's so many jokes

5684
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
I can make with that but I'm

5685
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
going to be a nice person

5686
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
and not make them

5687
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
alright

5688
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
10 seconds too early is not a bad thing

5689
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
well

5690
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
depends on the end goal

5691
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
but yes

5692
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
Gabe do you have any FUs you need to get out of your system

5693
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000

no not necessarily I let it out

5696
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
I pretty much let it out earlier

5697
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
yeah enough I can't really

5698
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
think of anything right now so just you know

5699
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000

5743
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
that's what I get for getting a fucking

5744
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
salad meat and potatoes all

5745
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
the way meat and potatoes for life you know what

5746
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
I'm just gonna be fat and not have

5747
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
food poisoning that's how it's gonna be

5748
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
here on out

5749
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
alright well that brings us

5750
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
to the end of another episode of Orange on Trader

5751
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
actually quickly I should check in with Loki for any

5752
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
last minute stories I forgot to do that earlier

5753
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
there's a remastering

5754
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
of Duke Nukem 3D it's coming out

5755
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
Duke Nukem World Tour it's gonna have also new levels

5756
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
awesome

5757
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
Duke Nukem

5758
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
I mean it would be what

5759
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
the fourth time I bought a reimagining

5760
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
of Duke Nukem but oh well

5761
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
you can't really remaster the game too much

5762
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
I mean it's

5763
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
clearly they can't make a new one so

5764
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
might as well keep doing what works

5765
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
alright

5766
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
well that is going to

5767
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
bring us to the end of another episode of Orange

5768
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000

5878
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
Loki my friend that's it we made it

5879
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,000
to the end of an episode here it's not

5880
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,000
longer episode but a good one uh any

5881
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:19,000
final thoughts for our listeners tonight I'm just tired

5882
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
now yeah I'm depressed

5883
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,000
tired of eBay it'll be okay

5884
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,000
well happy birthday though you know what we have some

5885
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
awesome some listeners were saying we should you know what we

5886
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,000
should all put 25 bucks in and help

5887
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,000
Loki get the damn DDR machine that's

5888
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:33,000
not the thing that's why it was such a disappointment

5889
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:35,000
because those those cabinets and granted

5890
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:37,000
it was slightly broken I would have needed to

5891
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:39,000
you know fix up some stuff but that's

5892
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,000
fine I mean like a new cabinet

5893
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:43,000
goes for over a thousand dollars it's

5894
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:45,000
like yeah that's why it stings so bad

5895
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:47,000
because it's it's like that's

5896
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:49,000
actually more cost effective to do it that way

5897
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:51,000
than it would have been to build pads

5898
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
I got build pads but now you're reminding

5899
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
me like oh you know if I you know now

5900
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
that I'm not upgrading my phone this year

5901
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
now that it looks like I'm probably not going to get the PlayStation

5902
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
4 Pro and I may not even get the VR

5903
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:03,000
at this point we'll see I'm kind of on the fence with that

5904
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
maybe this is the year Rob's finally

5905
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:07,000
going to get his cocktail cabinet because I really I really

5906
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:09,000
kind of want one I was gonna say you practically have the

5907
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:11,000
money for that for a cocktail cabinet now

5908
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:13,000
if you don't get those two things yeah I know you've got the

5909
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,000
money for that now only only if

5910
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
get it on Amazon you can pre-order it and then

5911
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,000
part of me is like you should save that money to

5912
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:21,000
do responsible things like home buying

5913
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,000
oh come on who needs adulthood we need

5914
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:25,000
cocktail tables come on man

5915
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
priorities exactly what future you got

5916
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:29,000
a bar top that I built oh

5917
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,000
well there you go you're halfway there man I know I

5918
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
know all right

5919
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
my final thought tonight I

5920
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:37,000
I can't think of an awful lot I'm just gonna say

5921
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
I'm gonna I'm gonna try to play

5922
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,000
more Overwatch which will make Alan very

5923
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
happy because Alan plays a fucking ton of

5924
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:45,000
Overwatch I think it's like all he

5925
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,000
ever he plays that and then I'll see him play No Man's

5926
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,000
Sky a little bit and he's back to playing Overwatch

5927
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
he plays a lot of fucking Overwatch and he has like

5928
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
like bro friends he made playing

5929
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
Overwatch and everything that he

5930
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:57,000
gets on there and he bro chats

5931
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:59,000
about how you know there's a reaper back

5932
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
behind the thing I just I'm like wow he's

5933
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
like really really good and when I

5934
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
play with him I'm fucking terrible so

5935
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:07,000
I need to up a game

5936
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
on Overwatch so I might be working on

5937
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
that this week or I might play

5938
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 to keep Loki happy

5939
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,000
and after all it is his birthday

5940
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,000
yes I hope you

5941
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:19,000
had a good birthday all things considered

5942
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:21,000
Loki indeed if not maybe maybe

5943
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,000
this week will be good too

5944
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,000
I have to go back to the call center

5945
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:27,000
in a few weeks so that's not making me too happy

5946
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:29,000
well enjoy the few weeks that you know you don't have to

5947
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
be there so it's like here's how

5948
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
frustrating it is yes we would love

5949
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:35,000
to hire you for this department

5950
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
but because of some corporate

5951
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:39,000
tree bullshit we've got

5952
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:41,000
to not hire people even though

5953
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:43,000
we desperately need people because some higher

5954
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:45,000
up person thinks it's a good

5955
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,000
idea not to spend money of course

5956
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:49,000
unlike corporate

5957
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,000
America which is also what your wife

5958
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:53,000
says it's a good idea not to spend money right

5959
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:55,000
and she says that about everything

5960
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:57,000
we can have like billions of dollars

5961
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:59,000
like don't spend any of it it's like

5962
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:01,000
I'm not I'm not gonna do that

5963
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
alright alright

5964
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,000
