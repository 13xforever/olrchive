14000	20000	Tonight, Blizzard is set to retire a name that's almost synonymous with online gaming. Could the Wii U soon be leaving retail?
20000	27000	Also, we're joined live by musician Aethernaut, answering your questions right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 659 for this September the 25th of 2016.
44000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.
48000	54000	And joining me, as always, here in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
54000	58000	With those of you live at the Voice Geeks Network, say hello here in studio to Tech Master Loki.
58000	59000	Hello.
59000	60000	Hi Loki, how are you?
60000	61000	I'm fine.
61000	65000	Eating pizza, right? Getting the fuel needed to get through a show.
65000	66000	Exactly.
66000	67000	Is that one of your super bacon pizzas?
67000	69000	It is my triple bacon pizzas.
69000	71000	I haven't seen you bring one of those to the show.
71000	76000	No, I didn't. They were very confused on the phone when I asked them, like, I want a triple bacon pizza.
76000	79000	They're like, we don't have a triple bacon pizza. We have a triple pepperoni pizza.
79000	80000	I'm like, no.
80000	82000	I want you to put bacon on it three times.
83000	85000	Three times the amount of bacon on the pizza.
85000	91000	And they had to like kind of like mentally process that for a second there and like, okay, we can do it.
91000	93000	I was going to say, this shouldn't be that complicated.
93000	98000	I've seen that meme out there that's the, what is it, a nun pizza with left beef.
98000	105000	Have you seen that meme out there where people call and they get the pizza and it's like no cheese, no sauce.
105000	108000	Because like, you know, when you order pizza online, you can fill out and check everything.
109000	113000	So people order, it's like no cheese, no pizza or no sauce, no anything.
113000	118000	So it's like, it's just the dough and it's nun pizza. And then they'll put beef on half of it.
118000	122000	So it's a nun pizza with left beef and the pictures you get are just, I know, right?
122000	125000	Like you're laughing because it's like so stupid. It's funny.
125000	128000	Like a lot of internet memes are so stupid. They're funny.
128000	131000	So, you know, there's, there's that one.
131000	136000	So I just, it's funny that I'm sure these pizza places get tons of crazy, crazy orders.
137000	141000	This is like nothing. We used to get like weird, like quadruple sausage pizzas and stuff.
141000	143000	And sausage is a little bit different with bacon.
143000	146000	Bacon is basically just bacon bits and then they cook them longer.
146000	150000	So it's, I don't know, crispier bacon bits, I guess.
150000	154000	But like the sausage is actually like raw sausage.
154000	162000	And so you basically have a nice half inch thick layer of sausage just smothered over the pizza when you get it at that point.
162000	168000	Because you're not having little sausage meatballs anymore. It's just, it's one layer of sausage at that point.
168000	172000	I see. I see. Not joining us this week, of course, Dark Sakura.
172000	176000	Just a reminder, she's out for a couple of months due to some work conflict.
176000	180000	But we will hear from her later in the show, thanks to the magic of radio.
180000	185000	But I do want to introduce, of course, our ever present chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
185000	188000	where we do tape our shows Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,
188000	195000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show where Alan Alchemy is actually posting pictures of the non-pizza with left beef.
195000	198000	Just in case y'all didn't hear about that meme, there it is.
198000	205000	So you get the full experience when you listen live and get the links on demand for some of the things we're talking about here in studio.
205000	209000	So I had a really interesting day. I got to tell you about this, Loki. I think you'd get a kick out of this.
209000	216000	And this is one of those things where my friend that I did this with asked me, please don't talk about this, don't tweet about it.
216000	220000	I don't want you telling other people about this and associating me with it.
220000	225000	So, of course, I'm going to open my show with it and talk about it here because it involves Shane.
225000	232000	So this is the deal. So I guess he had gone to his stylist.
232000	235000	I'm going to be in so much trouble for this, but this isn't a bad thing at all, actually.
235000	245000	This is a great story. I guess he had gone to a stylist or something and the stylist, I guess he was having hand pain or hand issues or something like that.
245000	250000	So the stylist actually recommended to him, like, you should go get a manicure.
250000	256000	You should go get the manicure because they will, you know, give the massage your hand and you'll feel a lot better afterwards.
256000	263000	So, you know, he wanted to go make an appointment to get the manicure pedicure type of thing, but didn't want to do it himself.
263000	268000	So me being the good friend that I am, even though I kind of dragged my feet about it too, I'm like, why am I paying?
268000	270000	For me, it was like, why am I paying money to do this?
270000	279000	But so we went and actually, I have to say, although it was kind of weird that there were like 40 women in that place and just us,
279000	283000	A, I've never been one to really give a crap about gender norms.
283000	292000	B, I actually thought like, wow, they did a really good job cleaning my nasty ass nails and they've never looked so consistent.
292000	299000	No, I didn't get them painted or anything like that. They asked if I wanted color, but I kind of left black nail polish in my goth phase that I went through my early 20s.
299000	313000	So, you know, I didn't get that done, but I did have the full thing and I was like, okay, this is, this is pretty, it's kind of like, it's kind of like when you go to the dentist and you get the deep teeth cleaning.
313000	322000	I needed a deep nail cleaning because, you know, sometimes weird stuff goes on with your nails. So I thought it was, I thought it was all right.
322000	324000	Have you ever had a manicure pedicure, Logie?
324000	325000	No.
326000	334000	It's actually kind of, they have the whole chair that massages you. And then after they, I mean, after they do all that, they like full on massage your hand, massage your legs.
334000	341000	And I was like, all right, I can, okay, I can kind of go with this. The only complaint I had was it was like, it was so much sensation going on at once.
341000	349000	Like I got one girl that's working on my hand, one girl that's working on my leg, the massage chair is going off and I'm just like, okay, wow, this is, this is like, this is overload.
349000	357000	This is almost like too much stimulation going on here, but yeah, I survived. And now I feel like my legs are good enough. I could go play DDR again.
357000	371000	So there you go. Let's see. Alan Alchemy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, professional athletes get pedicures every week, soccer, baseball, or otherwise.
371000	381000	Yeah. It's a, it's not something that's, I mean, I know it's something that society kind of looks at as a very feminine thing and you know, but what, what is that stuff anymore?
381000	395000	And I just, you know, I thought it was, I'm like, I don't know if I do it every day or every week or even every month, but it's kind of one of those things where like, all right, maybe every six months I would, you know, especially if my nails start to look a little like creepy on my toes,
395000	402000	I might be like, all right, well maybe I should just get this professionally treated. I'm going to treat myself to a foot massage. So there it is.
402000	403000	Treat yo self.
403000	411000	Treat yo self. Exactly. That's, that's what it was for me. So there you go. And yes, that does have to do with video games because these are the hands that hold controllers.
411000	419000	These are the feet that play DDR. So yes, darn it. This does have to do with gaming, but I suppose we should get into a real kickoff topic, shouldn't we?
419000	435000	Let's talk about, uh, let's talk about a story about another retro game making its return to the arcades. And this is something kind of similar to what we've seen happen with, I think Pac-Man, what we saw happen, I think recently with Galaga.
435000	442000	And that is old school video games coming back as Ticket Redemption games.
442000	444000	Oh, that's awesome.
444000	456000	And there's another one about to come out. It's Breakout, you know, Breakout. It's like, kind of like souped up pong. Arachnoid was probably the most well known kind of clone, I guess you could say.
456000	457000	Arachnoid.
457000	471000	Arachnoid. Why did I say Arachnoid? Suddenly, suddenly it's a game that involves spiders. Arachnoid was the game that, uh, uh, you know, was kind of like a, I don't want to say a clone of this because it kind of just, it kind of took the format and moved it a little bit more forward.
471000	482000	But, uh, Breakout was kind of the original that was on the 2600 and it was an arcade game. So Breakout is coming back to arcades and it's coming back from a company called Coastal Amusements as the manufacturer.
482000	490000	And, uh, they are making this and it has a spinner controller just like the old arcade game. It's obviously very colorful with the colored bricks.
490000	499000	Uh, kind of like what you used to see on the Atari 2600. But this time, it will give you tickets as a reward for when you win.
499000	513000	Now, when they were questioned about this, they did mention to say, or they did say, Breakout is ticket redemption only at this time. The operator can turn off the ticket dispenser, but this will not deactivate the ticket scoring options in the game.
513000	524000	This may come at a later time. So, in other words, you could see it as a arcade game that doesn't spit tickets, but the game is still telling you that you're winning tickets even though you're not actually getting any tickets.
524000	527000	You're winning so many tickets! Ha! They're just not real.
527000	545000	But, you know, I've been making all these trips recently to round one and so forth and, uh, you know, kind of trying to get into arcades again, especially now that more and more are coming up because of round one, because you're seeing a very interesting sort of mobile's influence on the arcade scene a little bit.
545000	561000	Um, but, like, I don't know how to phrase it, like this, like Breakout here, this is, I think, was a mobile game not that long ago. I think Breakout was called, uh, Breakout Boost was on the mobile phones, and this is kind of a version of that.
562000	589000	Um, and I know we've talked a lot about arcades are dying and it sucks that they're all ticket redemption games and little kids and it's just gambling for them, it's getting them ready for Vegas and all this stuff and what happened to the old school arcade games, but it seems like, like, not only is this really dominating, like, okay, so I put my money in, I play a game of Breakout, I get ten tickets, and I can use those tickets to buy, like, a wax fingernail.
589000	618000	I can use, to buy a bouncy ball, one of those little things that you push down on the, the counter and then it goes pop and it pops up, I can buy something stupid with those tickets, right, like candy or something, but then I think about, okay, well, but the Japanese video games in the music genre that I'm very fond of right now that, um, you know, are part of the reason why I go to places like round one, like DDR, like Beatmania 2DX, like Crossbeats, those sorts of games.
618000	632000	What do all those have in them? They don't spit out tickets, but now everything is tied to a card or it's tied to your mobile phone. You, you long time Konami music game fans, I'm sure, are familiar with eAmusement and that whole past system, right?
632000	654000	So, you're not getting tickets for physical rewards per se, but it does seem like you're still getting, based on how well you do and how much you clear in Beatmania 2DX or how much you clear when you're playing DDR, you're getting arbitrary points tied to this account that you use to unlock virtual things.
654000	663000	Like, um, I was playing the brand new DDR finally, uh, it was actually before the last episode, I just neglected to talk about it last week, but I finally played DDR Ace for the first time last Saturday.
663000	671000	And, um, you know, I had to play the Ariana Grande song that's in that because it's awesome, but, you know, there's a lot of other fun new songs that are in it as well.
671000	682000	Um, and so I played like a set of those songs and, uh, used my eAmusement card because I have one because of Beatmania 2DX and it showed, it did like a little meta thing at the end where it was like, you earn 30 steps.
682000	694000	And the little guy climbed up the stairs and I got so far that I unlocked a song. I unlocked the, uh, Bamani classic song, Make a Jam, which, you know, if you ever played the old-
694000	695000	Like, hooray!
695000	700000	Yeah, I know, it's kind of like, oh yay, that song. But, you know, I'm like, okay, well, that's like a real retro kind of like neat thing.
700000	713000	But I was still going, wait a minute, in this whole process, I earned virtual credit that just went to virtual rewards instead of the crappy physical rewards we're used to with ticket games.
713000	721000	And this is true of a lot of these games now. This is true of, um, Crossbeats. This is true of Beatmania 2DX.
721000	733000	This is true even, there's, um, what's that, what's that called? The, uh, Konami and Disney have a game, Tsum Tsum, I think it's called? These little tiny chibi Disney characters.
733000	741000	And it's a match three game. The arcade game is a match three game. But you actually get little physical things that are kind of like amiibo, but they're really, really small.
741000	747000	Like, they look like the type of thing you would have put a quarter in the machine in the old days and gotten a little bubble. Like, it's just like that.
747000	759000	But yet again, crappy little physical reward for play. Although if you're a Disney collector and a fan, I'm sure it's not so crappy, but still it's a little cheap physical reward as something you get for playing the game.
759000	771000	And I'm kind of like, so even though we've been sitting here kind of criticizing the whole ticket culture, I almost feel like currency changing is everywhere in the arcade now.
771000	785000	It's, it's here, it's taken over and it might not just be physical tickets, but it's everywhere. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think this is the future of arcades? Is it's incentive to go visit because there is something that you're working towards?
785000	790000	There's, there's a currency, there's unlocks, there's something to keep bringing you back. What do you think of all that?
791000	794000	It's just free to play games, that's basically what it is, except you're paying money for them.
794000	803000	I mean, look at, like most of the games out there nowadays that are free to play have the dual currency where, you know, you have something that you earn in the game and you have something that you buy.
803000	815000	So, I don't know, it's, it's a nice thing to have, I guess, if you're playing arcade games that have, like, some sort of, I don't know, trophies and that kind of support is kind of nice.
815000	822000	But at the same time, I think they're just trying to get you to play more games, obviously, so that they make more money off of it, which makes sense.
822000	827000	And make a jam, seriously, that's, I guess it's better than nothing.
827000	839000	Well, it's the first one and I don't, you know, I didn't play enough to get to whatever the second one was because by the time I was, well, A, now that I'm 38 years old, I don't have the stamina I had when I was, like, 24 and first getting into these games, right?
839000	847000	So I don't, it's kind of different. But so I couldn't play the game over and over and over again. But also B, it started to fill up a little more in the arcade.
847000	853000	So it was like, I would have to wait a while. So I just, I really only got to play like two rounds. And then it was like, that's, that's really it.
853000	861000	So I don't know what other unlocks you get. But I imagine there's some other, you know, new things and they're probably all originals.
861000	867000	I can't imagine there's any licenses that are locked away. But I'm sure there's a list online somewhere of what they all are.
867000	874000	But I imagine, you know, it's just cute little things for people who have played DDR for years and years and remember some of the old songs.
874000	882000	So JD in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com points out make a jam is greater than let them move.
882000	885000	That's true. That's true. At least, at least I didn't unlock that.
885000	895000	Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, well, DDR has been doing that for ages. Remember the days of Max 2?
895000	903000	I want to hear that story again. Okay, I'll tell an abbreviated version of it for those that know the arcade machine DDR Max 2.
903000	908000	Those were really fun days. And when we really, God, it feels like grandpa telling a story about the old days.
908000	918000	But you know, in the early days of Orange Lounge Radio, when those machines were still kind of newish, you know, there was a real culture around working together to get unlocks on those machines.
918000	926000	And what it was is that when you played the machine, you got, I think it was, it's been a while you guys, I'm going to get some of the facts wrong.
926000	934000	But I think you got points based on how well you did or like, I don't remember if it was like if you ate a song, it was like two points or one point.
934000	943000	I just remember there was a way you could get more points, but not a lot. But you would get these points and it would slowly count down this point clock.
943000	951000	And when the point clock got to the end, it unlocked a song. But because this was over 10 years ago, there was no cards.
951000	960000	There was no, you know, smartphones or anything like that, that it was tied to you. You were unlocking these things as an arcade community on the same machine.
960000	967000	So when you did an unlock and the counter got to zero, you unlock something permanently for the entire arcade, basically.
967000	973000	And so that built this real sense of, oh, we're going to all go down Wednesday night and we're going to work on unlocks.
973000	984000	Or, you know, maybe a post on a forum that says, because again, no Facebook yet, but a post on a forum somewhere that says, oh, the counter is down to 20, so we're surely going to get the next unlock tonight.
984000	992000	So, you know, people might go to see what it is, even though, you know, the list ended up on DDR Freak. I'm sure not that long after the machine came out.
992000	996000	Well, I thought it was random. It wasn't necessarily the same each time.
996000	1005000	You know, and I don't remember all those intricacies because it has been a while. I do feel like at one point it's like it would skip to four, eight, like it kind of bounced around a little bit.
1005000	1015000	I don't remember what it was that would cause it to do that. But I also remember at some point they finally did, like a year later, release a code that would just unlock everything if your arcade was slow.
1015000	1022000	Because some arcade operators, I'm sure, started to feel like I'm getting a little left behind because everybody else is at this other arcade.
1022000	1032000	And now this is the place to be because they have all the DDR songs and I don't. So, they started actually releasing codes that would unlock everything automatically for you, pretty much.
1032000	1035000	So, that was pretty cool.
1035000	1038000	ActDeftInChat says, those were the days.
1038000	1046000	And Dark Tetsuya says, I think AAA's were like three or more. Yeah, I know you would get like massive amounts of points on the machine for doing that.
1046000	1061000	But anyway, Loki, what do you think about the retro titles turning into Ticket Redemption games? Is that a horrible defacing of a game like Breakout or Galaga? Or is it, eh, at least my kid will get to play it?
1061000	1072000	No, it's not even the same game. Honestly, it's just more trying to cash in on nostalgia. They're really targeting it towards adults. Kids don't know what the hell that crap is.
1072000	1095000	Yeah, they may know what Tetris is, but they're not going to know what Breakout is. So, it's just trying to cash in on nostalgia. Because, I mean, even I heard my co-workers talking about, oh yeah, haven't been to that coin-op bar, but I heard they have all the old arcade games. Oh, we should go try that. That'd be fun. I remember playing those. So, I think that's kind of what it is. They're just trying to cash in on nostalgia.
1095000	1100000	Yeah. A place like coin-op, though, they don't really have any ticket games. It's a bar, bar, pizza type of place.
1100000	1103000	Right, but I'm thinking more like Dave and Buster's, that type of thing.
1103000	1107000	Yeah, okay. That's more, or even round one is more the type of place.
1107000	1123000	Or you go to the arcade or golf land or whatever. You go to one of those places with your kids and your kids are playing some stupid game and you're like, oh hey, Breakout, I remember that. You know, getting the adults in on that.
1123000	1131000	I see. So, it's kind of a way to bring the adults in to maybe play something with the kid because it's working on their nostalgia factor. Okay.
1131000	1136000	And it's also, I think, desperation because, you know, was this Atari?
1136000	1138000	Well, it's an Atari property.
1138000	1144000	Yeah, yeah. See, no more. Atari doesn't really know what to do with their properties anymore and so they're desperate to try to make money with them.
1144000	1152000	Like, for example, they tried relaunching Alone in the Dark because remember the last one, not so great. The one now, really not great.
1152000	1157000	And it's just they're trying to relaunch a lot of these properties and make some money off of these old IPs that they have.
1157000	1162000	And that's where they feel they're going to do it, in mobile or in maybe redemption.
1162000	1171000	Yeah. You know, Atari does definitely thrive a lot on the retro stuff. The vault is a huge thing on Steam right now and I think that's on iOS as well.
1171000	1183000	You know, they kind of repackage their old games. But to be fair, that collection's pretty solid as long as you're willing to go without the games that really made the 2600 great, which was all by other companies.
1183000	1190000	Like Activision made, I mean, made all the great games really on 2600 and iMagic and, you know, there were some other ones as well.
1190000	1195000	But yeah, those were, those are the companies that really put Atari kind of over, I think, a little bit.
1195000	1199000	Anyway, we're going to get into our gaming weeks as well a little bit later here.
1199000	1203000	But we have an interview on tonight's show and a guest that we're welcoming to the show.
1203000	1206000	So we're actually going to get him on the line here in just a moment.
1206000	1209000	We're going to be joined tonight live by Aethernaut.
1209000	1218000	Aethernaut is a musician who's going to be performing live at GamerX4 this weekend, which we're actually going to be at as well.
1218000	1222000	So we'll get to see him perform and hopefully you guys will as well if you're going to be there.
1222000	1227000	We're going to get him on the line to talk about his music and his latest collaborative release.
1227000	1230000	I think we have him on the line. Aethernaut, are you there with us?
1230000	1232000	I am here. Can you hear me?
1232000	1234000	Yes, we can. Hi, welcome to Orange Launch Radio.
1234000	1236000	Hey, thanks for having me.
1236000	1238000	Hey, thanks so much for being here. How are you doing?
1238000	1240000	I'm doing pretty good, pretty good.
1240000	1242000	Nice, chill Sunday night.
1242000	1249000	Yeah, I know, right? Sunday night is a nice, relaxing time to kind of kick back and do things like a podcast with your buddies.
1249000	1251000	Yeah, it's actually my game day.
1251000	1252000	Is it your game day?
1252000	1253000	I play Pathfinder every Sunday.
1253000	1255000	What kind of video games are you playing lately?
1255000	1263000	Oh, let's see. So I jumped on the No Man's Sky bandwagon for a while. That was fun.
1263000	1273000	But it didn't last too long. I've been playing Dark Souls 3 and that was awesome. I really enjoyed that one. I'm looking forward to the DLC.
1273000	1276000	Yeah, they still haven't announced that DLC yet, have they?
1276000	1278000	They have.
1278000	1279000	Oh, they did?
1279000	1284000	Yeah, it should be coming out probably around this holiday season.
1284000	1290000	I haven't been following that series as closely because I just get too frustrated with it. I tried to get into it way back when it was Demon's Souls.
1290000	1300000	It's one of those things where it's like, okay, this really is too hard. And I get it, but my partner is super, super into it and plays all those games.
1301000	1310000	I think he's really excited about the DLC as well, but I can't get into it in the same way. But that's alright. That's why there's different types of games out there for everybody.
1310000	1320000	So you are a musician who definitely has a lot of video game influence in his music, right? Chiptune, I guess you would call it, right?
1320000	1322000	Yes, indeed. Chiptune.
1322000	1330000	So tell us a little bit about how you got into that. What made you decide, I want to create this kind of music?
1330000	1340000	Well, I have been a gamer for pretty much my entire life and a musician for my entire life as well.
1340000	1351000	And I've always loved the music in the games that I used to play. So much, in fact, that I would just leave it running and just do something else, like play with Legos or whatever.
1351000	1359000	But the music would still be running. And those are probably some of my strongest memories of earlier video games.
1359000	1368000	And several years back, a coworker of mine had put on his iPod at work and it was a whole bunch of Chiptune stuff.
1368000	1375000	And I was blown away. I had never heard anything like this. I was like, oh, this sounds like all the old games I used to play.
1375000	1385000	And he was like, yeah, these are some people out from New York that have been using old systems to write new music. And I was just floored by it.
1385000	1405000	And so I kind of looked up some of these people and some ways that I could do it myself and have, I guess, successfully melded my music past with my video game past into something new that I can share with other people.
1405000	1414000	So you talk about your music past. So music was something you were kind of doing before you were making the Chiptune music? Like, were you involved in like, like, for me, not everybody knows this.
1414000	1421000	I was a total band geek in high school, which, you know, in some ways might be how I kind of got into radio and a little bit and the voice of broadcasting and all that.
1421000	1428000	But I was a clarinet player. Like, was that kind of like you too? You were kind of grew up on music in that same regard? Or was this?
1428000	1445000	Oh, yeah. So I was raised on classical music. And so I took violin lessons, piano lessons. So I took classical lessons. And, you know, growing up, I was in the high school orchestra and things like that.
1445000	1459000	But, you know, as I as I got into high school, I started listening to a whole bunch of other kinds of music, and especially electronic music, and it really, really stuck with me.
1459000	1472000	And when I started writing, actually, like composing music, I was composing electronic music, albeit it was like really terrible house music when I first started.
1472000	1477000	That's okay. The first episodes of the show were really, really bad. We all have to start somewhere.
1477000	1499000	So then, yeah, I just started to, I had these moments of going back to my roots and incorporating what I learned from, from my classical training, and from what I've learned from, you know, messing around with like rock and indie and experimental stuff. And I kind of just threw that all together into what it is now.
1499000	1513000	So speaking of the classically trained end of it, I know one way that a lot of people recognize you, if they've ever seen you perform before, a lot of people know you as, wait a minute, that's the chiptune guy who rocks that violin when he's on stage.
1513000	1521000	So is that like, is that kind of how your like classic past kind of melds with your your chiptune self?
1521000	1537000	Yeah, I, so the violin is my main instrument. I've been playing that since I was five. And when, when I was writing chiptune, when I first started writing it, I was, I was just cranking out song after song because I was so excited about it.
1537000	1553000	I finally had this medium that I felt like I was able to fully express who I was. And when I thought about it, and you know, I was like, well, you know, I would like to perform this stuff live, but how am I going to do that?
1553000	1567000	And I thought, well, may as well use what I've, you know, what I'm good at, what I've been doing for years, and that would be playing the violin. So I looked into how I would be able to do that.
1567000	1585000	And I found a pitch to MIDI converter, which it, it translates each individual note from a stringed instrument into a MIDI signal, and then I can trigger different sound banks from there.
1587000	1594000	So using one of those, I'm able to actually play all of these melodies on the violin itself.
1594000	1602000	That was awesome. That's, that's pretty clever, how you kind of brought all that together there through the, through the technology and the programs.
1602000	1611000	So going to our chat, and if you have questions for eighth or ninth, you can ask in our chat room, of course, over at live.vog.net.com. Some folks kind of following up on some of the things you've talked about.
1611000	1619000	DungeonBuster says, speaking of keeping old games running just for the music, I miss the sound and music modes that used to be in many of the option menus.
1619000	1629000	That's right. A lot of the old video games would kind of have the soundtrack built into the game in a very plain sound test menu. Where did that ever go? I don't think, I don't think many games today have that, do they?
1629000	1635000	You know, the last one that I remember seeing was in Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast.
1636000	1643000	That's right. That's right. I do remember that. Gosh, I'm trying to think, surely there had to have been something on PlayStation 2 or something with that. I just, I'm drawing a blank right now.
1643000	1651000	Oh, very, very good call out from Bobby Black Wolf. Smash Brothers has it. That's right. That would be a very modern game that has that.
1651000	1659000	And yeah, there's, there's so much Nintendo music in the newer Smash Brothers games. Good memories. Good, good memory there in our chat.
1659000	1665000	So you are actually going to be performing at GamerX 4 this coming weekend, right?
1665000	1668000	Yes, I am. I'm really, really excited about it.
1668000	1672000	Yeah, you were there, you were there the first year, right? And so you're coming back?
1672000	1674000	Yeah, I was there for year one and two.
1674000	1682000	Got it, got it. So you're coming back for year four. Tell our folks what they have to look forward to. Tell me I'm going to be there, so tell me what I have to look forward to.
1683000	1691000	So there is going to be, you know, a lot of the same old tunes that you've heard me play before and a few new ones.
1691000	1700000	I just recently released a split EP with another local chiptune group called The Chunderfins.
1700000	1704000	It's actually just one guy, but he's absolutely amazing and he was a lot of fun to work with.
1704000	1716000	And it's a four song EP and it is released through the net label Cheapbeats. You can find it on Bandcamp and the name of it is kind of strange.
1716000	1723000	It's called Sugar Knot Chundercrisp. It's, yeah, you're probably going to have to look at it in a link or something.
1723000	1740000	But its theme was breakfast cereal. And so we kind of just wrote songs based on that theme, kind of capturing the feeling of like waking up on a Saturday morning and like having your cereal and watching cartoons.
1740000	1747000	And somebody actually posted a link there in our chat room, JD actually sent a link there over to your band.
1747000	1756000	Well, actually, this is a special since this is a collaborative one. This is like a separate Bandcamp page for this, right? But you have albums that you have on your own Bandcamp page, right?
1756000	1768000	I do. I do. Yeah, so this particular EP was a collaborative effort. And so we decided to actually go through Cheapbeats, which is a net label, a chiptune net label specifically.
1768000	1778000	So that's the first one actually released on a label. But you can also go to aethernot.bandcamp.com and check out some of the stuff that I have put out by myself.
1778000	1782000	Dungeon Muster in chat says I would totally buy that cereal.
1782000	1786000	It looks really delicious, doesn't it?
1786000	1796000	And it's nice that the cereal has a catchy theme song to go with it, kind of like Nintendo cereal used to do or Honeycomb. Like who doesn't remember the Honeycomb song or any of that stuff?
1796000	1806000	Question in chat, a couple of people asking about the technology that you use. What do you use for your virtual studio technology in your digital audio workstation?
1806000	1816000	So for my digital audio workstation, I use Reason. They've come out with version 9 not too long ago and with an update for that.
1816000	1824000	But I also use a tracker called Famitracker. There's plenty of other trackers out there too.
1824000	1836000	But Famitracker I specifically like to use because I think it works very intuitively and it has different chipset options. I can do some FM work.
1836000	1847000	I'm kind of geeking out with words here. So yeah, I primarily use Reason and Famitracker and kind of just program everything by hand.
1847000	1853000	There must be some other music nerds that make their own. I use that term lovingly. A nerd is a good person.
1853000	1859000	There must be some other folks in chat because I'm kind of smiling and nodding at those things because admittedly I don't...
1860000	1866000	I can talk podcasting but I've never tried to make and compose music here but I think that's really cool.
1866000	1874000	I think there's a lot more. It's like making a game. I think there's so many layers that go into it that people don't even realize.
1874000	1887000	There are quite a lot of layers but that's not to say all of Chiptune has a lot of layers because a lot of it really has only four.
1887000	1889000	True.
1889000	1901000	Just a quick rundown of what Famitracker is. It's a little program that harnesses the chipset of whatever old system.
1901000	1915000	The biggest one that would be used is probably the NES. You use hexadecimal code to program each notes and you can add effects and slides and vibrato and all that stuff.
1916000	1922000	I know our pal Bobby Blackwolf does his own music composition as well and he's in chat saying,
1922000	1928000	I was a tracker back in the 90s. Used Scream Tracker and Impulse Tracker back when I was in the demo scene.
1928000	1932000	I think even I know Scream Tracker so I remember the old school stuff like that.
1932000	1939000	I would look at it and go, this is complicated. No, that's awesome.
1939000	1948000	What's in the future for you? Are you going to be working on any more albums? I know you just put out this EP but are you thinking about what you're going to do next?
1948000	1959000	I am currently in the middle of my second full length. This is very sad but it's taken me over two years.
1959000	1971000	A lot of things have gotten in the way or I've had to revamp the idea of it several times but I think I finally got it down and hopefully that will be coming out this next year.
1971000	1979000	Probably early 2017 and now I'm going to feel pressure to actually get it out in time.
1980000	1987000	Sorry about that. You know what though? You've been working on that probably not as long as Loki's been working on his game which still isn't out.
1987000	1989000	I'm not working on it.
1989000	1994000	Good work takes time. It takes a lot of time for sure.
1995000	2003000	There was something on my tongue I want to ask you about. Tell us a little more about the live performance end of stuff.
2003000	2011000	Do you feed off the audience when you're performing live or is it one of those things where you get in the zone and you tune that stuff out?
2011000	2018000	How does the live performance thing differ for you from when you're doing that versus sitting at your workstation?
2019000	2031000	When I do a live performance I absolutely feed off of the energy in the audience. I'm always a nervous wreck when I get up there every single time without fail.
2032000	2047000	But as I start to play and I feel people are getting into it, they're actually dancing, they're clapping. The response is what gives me more energy to keep going.
2047000	2058000	Eventually through the set I start to calm down and then I really get into the groove and then I just go nuts. I like making people happy.
2059000	2068000	Well I think you're going to make a lot of people happy at GamerX in just a few days. I'm excited to see you live. I know some of our participants are going to be going there.
2068000	2073000	Hopefully they're all going to take some time to check out the concert and all that. Which night are you performing? Friday? Saturday?
2073000	2079000	Oh if I had to guess I would say Saturday. I think Friday is what? Opening ceremonies? Is that right?
2080000	2091000	In the morning? Sadly I should have had the schedule in front of me but I don't. I will check that out right after this interview. I'm sure you'll be around for sure and people should consult their programs.
2091000	2093000	Yeah I'll be there the whole weekend.
2093000	2101000	Awesome, yeah us too. Definitely look forward to that. Real quick, one other question here from chat. This is a real good one here before I let you go.
2101000	2107000	Dungeon Buster says, has Aethernaut ever scored a game or would like to score one and if yes what kind of game would they want to score?
2108000	2110000	Have you worked with games?
2110000	2117000	Yes I've done a few games with a buddy of mine that used to live out here. They're mobile games.
2117000	2128000	The first one that I worked with him on actually was a two person, same computer kind of battle game called Blip Bloop.
2129000	2141000	Then we worked on another one that was a mobile game called Chroma Calamity. Kind of like a mesh the color gets progressively harder.
2141000	2154000	And then we did one called Cosmic Drift which was another mobile game. We are currently working on another one that I cannot divulge too many details about right now.
2154000	2161000	But that will be hopefully going up onto Steam Greenlight sometime soon. Very very soon.
2161000	2174000	But yes I would actually very much like to score video games and sound design video games for like that's my dream job. I would love to do that full time.
2174000	2182000	So yeah if you guys out there are indie devs and are looking for music or sound design let me know.
2182000	2191000	Well I'll tell you what GX4 is a great place to network with people because I did a lot of that last year when I went. Got some guests for the show that were making games.
2191000	2196000	So I think you're going to find a lot of great networking opportunities there. So that's going to be awesome.
2196000	2201000	Do you do other conventions as well? Is there anything else that's coming up that you're performing at that you know of?
2201000	2206000	Currently I might be going out to Magfest.
2206000	2207000	Ooh
2207000	2214000	So that might be fun. It'll be my first time going. I don't think I'll be playing main stage but I might be playing one of the side shows.
2214000	2222000	Oh that'll be awesome. Good luck. I hope that works out. I went to Magfest for the first time this year and I had a great time. I'm already set up to go back next year.
2222000	2227000	I don't perform but I kind of bob my head when I listen to the music.
2227000	2237000	Oh yeah you know even if you don't go as a performer it's great to go just because of all the games and music going on 24-7 for the entire thing.
2237000	2243000	It's really an amazing experience from what I hear and I'm really looking forward to experiencing it myself.
2243000	2251000	Awesome. Well then I hope to see you at Magfest as well but for now I will settle with seeing you this weekend at GamerX4.
2251000	2259000	We are going to check out one of your songs as we conclude here. This is one of your collaborative songs off of the new EP Sugar Knot Chundercrest.
2259000	2270000	We're going to check out a song called Saturday Morning. Before I get into that song, anything, any links to plug, social media to plug, anything that we should be following you on to check out the latest and greatest?
2270000	2281000	You can keep up with happenings on Twitter. My handle is at aethernautisdead. That is D-E-D. So aethernautisdead.
2281000	2291000	And you can just search for aethernaut on Facebook. You already have the link for my bandcamp. I'm also on SoundCloud if you just want to simply listen to stuff. Yeah.
2291000	2299000	Awesome. Well, and then some of the chatters are saying R.I.P. and I was thinking that's kind of a morbid handle, but it's D-E-D.
2299000	2306000	And that's, I think, isn't that kind of the response to like when something, when something really big happens in media, something really shocking happens?
2306000	2313000	Like, like Ru brings two queens back into the competition and it's OMG dead, right? It's that kind of dead, right?
2314000	2322000	All right. I try. We'll go with that. It's probably, it's probably for the best you distance yourself as far as possible from that comment.
2322000	2335000	Aethernaut, thank you so much for being here. We're going to check out the tune Saturday Morning. Check this out from the EP Sugar Not Chundercrisp, available cheapbeatsmusic.bandcamp.com. Check it out.
2335000	2338000	Thanks again, Aethernaut, for being here. I appreciate it. Yeah, thank you.
2343000	2346000	Aethernaut, thank you so much for being here. We'll be right back.
2373000	2376000	Thank you so much for being here. We'll be right back.
2403000	2406000	Thank you so much for being here.
2433000	2436000	Thank you so much.
2464000	2465000	Now!
2467000	2468000	Uh-huh!
2469000	2470000	You got it!
2472000	2475000	Gotta have a bull, gotta have cereal!
2475000	2476000	Hey!
2485000	2486000	Hey, hey, hey!
2493000	2494000	Hey!
2523000	2524000	Hey!
2526000	2527000	Hey!
2553000	2554000	Hey!
2571000	2577000	From the EP Sugar Not Shundercrisp, that is Aethernaut!
2577000	2580000	And thank you so much for being on the show tonight.
2580000	2584000	Really appreciate that, and be sure to, again, you can check that out over on Bandcamp.
2584000	2595000	It's only, what, $4 for a digital version of the EP, and I think $7 to get, like, a special, like, that would actually come in a CD case and all that fancy stuff.
2595000	2598000	So I would really encourage you all to buy that.
2598000	2603000	I plan to forego a pumpkin spice latte this week. I know it's a big sacrifice, but you know what?
2603000	2609000	Chiptune music that's awesome like that, and, you know, Aethernaut coming on our show and being supportive and all that stuff.
2609000	2615000	Definitely worth it, so I encourage you guys, if you like that song, which it sounds like a lot of you guys in our chat did, check that out as well.
2615000	2621000	Thanks again to Aethernaut for being on tonight's show, and we'll be seeing him at GamerX this weekend.
2621000	2627000	Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we've been playing this week. Loki?
2627000	2630000	I haven't played too much. I meant to, but just didn't do it.
2631000	2641000	Basically, just the same three mobile games I've been playing every week. That's Nonstop Night and Ingress and Pokemon Go.
2641000	2656000	I haven't been playing a whole ton of Ingress, just the bare minimum right now, just because I'm very close to getting my last Sojourner badge, which for those not playing the game, that means you play every single day consecutively for 360 days.
2656000	2659000	So I have about three more days left to do that.
2659000	2660000	Oh, wow.
2660000	2662000	Yeah, so then I can stop.
2662000	2664000	Then you delete it.
2664000	2676000	Then I can stop. Well, now I'm gonna delete it. It's just I won't feel the pressure to have to go out. Like, if I don't feel like we're going anywhere, like out of the house or something, I don't have to like, okay, I gotta make a special stop through the park to go hack this portal real quick.
2676000	2690000	And then, of course, Pokemon Go is whenever I'm driving slow enough. So if I'm stuck in traffic, I switch from Ingress to Pokemon Go because I feel like getting candy every three kilometers.
2690000	2692000	Ooh, one candy. Ooh.
2692000	2699000	It's like, my son's like, hey, what if I put a Pidgey as my friend? I'm like, that would be a waste.
2699000	2704000	Son, that would be a real dumb idea. Don't do it.
2704000	2715000	Let's not do that. So I have mine on a Charmander right now because, you know, there's hardly any around here for some reason. I never see them.
2715000	2726000	I have a Lickitung as my pal, which is actually kind of stupid because he doesn't evolve into anything. But since they're so rarely caught, it's a very good way for me to power them up.
2726000	2731000	So my plan is to have the most powerful Lickitung in all of California.
2731000	2732000	All right.
2732000	2733000	Goals.
2733000	2736000	Yeah, so that's pretty much what I've been doing.
2738000	2746000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, feast.
2746000	2748000	Yeah, that's it, unfortunately.
2748000	2759000	All right, that's okay. Kind of piggybacking on that a little bit, getting into my gaming week. I've also been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go because I actually got the accessory, the Pokemon Go Plus accessory arrive this week.
2759000	2768000	I preordered it way back when it was first available, you know, before the craze all started pretty much. That was such a hipster thing to say, sorry, but I did pick that up.
2768000	2775000	So I didn't even get it the very first day. I was still, I guess, in the second wave or something, but I did finally get the accessory earlier this week.
2775000	2787000	So I was able to try it out for a little bit. When you get the device, it comes on a belt clip, but you can actually take off the back with a screwdriver and screw it onto that more familiar wristband that a lot of people are seeing.
2787000	2796000	So there's kind of the two different ways that you can use that device. And here's the thing, it will light up and it will vibrate when there's a Pokemon nearby.
2796000	2804000	And I think it lights up blue, and I couldn't tell if it was vibrating or not because I was using the belt clip, but when you're near a Pokestop, it actually lights up blue.
2804000	2811000	And you hit the button and you will either, I think you have a 50-50 chance to catch the Pokemon, whatever it is, or you will get the items from the Pokestop.
2811000	2812000	It's less than that.
2812000	2813000	Is it even less than that?
2813000	2821000	For example, I've seen people online posting that about out of the 15 Pokemon that come by, 14 of them run away.
2821000	2822000	Oh my gosh.
2822000	2824000	Yeah, especially when you're high enough level.
2824000	2833000	See, I only really was able to run a test in this neighborhood, and I only ran into two Pokemon my whole little walk that I did, but I did catch both.
2833000	2841000	But I think one was a Pidgey, Rattata type of easy thing, and the other was a Nidoran, which is still pretty common.
2841000	2846000	So I didn't try to catch anything any bigger than that.
2846000	2854000	But here's the thing, when you're running that device, you still have to have your phone nearby. The two are tethered via Bluetooth.
2855000	2867000	So you can have the app asleep, which is going to save on battery life, but it's important to know the Pokemon device, the Pokemon Go Plus, is still getting the GPS data fed through the phone.
2867000	2872000	So the phone essentially is still running the game in the background, like in your pocket.
2872000	2877000	It's just not draining the battery as heavy, but it will be a battery drain.
2877000	2880000	That device will not replace your phone completely.
2880000	2885000	So as long as you go into it knowing that, then I think the device is kind of a neat little thing.
2885000	2891000	I mean, if you think about it, it's just a little wearable button, and the button changes colors and you hit the button.
2891000	2894000	That's all it does, and it's operating the game in your pocket, basically.
2894000	2900000	But I think where this would most be useful is if I'm the type of person who said,
2900000	2908000	OK, well, I'm going to use Pokemon Go as part of my getting fit and doing more walking and incorporating more of that into my routine.
2909000	2914000	The nice thing is that if you're going to use Pokemon Go with your wristband as opposed to playing the game in your pocket,
2914000	2920000	if you are going to walk and play Pokemon Go, you're stopping every few steps to hit a PokeStop,
2920000	2924000	throw the ball over and over again until the fucker runs away or whatever.
2924000	2929000	But if you're doing it this way, then all you have to do, you feel the vibrate, tap, keep walking.
2929000	2932000	You get to do it nonstop.
2932000	2937000	And I think that's where a lot of people will really enjoy this device is that, yes, you do get credit for the steps
2937000	2939000	and the distance and all that.
2939000	2943000	But remember, your phone does still have to be running the game in the background.
2943000	2947000	I've been finding lately that's been kind of funny, and this is just randomly.
2947000	2953000	When I'm playing the game and I go to spin the PokeStops, my avatar will sometimes clip past the camera.
2953000	2957000	Like, I had that happen today on my way here.
2957000	2962000	I had spun one of the PokeStops where I went into that, and all of a sudden I see this giant face go by.
2962000	2965000	What the fuck? I'm like, oh, it's my avatar.
2965000	2969000	Because it just moves the camera or something like that, which is silly.
2969000	2972000	But, I don't know. Fun little tweak.
2972000	2977000	Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, that's pretty much, I mean, I don't know if you guys have any further questions,
2977000	2980000	because I see in chat SHJ100Matt says, I'm interested in Rob's thoughts on it,
2980000	2984000	because I don't see the use for it for me, but I could be swayed.
2984000	2987000	I want to pick one up, but I don't want to fight people for it right now.
2987000	2989000	Yeah, don't pay the market prices.
2990000	2992000	It's not even worth the $35 or whatever it is.
2992000	2994000	Yeah, it's a pretty hefty price.
2994000	2998000	But, I kind of also look at it as, well, you know, it's collectible, that type of thing.
2998000	3001000	So, if you're into that, then cool.
3001000	3006000	But, if you're looking for that thing to, like, completely replace Pokemon Go or change your habits completely,
3006000	3008000	I don't think it's going to do that.
3008000	3014000	But, I think if you are like, okay, I want, you know, I know I do a lot of walking during the day,
3014000	3017000	or I want to make myself do more walking during the day,
3017000	3022000	and yeah, I might even get a little more incentive to do that if I was catching Pokemon,
3022000	3024000	or if I was affecting my game somehow, right?
3024000	3028000	Going back to the opening of the show, some type of digital reward for what I'm doing, right?
3028000	3029000	I want tickets.
3029000	3031000	Then that device is going to help you with that.
3031000	3032000	It's going to help with that incentive.
3032000	3036000	But, you know, at the end of the day, it's just a button.
3036000	3040000	It doesn't change the game that fundamentally or anything like that.
3040000	3044000	But, it is still kind of cool to see that a cell phone,
3044000	3050000	because I can't think of another cell phone game out there that exists with a peripheral like that.
3050000	3055000	Maybe, like, the Disney Infinity stuff I know exists in the mobile space,
3055000	3059000	but that's really the only other thing I can think of, and that, you know, a lot of those types of games.
3059000	3063000	Yeah, but those aren't different. I think those don't even have a thing that you scan.
3063000	3068000	It's basically they take the card, there's a card that comes with them as well that you put the code in,
3068000	3070000	and you just have your characters digitally that way.
3070000	3071000	Mm-hmm.
3071000	3073000	I don't think you actually scan anything with it.
3073000	3074000	Because that'd be silly.
3074000	3075000	Yeah.
3075000	3076000	Maybe you can. I know Skylanders does that.
3076000	3082000	Skylanders actually has a little, like, actual thing that you put on there, and you can do it that way.
3083000	3086000	Why? But they have that available to you.
3086000	3088000	I mean, if that's really what you want to do.
3089000	3092000	So, that's really it for the Pokémon GO.
3092000	3098000	The other game that I was checking out this week, I mean, I've still been playing World of Warcraft a lot,
3098000	3101000	and I hit max level and been playing that.
3101000	3104000	But now I've kind of, and the end game in that game is really interesting,
3104000	3109000	because they took a lot of influence from Diablo III for the end game in World of Warcraft.
3109000	3115000	Like, you do these things called World Quests now that feel a lot like the bounty in Diablo III,
3115000	3119000	and then even the high level dungeons take a lot of influence from the greater rifts,
3119000	3122000	because you actually get, like, keystone numbers that make the dungeon harder.
3122000	3129000	So, that's kind of interesting to me, but I don't know, you know, I still love Final Fantasy XIV as an MMO,
3129000	3134000	and I think a break's been good, especially because, you know, I just feel like the content patches for Heavensward,
3134000	3139000	they've been good, but they haven't seemed to have the longevity that the Realm Reborn patches had,
3139000	3143000	but they are putting out a new Heavensward patch on Tuesday.
3143000	3147000	And so, I've got to check that out, and it sounds like there's some neat things coming out with that,
3147000	3150000	certainly from a story perspective and some new fights and dungeons and stuff.
3150000	3156000	So, I kind of feel like, all right, well, I got to go, bye, wow, it's been fun flirting with you on the side,
3156000	3160000	but I got to go back to my main game of choice for a little bit. I feel like that's what's going to happen next week,
3160000	3163000	but we'll see, because I don't think I can juggle two MMOs forever.
3163000	3169000	But at the end of the day, it's also a social thing, and, like, you know, I'm able to play World of Warcraft with the guys from Game Buoy.
3169000	3174000	I play on their server with them, and that's fun to have that social aspect.
3174000	3178000	We ran a five-man dungeon with some other mutual friends of theirs, and that was a lot of fun,
3178000	3183000	and that's always, I think, where those games shine best, obviously, as a social type of environment.
3183000	3189000	So, yeah, I mean, if that stuff is still going on regularly, it's probably incentive for me to keep WoW around,
3189000	3194000	although paying for two MMO subscriptions, I don't know, that's a lot, so we'll see.
3194000	3199000	Although you can pay for your Warcraft subscription with gold now, I just don't make enough of it,
3199000	3206000	but it doesn't seem impossible. It seems like it's an achievable number, so we'll see. We'll see, maybe.
3206000	3212000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, JD says, my favorite MMO is Guild Wars 2.
3212000	3218000	Yeah, I know a lot of people into that. I bought that when it first came out, but I didn't have a lot of friends playing Guild Wars 2,
3218000	3222000	and so I would be playing Guild Wars 2 for a little bit, and then later I'd get a text message,
3222000	3226000	we're going to run a heroic in WoW, because I think I was playing that at the time, come sign in.
3226000	3230000	So, that's usually what ends up happening and those sorts of things.
3230000	3235000	Lastly, as far as video games go this week, besides any type of regular console things,
3235000	3240000	I've been playing, I don't know if I mentioned this, but I bought Hatsune Miku on PlayStation 4.
3240000	3244000	They released a Hatsune Miku game on PlayStation 4 like three weeks ago.
3244000	3252000	I got it delivered with the Pokemon Go Plus accessory when that came out, so I've been playing that on PlayStation 4,
3252000	3261000	and it's, I honestly feel like I'm playing a PlayStation 2 music game on the PlayStation 4, but it's cute.
3261000	3267000	I think I paid 40 bucks for it though, which is a little, it might be a little much,
3267000	3271000	I think something like 20 or 30 is maybe where this game kind of belongs,
3271000	3278000	and it really kind of forces you to play every song as you kind of unlock through the universe,
3278000	3285000	and there's this really cheesy story that goes with it, but as long as you're cool with how ultra cheesy it is,
3285000	3291000	I mean, even if I just say Hatsune Miku, I think that invokes some type of response within you,
3291000	3297000	and some people are going to be like, yes, and some people are going to be like, no, no thank you, not ever, not now.
3297000	3302000	So I kind of think you already know where you stand on this game, but some of the music's really cute.
3302000	3308000	I kind of think the music in the PlayStation 3 one that I had was better, but I like this one fine.
3308000	3314000	There are still some good songs in it, and I guess it does the whole cross save thing with the Vita version,
3314000	3318000	which I guess is pretty much the same game. I don't have that Vita version, so I don't know,
3318000	3329000	but I think it's that on the PlayStation 4, which might also explain why it doesn't feel as full as a PlayStation 4 game usually does,
3329000	3333000	probably because it started as a handheld game that they've kind of put on the PlayStation 4.
3333000	3338000	But if you like music games and all that stuff, you'll probably see something in this that you like.
3338000	3345000	It's fun to just play it here and there, but I don't think it's something I'm going to get obsessed with, if that makes sense.
3345000	3350000	And even ActDeft in chat says, the previous Project Divas are better.
3350000	3355000	And yeah, Project DVX is the one I've been playing. I knew it was Project Divas something.
3355000	3358000	I didn't remember it was as simple as X, but that sounds right.
3358000	3364000	But yeah, I think the one I was playing on PlayStation 3 had a better song list, and it was all open from the beginning and all that stuff.
3364000	3369000	But it's alright. It's fun. It's cute.
3369000	3371000	Anyway, that's it for our gaming weeks.
3371000	3379000	So before we get to the news tonight, I just want to quickly one more time plug that we will actually not be here next week.
3379000	3387000	There is no live Orange Lawns radio next week because I will still be in Santa Clara at GamerX4, which wraps up on Sunday.
3387000	3390000	We actually have a panel at 2 o'clock.
3390000	3395000	So even if I were to magically be able to get in the car and hit the gas at 3 o'clock,
3395000	3401000	considering that there is a frickin' football game at the stadium across the street where the Niners now play,
3401000	3406000	that day, I'm fucked. I'm not getting home until midnight on Sunday.
3406000	3409000	So are you saying that you're not ready for football?
3409000	3416000	No, I'm not ready for football. Not that. Why does it have to be on the same day? Anyway, but whatever.
3416000	3421000	So hey, since you're not going to be moving in traffic anyway, why leave GamerX early?
3421000	3425000	Why not enjoy to the very end and come see our panel at 2 o'clock?
3425000	3432000	Hey, that is prime Pokemon egg hatching speed right there, I'm telling you.
3432000	3436000	Maybe I'll bring my accessory just in case. That sounds like a fantastic idea, Logie.
3436000	3440000	Because then it's like, you could hatch like four or five eggs just on the way back.
3440000	3447000	So yeah, I'm going to be doing a panel with DarkSakura and Captain Spike from GameBooey.org.
3447000	3453000	And who knows who else we might just pull into that. We're going to be doing the Indie Gamer Podcast Super Show.
3453000	3461000	It's going to be sort of like half podcast fan club type of stuff because, not like the shows, but like,
3461000	3465000	you should do a podcast and we want to empower you to do a podcast and look how fun it is to do a podcast.
3465000	3472000	So it's kind of like half that, but half like, okay, we did these awesome panels at the first few shows that were podcast cross zone,
3472000	3475000	cross zone two, cross zone three, and those are a lot of fun.
3475000	3480000	But then we kind of realized like, we've never actually done a podcast.
3480000	3485000	So we thought we'd kind of do half that and half sort of like a blend of a little bit of what we do here on OLR,
3485000	3491000	a little bit of what they do on GameBooey and kind of actually talk about some of the news in gaming that week.
3491000	3495000	Because while there are a lot of amazing panels at GamerX4,
3495000	3502000	I'm not sure there's any that are dedicated to actual ongoing current events, like in the gaming fandom.
3502000	3506000	Obviously there's things in gaming culture that the panels address,
3506000	3510000	but I'm not sure there's anything that talks about like, there was big news this week.
3510000	3514000	Watch the NX gets revealed this week. We'll be able to talk about it at that panel.
3514000	3517000	So, you're laughing.
3517000	3521000	I know, right? The one week we're gone. Watch, watch, that's what's going to fucking happen.
3521000	3526000	Nintendo comes out tomorrow and says NX reveal on Wednesday and it's going to be like, son of a bleep bleep bleep.
3526000	3532000	But I'll tell you what. I'll promise you this. I leave for GamerX on Thursday night.
3532000	3540000	So if by some act of grace, Nintendo makes a huge announcement before Wednesday night,
3540000	3543000	I will make Loki get on Skype with me for 30 minutes.
3543000	3546000	Dark Sakura too, if she's available. And we'll do a reaction podcast.
3546000	3552000	We'll do a special one-off episode. But if it happens after Thursday, I can't do it because I'm on the road.
3552000	3557000	So, we'll see. Although, I guess I could tape something at GamerX, but then Loki wouldn't be there.
3557000	3563000	And I know how it is. Jamie knows how it is. Loki is the one you most want to know his reaction to the NX.
3563000	3566000	Oh, I'm so enthusiastic, especially after all the rumors and everything.
3566000	3572000	I mean, I can't wait to get into it. It's just, it sounds so needlessly complicated.
3572000	3575000	Okay. Bobby is making an offer. We might take him up on this.
3575000	3580000	Bobby says, I can call you guys on Skype and host OLR from Atlanta.
3580000	3585000	All right. So, deal. If the NX is revealed this week and we can't do something in advance,
3585000	3589000	so if it's revealed Thursday or Friday, Jamie and I will call from the car.
3589000	3593000	Loki will call from home or wherever he's at. Bobby will hook it together.
3593000	3600000	And we will do a special WTF OLR NX edition, but only if the NX is revealed this week. Sound good?
3600000	3605000	It's got to be revealed by the end of the next month because they have their next investor.
3605000	3609000	I actually was watching some stuff about this. They have their next investors meeting or whatever.
3609000	3614000	At the end of October. So, it's got to be released by then.
3614000	3618000	One of the theories was New York Comic Cons right around the corner
3618000	3622000	and that they may try to do something at Nintendo World, the Nintendo store.
3622000	3624000	Why there? Oh, okay. All right.
3624000	3626000	They'll try like a pre-event or something like that.
3626000	3631000	I think we're just stretching at this point. We're just grabbing for, well, maybe it's this.
3631000	3635000	I think the announcement is going to be the inevitable delay, but that's...
3636000	3639000	I'm with you there. I think that's what's going to happen.
3639000	3641000	We talked about that last week. I don't need to redo it.
3641000	3646000	But I'm preparing myself for that announcement.
3646000	3656000	That's what I'm preparing. If I'm pleasantly surprised and we do end up having to do a Bobby Black Wolf on the road Loki at home edition of OLR,
3656000	3660000	then so be it. That's great. But I'm preparing myself for the inevitable.
3660000	3665000	We've decided to push it back to holiday 2017 and we look forward to showing it to you at E3 2017.
3665000	3667000	I'm just preparing myself for that.
3667000	3669000	Whatever. You know what?
3669000	3671000	Set the bar low.
3671000	3676000	That's about an equal amount of underwhelming that I'm going to have versus an actual announcement anyways.
3676000	3681000	All right. Anyway, so no show next week unless the NX gets announced.
3681000	3689000	Otherwise, no show and we will see you in two weeks unless you want to see us live if you actually happen to be at GamerX.
3689000	3693000	Let's get into some gaming news this week. We've got a lot of ground to cover. Loki.
3693000	3697000	So Blizzard announced that they're going to be phasing out the name Battle.net.
3697000	3701000	They're going to be changing it to something else because that's what they've been doing with their products.
3701000	3705000	Naming them Blizzard this, Blizzard that. So Blizzard.net?
3705000	3708000	Blizzard launcher. I think it's what they've already...
3708000	3710000	Wow, that sounds so much cooler than Battle.net.
3710000	3717000	Or Blizzard network. Well, that icon that you use to launch all the games from, I think it's called Battle.net right now.
3717000	3720000	They will change that inevitably to this Blizzard launcher, I think will be the name of that thing.
3720000	3726000	Oh, that sounds so... It's like, I'm going to launch Battle.net or Blizzard launcher.
3726000	3730000	It's interesting. There's a lot of pushback to this change going on in the community.
3730000	3736000	Because, you know, even though I don't host Horde House anymore, I made a lot of friends in the Blizzard community from those days.
3736000	3741000	And so I still follow on Twitter and there's a lot of pushback going on out there and I'm kind of one of them.
3741000	3746000	Like, this is a really... I'm not sure the strategy behind this.
3746000	3753000	I've just always thought of Battle.net as another Blizzard product just as I consider Diablo a product.
3753000	3757000	Like, are you going to change the name of World of Warcraft to Blizzard MMO?
3757000	3762000	Are you going to change the name of Heroes of the Storm to Blizzard MOBA?
3762000	3765000	Is this Spaceballs? Blizzard the movie.
3766000	3774000	Blizzard the planet. Blizzard the this and that. Like, is this... Blizzard the t-shirt.
3774000	3776000	Like, is that what it's going to turn into? I think not.
3776000	3779000	So I just don't understand why Battle.net is such a negative thing.
3779000	3784000	I mean, I guess maybe it's not something that's super marketable, but what is in that department?
3784000	3794000	And I think Battle.net is just a really cool way to kind of tie that to the retro stuff that I remember when I first got into Blizzard products when I was playing Diablo 2.
3794000	3799000	Or I'm sure for many of you Warcraft 3. That whole thing.
3799000	3802000	Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
3802000	3805000	Kaijuto says, I won't miss Battle.net. Fuck them.
3805000	3809000	Well, I guess some folks will not miss it.
3809000	3815000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, it's so weird that the Battle.net name is going away.
3815000	3819000	Maybe they felt that in today's climate it's too confrontational.
3819000	3823000	That can't be it. What are they going to do? Patch it out of Diablo 2?
3823000	3827000	Because isn't the name Battle.net in Diablo 2? Are they going to patch it out of Diablo 2?
3827000	3829000	Which I think they're still selling, right?
3829000	3832000	Diablo 2 is still something you can buy at a store.
3832000	3834000	Like the big box and all that stuff.
3834000	3838000	That game is the longest running game probably ever of sorts.
3838000	3842000	Unless you count the millions of times they've re-released Pac-Man.
3842000	3849000	Then again, they patched Diablo 2 as recently as last year.
3849000	3853000	So, it's not out of the question, but it just seems a little silly.
3853000	3856000	Let's see.
3856000	3862000	Raginator says, Blizzard launcher sounds like a great gun for a sci-fi fantasy first person shooter.
3862000	3866000	A gun that shoots out Blizzards like a grenade launcher.
3866000	3869000	Is that Maze Weapon in Overwatch? No, close.
3869000	3872000	That's more of a DQ thing.
3873000	3880000	Let's see. Raginator says, I bought Diablo 2 in October 2012. It's my first PC game. I bought it from Target.
3880000	3885000	I bought Diablo 2 as one of my first PC games too, but that was like 99? 2000?
3885000	3887000	I never bought Diablo.
3887000	3891000	I think the original Diablo I'm thinking of. I don't think Diablo 2 is that old.
3891000	3899000	I never bought Diablo or Diablo 2, but I did play the demo or shareware or whatever version of Diablo they had that came with PC Gamer.
3899000	3903000	Because PC Gamer used to have all those cool demo discs and everything.
3903000	3906000	Like the old PlayStation Magazine had all the old games.
3906000	3907000	That was awesome.
3907000	3911000	I played that first stage of Parappa the Rappa on the demo disc to death.
3911000	3915000	I had that song memorized. That's why I still love it today, I think.
3915000	3918000	Moving on, let's talk about Steam.
3918000	3921000	Some people are going to raise their eyebrows at this headline.
3921000	3926000	Super Mario Bros. 3 is now available on Steam.
3926000	3930000	Hold on, it's not what you think. That was my click-baity phrase.
3930000	3935000	Here's what it really is. It's The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3.
3935000	3939000	It's not a game. It's actually a TV cartoon.
3939000	3943000	This was kind of the spiritual successor, I guess, to the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.
3943000	3949000	It didn't run for very long. It was 13 episodes long, but it was a cartoon series.
3949000	3954000	It did not have the Captain Lou cutaways or any of that stuff. It was just 100% cartoon.
3954000	3957000	I think they would air it with Captain N. It was on around the same time.
3957000	3961000	So it was like Captain N and then you'd have the Super Mario Bros. 3 adventures.
3961000	3965000	So you can get those episodes now on Steam because remember,
3965000	3967000	Steam has been getting into video recently.
3967000	3970000	So this is a logical thing for them to get into.
3970000	3973000	And although you might want to put on your tin foil hats and go,
3973000	3976000	OMG, Nintendo is testing the waters with Steam.
3976000	3979000	No, no, no, no, no. Hold up, hold up.
3979000	3985000	The rights to this show are with Cookie Jar, which is the company that actually put all this together.
3985000	3987000	So this is one of those rare cases.
3987000	3991000	Because that was back in the day when Nintendo was still willing to do that stuff
3991000	3993000	because the movie hadn't happened yet.
3993000	3998000	So technically this was not a Nintendo decision to do.
3998000	4004000	But certainly something where it's the right audience to put this in front of.
4004000	4008000	I'm sure there will be people that want to check that out.
4008000	4011000	So there you go. The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 on Steam.
4011000	4015000	Is that on Netflix? Because they had the Mario Bros. Super Show for a while on Netflix, didn't they?
4015000	4021000	They used to have the Sonic the Hedgehog stuff in the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.
4021000	4026000	And it's probably on there. I haven't looked.
4026000	4029000	Alright, what's up?
4029000	4032000	Orange Right says, wow, they even have the Milli Vanilli episode.
4032000	4034000	I don't even remember that being a thing.
4034000	4038000	I'm going to be honest. I remember the Super Mario Bros. Super Show for sure.
4038000	4041000	And I remember there was a Mario Bros. 3 cartoon.
4041000	4045000	And so maybe I saw an episode, but I don't think it was around very long.
4045000	4049000	And I just don't think I saw more of it than that.
4049000	4052000	Yeah, I don't remember. It all kind of blends together.
4052000	4053000	Alright, anyway.
4053000	4057000	Alright, so there's some more NX rumors.
4057000	4061000	Oh joy! Our favorite part of every episode of Orange on video.
4061000	4067000	This apparently is coming from, I want to say, some Foxconn employee that I guess in the past,
4067000	4070000	and I'm not so sure about the past on this,
4070000	4075000	he had sketched pictures of some of the other consoles that were coming out.
4075000	4081000	So he had basically there, he saw what the consoles looked like, and he's kind of described what it looks like.
4081000	4083000	So take this with a grain of salt.
4083000	4088000	But apparently, I don't know, I guess he was reliable in the past, so that's why people are paying attention to this, so we'll see.
4088000	4089000	Alright.
4089000	4096000	And normally I would kind of take a big deep sigh at this, but this seems something like,
4096000	4101000	with everything we've heard until now, this seems really plausible to me.
4101000	4107000	But again, like everything with NX, I'm taking it with a big grain of salt, and I'm not setting my expectations.
4107000	4112000	Right. So the NX, what they describe is basically three pieces.
4112000	4119000	It's a home console, and it's also like a portable or a hybrid type device.
4119000	4125000	It includes basically the console, which is like, think of it like a dock for the actual controller thing.
4125000	4132000	The dock thing contains basically a hard drive, the cartridge slot, and other interfaces.
4132000	4138000	They say it also supports TV output, but there's no GPU or CPU built into it.
4138000	4145000	There's this separate device that looks like the size of a power brick that's called a performance module,
4145000	4148000	and it's a device that provides the power supply.
4148000	4154000	It has a power supply, which contains like a separate battery and also a GPU, CPU inside of it.
4154000	4157000	It supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other wired connections.
4157000	4164000	You plug the dock inside, and it becomes the console thing.
4164000	4172000	And then also you can take it with you as, I don't know, it's really confusing.
4172000	4177000	So they say basically the screen looks similar to like a Wii U tablet thing.
4177000	4184000	So the six inch 720p screen, they're saying that basically if you use it by itself,
4184000	4187000	it can do like basic operations with lower graphics quality.
4187000	4192000	But when the performance module's attached to it, it has higher performance graphics,
4192000	4197000	and they say console level graphics comparing to like the Nvidia Shield.
4197000	4205000	And you can bring the performance module with you portable since it has its own battery.
4205000	4208000	So it just sounds weird.
4208000	4215000	So basically in a nutshell, they said it's a two in one portable, three parts dock, built in hard drive, all that stuff,
4215000	4219000	the handheld and everything, less powerful than the PlayStation 4 obviously,
4219000	4225000	and they're thinking it's going to be revealed in October, and yeah, I don't know.
4225000	4227000	I mean, it just sounds weird.
4227000	4235000	It sounds weird, and that's almost kind of why I'm like, I feel like this, you know, again, I'm not going to set my expectations.
4235000	4240000	As long as the games are good, this stuff is sort of inconsequential.
4240000	4245000	But, you know, we've heard obviously these rumors about the whole fact it's a console, it's a handheld,
4245000	4248000	and this whole back and forth has been going on for a very long time.
4248000	4252000	But yet whenever we see kind of the feedback of what other people are saying about it,
4252000	4255000	it's kind of like you get that impression like, no, they've done something more.
4255000	4258000	Like it's not just like a Wii U like that.
4258000	4266000	And so this power brick that you're talking about, which to me sounds an awful lot like when I go to an all day Ingress event,
4266000	4270000	and I have to take one of those bricks to charge my phone, like, you know, those big cell phone battery bricks.
4270000	4272000	It sounds like one of those.
4272000	4278000	So it's like, okay, well, you could have a handheld that just is, it's kind of like having a DS or whatever,
4278000	4280000	2DS or something like that, no big deal, right?
4280000	4285000	But if you wanted to, you could soup it up with this small brick.
4285000	4289000	Nintendo, what they've done with this is that they've scaled it down, the power of a console,
4289000	4292000	they've scaled down to such this small size.
4292000	4293000	The size of a NUYA.
4293000	4297000	Well, essentially, that you could take that with you as well.
4297000	4301000	And so this way you could get console style gaming on the go.
4301000	4308000	And I think a big part of that selling point is going to be that you could get a fighting game like Smash Brothers
4308000	4311000	set up like, you know, really easily.
4311000	4317000	And I'm assuming this little power device or whatever it is probably has some type of HDMI output on it.
4317000	4323000	So it is really, really easy to set up this thing as a console anywhere.
4323000	4326000	And it's interesting.
4326000	4331000	But again, you know, because this is a rumor, because it's a sketch, I'm kind of going,
4331000	4333000	but if this isn't it, eh, no big deal.
4333000	4336000	You know, it's kind of like one of those, I'm prepared to be disappointed,
4336000	4340000	but this makes sense with what's out there right now.
4340000	4342000	So basically, kind of what I'm seeing.
4342000	4345000	Nintendo's taken that power and made it the size of a cell phone.
4345000	4348000	So they have like this dock that you'd basically leave on your TV.
4348000	4352000	And then they have like the guts of the console as its own separate thing.
4352000	4359000	And then they have, you know, the tablet, which is basically your second screen or your Wii U type gamepad.
4359000	4365000	I think the dock, this is just, you know, again, Miss Cleo is as accurate as I am here.
4365000	4368000	This dock is probably, it's like a charging station type of thing.
4368000	4371000	And it's like, it's a nice, cute little place to store it.
4371000	4374000	They said though, they have like a hard drive and all that stuff.
4374000	4377000	And so it has your hard drive and has like your cartridge slot in there.
4377000	4380000	That doesn't, it just sounds very confusing.
4380000	4383000	I don't know how that would work if that was on the base.
4383000	4385000	If it's in the brick, I get that.
4385000	4387000	But I don't understand that on the base.
4387000	4389000	But then what would be the point even of that?
4389000	4391000	I mean, I guess other than charging your controller.
4391000	4393000	But it's just, I don't know.
4393000	4395000	Okay, let's assume that it was this.
4395000	4401000	How do you can, how do you, like it was so hard to describe what the Wii U was.
4401000	4404000	Basically it's just a system with a controller with a screen.
4404000	4406000	How the fuck do you describe this to a consumer?
4406000	4408000	They're not going to know what the fuck it is.
4408000	4416000	Well, the difference is they're going to, they're not going to sell it as the portable thing as a part of the game experience.
4416000	4420000	They're going to sell it as, again, I shouldn't say they're going to, you know.
4420000	4431000	If this was true, they would likely, they would use this as part of like the marketing would be the fact that you have this power of a console on the go.
4431000	4437000	And I think it's going to be very much about teaming up with your friends easily and kind of a lot of what they do with the DS.
4437000	4445000	But just the fact that it's going to be like the most powerful handheld and it turns into a full on console gaming experience like that.
4445000	4453000	And I think it's, the thing with the Wii U is that they never really got people to buy that for, here's how the technology makes the game better.
4453000	4456000	Here's how the detachable game pad makes the game better.
4456000	4458000	There never was really the must have games.
4458000	4461000	Now here's something though, this would be kind of cool.
4461000	4464000	What if they had GPS built into the console?
4464000	4466000	Like that little brick thing.
4466000	4467000	Oh, why not?
4467000	4468000	So like you're bringing it in.
4468000	4479000	If all that shit is in my phone, which is two year old technology at this point, iPhone 7 and the equivalent Note 7 or, you know, the kind that doesn't explode.
4479000	4483000	Is, you know, it's a very powerful little computer in your pocket.
4483000	4486000	So I absolutely believe they can get something.
4486000	4491000	I mean, if you put, what, stack four of these iPhone pluses together, that's the power brick.
4491000	4493000	And that's the type of technology that could be in it.
4493000	4494000	Right?
4494000	4495000	Doesn't that make a lot of sense?
4496000	4497000	I don't know.
4497000	4503000	It makes a lot of sense to me, but Nintendo, I mean.
4503000	4508000	I don't want to run with this too much because again, rumor, blah, blah, blah.
4508000	4521000	But it's just one of those things where I'm like, okay, well this, you know, if it's, if it is something somebody made up, that's a pretty clever little twist on what's out there that kind of matches with everything out there, if that makes sense.
4521000	4524000	So if it's fanfic, good job on your fanfic.
4524000	4525000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
4525000	4532000	On top of that, apparently someone that did actually see the device obviously would have been the head of Ubisoft.
4532000	4541000	Basically, you know, speaking to, I guess, IGN said, you know, I think once again, the interface is very attractive.
4541000	4544000	It's a machine that will be easy to use for all gamers.
4544000	4550000	They have built something that will give us a chance to really have a different experience from what exists today.
4550000	4556000	What I like is that they come up with something that's adapted to what we actually want now.
4556000	4562000	Doesn't that comment line up perfectly with that speculation though?
4562000	4571000	I mean, I want to be, I really want to be, you know, surprised and have this be something really cool.
4571000	4579000	I don't want them to like fail, but then again, they thought that like the second screen thing with the Wii U was going to be like a big fucking deal.
4579000	4582000	And it was alright, it's nice.
4582000	4591000	It is nice having that second screen thing because like my son can now, I can put the Wii U in the room and he can play on that screen and he doesn't need a TV set up there.
4591000	4593000	It's just very minimal.
4593000	4599000	I mean, that's nice, but aside from that, it's like, it wasn't like, oh my goodness, this is so revolutionary.
4599000	4600000	It just wasn't.
4600000	4605000	So I'm hoping that it's like, this is like the Wii where it's like, man, that's something no one's ever done.
4605000	4611000	That's really cool versus like, we think this is something that no one's ever done and that they're going to be really cool, but it's just not.
4611000	4613000	It's something that's common.
4613000	4615000	It's ultimately up to the games.
4615000	4616000	It's just that simple.
4616000	4619000	You know, the problem here, here it is right here.
4619000	4623000	Nintendo Land was not Wii Sports.
4623000	4624000	End of story.
4624000	4629000	So if the NX or whatever it ends up being called has its Wii Sports, we're good.
4629000	4632000	It's all about that game.
4632000	4633000	Games, really.
4633000	4640000	You know, because, you know, the Wii also had, you know, Zelda and, you know, some of the really cool stuff that it launched with.
4640000	4645000	And the Wii U's launch lineup was all rehashes from the year before.
4645000	4652000	So, you know, I think if it's true that they've delayed NX to get that more powerful launch lineup, that's going to be so important.
4652000	4656000	And here's the thing, though, I'm a little worried about, though, is that they're mentioning the console.
4656000	4663000	I understand that it doesn't have to be on par with the other consoles, but I'm worried we're going to have a problem all over again with third-party support.
4663000	4667000	Yeah, I know the Wii U didn't really need, didn't have that, but great.
4667000	4671000	They have first-party games coming out, but there's not, you're going to have to have two consoles.
4671000	4674000	And being, striving to be number two is kind of dumb.
4674000	4681000	I'm with you and I'm not, because this could be Nintendo saying they're not focusing on a living room console.
4681000	4685000	I mean, yes, it will play in your living room, but this experience is portable.
4685000	4692000	And the only people they compete with in that space is the phones, which is really weird that they're making phone games,
4692000	4698000	but I guess, you know, Nintendo could ultimately try to say, like, you know, your phone can only do so much.
4698000	4703000	Your phone doesn't have a controller. Your phone, they're going to try to show experiences you can't get on your phone.
4703000	4704000	Absolutely.
4704000	4705000	That's going to be the key part.
4705000	4713000	I'm surprised we still haven't gotten some sort of standardized controller for phones yet, but, I don't know.
4713000	4720000	I just, I mean, think about it. It's just like, hey, yeah, we can't compete with consoles, so we're just, we're not going out.
4720000	4722000	We're just going to compete with it.
4722000	4724000	Nintendo's not going to say we're not going to compete with consoles.
4724000	4729000	Nintendo's always been the whole, like, well, we're going to just do something different.
4729000	4733000	Ever since the Wii, now they're just like, we're just going to do something different.
4733000	4736000	Like, Sony, Microsoft, they can fight in their space, we're going to do something different.
4736000	4741000	That's been their MO since the GameCube did not turn into the PlayStation 2.
4741000	4749000	But sometimes people don't want different, and, I mean, it's nice that that different is good, and it's some innovative thing that people are actually looking for.
4749000	4752000	But don't just be different, just be different.
4752000	4756000	Alright, let's get to some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4756000	4765000	First off, we have SHO100Matt who says, serious question, for this to be worth it for consumers, do you think it needs to be $400 and or under to survive in the market?
4765000	4767000	Honestly, I'm not sure.
4767000	4780000	This could really go anywhere, but with the type of technology Loki describes, I actually think part of their trick might be to release something that's going to be cheap.
4780000	4792000	I'm talking, like, the price of a 3DS or something like $200. Or, you know, maybe they're going to piecemeal it. Maybe the little handheld thing works on its own.
4792000	4795000	And they can go fuck themselves if that's how they're going to fucking do that.
4795000	4799000	I don't know. Again, that is rampant, awful speculation.
4799000	4809000	If that's the shit they're going to pull where it's like, hey, you get the charge base and the controller, but the performance unit or whatever, that's going to be a separate fucking $200 or something. No. Fuck that shit.
4809000	4818000	I think Nintendo will not go as high as that. They may, and again, it's about the games. If they can put the games out to justify that price, then okay.
4819000	4827000	But I don't think Nintendo will go that high. I really don't. Wii U is $250, right? That's the highest they've ever gone.
4827000	4835000	Wii U is still fucking expensive. It's too expensive. It's at the end of its life cycle, basically. I mean, I don't know.
4835000	4842000	I hope they don't delay it, because that's going to be really awkward a whole long time before some actual Nintendo games come out.
4842000	4849000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, maybe Nintendo could do a new AR game similar to Pokemon Go on what Loki was saying about the GPS.
4849000	4857000	Why wouldn't they just put Pokemon Go on that thing if the brick, if the DS thing has GPS technology?
4857000	4862000	Now, where that gets dicey is, do you have to have cellular service for that to work?
4862000	4863000	Yeah, you would need cellular service.
4863000	4876000	Maybe, and that, I don't know. But, maybe they, wasn't there like an old rumor that, you know, and again, rumor is a rumor, but wasn't there like a really old rumor that these things would connect with the PlayStation 4?
4876000	4887000	Like, wasn't that a thing, like a while ago? Like, some wank that somebody had written somewhere that this actually, maybe the device, yeah, like, no, like, no, like, dang it.
4887000	4892000	I could swear that was something like a wank thing that had come up in a previous week and we all kind of wrote it off as LOL.
4892000	4905000	But maybe, like the Pokemon Go Plus thing talks to my phone? Maybe this NX thing will, or the brick or something pairs with your phone.
4905000	4921000	Well, yeah, you can, you can, well, I'm okay. But why would I do that at that point? I would just say, yes, I'm carrying like this giant fucking, I'm carrying this stupid power brick, I'm carrying this giant screen and my fucking phone to play Pokemon Go.
4921000	4933000	That's on my phone. This sounds like a perfect solution to my problem that I don't have because I can play on my phone. I, that just, yeah, that, no, it's a terrible idea.
4933000	4942000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says tether the NX to your phone via Bluetooth. Let's start that rumor. You can tether the NX to your phone's GPS and 4G. It sounds plausible.
4942000	4945000	Sounds good. Go to NeoGAF. Go ride it.
4945000	4947000	To the GAF.
4947000	4949000	Confirmed.
4949000	4951000	Just kidding.
4951000	4958000	It's, it's fun to dream and speculate, but at the end of the day, just announce, tell us what it is already.
4958000	4966000	Listen, it's, it's the, the, the recipe for success is already there. We just completely miss it.
4966000	4972000	Listen, three components, Half-Life 3 confirmed.
4973000	4989000	Stop it. Somebody in chat said that too. All right. Let's, uh, let's move on. Well, speaking of Pokemon, uh, you know, you can play Pokemon Go on this device possibly, but there's something else Pokemon that will be coming to the NX.
4989000	5001000	And that's not a rumor. That's confirmed. The Pokemon company has confirmed they are developing games for Nintendo's next generation platform. Of course, this, whatever it is, the NX, whatever it is.
5001000	5020000	And this was in an interview with the wall street journal where the chief executive of the Pokemon company actually mentioned, uh, Pokemon company's chief executive said Tuesday, his company's plans to create game for Nintendo's next generation system, which people familiar with the plan say is likely to melt features of traditional consoles and handheld devices.
5020000	5036000	Here's the quote. The NX is trying to change the concept of what it means to be a home console device or a handheld device. And that's all from that Pokemon company interview. And so yes, Pokemon will be on this device, but will it be a mainline game?
5036000	5050000	Will they do a special version of sun and moon will eighth gen be on the NX will a remake of the original one 51, which Shane will hate, but would that be on the NX or will they do something different?
5050000	5061000	I mean, certainly what it could be stadium. It could be snap. It could be mystery dungeon. It could be one of the 11 billion spinoff franchises there are for Pokemon, but something by the Pokemon company will be on this.
5061000	5079000	NX device. And so, you know, if it, if it is huge, if, if it is a mainline Pokemon game, be that a port of sun or moon, or, you know, sometimes, you know how, like they, they sometimes do like what there was red, blue, and then yellow, you know, and that whole thing, like there's the, the, the later game.
5079000	5085000	Maybe they do like a, a sun, a moon, and then dusk or something like that.
5085000	5088000	Oh no, sun, moon, and an eclipse, of course.
5088000	5097000	Okay. All right. Or that or whatever. So there's some other type of game like that that comes out for the, like the NX, but again, that part is speculation.
5097000	5109000	But it would be, it would be very interesting because that means you would be able to play a mainline Pokemon game on your television, not through some type of emulation or Super Game Boy Advance or GameCube, something like that.
5109000	5116000	That means, you know, that would be an experience that's essentially designed with the television in mind, as well as handheld. That could be very interesting.
5116000	5129000	And something I'd, I'd be very excited about, but we'll see. We'll see. Who knows if it'll be revealed as early as when they announce the NX as possible launch title. I suppose anything's possible.
5129000	5130000	Yeah.
5130000	5144000	RageNator in chat says, don't you mean, aw snap, snap two would be awesome. Yeah, snap two would be awesome, but they are putting snap-esque type of features in the upcoming sun and moon.
5144000	5153000	That was something that they revealed. So I kind of think they're just trying to put that there to appease the fan mail and tweets I'm sure they get saying, bring back snap.
5153000	5158000	That's what they're doing is incorporating it into gen seven. Anyway, Loki.
5158000	5167000	So the fan game Pokemon Uranium is ceasing development. They're going to be pulling down their download links and all that stuff.
5168000	5175000	Basically just saying, you know, unfortunately as Pokemon Uranium is a fan game, there's a limit to how far projects such as these can go.
5175000	5186000	And we are therefore ceasing development on this project as such, we the creators of the game will no longer be offering game downloads, updates, online services or support for Pokemon Uranium.
5186000	5192000	Well that and also they got a C and D a while back. So that's probably a little bit, they have to do with it.
5192000	5197000	But I'm sure if you want to play it, it's available online somewhere. So go find it.
5199000	5207000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, just make a similar game without the Pokemon IP. If you don't think that can work Undertale says hi.
5207000	5217000	So you could, you could do your own type of pocket monster game, except you have to call it something different. Like a little monster, Litmon, get lit.
5218000	5220000	Little monsters, get lit mon.
5223000	5229000	That would actually work with Uranium too, cause it's radioactive. Litmon, I like that.
5229000	5230000	Vapemon.
5234000	5241000	It's the game that all the hipsters play. I love it. Let's see, Raman in chat says chibi monsters, chibi mom.
5242000	5250000	Raginator says you are mon. I think usually that phrase is you're a mom, not you're a mon. Anyway.
5250000	5255000	So speaking of Loki going the Wii U is too expensive, blah blah blah blah blah.
5255000	5264000	Apparently something's happening over in Europe where Wii U's are no longer going to be available after October 1st.
5264000	5274000	Note, that is for the retailers to order, that does not mean Wii U's are suddenly going to disappear from store shelves starting on October 1st.
5274000	5283000	Apparently what's happening in the article that was published by Game Seek, retailers in the UK are being asked to put their final orders in for the Wii U.
5283000	5292000	Nintendo is now taking final orders on Wii U consoles. Those that haven't ordered by the end of September 30th will not be able to order the Wii U again from Nintendo.
5293000	5300000	Well, that's a good sign. Hopefully that means that the console is still coming out on time, but then again, fuck ups do happen.
5300000	5307000	Again, they're still going to have the inventory on hand to sell off if you're like, oh no, I'm not going to get a Wii U this holiday.
5307000	5310000	I think Nintendo kind of knows the demand for Wii U is going to be low.
5310000	5314000	Honestly, if you haven't picked one up by now, just hold off.
5315000	5324000	But it's weird that they haven't pulled the plug with the Zelda game coming out, you know, unless it is for sure happening or NX is coming out the same time.
5324000	5328000	It'll be the Twilight Princess of the console.
5328000	5332000	Oh, yeah, where the GameCube 1 gets ignored pretty much.
5332000	5337000	No, I'm just saying it's basically the last game to come out for the console.
5337000	5339000	Oh, yeah, I gotcha.
5339000	5348000	So, we'll see. Again, you know, I wouldn't read too much into that. It's nothing that we kind of don't already know.
5348000	5361000	The only thing about that is that it would seem to confirm there is no delay, and it could mean that Nintendo is going to announce something around October 1st, which would be next week.
5362000	5371000	In order to, you know, because once they kind of make that announcement, then they really know that a lot of people are going to start thinking like you, where it's like, well, why do I need a Wii U? Because I want this thing.
5371000	5381000	Especially if this new thing plays Wii U games, which maybe the base, here's more fan wank, maybe the base has a disc reader on it or something.
5381000	5384000	You could play the Wii U games. That's all digital. I'm sure it's all digital.
5384000	5391000	It's all digital. But hey, it would be nice if like, you know, since I do buy mostly digital games now, if I could port over my digital games to that.
5391000	5402000	Of course, you know, most of these, you know, companies, Nintendo included, oh, well, we have no way of talking to get our one database over here. Can't talk to the other database.
5402000	5408000	So you got to buy those fucking Wii U titles or those virtual console titles for our fourth fucking time or whatever the case may be.
5408000	5411000	Well, the Nintendo Network, though, has brought all that together.
5411000	5412000	Has it?
5412000	5419000	Well, but that's when the NX was first revealed in the first place, was that they were talking about an ecosystem that would bring all that together.
5419000	5423000	But anyway, I'm done with the NX wank. Next story.
5423000	5425000	I'll believe it when I see it, that's for sure.
5425000	5427000	Until two weeks. Two week break from NX wank.
5427000	5439000	So if only I had this, you know, option, you know, several was it months now, several months ago when I actually purchased a controller, a Bluetooth controller for my Samsung Gear VR.
5439000	5446000	Well, now Microsoft announced that it would be expanding its support for the Xbox one controller to the Gear VR.
5446000	5452000	So you can actually use that in Minecraft Gear VR edition if you want.
5453000	5458000	You know, their controllers are nice, so I would definitely consider that if I hadn't already bought one.
5458000	5461000	Yeah. Well, I was going to say, don't you already have a Gear VR?
5461000	5464000	I already have a Gear VR that I don't play very often.
5464000	5466000	Well, maybe it's time to dust it off.
5468000	5472000	All right. We're about to get to the classic of the week, but I'm going to do one more story here.
5472000	5476000	And I honestly, I don't want to talk about it, but because it gets into politics.
5476000	5478000	That's why I didn't put in.
5478000	5486000	But here's the thing. A, we have an email on it later. B, I could kind of go, this has nothing to do with gaming.
5486000	5491000	But when you've got developers talking about that they're not going to make games on stuff.
5494000	5501000	Here's the thing. I'm going to just mention it for the sake of mentioning it because it is something that's out there in gaming culture.
5501000	5505000	But I just like, I just don't want to argue tonight.
5506000	5511000	Wasn't the NX wank enough? I just, I don't have it in me. I don't have it in me tonight.
5511000	5516000	Here's the thing. All right. I'm sure you've all seen this going on on social media.
5516000	5521000	And there's a lot of controversy around Palmer Luckey, who's one of the Oculus co-founders.
5521000	5527000	And it was, it came to light that there was some controversial political giving going on.
5527000	5539000	And that allegedly, Palmer Luckey was giving some money to this organization that makes, they make like memes that are really, they have some Reddit.
5539000	5547000	And it's a lot of like, here's the thing. One side, the side that kind of exposed all this said, this is the shady side of the internet.
5547000	5554000	This is where they do a lot of these dumpy memes. This is where a lot of this gets into the really gross stuff.
5554000	5561000	It's the dank meme factory and all that. And this is all going on over here.
5561000	5569000	And, but then, you know, to be fair, Palmer, and I was, I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop when this, this information came out.
5569000	5573000	I said, all right, well, the guy is going to make a statement in three, two, one.
5573000	5582000	And sure enough, Palmer Luckey came out and actually made a statement that he had given $10,000 to Nimble America, which was the organization.
5582000	5590000	Yes, he did give the $10,000 to that. And, but he was not pro-Trump.
5590000	5595000	He was actually voting for the libertarian candidate. He's voting for Gary Johnson.
5595000	5606000	And he was under the impression that this organization was to energize the youth vote, basically, that it was to try to get more younger people to vote.
5606000	5613000	I guess by getting on the cool and hip Reddits, I don't, you can just imagine how that boardroom presentation went or whatever.
5613000	5620000	So he thought he was giving money to the youth vote, this $10,000. He doesn't plan to donate again.
5620000	5630000	But a lot of people have said, oh, fuck this, because, and even for me, I'm like, I don't really give a shit if he's voting for Trump.
5630000	5639000	I mean, I kind of look at that and go, girl, but the part of this country is you have the freedom to vote for whoever you want.
5639000	5652000	That's why you vote, right? So I'm not going to be all like, oh, well, shit, we got to just fucking boycott the entire Oculus company because one dude plans to vote for Trump.
5653000	5664000	I understand why people might kind of like be really angry because this is an election that's stirring a lot of feelings.
5664000	5670000	And it's just, it's really getting gross. Like, it's just, I can't wait for this shit to be over.
5670000	5674000	Like, I just, but then it's like, well, then in four more years, we'll fucking go through it again.
5674000	5678000	But it's just like, it's just especially ugly this year, right? This whole thing.
5678000	5682000	But here's the thing, and this is what didn't sit right with me when all this news came out.
5682000	5687000	Because the news comes out and you've got these developers saying, oh, I'm going to pull support from Oculus.
5687000	5692000	We're not going to make our game for Oculus anymore unless this guy gets fired and dah, dah, dah, dah, and all this stuff.
5692000	5696000	It's like you don't even have like all the full information. You're already jumping to them.
5696000	5700000	And honestly, and this might surprise some of you because yes, I do tend to be very liberal.
5700000	5704000	I don't support people that don't support LGBT rights, period.
5704000	5708000	I don't support bullying online and all that stuff, period.
5708000	5712000	But with that kind of also goes the fact that, well, wait a minute.
5712000	5717000	Because I was looking at that going, well, hold on. Does this guy, and I could be wrong on this.
5717000	5725000	Does this guy still make money from Oculus currently? Didn't all his money come from the sale from Facebook?
5725000	5729000	So what are you going to do? What are you going to do?
5729000	5737000	By that logic, if you're going to get rid of your Oculus Rift, delete your Facebook account.
5737000	5741000	Facebook's the one that gave the money, right?
5741000	5750000	And the other thing is that Oculus has obviously thousands of employees, and I don't think all of them feel this way.
5750000	5758000	And I think there's a lot that recognize this organization is shady and has people with ties to shady things.
5758000	5760000	And we don't want to support this type of thing.
5760000	5768000	And at the same time that this is all going on, I was looking at, because VOG Network is sponsoring GamerX this coming weekend,
5768000	5772000	I was looking at who's sponsoring the upcoming convention.
5772000	5775000	Oculus is a sponsor of GamerX.
5775000	5782000	So I kind of looked at it, which obviously GamerX and that organization is not going to tolerate this type of bullshit.
5782000	5786000	That's a lot of what it's against, right?
5786000	5796000	So it's like the Oculus founder took the money, ran off, and did this one donation.
5796000	5800000	And you can do what you want with your money in America and that whole type of thing.
5800000	5804000	I'm not sure I'm okay faulting the entire company, Oculus, for that,
5804000	5813000	when at the same time what the company is doing by sponsoring something like GamerX says that they don't want to support diversity.
5813000	5819000	I have a hard time believing that he was being malicious about it.
5819000	5821000	Like, oh, I hate all those gays.
5821000	5826000	Let's make some anti-gay memes or anti-Hillary memes or whatever.
5826000	5832000	That's not the libertarian perspective anyway. The libertarian perspective is marijuana.
5832000	5834000	No, I'm kidding. Don't send the angry emails.
5834000	5836000	Hey, but get out and vote because that is on the ballot this year.
5836000	5841000	But that's kind of not part of that viewpoint anyway.
5841000	5850000	But it's just, I don't know. I wasn't quite ready to say, and I have boycotted organizations before.
5850000	5857000	I was not comfortable when Chick-fil-A was sending all that money to anti-GLBT organizations.
5857000	5866000	Now, it caused a really interesting sort of twist because here locally we had a local franchise owner
5866000	5872000	that was actually donating to pro-LGBT organizations to offset what the corporate was doing basically.
5872000	5877000	And so it's kind of one of those moral quandaries like, okay, so can I eat this chicken sandwich?
5877000	5885000	So I ate the damn sandwich because, you know what, if I were to boycott every single stinking thing
5885000	5891000	that was related to somebody who had this really gross opinion somewhere in the line,
5891000	5894000	I think I'd be boycotting a lot more than I probably currently am.
5894000	5898000	Besides, we all use cable companies and internet and all that stuff like that.
5898000	5905000	And most of those are lining the pockets of people in the government that are making bad decisions to further screw us.
5905000	5908000	So are you going to boycott internet too?
5908000	5914000	However, I want to make this very clear because I don't want to make it sound like I'm 100% supportive of this guy either
5914000	5923000	because I'm not. But I don't want necessarily all the other 1,900 people who are working at Oculus to have to suffer,
5923000	5927000	especially when the company is kind of putting out this conflicting message.
5927000	5934000	But I just want to make very clear, I don't support online bullying and all that crap whatsoever.
5934000	5938000	And that shit needs to stop. Twitter needs to step up and do more.
5938000	5943000	If they can put fucking read receipts on direct messages, they can hold accounts more accountable
5943000	5945000	for some of the shit that they put out there.
5945000	5951000	And so I understand if people want to sever ties with anybody that would associate themselves
5951000	5954000	with that dark underbelly of the internet, I understand that.
5954000	5957000	So I want to make that very, very, very, very clear.
5957000	5960000	But for me, it's kind of one of those, well, wait a minute.
5960000	5967000	I wasn't ready to throw that all out just yet because I felt like the facts are not all in place.
5967000	5968000	And now it's really muddied.
5968000	5974000	But it's going to be really interesting because Oculus is going to have this booth at GamerX in four days.
5974000	5982000	And so there's going to be a lot of people there who have been targets sometimes of some of this bullying and all that stuff.
5982000	5986000	And so Oculus in some way is going to have something to answer to.
5986000	5988000	So it's a really awkward position.
5988000	5991000	So this whole thing is awkward and it's why I didn't want to talk about it in the first place,
5991000	5994000	but people are threatening to stop making games. It is awkward.
5994000	5995000	It's the whole thing is awkward.
5995000	6000000	Awkward like having a console that's comprised of three different parts that are both independent from each other.
6001000	6008000	Oh, God, I admit I did not look at chat throughout that whole thing because if I did, I would keep getting sidetracked.
6008000	6010000	Don't you know you never read chat? Never read the comments.
6010000	6014000	No, hear it, hear it, dog. It's OK. I can look at the chat.
6014000	6020000	So I'm trying to scan through and look at some of the comments here in chat.
6020000	6023000	So let's see. Legend of Zaku in chat says,
6023000	6027000	the fact that Oculus is sponsoring GamerX will make for some interesting reactions.
6027000	6029000	I wouldn't be surprised if folks protest their booth.
6029000	6033000	I hope not. Like, let's have a conversation.
6033000	6036000	I mean, the guy did apologize.
6036000	6040000	I understand that people are reading into that and saying, well, there might be some untruth in the apology and all that.
6040000	6044000	But I feel like, OK, we're at least trying to get to the bottom is,
6044000	6048000	can we all agree that we need to stop bullying each other online?
6048000	6053000	Can we start there? Because maybe if we can, then maybe we can avoid a lot of that stuff.
6053000	6058000	And also, who cares? Like, I don't care. I really don't care.
6059000	6063000	I mean, who cares now? Does this affect the Oculus in any way?
6063000	6066000	No. Does it make it any better? No.
6066000	6071000	Probably get a Vive anyways. Does this mean the controllers are coming out anytime sooner?
6071000	6075000	No. So I don't care.
6075000	6079000	The Vive has some better games on it right now anyway. Exactly.
6079000	6083000	That's the other reality is it's like if I'm going to say I'm not going to buy an Oculus,
6083000	6087000	I have a perfectly other reason for saying that.
6087000	6093000	Well, the Vive is the game. Are you getting into like who's going to actually not be supporting you because of the drama?
6093000	6096000	Or are you going to be doing that? Well, I don't I don't have a list.
6096000	6099000	I know there's been several. OK, what if it was Polytron?
6099000	6103000	OK, I would feel fish. Don't fucking care. I mean, seriously, just don't.
6103000	6107000	And basically you're saying they're dropping the Oculus support because of this.
6107000	6114000	No, I think you were just dropping it because more people probably have a Vive right now, to be honest.
6115000	6125000	Let's see. Trying to scan in some other comments. Bobby Black Wolf says Oculus came out in a statement that he was doing this with his personal money and was not doing it on behalf of his employer.
6125000	6130000	Do you I don't know if I should tell this on air, but I guess I'm going to now.
6130000	6136000	Do you remember when Prop 8 was the thing? And obviously because that was the whole banning gay marriage thing.
6136000	6141000	Obviously, I was very, very against that, but it passed anyway. But the public perception has changed since then.
6141000	6150000	Do you know that they made the donor list like public, like you could find out like who had donated it to it and with it, you could they'd have to put their list place of work.
6150000	6157000	So, you know, I scan that list and I found coworkers on that list. And so it and I shouldn't have done it.
6157000	6163000	I really shouldn't have done it. And I never and I never they weren't people that I like work with frequently or anything like that.
6163000	6168000	But they were just like names I recognize, just like, you know, high up people in other departments and stuff like that.
6168000	6176000	But like, was I going to sabotage my own company because people associated with my company had donated money towards this horrific cause?
6176000	6183000	And it's like, no, I kind of can't do that because this is the company that, you know, I'm very happy with. Right.
6183000	6186000	And all that stuff. So, no, I can't do that.
6186000	6193000	And honestly, I could probably look up any company in the Fortune 500 that list of the biggest companies.
6193000	6198000	Right. I could look up any company in that list and somebody from that company probably donated to Prop 8.
6198000	6204000	So I think it just goes to show maybe what we just need more of is maybe education. I don't know.
6204000	6209000	Maybe we need to educate before we boycott. If education falls on deaf ears, then we boycott the whole type of thing.
6209000	6214000	I don't know. But that's just that's just where my head's at with all this stuff.
6214000	6219000	OK, we got through it. Yay. Let's let's go back.
6219000	6226000	Let's go to a time when things were simpler. You know what? We're going to we're going to take a take a step back into a more classic time.
6226000	6233000	We're going to go back to when you didn't know the political leanings of individuals because you were getting fed information once a month.
6233000	6237000	There was no fucking Internet. That's right. There was no Internet.
6237000	6244000	Let's go back to a simpler time with a segment we like to call the classic game of the week.
6244000	6251000	And thanks to the magic of the interwebs, radio interwebs, we're joined by Dark Sakura.
6251000	6255000	Hello. Hi. How are you? Purple and blue. Yes.
6255000	6260000	She's I know this is radio, so you don't get to see it, but you'll just have to imagine it.
6260000	6266000	Dark Sakura is rocking a purple and blue hairstyle, but it's very like it's not like punk rock, but a little punk rock.
6266000	6269000	Yeah, it's it's a blue to purple.
6270000	6276000	I like it. It's cute. Thank you. And my inspiration for the cut was kind of Ramona flowers.
6276000	6282000	OK, I got it. So, you know, even though we're not a video, people can't see you.
6282000	6286000	They could see it at GamerX this coming weekend. They can.
6286000	6291000	Hopefully I won't have roots by then. Or you'll just have to get it redyed real quick.
6291000	6294000	I have to not I'm not going to be doing my Monokuma cosplay.
6294000	6300000	I'm sorry to hear that because somebody had to schedule a cosplay on Sunday morning.
6300000	6305000	Who does that? Yeah, the timing's a little little funky this year, but we do have the panel.
6305000	6309000	Yes. So come see us at the panel. Maybe I'll make the Monokuma mask.
6309000	6317000	That would be something. All right. Let's get to a little bit simpler time, though, before we had all these fancy conventions with cosplay.
6317000	6320000	Actually, we did have those 10 years ago, but I've got nothing else for a transition.
6320000	6323000	So the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura, what'd you pick this week?
6323000	6326000	I picked Sohkyu Gurantai.
6326000	6331000	Gurantai. Hey, it means Blue Sky Crimson Lotus Squad,
6331000	6339000	which is a game, a vertical scrolling shooter in the vein of, I would say,
6339000	6347000	radiant silver gun. Stylistically, it looks very similar, but this game was an arcade game that came out.
6348000	6350000	It's only in Japan, by the way.
6350000	6358000	But there was the arcade version in 1996, and then it came out on the sake of Saturn, February 7th, 1997,
6358000	6365000	and then on PlayStation on December 25th, 1997, and a rerelease May 22nd, 2003.
6365000	6372000	It also had mobile versions. It was, now keep in mind, these were the older Japanese phones,
6372000	6378000	but they were the EasyWeb, iMode, and Yahoo version for mobile.
6378000	6384000	That was like when Japan had iPhone, Android-type stuff while we were still rocking flip phones, right?
6384000	6387000	Well, it was actually all that shit on a flip phone.
6387000	6394000	I remember my flip phone would play a crappy little Castlevania clone, but it wasn't very good.
6394000	6400000	Well, anyway, this game is put out by a company called Rising, with a Z in the middle.
6400000	6407000	And they actually did do an English version of the game called Terradiver, but it never came out.
6407000	6415000	So the biggest version that people know is the Saturn version, the Saturn version being probably the best version of it.
6415000	6420000	And if somebody wants to give me this, please do, because I would desperately like a copy.
6420000	6423000	But not paying radiant silver gun money.
6424000	6427000	Anyway, like I said, it is a vertical scrolling shooter.
6427000	6434000	You can pick three different ships, red, blue, or green. Each of them have their pilot and a fire pattern and a laser web.
6434000	6441000	Each ship has a gun and a bomb, but you have this thing called a laser web,
6441000	6449000	where you hold down the button for the gun and it releases a lock-on laser web that's shaped like a cone or semi-circle.
6449000	6453000	It will destroy the enemies it locks onto after you release.
6453000	6462000	Each ship has two different lock-on weapons, and they both work for the web laser thingy.
6462000	6473000	Also, once the enemy enters a web's range, the player can destroy the enemy or multiple enemies with homing lasers or fireballs.
6473000	6484000	And the game, the interesting thing about this is that it is not set for a 3 to 4 aspect ratio like the vertically oriented monitors.
6484000	6492000	It uses a horizontal monitor, 4 to 3, like the Neo Geo shooters and radiant silver gun and giggling.
6493000	6498000	The game has a plot. It's basically after Earth is exhausted.
6498000	6507000	They start doing a space program and go to mine outside of Earth, and basically shit happens.
6507000	6513000	So, I will let you read the synopsis for yourself.
6513000	6525000	One of the things that I like though is the intro of this game, because it does this big kanji text that makes me think that when they designed Evangelion,
6525000	6539000	they totally were fans of this game and ripped the style of the text with the big, bold, white kanji with an occasional red one thrown in or a different color.
6539000	6542000	Even I'm getting that vibe from it too, from what little I see.
6542000	6552000	So, this one was originally on the STV arcade machine, and so the Sega Saturn release was pretty much as perfect as it could be.
6552000	6556000	The PlayStation version has less graphical clarity and some slowdown.
6557000	6569000	And then later on, the Saturn had a re-release. It was Silkyu Gurantai Otokyo, which is an enhanced port that fixed some bugs.
6569000	6581000	It had a playable demo of a game called Battle Garega, and of course there was a mobile phone version.
6581000	6592000	This game is actually probably one of Rising's most popular arcade games. The Saturn version was given a 92% by Consoles Plus.
6592000	6597000	And there you go. It's also just kind of fun to say, you know.
6597000	6602000	Silkyu Gurantai. Now on sale.
6602000	6605000	Or Terra Diver, although not really.
6605000	6609000	Terra Diver, that's a good name, but I like the Japanese name. It's just fun to say.
6609000	6611000	Thank you for saying it this week, Dark Sakura.
6611000	6613000	You're welcome. Do you want to try it?
6613000	6615000	No. There it is, your classic game of the week.
6615000	6618000	Oh, Silkyu Gurantai.
6618000	6620000	It wasn't as sexy that time, I gotta say.
6620000	6622000	Silkyu Gurantai.
6622000	6628000	Thank you. Much, much better. Much better when you give it the bassy, kind of George Takei style pronunciation to it.
6628000	6631000	Yeah, I have to be vocal.
6631000	6636000	Oh my. Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week. Thank you, Dark Sakura.
6636000	6637000	You're welcome.
6640000	6650000	So, I know a lot of you that like classic games really probably like Super Mario Brothers, a classic platformer.
6650000	6654000	And that's what made Super Mario Maker a pretty kick-ass game, you know?
6654000	6656000	Say what you will about the Wii U as we did earlier in the show.
6656000	6658000	That's unfortunately why I haven't been playing a lot of games.
6658000	6665000	I've been watching a lot of Let's Plays of like these really crazy glitched levels or like, you know, intricate Super Mario Maker levels.
6665000	6670000	Yeah, I always, you know, if I wasn't doing like four podcasts a week, I would do more live streaming of Mario Maker.
6670000	6673000	Because there's so much fun stuff to find in that.
6673000	6675000	So, I don't know, maybe after tonight's show or something, who knows?
6675000	6681000	But anyway, so Super Mario Maker, of course, one of the big things they announced recently is that Super Mario Maker is going to be coming to the 3DS.
6681000	6686000	And, you know, that'll I'm sure be a popular title on the 3DS as well.
6686000	6690000	So people can make levels and play them on the go and all that stuff.
6690000	6696000	But did you know that Mario Maker on the 3DS will not actually be in 3D?
6696000	6699000	It's really Super Mario Maker for 2DS.
6699000	6704000	So 3DS will not have 3D in Super Mario Maker for the 3DS.
6704000	6708000	So it is kind of silly that you see 3DS so prominently on the box art.
6708000	6713000	I mean, I understand that that's the name of the system, but it's funny that it's not in 3D.
6713000	6716000	But at the same time, what were we expecting?
6716000	6723000	You know, it would be a lot of work to go back in and probably add 3-dimension type of stuff to these levels.
6723000	6726000	It's not really a game that's going to benefit from it.
6726000	6730000	It doesn't necessitate it or necessarily benefit from it, so I'm not complaining.
6730000	6735000	It's just kind of one of those, like, oh, well, maybe the title just should have been different.
6735000	6737000	Is Super Mario Maker portable?
6737000	6738000	Super Mario Maker Go.
6738000	6742000	Super Mario Maker, you know, instead of emphasizing the 3D.
6742000	6750000	Or they can go the very uniquely well thought out titleine that they do with Smash Brothers.
6750000	6753000	Super Mario Maker for 3DS.
6753000	6758000	Which, is that Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS? That is what it's called.
6758000	6764000	But you can play it on a 2DS, so it's not really for a 3DS.
6764000	6771000	Anyway, if you want to check it out, 40 bucks is what it's going to cost you, and it is out on December 2nd.
6771000	6777000	So, I'm okay with that not having 3D, and I'm pretty sure Nintendo is done with 3D.
6777000	6785000	But the thing is, that being said, the thing that's really disappointing about it is that it doesn't support, you can't download all the levels.
6785000	6787000	You can only share locally with your friends.
6787000	6792000	I thought there was something where you could do, like, you can go on and get random levels or something like that.
6792000	6797000	Like, you still can play the shuffle modes, which just seems really weird to me.
6797000	6798000	Really?
6798000	6805000	Yeah, maybe it works differently when you're online on the internet versus when you're out on the go, because obviously that's a big problem.
6805000	6807000	When you're on the go, you can't put in a random level.
6807000	6810000	Well, that I understand, yeah, because you have to have internet in order to do that stuff.
6810000	6817000	But that would be really lame, though, if you can't, like, oh, hey, one of the best parts about Super Mario Maker, we're just not going to include it.
6817000	6824000	Yeah, and Bobby Black Wolf trying to clarify it in chat too, saying, the 100 challenges done online, yes, but you can't search for them.
6824000	6829000	So that does seem a little weird to me, because it's going online to get those courses then, but then that's it.
6829000	6833000	You can't do the search or anything like that. That seems oddly limiting.
6833000	6835000	The 3DS can't handle searching.
6835000	6840000	I guess not, but I'm going to be honest, I'm not going to buy it.
6840000	6844000	I love Mario Maker. I think it was my favorite game last year, right?
6844000	6847000	But I love it on the Wii U, and I'll just keep playing it on Wii U.
6847000	6851000	Exactly, and you know that they'll port that shit to the NX, so why even bother?
6851000	6861000	And now that we might have a discussion about, especially, hey, if they are like, it's Super Mario Maker, but we're adding new level types into it, or we're going to add Mario 2.
6861000	6868000	Mario 2 is so different though, but you know what? Shit, I'd still be here for it if they figured it out somehow.
6868000	6880000	Or like, crazy shit, like, you know in NES Remix, there's like a remix level where you play a stage from Mario 3, but you play it as the princess from Mario 2?
6880000	6888000	Like, I would love something like that, where like, you can use the Mario 2 characters in Mario Maker levels. I would love that.
6888000	6892000	So maybe, you know, if they are going to do it again on NX, like, step it up.
6892000	6908000	Or even better, like, just do Nintendo Maker where you have, you know, you could do instead of just Mario stuff, it's like, okay, this is going to be a Metroid level, or this is going to be a Mega Man level, or this is a Kirby level.
6909000	6913000	Alright, let's move on with some rapid fire news. Loki.
6913000	6927000	Alright, so, you really do need to go back to Grand Theft Auto, and especially Grand Theft Auto Online, because they keep adding all these updates, and they're really cool, but I just haven't played it in months, years.
6927000	6935000	But yeah, the new update is going to be the Biker's Update, and it basically adds the ability for you to run your own motorcycle club.
6935000	6951000	So you can have you and eight, up to eight players can lead a motorcycle club, and it has new competitive and co-op gameplay online, new motorcycles, weapons, and tattoos and hairstyles and all that stuff.
6952000	6966000	So, go check it out, because it is free, and they're going to be coming out as soon. It doesn't really have a specific date when that's going to be coming out, but I know the stunting one that they just released online is fantastic.
6966000	6978000	If you like racing in those games, especially some of the stunt races people used to make, especially when they have the, you know, course editor, it is some crazy shit out there right now, so seriously, go check that out, including myself, I need to do that.
6979000	6995000	So, Minecon was just recently hosted, and one of the things that they announced during Minecon, I guess, is that there's going to be some new download content coming to Minecraft, of course.
6995000	7015000	One of those being the Chinese mythology mashup pack is coming in an update on October 4th. It's going to add a new world that's inspired by the Far East, and I guess you'll be able to wander through like streets and stuff like that, and they have 13 new tracks that kind of go along with that, and 41 new skins.
7015000	7023000	And along with, I guess, maybe a level for the battle mini-game as well, so check it out.
7023000	7031000	One of the other things, though, that they kind of announced and then pulled back, oh, I was going to say, the mashup pack will cost you five bucks.
7031000	7048000	So, one of the things they kind of announced on Twitter and then kind of pulled back a little bit is that Minecraft is going to be the first universal cross-platform game, so that included basically PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and PC.
7048000	7049000	Oh, that's cool.
7049000	7064000	But, I think it's only in the Realms, because they released that and then they deleted the tweet for that, because the original picture had like this, you know, it showed basically all the different devices and everything, but I think it's maybe just Realms right now.
7064000	7073000	But hey, that's kind of cool, though, that they may be able to get into that and have that sort of support where you can play with anybody someday.
7073000	7084000	Because I know the PC and Pocket Edition, they're getting up there to the feature support as of, you know, what they have with the console version at least, and I'm not sure where the PC version is.
7084000	7091000	It's been a while since I've actually delved into the PC version, but, you know, tons of new things keep coming to it.
7091000	7095000	Yeah, it's a game that keeps on giving, I guess.
7095000	7109000	Anyhow, remember YouTube Live? It's still going, just, you know, YouTube. I gotta admit, though, I don't know a lot of people that stream exclusively on YouTube. I know they have some big personalities over there, obviously, but it seems like YouTube is more the place for the pre-packaged stuff.
7109000	7111000	I just don't see a lot of streaming going on over there.
7111000	7112000	There's a lot of live stuff.
7112000	7113000	I'm not knocking it. I'm not knocking it. I'm just saying.
7114000	7117000	I see a lot of live stuff, but it's mainly, like, press events and stuff.
7117000	7128000	And I'm sure there's a lot of people that do live things on YouTube. It's just that I don't really know an easy way to look for those, and, you know, I don't follow a lot of people that do that.
7128000	7140000	I mean, one of those examples, you know, way back, unfortunately, and this is, I think, before they even really did a lot of that stuff, was, you know, pushing Pixels and, you know, cooking with Unity.
7140000	7145000	Sadly, their show's been off for a long time, but they used to do live shows on YouTube.
7145000	7154000	Gotcha, gotcha. Well, YouTube trying to kind of amp up their gaming presence and all that, and this is a pretty big name for them to bring on regularly.
7154000	7166000	They were already using Geoff Keighley during E3, but Geoff Keighley is now going to be working with YouTube for a new live show that will be broadcast on Thursday nights, and it's going to be a part of YouTube gaming.
7166000	7180000	And they're going to do trailers and gameplay footage and developer interviews, and I'm assuming maybe they're trying to build a place for studios to do their reveals, kind of like they do during E3 and like they do during Geoff Keighley's video game award show and all that stuff.
7180000	7185000	So, I mean, this would be a platform for that, especially having his name tied to that.
7185000	7189000	Well, I remember, like, the old game trailers, you know, show that they used to have, so.
7189000	7197000	Yeah. He's going to be working with some other YouTubers that already are a part of this, like Nadeshot, iJustine, MatPat, iHasCupquake.
7197000	7204000	I think I've heard of one of those people, to be honest. But anyhow, because we watch different things, and that's okay, I'm sure they're very talented.
7204000	7211000	But, of course, YouTube gaming is not going to be the first live show. Thank you. Thank you.
7211000	7216000	But as far as video shows go, IGN has one, GameSpot has one, and so forth.
7216000	7222000	But, you know, YouTube's going to have that visibility because people go to YouTube for things that aren't necessarily just gaming.
7222000	7228000	Anyway, their first show is this Thursday, just in time for them to cover TwitchCon.
7228000	7232000	Which is a big thing that's going on in gaming this weekend, right?
7232000	7237000	That is kind of unfortunate that GamerX and TwitchCon end up being the same weekend.
7237000	7240000	It's kind of a bummer that it worked out that way, but yeah.
7240000	7246000	Anyway, also, Final Fantasy XV, apparently a newer build of the game was shown at EGX.
7246000	7256000	And one of the folks that writes over there was saying that, hey, there actually is some improvement shown because of this delay.
7256000	7260000	Because Final Fantasy XV, you know, next week was supposed to be the week.
7260000	7263000	Next week was supposed to be the week that we would all be playing Final Fantasy XV.
7263000	7266000	And now our gaming calendars have a hole in them.
7266000	7274000	They do. And I've been drooling over Forza Horizon 3. I'm like, yeah, I need to get an Xbox One.
7274000	7280000	Well, Forza Horizon 3 would have just been like, I hate to say dead in the water because I love Forza Horizon.
7280000	7286000	But for me personally, I would have just skipped it if Final Fantasy XV had come out the same day.
7286000	7290000	But now I can pick up Forza Horizon and maybe have some time to play it.
7290000	7293000	Although with the expo this weekend, I'm not sure how that's going to work out.
7293000	7302000	But there you go. So Final Fantasy XV, apparently to some previews that are going out there, they are showing that there's a little more.
7302000	7306000	And this is on a regular PlayStation 4, not a PlayStation 4 Pro or anything like that.
7306000	7311000	But that some of the fluidity is improved a little bit and it's not looking quite as choppy.
7311000	7315000	So that's pretty exciting to hear that they've got that nice coat of polish on it.
7315000	7321000	Because for a game that we've basically been waiting 10 years for, it needs to be really good.
7321000	7323000	It needs to be really good.
7323000	7328000	Let's travel around the world and check out what's in stores this week. Loki.
7328000	7333000	So this is pretty awesome. This is one game I've been waiting for for a while because I actually followed the developer.
7333000	7340000	Well, not only on Twitter, but also on the Unity 3D subreddit and where he's been, you know, he posted a lot of stuff.
7340000	7345000	But Cluster Truck is coming to PC this week on Steam.
7345000	7349000	Also Darkest Dungeon on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
7349000	7355000	FIFA 17 on PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
7355000	7361000	Just speaking about Forza Horizon 3, that's coming out on Windows 10 and on Xbox One.
7361000	7366000	Galgun Double Piece on PC. Ooh, I may have to pick that up as well.
7366000	7370000	Litchsphere on PC, Mac and Linux and PlayStation 4.
7370000	7375000	Sonic Boom Fire and Ice on 3DS.
7375000	7377000	Can't wait. Number one fan right here.
7377000	7380000	XCOM 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7380000	7383000	This is an awesome title.
7383000	7386000	Burly Men at Sea on PC.
7386000	7388000	What? What? What?
7388000	7391000	Pre-ordering that? Was it Burly Men at Sea?
7391000	7393000	Burly Men at Sea.
7394000	7396000	What platforms is this on?
7396000	7397000	That's on PC.
7397000	7403000	On PC. Hold on, I want to bring this up. Apparently it's a Steam Greenlight thing that's going on here.
7403000	7406000	I'm looking at this. Oh, there's an autoplay teaser going on here.
7406000	7412000	It looks like the graphics in this are pretty simple and you only see their backs.
7412000	7418000	This is not the type of game I was expecting to see with a game called Burly Men at Sea.
7418000	7422000	Rama in chat says, need more Seamen in your life?
7422000	7424000	This is a family show. Don't be disgusting.
7424000	7425000	Alright.
7425000	7429000	Demon Gaze 2 on PlayStation Vita.
7429000	7432000	We also have Hybrid Wars on PC.
7432000	7437000	The Metro Nomicon on PC and Mac.
7437000	7440000	Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 on 3DS.
7440000	7446000	Xeno Raid on PC and Yokai Watch 2 on 3DS.
7446000	7447000	That's it.
7447000	7450000	Alright, going to Japan and checking out what's on their shelves this week.
7450000	7453000	Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 in the Definitive Collection.
7453000	7455000	That whole bundle we got last week or the week before.
7455000	7459000	Japan is getting this week on September 29th on the PlayStation 4.
7459000	7466000	The Biohazard Value Pack is also coming out so that's obviously a repackaging of some of the Resident Evil stuff that's been on the platform.
7466000	7470000	FIFA 17 comes out as well which I imagine will be a pretty big deal.
7470000	7472000	That is of course in regular.
7472000	7477000	And Deluxe Editions because we love Deluxe Editions in Japan.
7477000	7484000	Going over to the PlayStation Vita which yes still has releases including Demon Gaze 2 also on September 29th.
7484000	7496000	Kimi wo Eogi Otome wa Hime ni is out in just a limited edition but you can get pre-mini star in regular and limited edition this week.
7496000	7501000	And pre-mini star is anime babes at the beach basically.
7501000	7505000	Made outfits, bikinis, the whole works, all of it.
7505000	7510000	All your anime fantasies coming true in that game.
7510000	7513000	And on the Nintendo DS in Japan.
7513000	7518000	It doesn't actually look like, oh Yokai, no that's here in the US.
7518000	7522000	I don't think there's really anything, any big games this week.
7522000	7527000	Just a bunch of covers and stuff but nothing, no games really in Japan this week.
7527000	7529000	At least on my list.
7529000	7531000	So let's go to the UK.
7531000	7537000	UK we've got Forza Horizon 3 on Windows 10 and Xbox One.
7537000	7544000	Also FIFA 17 coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One 360 and PlayStation 3.
7544000	7549000	I did notice because I just completely forgot about it considering I have a pre-order for it.
7549000	7552000	PlayStation VR is that only a couple weeks away?
7552000	7554000	Yeah it's what like October 16th or something like that?
7554000	7557000	13th is what I see in a bunch of the VR games. I'm like damn.
7557000	7562000	I have to make the go or no go decision on that like in the next week really.
7562000	7564000	Hoping I get my new job.
7564000	7566000	I'm supposed to hear something.
7566000	7571000	So if that means new job means more pay so I can purchase this.
7571000	7573000	Here's where I'm at.
7573000	7578000	Like I have that and the pro order but I know in my gut I'm not going to get both.
7578000	7580000	That's just too much money.
7580000	7585000	I am able to spend some money here and there but that's a bit much.
7585000	7588000	I would probably hold off on the pro until you get 4K TV.
7588000	7591000	Well I kind of think at this point I may not get either.
7591000	7598000	Because now it has just come up that there's going to be a major Ingress event fun day in Chicago in November.
7598000	7603000	And I have friends in Chicago who I really wouldn't mind visiting their fair city and going to that Ingress event in Chicago.
7603000	7608000	I don't know if that's happening yet but flights are expensive.
7608000	7614000	But I'm like well if I forego the PlayStation VR that's money saved.
7614000	7616000	So I'm starting to have that whole debate with myself.
7616000	7618000	It's how badly do I want to play Rez?
7618000	7621000	And I do want to point out badly.
7621000	7624000	But there is a non-VR version of that game.
7624000	7628000	Somebody I know has got to pick up that VR system so I'll be able to play it there eventually.
7628000	7630000	But do I need to play that all day every day in my own house?
7630000	7632000	I don't know. I just don't know yet.
7632000	7636000	So my feelings of PlayStation VR are very complicated right now.
7636000	7638000	I'm just, I'm worried.
7638000	7647000	I almost came, I was cleaning out the garage this weekend and one of the things I was thinking of was gaming rules almost.
7647000	7651000	And I want to think one of them was never buy a gaming peripheral.
7651000	7660000	Basically, not necessarily any gaming peripheral but the Kinect.
7660000	7662000	Or the Move.
7662000	7667000	All this additional stuff that they add to a console afterwards because it ends up being poorly supported.
7667000	7674000	And I'm worried that PlayStation VR is going to be that, hey, we're doing all this 3D stuff and then it's just eh.
7674000	7681000	Or they come out with something better, you know, shortly after like the PlayStation VR Pro or something like that.
7681000	7685000	Yeah, and it's one of those things where it's like maybe I just don't need one day one.
7685000	7689000	Maybe I'll still get one but I can wait a little bit to see what else kind of comes of it.
7689000	7691000	And I don't necessarily need to be dealing with it.
7691000	7693000	But I have that money down. I already have a hundred bucks down.
7694000	7697000	Oh, I don't. I brought it on Amazon so I don't have to do that.
7697000	7698000	I got a GameStop, so yeah.
7698000	7700000	Well, you get that money back, right? If you cancel it?
7700000	7702000	Yeah, but like...
7702000	7704000	In credit or something? I hope not.
7704000	7705000	No, they better...
7705000	7706000	Oh, that's good.
7706000	7714000	Well, anyway, it's complicated. This is a very complicated show tonight. It is plausible that tonight's show is complicated.
7714000	7719000	Well, I'm just looking at like the VR games they have coming out and it's like Batman Arkham VR.
7719000	7720000	Eh, don't care.
7720000	7722000	Drive Club VR? Eh, don't really care.
7722000	7724000	VR Worlds? Eh, that might be alright.
7724000	7729000	But like, you know, Rez in PlayStation VR World, that's pretty much it.
7729000	7731000	Ooh, Rollercoaster Dreams. That might be kind of cool.
7731000	7734000	The Final Fantasy experience I'd like to see in the VR thing too.
7734000	7736000	So, I mean, there are things I want to check out with it but it's just like...
7736000	7737000	I don't know. Maybe I'll wait.
7737000	7739000	Is it $500 bad, you know, that whole thing?
7739000	7740000	Yeah, so...
7740000	7747000	Anyway, let's get to the mailbag and see what you guys have to say in our mailbag because every week you guys email us.
7747000	7753000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we dive into the email bag.
7753000	7760000	And while Dark Sakura is not present while she's on her little vacation and we don't have radio magic for the mailbag, I'm sorry.
7760000	7761000	Only the classic game.
7761000	7765000	I'm reading emails this week and we have a few actually.
7765000	7769000	I think last week we didn't have any or maybe just one and this week we had like three long ones.
7769000	7774000	So, let's get to the emails this week.
7775000	7779000	Speaking of complicated, Reddertainment is sending us this first email.
7779000	7781000	Greetings Podtopians.
7781000	7788000	At this point in the show, you've probably touched on this week's controversy over Palmer Luckey and his involvement with the political action group Nimble America.
7788000	7794000	I've seen a lot of talk about this controversy over this week but I've seen very little touch on the tactics utilized by Nimble America.
7794000	7798000	These tactics are touched upon in a quote taken from an article by the Daily Beast.
7798000	7802000	The article that seemed to be the light match in this firestorm. Link given.
7802000	7809000	With a quote, Nimble America says it's dedicated to proving that chip posting is powerful and meme magic is real.
7809000	7811000	Sorry, I'm actually laughing as I'm reading that.
7811000	7818000	Either this quote is bullshit and was crafted to get a reaction or it articulates the tactics utilized by Nimble America.
7818000	7825000	Tactics like this are what makes many online communities blatantly hostile and caustic to all but those that exist within those communities.
7826000	7834000	Strip away what their political aim is. Nimble America's tactics are just plain wrong and tactics like this should not be tolerated no matter what the agenda behind them is.
7834000	7839000	A group's image, and often the image of the movement they stand for, is painted by the tactics they utilize.
7839000	7844000	If the tactics are good, then the group is seen as good and generally continues until their aim is met.
7844000	7848000	If the tactics are bad, then the group behind those tactics generally doesn't last long.
7848000	7859000	It is my honest hope that Nimble America goes quickly away, not because of the viewpoints they espouse, but because of the way they go about trying to create their vision of the world.
7859000	7861000	Stay care. Retertainment.
7861000	7867000	Thank you for the email. Obviously, we've kind of already dived into this issue and I'm not one to spend another five minutes on it.
7867000	7876000	However, I think you did articulate very well, perhaps better than even I did because I had 5,000 thoughts I had to barf out during that segment.
7876000	7884000	But I think you articulated very well like where the problem kind of lied with the whole thing, but I will defer to our conversation earlier.
7884000	7886000	But thank you for the email.
7886000	7891000	I shall move on to Rob who sends us our next email who says,
7891000	7902000	One important lesson from your interview about Silent Earth, remember our interview last week, was that a, quote, stealth release is not a good idea when developing an indie game.
7902000	7904000	I'd like to share my opinions on why.
7904000	7908000	Stealth release is like the belief that your game will be a sleeper hit.
7908000	7912000	Sleeper hits are called that because they are rare and unpredictable.
7912000	7918000	It is unlikely that your game will be a sleeper hit, so you are probably setting yourself up for failure.
7918000	7923000	Showing your progress in a collaborative environment will get you feedback outside of your own vision for the game.
7923000	7931000	Not only will people point out obvious flaws and things that are simply not fun, but you also get a sample of what customers will want.
7931000	7940000	Lastly, free PR. You can't afford advertising. Also, no matter how much it hurts, if your game is a stinker, you need to hear it as early as possible.
7940000	7942000	Thanks, Rababa.
7942000	7944000	Great email from Rababa.
7944000	7954000	And yeah, it was a great little takeaway from our interview last week where the developer had been talking about that he was considering kind of releasing it as a surprise, but then decided no, he didn't want to do that.
7954000	7958000	And he had this very transparent kind of like log and he was getting a lot of that feedback.
7958000	7962000	And I think Rababa really kind of accentuates a lot of that with some very good points in that email.
7962000	7967000	So I really, I don't really have a lot to add to that email either. I think that email is just well said.
7967000	7971000	So really, all I'm doing tonight is reading.
7971000	7975000	So let's see how this last email goes from YYR, who starts off.
7975000	7981000	Hello, LR. Just some thoughts on last week's episode. Please put on your tinfoil hat for this.
7981000	7986000	Oh, good thing ours are very well worn tonight, YYR.
7987000	7994000	Regarding the many games that have been delayed to quarter one 2017, I'm starting to think that these are happening on purpose.
7994000	7999000	The first quarter of 2017 is now bursting at the seams with big releases.
7999000	8003000	And what else is supposedly coming out in the first quarter of 2017?
8003000	8009000	Nintendo NX. Oh, oh, shit. Here we go. Yeah, damn it. I thought I was done. God damn it, YYR.
8009000	8011000	God damn it.
8011000	8016000	I will, it's the show where every gamer has a voice, so YYR gets a turn.
8016000	8023000	It's almost looking to me like maybe, just maybe, Sony and Microsoft are puppet masters here, whispering to publishers,
8023000	8029000	no, you don't need to release those games for the holidays. Why not in February or March?
8029000	8035000	So that when the NX, whatever the hell it is actually called, releases, folks might look at it and say,
8035000	8040000	well, look at all the stuff that just came out on Xbox and PlayStation. Do I really need more gaming hardware?
8040000	8047000	Yes, this theory borders on batshit crazy, but we've already seen these companies take whatever opportunities they can
8047000	8052000	to plug their products and put down the others. So how crazy is this theory really?
8052000	8060000	All I can say is, it's plausible. I just wanted to feed that to the chatters. I'm feeding the trolls in chat tonight.
8060000	8062000	You can take the hat off now.
8062000	8069000	Regarding the interview with Sam, I must say I heartily endorse the creation of any new arcade style games
8069000	8074000	because those are my favorites and I look forward to trying Silent Earth, perhaps a magfest.
8074000	8078000	But his answer regarding the question of portrait versus landscape was interesting to me.
8078000	8084000	He said that he chose the portrait orientation because it's more natural because of the way we're used to holding our phones.
8084000	8090000	On the occasions that I have used my phones or tablets in the landscape orientation, I haven't ever felt that it was awkward,
8090000	8096000	not in my opinion at least, but what made this comment stand out to me is that the end result is not merely aesthetic.
8096000	8100000	The portrait orientation also dramatically reduces the difficulty of Missile Command.
8100000	8104000	Not only is there less ground to defend, the incoming missiles also have further to travel.
8104000	8109000	This is not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, it significantly helps the game's accessibility.
8109000	8114000	And yet the developer's choice of orientation seems to have been made without regard to that major difference.
8114000	8121000	Just an aside that's not in the email, I think you can also account for some of that because the game was still very difficult in my opinion
8121000	8123000	and we even kind of talked about that in the interview.
8123000	8128000	I think you could change some of that with how big are the missiles, how big are the explosion radiuses and everything.
8128000	8132000	There is still stuff that can be tweaked with that, but I just want to make sure that was out there.
8132000	8134000	Back to YYR's email.
8134000	8141000	I'd be interested to know your thoughts, well there you go, both on whether you believe that the game design is evolving to be a bit more about aesthetics
8141000	8149000	and a bit less about concrete things like game difficulty and also whether you dislike the landscape orientation for any reason.
8149000	8154000	I'd love to hear chat's take on this too. Well let's take a minute to talk about that.
8154000	8163000	And I think this was almost best accentuated with Nintendo coming out at the Apple conference and showing Super Mario Run.
8163000	8171000	And one of the big things they were talking about was you can play it with one hand and they were showing what, Miyamoto playing it in one hand
8171000	8175000	while his other hand was jerking it. No, I'm kidding. I just want to see if you're paying attention.
8175000	8179000	If his other hand was like holding a subway bar or something like that, right?
8179000	8185000	And that is a very common thing, like you look like in subways a lot of people kind of texting one handed and all that stuff.
8185000	8189000	Or while they're driving. Okay, again, just want to see if you're paying attention.
8189000	8192000	That's just Loki playing Pokemon Go as he's at the intersection.
8192000	8194000	Yes, intersection.
8194000	8203000	But in that regard, yeah, it does feel a little more natural one handed to be in portrait as opposed to landscape.
8203000	8207000	You can kind of do landscape one handed, but your thumb can only cover half the screen.
8207000	8210000	Like try it. Especially if you have an iPhone 6 Plus like I do.
8210000	8215000	My thumb can only hit half the screen in landscape. It doesn't work too well.
8215000	8222000	So yeah, portrait feels a lot more natural with these bigger phones and your thumb can kind of carry more area.
8222000	8226000	So I can see where that comes into it.
8226000	8234000	And you know, we talked about last week as well, Luminous, the puzzle game, did change to a portrait orientation game.
8234000	8238000	When Loki and I, the week before, full unexpected, it was going to be widescreen.
8238000	8240000	Yeah, and it also changed to a really shitty control game.
8240000	8243000	Well, it already was on the last iPhone version.
8243000	8246000	But regardless, at least it was a little bit better this time.
8246000	8250000	And the portrait thing I found out really wasn't a big deal for me.
8250000	8252000	And maybe that's just because I have a Plus.
8252000	8256000	And a lot of you have those androids that are just as big.
8256000	8260000	And so it's like you still kind of have a lot of real estate to work with, even in portrait mode, it kind of works out.
8260000	8265000	But who cares? You're just tapping. Like in Mario, you're just tapping the screen.
8265000	8268000	So it doesn't matter where it's at.
8268000	8273000	And in the game Silent Earth, it was about tapping the screen to do the missiles as well.
8273000	8276000	There wasn't a lot of swiping or any other complex things.
8277000	8284000	I don't know. But to go back to releasing in Quarter 1, that's unfortunately not because of the NX.
8284000	8286000	That's something they've been doing for a long time.
8286000	8292000	The fourth quarter gets so packed full of stuff, it's hard to make your games stand out against everything.
8292000	8297000	And so it's easier just to delay it and put it in that dead period.
8297000	8303000	Go to a September show in any of our 15-year history of this show, and we're talking about some damn game that gets delayed.
8303000	8308000	And we always say, wow, next year's going to be really packed. All the good stuff's coming out next year.
8308000	8311000	Now it's like every year. I feel like a broken record.
8311000	8316000	It is. I mean, because before, if it doesn't get delayed, it's just, it's, you know, it used to be,
8316000	8319000	it's like, oh, everyone's afraid of Call of Duty. I don't think that's the case anymore.
8319000	8327000	But it's just, I mean, I think they've learned that they can delay a game and still does really well in that time period.
8327000	8333000	Especially, you know, even though March is usually packed full of titles, January and February are usually pretty dead.
8333000	8338000	And so, I mean, February actually has been pretty, it's been getting more packed.
8338000	8345000	But, you know, typically those are really dead months so that you can put your game out there and have more tension for it.
8345000	8350000	It's like movies, really. I mean, you can release a movie at any time, and if people really want to see it, they'll go.
8350000	8353000	Like, they talk about, like, January is a dead period, February is a dead period.
8353000	8358000	But, like, I feel like within the past few years, like, they've been releasing big movies in January and February,
8358000	8362000	and they do very well because those are expected to be. But people, people aren't suddenly going to be like,
8362000	8364000	oh, I should stop going to movies.
8364000	8370000	Yeah, they're not going to, no publisher or no, like, Microsoft or Sony is not going to tell people to delay their game
8370000	8376000	till the first quarter because of the NX. They're going to be like, fuck that, put your game out now so that the fourth quarter stuff looks good
8376000	8380000	so we can sell more of those PlayStation Pros and shit. I mean, that's what they're going to be trying to do.
8380000	8384000	It's not, I don't know, they're never going to tell people to delay a game.
8384000	8391000	Alright, and sadly YYR Chat isn't really responding to your question. They're too hung up on the Miyamoto jerk in it comment.
8391000	8395000	Sorry about that. Alright, so I'll finish off YYR's email here.
8395000	8401000	I'll end by congratulating Loki on his bathroom revelation, which you talked about on the show last week.
8401000	8407000	Yes, and sadly that has not caused me to actually do any game development because I'm still too fucking tired.
8407000	8414000	I've tried. I've been trying, and unfortunately the wife has gotten into American Horror Story now, so that's on TV.
8414000	8415000	Oh no.
8415000	8420000	And because it's new, it's like, attention! Woo! I'm going to watch TV.
8420000	8426000	You know, it was starting to get a little easy to even graze anatomy. Like, I don't care about that show, but my God.
8426000	8433000	If it's on TV, my brain's just like, I need to pay attention to this. Or like, hey, I'm going to look up this information that I need.
8433000	8436000	Oh, and I'm on YouTube and I'm browsing shit.
8436000	8440000	I watch hardly any TV and all that stuff. I've talked about this before because I'm too busy playing video games.
8440000	8446000	But like, you know, my buddy Shane will ask me, like, well, don't you, or he'll tell me like, watch this while you're doing Netflix.
8446000	8452000	Or he'll talk about how he's watched the entire series of Parks and Recreation over the past couple weeks.
8452000	8457000	I'm like, how do you have time for that? But he plays that on one monitor while he games on the other.
8457000	8462000	And I'm like, I can't do that because I'm like you. I see something on TV. I'm like, oh, television.
8462000	8467000	It all depends. Like, if it was like an MMO, like if it was like Final Fantasy or something like that, maybe?
8467000	8478000	You think you can, but unless you're doing something like mining, even then I can listen to a podcast while I do those menial tasks in Final Fantasy, but I can't fucking raid or something like that.
8478000	8486000	Like, I can't do that. Like, I've tried, you know, at work. See, because lately my job at work, you know, I've been programming.
8486000	8499000	Ironically enough, I've been doing more programming at work than I have been at home, which is not even my job at all at work, but I've been programming macros to automate stuff at my job.
8499000	8509000	And so I've been actually doing lots of programming, but I can't listen to a podcast while I do that. My brain just, it needs to be distraction free in order to do that.
8509000	8518000	I just can't, like if I'm doing mundane stuff, I can listen to a podcast, but I cannot program and listen to a podcast at the same time.
8518000	8519000	Alright.
8519000	8520000	At least right now. Not enough caffeine, maybe.
8520000	8533000	Alright, well anyhow, YYR ends his email. I'll end by congratulating Loki on his bathroom revelation. I'm thrilled that he can finally shit his focus towards his game, and I'm sure that the end product will be much improved.
8533000	8542000	And well, if it doesn't turn out good at all, there's always Minecraft and Call of Duty, I guess. Poop, YYR.
8542000	8553000	This is pretty expected from someone that came up with pixel shit, so I guess I'm not too surprised. And I humbly accept that, that praise.
8554000	8561000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some highbrow humor like we had in that last email.
8561000	8563000	Again, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8563000	8569000	Hey, we have some more news before we get to the Skype line at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype. Loki.
8569000	8576000	So, Capcom. What are you doing, Capcom? Seriously. You released an...
8576000	8577000	Where do we start?
8577000	8591000	Where do we start? So they just released an update for Street Fighter V that's supposed to bring additional characters, but also has some sort of feature or patch to shut down cheating.
8591000	8601000	While that's a good idea, the way they went about it, not so great. So basically they have this anti-cheating protocol that grants kernel access to your system.
8601000	8611000	And because of that, it could be exploited as a backdoor into your system. So because of that, they're now going to be rolling back that latest security measure.
8611000	8624000	And so, yeah, that kind of sucks. It's like, could it be another way to do that without, you know, leaving my computer open for people to hack it? Maybe?
8624000	8637000	Yeah, I mean, you got to remember PC people, they tend to really watch what's going on with their system and they're very possessive about people getting in there and putting things on it that, you know, may be questionable type of thing.
8637000	8638000	Yeah.
8638000	8652000	So, yeah, I don't know if that was the best idea for Capcom to do. Look, I'm all for them taking measures to ban cheating, but maybe that software they should put on their computers and not mine.
8653000	8655000	Just a thought.
8655000	8656000	Yeah.
8656000	8665000	Anyhow, let's talk about Killer Instinct, since we're talking about fighting games. You know, Killer Instinct season three is a thing that's going on, which I have to admit, I haven't paid a lot of attention to.
8665000	8678000	I have season one and two, but I have yet to really catch up on season three, but maybe this is an opportunity for me to, because Killer Instinct just got their story mode, because this is the cool thing to do now is put out your story mode way later.
8678000	8679000	But to be fair...
8679000	8680000	Two seasons later?
8680000	8689000	Well, to be fair, Killer Instinct was also kind of that free game, you know? Yes, I know they piecemealed some of it, but a little bit different the way they went about it in the very beginning.
8689000	8696000	But regardless, there is now a free story mode and it will have Shadow Lords in it.
8696000	8703000	So I guess you can actually play Shadow Lords over and over and it's a type of conclusion to season three.
8704000	8718000	You can also get the $40 Killer Instinct Definitive Edition that has pretty much everything that has come out thus far. All the fighters, all the skins, all the stages, and a gold costume for Gargos.
8719000	8730000	I think that the last one that they put out last, it was either at the end of season one or end of season two, was also the Definitive Edition or something like that.
8730000	8736000	It's like, definitive for now, until we come out with some more shit, then there's going to be a more definitive edition.
8736000	8740000	No, seriously definitive. The plausibly definitive edition.
8742000	8745000	Definitive as in, well, there might be more content later.
8746000	8748000	Moving on, Logie.
8748000	8757000	So From Software is going to be working on some new games. Of course, I'm assuming that some of those are going to be Dark Souls-ish.
8757000	8767000	One of them, though, is going to be Armored Core and I'm a pretty big fan of Armored Core, so I am definitely looking forward to that.
8767000	8773000	The last one that they did not say what it is, so there's something else out there that's going to be coming out.
8773000	8776000	Armored Core. Yes, please. Want more.
8776000	8783000	Now, imagine if it was Armored Core, though, but Dark Souls hard. I don't know if I'd want to play that.
8785000	8789000	Hopefully it will have a varying skill level or some type of...
8789000	8794000	Yeah, because I'm pretty much not very good at the game, but I will play it.
8794000	8800000	Because it's just like, missiles, missiles, missiles, missiles, missiles, fire stuff, missiles, more missiles!
8800000	8802000	I don't know.
8802000	8807000	Well, I sure hope Enchanted Arms 2 is one of the other titles that they're working on. Remember that one?
8807000	8809000	Enchanted Arms, yeah.
8809000	8812000	We'll see. Dark Tetsuya in chat asked, new King's Field?
8812000	8814000	Actually, I think it was Enchant Arm.
8814000	8817000	Was it? I thought it was Enchanted Arm.
8817000	8819000	No, Enchant Arm.
8819000	8820000	Whatever.
8820000	8821000	This is one arm.
8821000	8822000	Whatever. It's one game.
8822000	8824000	Your arm is enchanted.
8824000	8827000	But it was like the first RPG on 360, I think, was this big thing.
8827000	8832000	Because it came out before Blue Dragon or Lost Odyssey or that stuff.
8832000	8833000	Anyway.
8833000	8834000	Yeah, whoopty shit.
8834000	8837000	Bobby Black Wolf says it was Enchanted Arms.
8837000	8841000	I think in Japan it had a modified title.
8841000	8842000	But anyway.
8842000	8845000	Who cares? Because now it's all about Mass Effect, right?
8845000	8849000	And, do you want to be in a Mass Effect game?
8849000	8853000	Because I kind of feel like I really should have already done this, and I haven't, and that's probably a mistake.
8853000	8855000	However, I have until September 28th.
8855000	8863000	Because BioWare is giving Mass Effect fans a chance to voice a character in an upcoming Mass Effect game.
8863000	8867000	Note that that does not mean Mass Effect Andromeda.
8867000	8869000	It probably is, but it doesn't mean it is.
8869000	8871000	Loki, you're laughing over there.
8871000	8872000	Oh, you gonna enter?
8872000	8873000	No.
8873000	8874000	I'm not a fan.
8874000	8875000	You should do your Tingle voice.
8875000	8877000	No, I don't need your Tingle voice.
8877000	8884000	But, Loki, if you won in your Tingle voice for the character in Mass Effect, which I think there's like two different scripts or whatever.
8884000	8892000	If you were to win, you would be put up in a fabulous city like Edmonton, London, or Los Angeles, which would be your city because it's the closest.
8892000	8893000	Fabulous city.
8893000	8897000	For two nights and three days, meaning a weekend.
8897000	8902000	And you will take part in a professional voice recording session at Studio BioWare.
8902000	8908000	But by the way, there's no guarantee your voice will actually be used and we don't know what game it's gonna end up in. Those are all the standard disclaimers.
8908000	8916000	Now, this is a total side tangent here, but on your screen there, I know that says Virginia, but it looks like vagina from here.
8916000	8918000	I'm sorry.
8918000	8924000	It's an ad on a website that has the cliff notes I'm using for this story.
8924000	8927000	And yeah, it does kind of look like vagina.
8927000	8934000	But it's actually, it's branded a unique first person thriller that's available now on Steam.
8934000	8939000	A first person thriller vagina.
8939000	8941000	How old are we?
8941000	8944000	No, it's Virginia. It's a little bird.
8944000	8948000	So, do they have like a script or anything?
8948000	8952000	They do, actually. There's like two sample scripts and you can submit one of those.
8952000	8956000	Your recording does have to be in English. You can submit audio or video, but it can't-
8956000	8960000	Dude, they have them online. Can we do this live?
8960000	8965000	Well, we could. I guess. Let's see.
8965000	8966000	Let's see if we can-
8966000	8967000	Do you want to do it live?
8967000	8968000	Yeah, we'll do it live.
8968000	8969000	Fuck it. We'll do it live.
8969000	8974000	Alright, let's see. Let's go. Okay, we're gonna go from BioWare.
8974000	8977000	And let's see. Explorers wanted contest. Okay, da da da da.
8977000	8981000	Okay, script one and script two. Here we go.
8981000	8989000	Script one. Okay, so there's- do you want to- now, obviously, the winner would not voice Ryder.
8989000	8992000	The winner would voice this Jordan Tate in this first script.
8992000	8995000	So, do you want to do Jordan Tate and I'll do Ryder or you want to flip it and I'll do Jordan Tate, you do Ryder?
8995000	8996000	Yes, I'll do Jordan Tate.
8996000	8999000	Alright, alright. So, here's Loki's audition.
8999000	9001000	I'm not- this is-
9001000	9007000	Which, by the way, they say it's an unannounced Mass Effect game and then I want to point out at the top of the script, it has the Mass Effect Andromeda logo.
9007000	9008000	So, here we go.
9008000	9014000	Alright, Loki auditioning for the part of Jordan Tate in Mass Effect Andromeda.
9014000	9023000	Jordan Tate is a smart and talented indie documentarian eager to give the real perspective on life in Andromeda.
9023000	9026000	Okay, so the inquisitive reporter. You ready? Here we go.
9026000	9027000	So much stress on this.
9027000	9030000	I know. Starring Loki and Rob Roberts as Ryder.
9030000	9035000	Ryder, isn't it? Jordan Tate, freelance vid maker.
9035000	9040000	Superintendent Drake asked for an uplifting documentary about our efforts.
9040000	9045000	Translation, paint rainbows all over our problems. But people deserve the truth, not propaganda.
9045000	9049000	Perhaps a crisis is a time for hope rather than hard truths.
9049000	9052000	But if we pretend everything's fine, who does that really serve?
9052000	9058000	I want the dirt and the blood, not just a convenient fairy tale Drake's looking for.
9058000	9060000	Okay, what do you want to know?
9061000	9066000	Well, how do you think things are going? Official reports don't tell us very much.
9066000	9069000	I think people should go out and see Andromeda for themselves.
9069000	9075000	No trouble at all? Are those scars on your armor just from popping the champagne?
9075000	9078000	Hey, fuck you, buddy! Sorry, I improved. Sorry.
9078000	9082000	Never mind. If that's your take, that's what's going in.
9082000	9087000	Bandwidth means I'm transmitting in short bursts, so that's all for now.
9088000	9090000	Bravo, Loki!
9090000	9094000	Oh, and oh, I didn't even realize I'm supposed to have like, oh, I didn't even read any of that.
9094000	9099000	Loki didn't even realize there's direction on the right side of the screen.
9099000	9103000	Loki just said, I'm gonna do it my way. Fuck you.
9103000	9104000	There it is.
9104000	9110000	DarkTetsuya in chat says, also Robin Loki reading game scripts should totally be a segment.
9110000	9115000	Be careful what you wish for, DarkTetsuya. Be careful what you wish for.
9115000	9120000	I would love to get guests to come in and banter on the scripts that they wrote.
9120000	9124000	That's my dream competition is to watch Loki butcher their scripts.
9124000	9127000	Oh, I can butcher anything, because I don't read very well.
9127000	9130000	That's quite the thing to admit.
9130000	9132000	I'm not the expert literacy.
9132000	9135000	Orange Lounge Radio just went dark. I can't read very well.
9135000	9140000	No, it's not that I don't read well. It's just I read too quick, and so I skip shit.
9140000	9142000	Or I don't read ahead enough.
9142000	9145000	Whatever. I just don't care what it is.
9145000	9147000	You only tripped over a couple of words.
9147000	9148000	Exactly. It's the first time.
9148000	9149000	He was reading over my shoulder.
9149000	9150000	You would have to practice, you know.
9150000	9155000	That's right. You would do a couple takes and listen to the one you like best, and that's the one you submit.
9155000	9157000	Alright, anyhow.
9157000	9159000	Alright, next up, Loki.
9159000	9168000	Alright, so No Man's Sky has been created, or I should say recreated, in Doom.
9168000	9173000	Yes, so someone made a mod for Doom called No Guy's Sky.
9173000	9175000	And not the new Doom, right?
9175000	9178000	Like the old 90s shareware Doom.
9178000	9179000	Right. The original Doom.
9179000	9182000	A WAD file. Or was that Duke Nukem that used WAD files?
9182000	9187000	Basically said, you know, everything is randomly generated from the sky to the ground to the aliens.
9187000	9193000	You can even mod, you know, mod yourself to wear the face of anyone you want.
9193000	9197000	Even, you know, your own, I guess, if you wanted to do that.
9197000	9204000	You can mine for resources with lasers, fly about with a jetpack, or even talk to the aliens.
9204000	9206000	That's ridiculous.
9208000	9211000	You know what's also ridiculous is that the guy has never played the game.
9211000	9215000	He made, he did that reimagining based on the trailer.
9215000	9217000	So I think that's hilarious.
9217000	9218000	That's awesome.
9218000	9223000	That he hasn't even played the game, and he kind of has some of the elements kind of down a little bit.
9223000	9227000	I mean, obviously, the look is, well, I mean, it's Doom.
9227000	9230000	When I say the look is similar, it's like, not really.
9230000	9233000	But, like, the UI is kind of like all in the same places.
9233000	9235000	This is really funny.
9235000	9236000	I thought that was funny.
9236000	9239000	Alright. DungeonBuster in chat says,
9239000	9242000	LOL, I saw this mod, it's pretty wild.
9242000	9246000	DarkTetsuya says, Doom was WADs, if I remember correctly.
9246000	9247000	It is WADs.
9247000	9248000	WADs.
9248000	9249000	Alright.
9249000	9252000	And speaking of WADs,
9252000	9257000	our last story tonight before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
9257000	9261000	all one word on Skype, has to do with pornography.
9261000	9262000	Yay.
9262000	9263000	What does that have to do with video games?
9263000	9269000	Because this is a porn, it's a parody porn.
9269000	9273000	Like some classic parody porns of the past, like Edward Penis Hands.
9273000	9277000	But this porn is based on a video game.
9277000	9281000	Which, by the way, I would like the authors of these articles to know,
9281000	9284000	this is not the first to be done on a video game.
9284000	9288000	Because you think reading scripts live on this show is riveting.
9288000	9292000	Go back to like the first hundred of OLR when this is a very different show.
9292000	9297000	When we would watch porn live during the show, such titles as Dance Dance Fuck,
9297000	9298000	remember when we had that?
9298000	9299000	Oh yeah, I remember that.
9299000	9302000	And we watched that, because we're just watching it on a radio show,
9302000	9304000	so it's not obscene.
9304000	9306000	So we watched Dance Dance Fuck and gave our live review of that.
9306000	9309000	We also watched Final Fuck X one week. Remember that?
9309000	9310000	Yes, I remember that.
9310000	9312000	Did you know the cosplayers? Well, the women were cosplaying, the men were.
9312000	9315000	Yes, Dance Dance Fuck had really nothing to do with DDR.
9315000	9319000	No, it didn't. I think it just used the word dance twice,
9319000	9322000	which might have actually been a misprint. I don't know.
9322000	9326000	But anyway, what makes this especially notable is that, you know,
9326000	9333000	the technology and film quality has changed a lot since the days of Dance Dance Fuck.
9333000	9335000	Didn't you get Dance Dance Fuck on like a VCD?
9335000	9341000	No, it was on a DVD. It was like I was looking for DDR stuff online on eBay,
9341000	9344000	and that somehow came up. Like, I typed Dance Dance Revolution,
9344000	9348000	and it was like, I saw that there. I'm like, I have to get that.
9348000	9357000	Well, Overwatch is the subject of the porn parody from Brazers Entertainment.
9357000	9362000	I'm not familiar with them somehow, but I guess they have done porns
9362000	9366000	like Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Suicide Squad.
9366000	9371000	So they are doing a porn called Oversnatch, a triple X parody,
9371000	9378000	which does involve Overwatch characters. You actually have the dude dressed up as Reaper.
9378000	9384000	So finally the dudes are cosplaying too, and they're hiding his face by dressing him up as Reaper,
9384000	9386000	which, you know, is probably for the best.
9386000	9387000	It's not Reaper?
9387000	9389000	Not cool.
9389000	9391000	I'm just saying, you know, they tend to do like...
9391000	9393000	Like, the name changes?
9393000	9395000	Yeah.
9395000	9397000	It's Reaper.
9397000	9399000	Is it Anus Reaper or something like that?
9399000	9406000	Aleta Ocean is the name of the female character, and she's dressed as Widowmaker.
9406000	9413000	And you see, in the trailer, they are kind of, they're standoffish a little bit.
9413000	9416000	They're kind of, you know, there's this very sexual tension between them,
9417000	9420000	and we don't know how they're going to resolve it because the trailer ends.
9420000	9423000	So we'll have to find out when this comes out.
9423000	9425000	They talk it out.
9425000	9427000	This comes out when? Next week, I think.
9427000	9429000	I don't know. I thought I had a date.
9429000	9432000	I think the date was in the trailer, and it's sometime pretty soon.
9432000	9438000	So there's no word if there's Tracer or any other characters from Overwatch in the game.
9438000	9441000	All we see so far is Reaper and Widowmaker.
9441000	9445000	So, over-snatch a Brazer's XXX parody.
9445000	9449000	And my question is, who's going to move the payload?
9452000	9454000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
9454000	9458000	If you would like to give the show a call and talk about anything you would like,
9458000	9464000	maybe not the last story, but maybe there's something else you would like to comment on that we have talked about tonight.
9464000	9467000	OrangeLoungeRadio, again, all one word on Skype.
9467000	9471000	We are going to take your calls before we get to the episode.
9471000	9478000	By the way, if you like porn, or you like Overwatch, you should check out that trailer.
9478000	9482000	There's no porn in it, but the costumes are pretty well done.
9482000	9487000	Yeah, they have good costumers, that's for sure.
9487000	9490000	Alright, let's get to the Skype line.
9490000	9492000	Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9492000	9495000	God damn it, Rob, you have a perverted sense of humor, dude.
9495000	9499000	Me? Me? This is a family show.
9499000	9501000	Payload.
9501000	9504000	Hi, Rama, what's on your mind, buddy?
9504000	9506000	A couple of things.
9506000	9510000	I'm sorry, there was a comment on that article that was too fucking good that said,
9510000	9514000	so, who's going to get the lay of the game?
9514000	9519000	I swear to God, if that movie doesn't end with lay of the game,
9519000	9522000	then, like, throw it in the fucking garbage.
9522000	9526000	Because it's a shit parody, if it doesn't end with lay of the game.
9526000	9527000	I got it.
9527000	9532000	You know, you think I was making a mistake reading comments on an internet video game news article,
9532000	9538000	but once in a while, once in a fucking while, you hit gold.
9538000	9540000	But, yeah.
9540000	9546000	I want you to know, we do the same shit on our show as well.
9546000	9555000	We have strange news for Japan, and we troll the comment section, and it's usually really, really bad.
9555000	9559000	It usually is. Speaking of comments, BobbyBlackWolf in chat,
9559000	9565000	the real trick is, how do those costumes look crumpled up on the floor by the bed?
9565000	9570000	Funny you should mention that, because when I shared that article to my wall,
9570000	9573000	a bunch of us came up with two questions.
9573000	9577000	Number one, who is commissioning the costumes?
9577000	9581000	Number two, who are they going to get the play as Mei?
9581000	9586000	Well, if there's even more than the two characters, they might just be doing, like, a ten minute short,
9586000	9590000	and they're expecting people will buy it because, LOL, it's Overwatch.
9590000	9596000	I mean, you know, we're not the only gaming blog or podcast or media giving that thing free for listening this week.
9596000	9600000	Oh, there was a gay one. There was a gay Pokemon Go. Was there a straight one, too?
9600000	9604000	Straight one, but it was like, basically, they had the female stars in, like, those Pokemon hoodies.
9604000	9612000	Okay, they did the exact same thing with gay porn, except it was like Pikachu was wearing a yellow jockstrap or something like that.
9612000	9618000	Like, it was just, like, it was exactly as fucking stupid as you'd think.
9618000	9622000	Which porn is supposed to be! Porn is supposed to be stupid. It's just sex. Anyway.
9622000	9625000	Is it right up there with the Captain America one, as well?
9626000	9630000	Didn't they have a gay parody? I think they did. Civil War?
9630000	9631000	Yes, they did.
9631000	9639000	I don't recognize, for some reason, when you said Captain America, I thought Captain, was it Captain Planet or whatever?
9639000	9640000	Captain Planet?
9640000	9644000	The only Captain Planet I will recognize now is the Don Cheadle Captain Planet.
9644000	9648000	I do not recognize any other Captain Planets other than the Don Cheadle Captain Planet.
9648000	9654000	All right, Rama, I don't think you called in just to talk about porn tonight, but here we are. What did you want to talk about?
9654000	9663000	No, I wanted to talk about the Luminous game for mobile, because I decided to spend some of my credit and buy the game.
9663000	9664000	And?
9669000	9675000	I can tell this is going. That's it. There it is. Good night. Thanks, Rama, for calling. There's his review on Luminous.
9676000	9685000	It's a good game. It's fun. I don't believe the game is worth $3. It's worth 99 cents.
9685000	9688000	Act Def says that was a sigh out of 10.
9690000	9693000	But it has shining, Rama. It has shining.
9693000	9702000	Yes. Don't get it twisted. I love the music in the game. I mean, the music really sets the tone, and it's vertical, which is cool.
9702000	9710000	Now, if you liked the original Luminous that came out for PSP, there is a game on Android called Rebirth.
9710000	9716000	Just like that one, and it's horizontal, and that one is just as fun. I just look at it this way.
9716000	9722000	If you like the original version and you want to keep playing that, get Rebirth.
9722000	9725000	If you want to try this new one, get the updated one.
9726000	9735000	But what's interesting is that when I went looking for the game, evidently, if you get the import, if you're able to download the import version, it's free.
9735000	9740000	You know what would have sweetened the pot a little bit, I think, since we talk about the music is great?
9740000	9744000	What if you bought the game for $3.99 and you got the soundtrack for free?
9744000	9749000	Because I can't imagine that in the Apple Store or something, don't they do bundled things all the time there?
9749000	9754000	I know they do with CDs and stuff. Couldn't you just get the soundtrack for free when you get the game?
9754000	9757000	And that would sweeten the pot a lot, don't you think?
9757000	9766000	It would, but the thing is, I don't really buy a lot of games on the Play Store because I have my ways of trying games out.
9766000	9768000	Neither here nor there.
9768000	9769000	Oh boy, alright.
9769000	9778000	I don't see a way, unless they email you a copy of a download code with your receipt, that would be the only way they could do it.
9778000	9783000	I don't know how the Play Store works as much because I happen to be an iPhone user.
9783000	9789000	But with the iTunes, like I know when you buy CDs on iTunes, which I haven't done in a long time, but you can do it.
9789000	9795000	Like sometimes they'll throw in a music video for free, which is somewhere else in the store, but it just comes bundled with it.
9795000	9801000	Or sometimes you get like a PDF book with all the art in it and that just comes with it.
9801000	9807000	So I can't imagine it can't work the other way around where you could download an app and it triggers that you get access to the soundtrack as well.
9807000	9817000	I mean, fuck, if they could have pushed everybody's fucking iTunes accounts to get that U2 album a couple of years ago, there's a way to do it.
9817000	9825000	See, but what I meant by grabbing like games alternately, I don't mean like downloading for free.
9825000	9837000	There is an app for Android called QOAP, Q-O-A-P-P. You download it, it lets you, it connects you to all of the import games on the Japanese Google Play Store.
9837000	9842000	And pretty much all a lot of my friends play those because here's the thing.
9842000	9854000	The difference is that in the Japanese games, you're getting more freebies, more bonuses, more stats for the characters that you're playing as opposed to level grinding and getting on the American one.
9854000	9859000	You're level grinding, you get a piece of bread as opposed to Japanese one. You're level grinding, you get a whole loaf.
9859000	9865000	Okay, that makes sense. I gotcha. I thought you were talking about CD stuff, so I'm glad you clarified that.
9865000	9867000	What? No, no, no.
9867000	9871000	Gotcha. Alright, so instead of Luminous, what was that game called again?
9871000	9872000	Rebirth.
9872000	9877000	Rebirth. Alright, I will make a note to check that out if it's on iTunes and the iOS platform.
9877000	9887000	And another thing that really grinds my gear about this game, it seems there is this trend where if you're not connected to a network, the game will not play.
9887000	9893000	The game will play, but if it finds out that you're not on a network, the game just locks up. I'm just like, seriously?
9893000	9900000	It's that stinking, it always, because it gets all the patch data online when you connect and the Square games do this too and it's really annoying.
9900000	9910000	Same thing with Sailor Moon Drops. It's like, I can only play the first three levels of whatever I'm in. If I pass those levels, if there's no internet connection, I can't play the next one.
9910000	9914000	I think it's an anti-Loki thing so that he can't cheat. I don't know, that's my assumption.
9914000	9916000	There's always a way.
9916000	9917000	How's nonstop night going?
9917000	9919000	It's going fine.
9919000	9923000	Alright, Rom, anything else on your mind before I take another call?
9923000	9924000	No, that's it, bro.
9924000	9927000	Alright, take care, my friend. Anime Jam session on Tuesday, right?
9927000	9928000	You got it.
9928000	9930000	Alright, we'll be there. Have a good one.
9930000	9931000	You too.
9931000	9932000	Bye.
9932000	9938000	Alright, let's see if we get more calls here at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, but we do have another call, so let's get to it.
9938000	9940000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9940000	9944000	Hi, this is Regineer.
9944000	9946000	You don't know your own name? No, that's okay. Hi, Regineer.
9946000	9955000	Actually, when you were talking, I was starting to hear my own voice coming through my headset, so it kind of threw me off.
9955000	9956000	What's on your mind, buddy?
9957000	9971000	Actually, I had a couple questions regarding modding PCs, and I'm not sure if you specifically would know the information or not. Maybe you might.
9971000	9975000	Or our chat room. We have this whole crowd-sourced chat room since we do this live.
9975000	9994000	Ultimately, I would like to mod my computer over time. For the most part, everything's stock in it with my RAM, which I upgraded from 4GB of DDR3 to 8GB.
9995000	10011000	Now, with that being said, I have three questions. First being, would I see any benefit to upgrading the RAM yet again to 16GB of DDR3?
10013000	10023000	Would you see a benefit from upgrading 8 more gigs of RAM in the machine? Would you see that necessarily in the games? Because that's all about how much memory is on your graphics card, right?
10024000	10038000	Well, it depends. You're going to see some improvements, because the less it has to write to a disk cache, the better off you are, because it's going to be using your RAM, and RAM is a lot faster than running to a disk.
10038000	10046000	So it will have some improvements there, but is it going to cause your games to look better? Probably not. It may just give you a little bit. Depends where your bottlenecks are.
10046000	10053000	And some crowd-sourced answers here, because admittedly, I don't know a lot about this subject. I just kind of go off of what I think I know.
10053000	10064000	But some comments in our chat room. Brad from Pod Culture says, more RAM is always better. Rama in chat says, you'll get better performance and stability. And Dungeon Buster says, yes, it will help, especially if you multitask a lot.
10065000	10081000	Now, one thing I've always been mentioning since I first got this computer is eventually I want to upgrade the graphics card, because it's a relatively old card. I think it's like a GTX 610 or something like that.
10081000	10094000	But anyway, before I do upgrade that, do I necessarily have to upgrade my power adapter or whatever you want to call it?
10094000	10095000	Your power supply?
10095000	10100000	Power supply to 500 or 550 or whatever it is.
10101000	10110000	What you would do is when you look at, you know, there's a couple things you do. First off, you look at the actual graphics card, because they'll usually give you a recommendation of the power supply that you need for it.
10110000	10121000	The other thing you do is online, there's a lot of those power wattage calculators where you basically put the components that you have in your PC and kind of see what you need.
10121000	10128000	Or you just buy a really fucking big power supply and just say, eh, whatever, this will run it.
10128000	10136000	But yeah, a lot of the things, even though a lot of graphics cards do take a lot of power, they've been more power efficient lately, so I don't know if it's increased that much.
10136000	10151000	Just look at the power supply. It should give you a recommendation of the minimum power supply needed for that. You'd probably be fine with that, unless you have a ton of hard drives or something, but I would just start there. Or maybe even go 100 watts over that.
10151000	10159000	Rama in chat suggests always upgrade the power supply first. 650 watts or better. Dungeon Buster says don't cheap out on the power supply.
10159000	10171000	And the other thing, too, to consider is, considering how old your computer is, if the power supply is old, those don't always work at full capacity after a certain amount of time, so you'll want to replace it anyways.
10171000	10182000	Yeah, and any problem, well not any problem, but usually the first thing that'll fault on my computers are the power supply. It's usually the first. And it's not always the most pleasant thing when those things go out, either.
10182000	10192000	So, wow, this is the closest I'm ever going to get to feeling as popular as Leo Laporte, so this is fun. But Raginator, what games are you playing with all this stuff?
10193000	10204000	I know you talk a lot about the Magic games and those trading card games, and to be honest, I don't think you're going to see a lot of improvement in those types of games with these upgrades in the system.
10204000	10214000	But if you're playing something more like, I know you've expressed interest in some of the Final Fantasy MMOs in the past, Final Fantasy XIV, absolutely, you'll get a better, a new graphics card and all that shit, that's going to be a way better framerate.
10214000	10233000	Yeah, honestly, most of my games run pretty well on medium to high settings, just fine, as it is. The only trouble is, there's one game that I do want to play right now that really, really chugs.
10233000	10244000	Luckily, I've been sucking money into it yet. I just got the free version, but there will be a killer instinct on Windows 10.
10244000	10263000	And I would imagine that, plus I haven't tried them out just yet, but I would imagine that the remastered versions of Bioshock 1 and 2, I got those for free, those are probably going to have framerate issues, my guess.
10264000	10276000	So, I would imagine pretty much that the higher end games from here on out are not going to see your framerate issues because I rolled a card.
10276000	10297000	So, I kind of figured be a little proactive, that way I kind of keep up with things. I like all the games that you had mentioned before, but also I like to play a little bit of everything.
10297000	10305000	It's just inevitable that every few years, especially if you want to play the cutting edge stuff, you will have to upgrade some of the parts and the machine.
10305000	10315000	And I guess this is why the consoles are now starting to take a very similar approach, is that, well, we're doing these incremental upgrades since people do the incremental upgrades on their PC, but we'll see if it's a strategy that pays off.
10315000	10320000	Anyways, Ray Jeter, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in another call, alright? But thanks for the call. Have a good one, buddy.
10320000	10321000	Alright, thanks.
10321000	10322000	Alright, bye.
10323000	10332000	Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype. If you would like to call and get in, I've probably got enough time to squeeze in one more call. Do we have any last minute stories, Loki? We got a squeeze in here?
10332000	10344000	Yeah, my last minute story is my stupid wireless network card that was a USB thing that I bought from my laptop because it upgrades it to a wireless AC. Decided to, hey, fuck you, I'm not going to work.
10344000	10347000	You know I have one, and Shane has been borrowing it.
10347000	10366000	I'm just going to go buy a new one, but it's because it's my kid's fault, to be honest. It's because I leave my laptop, I'm very dumb, I leave my laptop on the ground because I have this really heavy cooling tray, and it sits on the ground when I get up from the couch and stuff.
10366000	10371000	And they're reckless, and they accidentally step on things, and I think that they've stepped on it before.
10371000	10375000	Alright, we got one more call coming on. Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10375000	10376000	Hey, it's Brad from Pod Culture.
10376000	10378000	Hey, Brad, what's on your mind, buddy?
10378000	10393000	Well, you were talking about hardware or accessories and stuff earlier with your little Pokemon Go device, and I picked up a new piece of hardware earlier. I got one of the Xbox One S controllers from the Evil G.
10393000	10395000	Oh, okay, what'd you think of that?
10395000	10406000	Well, I got the Gears of War exclusive one that they had, because my PC controller died, so I had to pick up a new controller, and these have Bluetooth in them now.
10406000	10407000	Okay, makes sense.
10407000	10408000	Or work better with Bluetooth.
10408000	10409000	Makes sense.
10409000	10410000	You don't have to have that damn dongle.
10410000	10411000	Yeah, makes sense.
10411000	10413000	It's pretty nice.
10413000	10417000	Are you playing anything on PC with it, or are you kind of sticking to Xbox?
10417000	10418000	No man's guy.
10418000	10419000	Okay.
10419000	10421000	I like a lot.
10421000	10426000	Awesome. Did they change how it kind of feels compared to the controllers that are out today?
10426000	10442000	A little bit. The shoulder buttons aren't as clacky as they are on the first one, and the thumb sticks seem to be a little more sensitive.
10442000	10451000	Okay, so it's a little more sensitive. What about the D-pad? The D-pad was something I never really liked, especially on the old 360 controller. It was a beast. What's it like on this new one?
10451000	10463000	Well, to me it feels the same as the regular Xbox One controller. The only reason I picked the Xbox One S controller up is because of the Bluetooth functionality. I don't have to have a wire now.
10463000	10470000	No, it makes sense. Wireless is where it's at. You know, I still have a wired 360 controller that I sometimes use on PC, because it works.
10470000	10475000	That's what I was using. I had a razor saber tooth that just finally died.
10475000	10484000	Now I have a Steam controller, and I really like that, because it does a little feedback thing as you're moving it. It's kind of like it tickles your thumb as you're moving it around the PC.
10484000	10487000	I have one of those, because I have a Steam link.
10487000	10489000	Oh, I'm surprised you're not using that on your PC.
10489000	10493000	Because No Man's Sky doesn't stream very well on it, apparently.
10493000	10498000	Oh yeah, that reminds me. Did you ever give us an impression about your Steam controller?
10499000	10507000	I don't like it, but I'm also not a big fan of change. And that is just one weird-ass controller.
10507000	10512000	As far as I go, I thought I did talk about it a week or two after I got the device. You just might not have been here that week.
10512000	10513000	I just don't remember.
10513000	10521000	I like it. It's kind of funky with the whole, like, trying to type with it is really funny. But I like the feedback thing in the D-Pad.
10521000	10527000	It's weird, but it kind of lets you know that it's sensing the movement that you're doing. I like it.
10527000	10529000	Is it like the 3D Touch on your iPhone?
10529000	10534000	I don't have 3D Touch on my iPhone. I have a 6, not a 6S or a 7.
10534000	10536000	What, time to upgrade?
10536000	10539000	Well, I thought I might have talked about this last week. I don't remember.
10539000	10545000	But I've actually decided this is going to be the first time that I'm eligible for an upgrade that I'm going to sit out.
10545000	10552000	I'm not that excited about iPhone 7. I don't think the time is right for me to jump ship to Android either.
10552000	10556000	I don't think, like, you know, I see Alan's phone and I'm like, eh, eh.
10556000	10560000	And plus, if I need to use an Android for something, which I've had to before.
10560000	10564000	I've been very curious about podcasting on Android and how that works and all that stuff.
10564000	10568000	So, Alan shows me all that stuff. So, I kind of like that we have both in the household.
10568000	10574000	But just now's not the time for iPhone. There's a lot of rumors that they're going to do something major for the 10th anniversary.
10574000	10578000	Although, it would be very weird for them to do the major upgrade on the off cycle.
10579000	10585000	The camera upgrade is just not enough for me. My current phone is really, really good.
10585000	10590000	Jump ship. I have an S7 Edge and the camera on that is amazing.
10590000	10594000	Not a note. I'm crazy, but not that crazy.
10594000	10603000	I don't take pictures a lot. I take pictures of the cat. I take selfies. I don't take very scenic types of pictures very often.
10603000	10605000	I don't take pictures of the cats.
10605000	10608000	Yeah, it's true. I get some really good pictures of the cats.
10608000	10615000	We had a cat that passed three years ago. Once in a while, when I'm going through pictures on my phone or on my computer, I'll come across a picture.
10615000	10619000	Aww. Aww, I miss that little fucker.
10619000	10624000	And Facebook, yeah. Facebook memories is a bitch in that way.
10624000	10626000	Oh, Facebook memories can kind of be cruel.
10626000	10629000	Yes, because they keep bringing Clara up.
10629000	10631000	Yeah, I know. It happens. It happens.
10631000	10635000	All right. Well, Brad from Pod Culture, my friend, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10635000	10636000	All right.
10636000	10637000	But thanks for the call.
10637000	10638000	All right, man. Later on.
10638000	10639000	Take care. All right. Bye-bye.
10640000	10642000	All right. That is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10642000	10644000	Sorry if you didn't get through, but consider sending us an email.
10644000	10651000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com or we will be back in two weeks here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10651000	10660000	Before we wrap things up, though, we've got to get back to work tomorrow on a Monday, so we need to clear our system of the angst in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
10661000	10675000	This is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is... This is fucked up.
10676000	10681000	FU did my stupid network card just because, I don't know, it just decided to stop working.
10681000	10687000	And then on top of that, on top of that, because that wouldn't be a big deal because my laptop has a built-in network card.
10687000	10691000	My built-in network card says, hey, I'm not going to fucking enable myself anymore.
10691000	10693000	So, fuck you.
10693000	10696000	So now I have to go to Walmart to buy a new network card.
10696000	10697000	Tonight.
10698000	10705000	FU did the fact that this weekend was really busy and I didn't feel like I got to relax a lot, although the mani-pedi was nice, I will say.
10705000	10707000	I was pretty relaxing, but nothing else.
10707000	10714000	And FU did the fact that I'm just hearing that Arnold Palmer died, the golfer and creator of one of my favorite drinks to order at a restaurant.
10714000	10717000	That's not a joke. I really do like the half iced tea, half lemonade thing.
10717000	10722000	That's one of my favorite things to drink, so that sucks.
10722000	10726000	2016 is an asshole. Seriously.
10726000	10733000	Well, the good news is when we come back, 2016 will be one step closer to being over because it'll already be October by the time we're back.
10733000	10736000	But we will not be here again next week, don't forget.
10736000	10740000	So we will see you in two weeks with an all-new edition of Orange Laundrio.
10740000	10747000	Hey, remember, if you like what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, tell a friend or five about the show and help us spread the word.
10747000	10749000	Because, you know, we don't have a million dollar magazine behind us.
10749000	10752000	We're not sponsored by YouTube or Jeff Keighley or IGN.
10752000	10754000	We're not any of that stuff.
10754000	10757000	So, you know, we need a word of mouth. We really rely on that.
10757000	10759000	Not like anyone has a magazine behind them anymore.
10759000	10761000	Probably not anymore. A digital magazine, I guess.
10761000	10764000	But we don't have any of that behind us, so help us spread the word.
10764000	10771000	And, you know, a nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this show, like a Google store or wherever.
10771000	10774000	That goes a long way as well, so we really appreciate that.
10774000	10777000	But that is going to do it tonight for a couple of weeks.
10777000	10780000	But first, our final thought. Loki.
10780000	10785000	I guess I should play some games this week. I don't know. There's a lot of stuff on sale right now.
10785000	10787000	I may peruse that.
10787000	10793000	I've also been eyeing RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, which is part of the Humble Bundle right now.
10793000	10797000	So go pick that up for a dollar and get RollerCoaster Tycoon 2.
10797000	10798000	I have to look into that.
10798000	10803000	And my final thought is I'm really looking forward to GamerX and I'm looking forward to meeting some of you there.
10803000	10805000	Please don't be shy.
10805000	10810000	I know it's weird sometimes when we go from the online space into the real world space.
10810000	10816000	But I promise you, even if I have resting bitch face, I'm super approachable and I want to meet more people and listeners.
10816000	10818000	So please feel free to come up to the table and say hi.
10818000	10822000	If I'm not there, somebody who knows me is there and will know when I'll be back.
10822000	10826000	Just remember, I'm trying to enjoy the con too, so I don't want to be at that table all day every day.
10826000	10833000	But we also will have the panel on Sunday at 2 o'clock, so I would really encourage you to check that out.
10833000	10838000	And just really looking forward to playing some games. Take my 3DS, we'll play some games.
10838000	10848000	It's a bummer. I didn't have a console that's the size of a battery that I could take to the hotel room with me and have full console gaming in my hotel room.
10848000	10857000	So what is the time to stories of, oh, I lost my console because, you know, they had the...
10857000	10860000	I threw the power brick through the TV.
10861000	10862000	Yeah, yeah.
10862000	10869000	All right. So again, we will see you in two weeks unless a Nintendo NX announcement happens this week.
10869000	10874000	That's the only way you're going to get a surprise OLR show. So Nintendo, a lot is resting on you.
10874000	10880000	But I have a feeling, despite all that, we'll be seeing you in two weeks here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10880000	10884000	Have a great couple of weeks, everybody. We'll see you next time. Thanks again. Good night.
10884000	10887000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
