00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:26.000
Tonight, it's been a busy week in video gaming and we've got a packed show to match. Join us for all the latest news in sequels, prequel sequels, lawsuits, and an interview too. All this, and yet still more, starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:54.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, September the 18th of 2016 with episode number 658 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me here in studio as he does every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Doing fine.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Hopefully you're doing better this week. I know your birthday week didn't go so well, but I hope this week is doing better.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Oh, I'm over that now.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
Okay, much better. So maybe less angry rants tonight, or will we still have plenty? I don't know.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm sure there will be something.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
There will be something, something to get the rants going on. You guys of course can always rant along with our show.

01:18.000 --> 01:29.000
Like the trial version of M-I-R-C, which is not letting me actually open it, which is ironic because I actually did pay for a copy of M-I-R-C and I don't know where my stupid registration code is.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I was going to say, maybe it's time to register.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
No, I already paid it. I paid it, I just don't know which email they sent it to and they have no absolute way to track their registrations because they're fantastic.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
All right. You can join us, of course, live. If you are listening to our show live every Sunday night at The Voice of Geeks Network is where we tape.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
And if you are listening live, we invite you to join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
And of course tonight we are going to be having an interview a little later, as was mentioned in the intro, kind of following a similar theme to what we had last week.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
Gay was here last week with Sacramento IGDA talking about some of his indie game development things.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
And we're actually going to have another indie game dev on tonight.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
Sam from Remote Games is going to be here in a little over 15 minutes to talk about his project called Silent Earth.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
So we'll talk to him more about that in a little while.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
It's like Silent Hill, but bigger.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
No, it's actually nothing like that.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I think that there's a concept in there somewhere.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
You could have a game like Silent Hill, but it's like the randomly generated areas like No Man's Sky.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
So it's huge.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
It's just huge.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Maybe not, maybe not.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
I think the game Sam's making might be a little more focused and possibly better too.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
So we'll talk to him about that a little later.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
For now, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So maybe speaking of rants, I don't know.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
This is a topic that sometimes makes people angry, but I don't think it's like one of those things to like super get irritated over.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
But we have some news of some big game delays.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Right, Loki? What happened?

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah, so basically there's two game delays that were announced this week.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
The first one being that the Last Guardian is going to be delayed again in which everyone's like, no!

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
To December, which is about a month away.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, after 10 years, what's another month, right?

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah, so they just need some extra time on it and that's fine, whatever.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
And then, you know, the South Park Fractured But Whole is going to be delayed to quarter one of 2017.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Which, honestly, I want to say that's, I don't know if that's what happened with the first one.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
I know that it came out, it was delayed a few times the first one when it originally came out.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, and this is because there's this very interesting trend going on where every single game gets delayed.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Every single one of them gets, maybe not every single one, but it definitely seems like, I mean,

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
we hear stories about game delays far more often than we don't hear stories about game delays.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
So that caused me to, you know, sometimes when I read a gaming story, I have this tendency to write a very reactive tweet.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
I don't know, does anybody else do this? Maybe you go to Twitter to throw out a little sass.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
So I did as well and I just, I wrote a little tweet that was like, and I used the little clapping emoji

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
because that's what you do when you have your point to get across, right? You know, stop doing that clap.

04:26.000 --> 04:36.000
But I wrote a little tweet that was like, you know, game release dates are BS and they're nothing but a way to push preorders for retailers.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Do you think that, I mean, Loki, you worked in that industry for many, many years.

04:41.000 --> 04:49.000
Do you think there's some truth to that? That, I mean, release dates really only exist to generate preorders and hype and all that?

04:49.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah, release dates change all the goddamn time, like all the time. And a lot of, it's just, the problem is that they announced the two early, I think.

04:58.000 --> 05:10.000
And it is good that at least we're seeing them put out games that aren't completely buggy, aside from like, you know, No Man's Sky and stuff, which got delayed and still was buggy.

05:11.000 --> 05:24.000
But, you know, South Park though, being that the pedigree of the game, I trust them a lot more than I would trust, say, you know, I don't know, The Last Guardian, God, it's been delayed so many times, who knows.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
But I would assume that's going to be a good game.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah, I mean, and here's the thing, it's not like I'm saying like, oh, delays are going to make a game bad. That's hardly the truth.

05:31.000 --> 05:45.000
And it's fine too, especially with normally like it used to be like everything you get clumped into the fourth quarter. And then it's just like, I can't buy everything, which is, you know, so I was I was planning on picking up South Park and I already have it preordered.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
So, you know, buying into the hype. No, I got it. The digital version preordered so I could play the original game.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Oh, yeah. I never finished that little freebie.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Hey, that's worth it for that. I mean, come on.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
OK, so but yeah, normally I don't even digitally, I don't really preorder stuff unless I want it right away.

06:05.000 --> 06:12.000
Tech 2030 in chat says, LOL, did Rob just do the clap emoji meme IRL? Yes, I did.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
Let's see, a stoppie in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, NX announcement delayed. Maybe, probably, likely.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
You know, I would have, I would have fully expected, you know, my prediction was NX was going to be announced.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah, now the rumor is, oh, it's going to be October. Yeah, come on. No one knows what it's going to be.

06:32.000 --> 06:40.000
It's just, yeah, everybody's guessing at this point. And we're all just setting ourselves up for disappointment. Isn't that that running trend with release dates and everything?

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
Like I said, South Park, I'm sure it's gonna be great. Last Guardian, it's gonna be great. All these games that get delayed usually end up pretty great.

06:47.000 --> 06:58.000
I mean, the delays are often for a pretty good reason. So we've got to find this balance between the marketing department that wants to put on the PR that wants to put all these dates out there to generate the hype.

06:58.000 --> 07:10.000
And the realistic scenario of that sometimes when you're developing for an HD platform, especially now, so we have to talk pro platforms with 4k and all this stuff, the game development takes a little bit longer.

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
Right? So where is the happy medium? And for me as a podcaster slash fan slash commentator slash whatever the hell you want to call me.

07:18.000 --> 07:28.000
This stuff has been kind of frustrating for a while because it makes me go like, what I feel like when we do these stories on the show about release dates, which we have some tonight, right?

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
Tokyo Game Show happened this week. So they were talking about, oh, here's some big games that are coming come out and their release dates.

07:34.000 --> 07:46.000
So I'm sitting here going, well, I want to talk about them on the show because these games do sound exciting, but I don't, I don't really want to hype these dates, because how often do these dates really end up sticking?

07:46.000 --> 08:00.000
They probably won't. So I'm like, do I say they're there? It's a target date. That's kind of a term I've been liking lately as a release target, because it at least kind of puts that image out there that it's an ever moving thing.

08:00.000 --> 08:10.000
We even do a segment here on the show called release dates. Now, granted, by the time we're talking about the games that are going to be out that week, I think the list is usually pretty accurate.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
But even then we've had some games that we said on the show, they're going to be on shelves this week. And then suddenly there's something that happens that gets them delayed.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
You know what I mean? I don't know. Like that part is just, it's frustrating. But and then I kind of look and go, does this really happen to like movies and stuff?

08:25.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, yeah, actually it kind of does. It happens to movies a lot, right, Loki? Movies get moved around all the time. And a lot of that is strategical, usually, is that they don't want a movie to open up against another movie.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
And that's what happened with the Warcraft movie, right? It got bumped back from like the holidays of 2016 to not compete with other stuff, right?

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I never saw it. Didn't have an interest in seeing it. Don't care.

08:47.000 --> 08:57.000
It wasn't bad. It wasn't bad. And then TigerConChat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says, don't be surprised if Nintendo delays the NX. You know it's a possibility. Oh, it's absolutely a possibility.

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
I just don't care at this point. And the reason for that is because like, I still don't know what the fuck it is. So why am I supposed to be excited about it?

09:04.000 --> 09:12.000
Maybe that's an okay place to be. Maybe that's where we as gamers need to set our expectations right now is that you know what? We just don't know.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
They're going to talk about it when they're going to talk about it. And let's just stop hyping up this thing that for all practical purposes doesn't exist.

09:20.000 --> 09:34.000
Because as you start to set more and more and more and more expectations of, oh, the NX is going to be for sure a tablet and desktop thing because all these rumors say so that's going to let you stream your games live to the remote.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
And it's going to have all this online platform. I don't know. I'm just making this stuff up at this point. But that's what a lot of these websites are doing is just really reaching with patents and all this other stuff.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Online platform.

09:45.000 --> 09:59.000
Just bear with me here. All right. So you're setting these expectations that are may or may not be met. It's like you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. So I'm just kind of sitting here like, I'm just, I'm kind of like over it at this point. I'm just over it.

09:59.000 --> 10:13.000
I will continue to talk about NX rumors and big things like that because this is a show that talks about gaming culture as well. And that conversation still continues to dominate a lot of gaming culture.

10:13.000 --> 10:23.000
But that doesn't mean I'm not going to sit here at the same time and go, but maybe we should just stop letting that be a part of culture right now and just, you know, when they're going to announce it, they're going to announce it.

10:23.000 --> 10:35.000
And we just don't freaking know at this point when that's going to be, and maybe y'all should just start realistically setting your expectations that NX could be a holiday 2017.

10:35.000 --> 10:47.000
But the amiibos, the amiibos have a date of March the 4th. Oh, sure. Cause those, those retail days never change. Never change. Rock solid. Right?

10:48.000 --> 10:58.000
That never changes ever. What day was beautiful Katamari coming out again? I don't know. Anyway, blast from the past there. Not everyone's going to get that reference and that's okay.

10:58.000 --> 11:10.000
But anyway, uh, you know, you know what I mean? Those, those things, they're not really hard evidence, you know, retailers put stuff in their system. And yes, I know they've been hyping up Zelda for March for Wii U.

11:11.000 --> 11:22.000
A variety of things could happen. They could just delay it. I mean, Final Fantasy 15 had the biggest pomp and circumstance event over the release date of the game and still delayed it.

11:22.000 --> 11:33.000
So I'm sorry, but this whole Zelda is for sure coming out March thing holds just about as much water at this point. There's nothing to say that they couldn't release it on the Wii U and then the NX later.

11:33.000 --> 11:42.000
Cause you know Nintendo loves the double dipping thing. I'm going to stop picking on them though. Cause I do, I, I want the NX to be great. I really do.

11:42.000 --> 11:52.000
As a Nintendo fan, I want the NX to fucking kick a lot of ass. I want there to be an awesome Zelda game, an awesome Mario game, an awesome F-Zero. I'm just going to sneak that in there.

11:52.000 --> 12:00.000
I want all that to be there, but I'm just like, you know what? I just need to just, just stop and just wait and see what's going to happen with this.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
They feel very Apple to me. Like, dude, I'm sorry.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Is it because the Apple TV still hasn't happened? Is that what it is?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
No, it's not because of the Apple TV. I don't give a shit about the Apple TV.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
The Apple car?

12:11.000 --> 12:24.000
They just, God, no, I'm glad that that's not a thing. No, it's basically just cause a lot of the Apple stuff seems to be like, here's how we're innovating or how, I'm sorry, here's how we're innovating.

12:25.000 --> 12:35.000
You know, this is what you need, you know, versus like, here's what I want. They're like, no, but here's what you need.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
It's like, you don't need that. You don't need headphones that don't are $160.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Are you saying that the NX is not going to have a headphone jack? Is that what you're saying?

12:45.000 --> 12:54.000
I'm just saying that it's there. There's a lot of buzzwords going around about like how they're like, they're starting over. They're starting from scratch. They're taking it back to the root.

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
It's like none of this shit makes any, it means nothing to me. It means nothing because we don't know what the fuck it is.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
All I'm thinking it is it's a goddamn system that's cartridge based, that's both portable and a home console.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
Whoopity shit. That's not a fucking like, you know, innovative thing.

13:12.000 --> 13:22.000
You know what's also portable and a home console? My phone. Because they play it at home and I play it while I'm walking around and going places.

13:23.000 --> 13:35.000
So, so you, you've pre-ordered one of these affected games, the South Park game, but at the end of the day, you're just, the delay news just hits you with a resounding, meh, more time to play the first South Park game on PS4.

13:35.000 --> 13:45.000
I've got like dozens of games I haven't played yet that I bought. So I mean, that's, I actually, we're just talking PlayStation library, dozens of games. We're talking Steam library, hundreds of games.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
So I'm not like, whatever. Oh, darn, I will have a game of play. I'll just probably pick up Call of Duty or something.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
Do you think we need to, I mean, you've, you've heard me talk a lot here about maybe we need to reevaluate all this hype behind release dates. What's your perspective on it?

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
Do you think we should just continue to go ahead and hype release dates? Do we need to think about this differently?

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
Just do it the way you've been doing it. Just don't get so bent out of shape when stuff gets delayed because you know what's going to happen. I mean, that's really the only thing.

14:12.000 --> 14:20.000
They have to announce a date and maybe they weren't really firm on that date. And then it's like, you know what? We could release on that date, which is not going to be to the quality that we want. So we got to delay it.

14:20.000 --> 14:35.000
I mean, that's what it is. I mean, as long as you're not like delaying it every single month or something like that and not talking with, you know, the people, the fans or the people that have it preordered and stuff, keeping that communication open is important.

14:36.000 --> 14:45.000
You know, like Mighty No. 9 kind of did that. They didn't really talk to their fans too much and it kept getting delayed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed.

14:45.000 --> 14:59.000
And then, especially, you know, if you're going to delay it, it better come out looking great. It better be fucking fantastic. Don't delay shit over and over and over again and then just have it come out being completely broken and unfinished. Because that's just stupid.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
SSG100Matt in chat over at live.vongnetwork.com says, if you're violently mad about a game delay, let me introduce you to something. It's called going outside.

15:08.000 --> 15:17.000
Well, and on top of that, like seriously, people like issuing death threats for game delays, how fucking childish are you? Would you fucking do that?

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
What is your view of the real world? Like seriously, what is your view of the world?

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Like, I'm sorry, like I'm going like for perfect example today.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
Do you threaten your mom when you don't get what you want for Christmas? Like, is that how this works?

15:32.000 --> 15:42.000
Here's like, here's real life for you. On my way here to the show today, I decided to stop at Jack in the Box to get food because I was hungry and Jack in the Box has lagerous portions of food.

15:42.000 --> 15:51.000
I stopped there and they're like, you know why that is, Loki? They cater to stoners. I know you don't smoke marijuana, but you still seem to benefit from the munchies galore thing they have at Jack in the Box.

15:51.000 --> 16:03.000
So I went there and then like, um, I'm waiting, no one's answering, you know, the stupid, you know, the drive through. I'm like, okay, whatever. This is typical. They're fucking just minimum wage, whatever.

16:03.000 --> 16:16.000
So finally, like there's like, hello? I'm laying in the manager comes out. Sorry, we're close for 30 minutes cause we just got robbed. I didn't go, you know, fuck you. I hope you die, you fucking asshole. Where's my goddamn food? I came here for food.

16:16.000 --> 16:28.000
I mean that like, but you know, the car behind you did that. I mean, is that like, that's how those people that send death threats for like, I mean, can you, I can't imagine just like daily life with them.

16:28.000 --> 16:38.000
You know, they're going to the grocery store. I'm sorry. They're locally. This is something that we have to do. If you don't bring a bag, you got to pay 10 cents for a bag, which is fucking stupid in its own right.

16:38.000 --> 16:51.000
But, um, you know, it's like, I'm sorry, you'd have to pay 10 cents for that bag. Fuck you. I hope your family dies in a fire. I hope your house burns down. Fuck you. I'm going to come to your house. I know where you live. I'm going to murder you in the goddamn face.

16:51.000 --> 17:00.000
You know, it's like, do you do that laughing, but I'm laughing in a horror because this is what Twitter would be in real life. You don't like people don't do that.

17:00.000 --> 17:12.000
And the reason they do that is because they're anonymous because if they knew who they were, if like you could like click on their name and see their face and where they live and all that shit, they wouldn't be fucking doing that shit because they'd be accountable for what they say.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
But they're not. They're anonymous on the internet and they think that they could do whatever they want. So that's it.

17:17.000 --> 17:29.000
Uh, let's see. Alan alchemy and Chad over at live.fognetwork.com says, I'm thinking of the chicken nuggets, super cyan lady. Now have you seen that video? This isn't even my final form. Have you seen that lady? They wouldn't sell her McNuggets at the drive through.

17:29.000 --> 17:37.000
So she just like, she went like batshit crazy to drive it. It's really awkward to watch. Like you look at it and you just go, why did they not sell her nuggets ma'am? You've had enough.

17:37.000 --> 17:47.000
I think it was like 10th. It was breakfast hours, so they didn't have McNuggets yet. She was probably still up from the night before because of the drugs, allegedly.

17:47.000 --> 17:55.000
Uh, let's see. Dungeon Buster in chat says, all mess you up for delaying my game becomes all love pixels that look round and yummy.

17:56.000 --> 18:08.000
As shown under Matt says, those people do not act like this in public. It's the anonymity of the internet that lets them get away with it. So there it is.

18:08.000 --> 18:18.000
Uh, so we're going to, uh, we're going to just probably keep reporting these delays. So just, just anticipate if there's a big game coming out, it's probably going to get delayed.

18:18.000 --> 18:37.000
I wonder if they could do something like with social media. I mean, I don't, I'm not against, you know, anonymity on social media, but like, you know, like how if you have a dispute on like eBay or something like that, when you, you know, file a complaint or something like that, like you get to see the seller's information, they get to see your information, like your contact information.

18:37.000 --> 18:48.000
Can we do that? Like in social media, like if someone's being an absolute, you know, dipshit and fucking threatening people that like you file a complaint and you get to see who they are and they get to see who you are. I don't know.

18:48.000 --> 18:57.000
It just opens a whole nother can of worms about that system being abused. There's more I could say on it, but that's just the long and the short.

18:57.000 --> 19:09.000
No abuse on the internet. That's just ridiculous. I think at some point Twitter themselves has to step in, but Twitter is almost like Twitter would tell you they're too big and there's nothing they can do about it, but it's one of those.

19:09.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, if you're that big, you need to be hiring some type of every situation, but you got to do something. It's too bad. Your direct messages now have read receipt stamps. Isn't that exciting?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
So you can say, show me the receipts. Ah, yes, you did read that.

19:28.000 --> 19:44.000
Alright, look, we got to change things up a little bit here. Let's just cut out the PR department. Let's just cut out the marketing. Let's cut all that out. Let's go back to when it's one or two people making the game and it'll be out when it's ready. That's how they do it in the indie scene.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
I don't know. A lot of developers don't want to talk to fans or people.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Well, we've got one who wants to talk to us tonight.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, exactly.

19:51.000 --> 20:06.000
I know. We're very excited about it. So we're going to bring him onto the show. His name is Sam. He's from a company called Remote Games and the game that they're working on is called Silent Earth. And so we're going to get Sam on the line here to talk about the game Silent Earth. Sam, are you here with us?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah, I am. Can you hear me okay?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, we can. Welcome to OLR.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Hey, thanks for having me. This is pretty cool.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
No problem. Thanks for being here. Tell us a little bit about your project, Silent Earth.

20:19.000 --> 20:47.000
Okay, well, where do I start? Let's see. As far as what the game's about, it's a game that's very much thematically about simulations and how simulations reflect on reality versus looking at reality through the lens of a computer screen, like an interface of some kind.

20:47.000 --> 20:58.000
How different is a simulation from something that you're looking through elsewhere? So it's really just about Missile Command.

20:58.000 --> 21:06.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. So you just told this whole big story and then you said that.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
Sorry, I got super distracted and did a really bad intro for the game. Let me play again, okay? Sorry.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Sure, why not? We screw up all the time here on OLR. Why not?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
You there with me?

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah, we are. I think we have a little bit of a delay though.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Hello?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Hi, we're here.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I can't hear you.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
Uh-oh. Okay, these things happen. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to just drop the call here real quick.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Okay.

21:30.000 --> 21:40.000
And I'm going to try calling him back. He had the video going. And so I'm going to tell him to try not doing video. And we're going to get him back on the line.

21:40.000 --> 21:48.000
And of course, as live radio goes, sometimes these things happen and the chatters are having fun with it. Let's see.

21:48.000 --> 21:57.000
Tiger Claw in chat says, some developers hire a PR person to talk to them because sometimes the developer opens their mouth saying things that would cause expectations to run really high.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
And when the game comes out…

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Okay, I'm here. Is that okay?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
That's right. Hey, Sam, you here?

22:02.000 --> 22:12.000
Loki, why don't you tell us about your gaming week here real quick while I try to fix this situation. We'll get into how is your gaming week and then we'll get Sam back on the line here.

22:13.000 --> 22:28.000
Alright, so this week I basically played, well, basically just Ingress a little bit. And a little bit of Pokemon Go. I got that new update with the buddy Pokemon stuff.

22:28.000 --> 22:36.000
And yeah, I completely still bitched about having to fix my son's phone. Thankfully it wasn't as hard to unroot it as I thought it would be.

22:37.000 --> 22:49.000
Pretty much just running recovery and uninstalling Super User, which was pretty simple. And so he's up and running again as well. It's still a pain in the ass. I shouldn't have had to do that in the first place.

22:49.000 --> 23:02.000
But we did that. And then I thought about picking up a Pokemon Go Plus, but then I've been hearing a lot of things regarding it. Just how it's basically just this $35 Poke Ball Waster.

23:02.000 --> 23:16.000
It only throws the common, you know, your regular Poke Balls. It only throws it once and most of the time stuff escapes. Especially when you're high enough level in the game where you can't really catch stuff too easily.

23:16.000 --> 23:30.000
So it's an absolute waste of money if you're kind of past level 20. On top of that, I mean I guess it could spin Poke Sops and stuff. So I still wanted to pick it up just to be able to hack it and all that.

23:31.000 --> 23:43.000
I don't know. I just didn't find it. Because a lot of people are scalping them. They are selling them for over retail. And because people are dumb enough to buy them and I'm just not dumb enough to buy it for that kind of price.

23:43.000 --> 23:52.000
Nor even $35. It's really kind of expensive. So I'm just not going to pick it up. The other stuff I've played, Nonstop Night. I've been playing a little bit more of that.

23:53.000 --> 24:11.000
What else? Console gaming wise, I don't think I've really played anything. Which is too bad. But I'll probably go back. I've been working mentally. I'm mentally working because I haven't actually coded anything on my game.

24:11.000 --> 24:19.000
But thankfully, as I posted on Twitter, I had an epiphany last night. Of course, where do you have most of your epiphanies? Sitting on the toilet.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
TMI!

24:21.000 --> 24:35.000
But no. I figured out. Because the thing that was giving me the hang up on that was my engine. Which was going to be almost like a voxel based engine. But I didn't really want it to be a voxel based engine.

24:35.000 --> 24:44.000
I was struggling with how am I going to optimize this? How am I going to do certain things? And then last night it just kind of hit me how I'm going to do it.

24:44.000 --> 24:54.000
And I was like, oh my god. This is so much easier than what I was thinking of doing. And just like, I completely am going to change how I was going to do it.

24:54.000 --> 25:06.000
Alright. Glad to hear you've had an epiphany. Okay, I think I've got the Skype situation figured out. We're going to try to get Sam on the line the old fashioned way. Through the old telephone.

25:06.000 --> 25:14.000
And we'll give him a call here. And finish his thoughts on his game. Hey Sam, you with us?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Yes I am. I can actually hear you now.

25:17.000 --> 25:26.000
Skype sometimes has a really bad delay. And if there's WiFi and all that stuff it gets crazy. But I'm glad we were able to click in the back line to get you back on the show.

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah. I don't know how much of the game's intro you guys got. So I can sort of go over that again if you'd like.

25:33.000 --> 25:41.000
Sure. We got a really nice description about your vision of the game. And then you kind of ended it with, yeah it's Missile Command.

25:42.000 --> 25:54.000
Oh yeah. Maybe you missed a chunk or something. Okay cool. So I'll just go over it again. Basically it's sort of a new take on Missile Command.

25:54.000 --> 26:08.000
That's put through, okay so what if we took the arcade formula of short rounds or levels with the intention of high difficulty for the sake of you having to start from the beginning over and over again.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
What if we took that formula seriously? What does it mean dramatically? And so that's sort of my take on that, right?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Right.

26:16.000 --> 26:27.000
In this case it's Missile Command. Because I had the idea from playing Missile Command, that's when I sort of came up with the idea of taking an arcade game formula seriously, right?

26:28.000 --> 26:42.000
And it's just sort of talking about, I wouldn't say it's Missile Command on a, it's not a copy for copy of Missile Command. It's super updated, right?

26:42.000 --> 26:52.000
So we focus on things like, for example, you have an upgradable missile with weapons that you can change in and out and there's lots of different ways to tailor your playstyle.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
There is a narrative to the game and a whole bunch of other stuff.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah, I noticed you were good enough to let me check out Silent Earth before our interview tonight, so I did check it out a little bit.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
And admittedly at first, you know, when I fired up the game I said, oh, this is kind of, you know, it reminds me a lot of Missile Command.

27:07.000 --> 27:21.000
But as I was starting to play it, like, not even like a minute into it, I realized, oh, but there's this giant shield that's protecting my town and oh, this energy meter is completely different from how Missile Command would have the missiles in it.

27:21.000 --> 27:34.000
And oh, suddenly I got this upgrade that changes my weapon so it fires this big line across the screen that would kind of strategically change the way you might think about a game like this.

27:34.000 --> 27:44.000
I guess maybe, I guess maybe I was like, what if somebody made Missile Command, like had the idea for Missile Command today, but had today's tools to do it? Is that fair to?

27:45.000 --> 27:57.000
Yes, no, totally. You know, it's very much like a super modernization of that formula and then like, you know, like I said thematically, like how can we evaluate, like look at an arcade game thematically, right?

27:57.000 --> 28:07.000
So yes, actually mechanically it's like a huge re-sort of imagining of what Missile Command was originally when it came out.

28:07.000 --> 28:21.000
You know, what might it look like now? If they could, if they had access to like, you know, the decades of game design advancement and then like also like, you know, just like all the technology and all that stuff too.

28:21.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah. If you guys have a question for Sam, you can ask in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and we will ask him some of the questions from you guys here live listening to the show.

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
Silent Earth not actually released yet, but you guys are targeting early next year. Is that right?

28:38.000 --> 29:00.000
Yes, that's what we want to do. Right now it's just me and one other guy, Command and Development team. I handle visuals, code, most of the writing and my buddy Thomas Hoey, who's based out of Bristol in the UK, handles all the audio and the audio programming.

29:00.000 --> 29:10.000
We have a special software called S-Mod, which is our audio engine. And so he handles how the audio engine runs. And then I would just integrate that into the game.

29:10.000 --> 29:19.000
Now, if I remember right from reading on the website, this is like it's a procedurally generated soundtrack? Like it's a soundtrack that's not always going to be the same?

29:20.000 --> 29:35.000
Yeah, so it's not procedurally generated in the sense that we have an instrument generator that's making notes. We just have a huge bank of stems that the generator gets to pick from.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
You'll always feel like a slightly different remixed version of the theme. Things will always be kind of different. The farther you go, the more...

29:42.000 --> 29:52.000
We're working on this sort of sneaky little addition where the farther you go in the game, the more the stems unlock. So the diversity actually increases the more you play.

29:52.000 --> 30:03.000
So yeah, unlocks are a big part of the game, but we actually wanted to make a game without any gameplay unlocks, aside from the upgrades.

30:03.000 --> 30:17.000
So most of the things you'll be unlocking are like palettes, narrative is the biggest one, and then obviously the upgrades, but as you get them further on in the game.

30:17.000 --> 30:26.000
So basically, the first time you encounter the wine mod, that means you'll have the wine mod forever, right? There's a force push mod that you may or may not have gotten to.

30:26.000 --> 30:39.000
I think the build I sent you actually had a huge spike in difficulty. That may have prevented you from getting that, but you can get that force mod, and then the first time you get that, it'll be in the pool of things that you can get at any time.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Because you'll be playing it over and over.

30:42.000 --> 30:55.000
So it encourages you, whereas the first time you play, you might be like, okay, so I've got missiles and this feels a little familiar. The further down the rabbit hole you go, so to speak, you start to get more and more elaborate and you get to keep these things with you.

30:55.000 --> 31:11.000
Yes, yeah, 100%. The game definitely encourages you to keep playing it as far as mechanical interplay between all the different stuff goes, right?

31:11.000 --> 31:26.000
So the game will be super basic when you start. By the time you edit, you'll have a much more depthful knowledge of the way the different bosses behave, the way different enemies behave, and that sort of stuff.

31:26.000 --> 31:33.000
So we definitely want to have the game start really simple and then become complex, right? So the learning curve is a lot more shallower.

31:34.000 --> 31:53.000
We have a chatter in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com named JKLOL, who actually gave a link to the game, which is interesting because the link actually goes to this other website, this TIGsource.com, which seems to be from what I'm not super familiar with it, but I'm guessing a lot of indie devs are. I haven't made a game.

31:54.000 --> 32:07.000
Then you probably know this site better, Loki, but as I was starting to dig into it, I thought it was really cool because you were basically posting this big log of all the changes you've been making to the game, and you could really see how some of the feedback you were getting was influencing you.

32:07.000 --> 32:16.000
And so I could see some of the earlier screenshots of your game and kind of go, oh, well, that's different from what I just played, so he's made some changes.

32:16.000 --> 32:22.000
How is that process of being very, I guess, public with your game development?

32:22.000 --> 32:36.000
Well, TIGsource is a great, great community. And a friend of me put it this way, because before I started on TIGsource, I was super about making this game in secrecy.

32:36.000 --> 32:45.000
And I didn't even care about how much money I made on it, I just wanted it to be, to go out, and no one really did know what it was, and it to be kind of enigmatic.

32:45.000 --> 33:03.000
But I went to IndieCade with a friend, and while we were there, he sort of convinced me that like, hey man, I know that more than working on this game and having it be like the thing that you want it to be when it comes out is not as important as making up a game later, right?

33:03.000 --> 33:14.000
And so he said, even if you start showing all these people all the different feedback that you make and stuff, there's so many people who are going to see this game that just don't, like, have no clue what it is.

33:14.000 --> 33:24.000
They haven't heard of it before or anything, right? So for a lot of these people, they will absolutely still get that magic, even though you're sort of like, even though on TIG, obviously, I'm not showing the game's guts, right?

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
Like, here's how we intend players to feel at this moment, and so on and so forth.

33:28.000 --> 33:41.000
So the public part has only been good, you know? There's not been anything bad about it whatsoever, because the game has just improved since I started the TIG.

33:41.000 --> 33:48.000
Yeah. It reminds me a lot of, just looking at the visuals, it reminds me a lot of like the Space Invaders Extreme or whatever that came out.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. I can see those parallels.

33:53.000 --> 33:59.000
Speaking of the design and the look, we have a comment in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com from Dungeon Buster, who says,

33:59.000 --> 34:06.000
The narrow orientation makes the action look a bit claustrophobic, but I'm guessing that's probably by design.

34:06.000 --> 34:13.000
You know, that's a really good call out, is that Missile Command, you know, the old game, was on square TVs, basically, in the arcade and at home and so forth.

34:13.000 --> 34:22.000
You know, when you decide that you're going to go with a cell phone for your platform, you went with the more, you know, a lot of games go widescreen with it,

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
but you went portrait with it, which I can totally see what Dungeon Buster is saying. It kind of gives a very different, more claustrophobic feel to the game,

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
especially if you are familiar with Missile Command. Was that a design choice? Like, what went into that?

34:36.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah, it was. It definitely was. When I started on the game, I realized that the vertical screen looked like I wanted to make a mobile game, right?

34:43.000 --> 34:50.000
And so I realized that vertical games, I have always had more fun interacting with vertical games.

34:50.000 --> 34:58.000
I don't know how much mobile gaming you guys do, but there's ridiculous fishing, obviously, the huge one down well.

34:58.000 --> 35:06.000
You know, all these vertical games are just super fun to interact with, I think because that's how the phone is designed to be held,

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
and so you don't feel weird at all trying to control the phone like that.

35:09.000 --> 35:17.000
Like, when you turn the phone sideways, there is a weird disconnect just from using the phone that way because you're not used to holding it like that.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
Where it's like, you know, I can imagine if you try to hold, like, the first time you try to do claw hands on an Xbox controller or something like that,

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
it feels really weird and it takes you to get used to it. But the reason why I did edge of vertical is because it's very natural.

35:31.000 --> 35:39.000
I also think that, you know, as far as the claustrophobic part of the game, it's claustrophobic by design for sure,

35:39.000 --> 35:45.000
because I don't think that's a property of it being vertical, necessarily.

35:45.000 --> 35:53.000
It's supposed to be that way because there's definitely tools like the different mods, for example, that will work with that,

35:53.000 --> 36:00.000
and enemies that are designed to sort of, you know, make things more or less claustrophobic and intense and busy, right?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Right.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Right.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
Looking at other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, I love this name and I hope I'm saying it right,

36:08.000 --> 36:15.000
glorpbibbledop in chat says, I was looking for a game for my kid's iPad there too.

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
Do you think, first of all, luckiest kids in the world having an iPad at two, I'm guessing it might be a hamburger.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Yeah.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Do you think this would be easy enough for them?

36:23.000 --> 36:32.000
I think, I don't think it would be easy enough to play.

36:32.000 --> 36:41.000
I don't know if it's, like, what we plan on writing the game is necessarily going to be something I would, it would be like two-year-old material,

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
but it's also kind of one of those things that, like, when I was a kid, like really little, right, and was playing games,

36:46.000 --> 36:55.000
I played Myst when I was five, and all of the content in Myst just went straight over my head, like narrative-wise, right?

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Right.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
And that's like a pretty intense story.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
So, yeah, it might be great for a two-year-old.

37:00.000 --> 37:06.000
I've never had a two-year-old play test it, but I don't see why any reason why playing it wouldn't be,

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
because it's all, there's no words in the game, the actual gameplay, right?

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
Like it's all just icons and like, you know, like shapes and stuff.

37:12.000 --> 37:20.000
Yeah, I kind of think, based on my limited experience of the game, I kind of think a two-year-old's going to get a really big kick out of just like touching the screen and seeing the explosions happen.

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
I don't think they're going to understand the game at all, but I think they're just going to be like, ooh, when I touch it, it does things.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
You know what I mean?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Right, totally.

37:28.000 --> 37:36.000
Yeah, so I think, you know, as far as like, you know, a kid playing it and just like being able to interact with it mechanically, yeah, 100%.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Yeah.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
And I mean, the controls are very, very simple, which you kind of have to have for a mobile game, right?

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Yeah, I think I sent you a PC build, right?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Yes.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Yes, yeah.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
The PC build is, you know, it's way more fun to interact with on the phone.

37:52.000 --> 38:01.000
We're playing around with PC builds right now because we think it'd be cool to like have it on Steam just to, you know, have other, like basically to build interest for the mobile version.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
But we're not entirely sure on that yet.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Most likely we will pursue Steam now.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.000
Now tell us a little bit about, you know, because we've been talking a little bit in the first half of our show tonight about, you know, why games get delayed and all this good stuff.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
And, you know, obviously what I played of your game was good.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
I mean, it needs, you know, it probably just needs that polish, like a start screen and all that stuff.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
But for the most part, it seems like you've got a good game in there.

38:28.000 --> 38:42.000
So what are you kind of working on between, tell us a little bit about what it is you work on between now where your game is, you know, shaping up to be the game and let's say March or whatever when you are planning to release.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
I'm throwing that out there based on the winter.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Right. Well, you know, can I give you a little history of the game's development?

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Please.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
That might help frame it.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Absolutely.

38:51.000 --> 38:58.000
So like, so like I started on the game, like it's been a prototype, right, for like most of its life, which is like five years.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
And this game doesn't feel like a five year game.

39:02.000 --> 39:12.000
It's something like I've worked on other stuff and totally had this, like its progress isn't it five years and I totally had it on the back burner and worked on it and tweaked it.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
I moved recently and decided to start working on it full time.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And that was back in January.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
And it's just been, it's been this really, like the game did not play the same way back then.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
It was way slower.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
The game was like way more zoomed out.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
The action was more, it was more like a zen game.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
Like it wasn't even hard really to play.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
And I ended up turning it into like more of a full fledged action game and it worked out really well.

39:40.000 --> 39:52.000
So being that, being that it's just now become like what, what I think it's going to, like it's most resembling version of its like final form or whatever, you know, at this point we're just adding content.

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
So the build I sent you is just really like a super vertical slice of the game, right?

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
There's like three rounds and two upgrades.

39:59.000 --> 40:09.000
None of the narrative stuff, you know, none of the, like there's no unlockable system, the round just repeats, there's no menus.

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
So as far as mechanical systems and all that go and like how it plays, it's going to stay about the same, right?

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
But we definitely, you know, at this point are just at the content stage.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Interesting. So it's like you have, you have the core of the game.

40:22.000 --> 40:30.000
You have that, I don't know, whatever you want to call it, the, the, the chewy center or whatever the game is done, but now it's about building all the rest that kind of goes around it.

40:30.000 --> 40:36.000
This is probably why they say in game design, what, like the first 90 or the last 10% takes as long as the first 90%, something like that.

40:36.000 --> 40:46.000
Yeah, exactly. Cause, cause right now, you know, it was actually a pretty big effort for me to just get it to the point where it feels as good as it does.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
And I really confident in how the game feels to play.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
So, so I really feel like that that's most of the work, right.

40:53.000 --> 41:04.000
Is getting, getting a concept that's legitimately fun because I feel like that, you know, that's something that like even people who have been making games for a really long time, like not me, right?

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Like I'm, you know, I'm just an independent developer.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
So like even people who have been making games for a really long time sometimes struggle to come up with games that are legitimately fun when you play them.

41:13.000 --> 41:24.000
So that's the hardest part, but now I just have to, you know, flesh that out and explore the concepts in it and really try and just create a ton of content that really highlights all the aspects of the design.

41:24.000 --> 41:32.000
I got to mention some of the chatters here when you talked about how it's been kind of like a concept that's been evolving for five years.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
You know, our very own Loki here has been working on his own game called it's time to car.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And a lot of people have been giving him crap.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Oh, I stopped working on that.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Yeah, right. It's been, it's taken you years. Right.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
But some folks in chat like JKLL says here that Loki five years.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
So it's all because I'm not working on that one anymore.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I have another one that we're going to longer.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
So it's fine.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
All right. Let me I know we're a little bit past time here and I appreciate you staying on through all the tech difficulties and all that stuff.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
But I want to ask you at least one.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:58.000 --> 42:07.000
I want to ask you at least one more question here from SSG100 Matt in our chat room saying, have you taken the game to any conventions or shows to have people demo it?

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
If not, do you plan to take it on the road to conventions?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Yes, we have.

42:12.000 --> 42:19.000
We, we, we, we went to PixelFest, which, so I'm based out of Richmond, Virginia.

42:20.000 --> 42:31.000
And we took that came to PixelFest, which is a tiny little, little, that was the first year they did it was this year is a tiny little festival in Norfolk, Virginia.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
And then I went to IndieCade and got one of their show and tell tables.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
And I think that's IndieCade East in New York City.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
And then we are hoping we just submitted it for MagFest.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
So we will see how that goes.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Well, good luck.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
MagFest is the, I think the only East Coast show I do now.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
So I'm going to be there in 2017.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
So I'll cross my fingers for you guys.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Awesome.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I hope you guys get in so I can play this game at MagFest.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
You have some people cheering for that in the chat as well.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
SSG100 Matt who asked that question is a MagFest goer.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
So best of luck.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
I hope you guys get in there.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Yeah, well, we really appreciate it.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
So if people want to check out the progress on Silent Earth,

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
I would give you the link to the dev blog, but it's a little lengthy.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
So I'm going to encourage you to get the link from your company website,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
which is remote-games.com.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
And if they want to follow you guys on Twitter, it's at remotegamesco,

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
C-O, right?

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Yes, remotegamesco, yeah.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And feel free to follow me also.

43:30.000 --> 43:37.000
That's just at samloesschen, S-A-M-L-O-E-S-C-H-E-N.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
And I'll tweet that out from the OLR account so people can follow you

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
and continue to watch this game progress

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
and see what the concept of Missile Command might look like

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
with 2016 bells and whistles on it.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Well, I appreciate your time.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
Thanks for bearing with the technical difficulties

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
and for talking about the game.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
It's been awesome.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Gosh, thank you.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
We're an indie podcast, and we love to support indie developers,

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
and we want to wish you the best.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
And I just want to say personally I think you made the right call

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
on being more transparent with your game's progress

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
because I think everybody wants to,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
and to use a person's name as a verb here,

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
everybody wants to Beyoncé the industry

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
and drop their CD with no announcement and everything like that

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
and shock everybody,

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
but you can only Beyoncé the industry if you are Beyoncé.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Yeah, if you've already got the audience.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Exactly.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
I 100% agree.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I think you made the right call there,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
and I think this way it allows people to really kind of see

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
what you're going through there,

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
and I think people who might be considering developing their own game

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
can kind of learn from some of the stuff you've been going through.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
Yeah, well, it's 100% a labor of love.

44:44.000 --> 44:51.000
I'm making this my full-time job.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
We 100% are doing this off of savings,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
so we're doing this to make this,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
we want to make it as good as we possibly can be,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
and like what you're saying,

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
making it public and making it a transparent process

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
had it done so much for that.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
You have to wonder how some other games

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
that have come out in the past year

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
would have done through a more transparent process like that,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
but I'll leave it at that.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Sam, I want to wish you the best.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
I totally agree with you.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
All right, well, you guys have a nice night.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Thank you for having me on.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
You too.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
I want to wish you the best of luck with Silent Earth,

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
and thanks for being on tonight.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
You take care.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Yep, take it easy. Bye.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
All right, bye-bye.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
All right, that was Sam from Remote Games

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
who's making Silent Earth,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
and check that out, the screenshots and everything.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Again, that's remote-games.com.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
You can follow him on Twitter as well,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
at remotegamesco.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Stoppy in our chat room says,

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Brave man.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Yeah, to putting all that out there publicly,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
but again, I think he's right in saying

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I noticed that community was very supportive,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
and it's funny, we were talking earlier

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
about how there's a lot of nasty people

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
out there on Twitter and so forth,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
but he kind of chose this site

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
that really kind of caters to people like him,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
which I think is the way to do it,

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
to be public with something like that,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
so that's great.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
And yes, I am not working on that game.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
There is another game.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
No, seriously, there is another game

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
I was working on before I started

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
that other It's Time to Car

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
that I am still working on now,

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
and that hopefully now that I've had this epiphany,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
you will actually see something for it

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
because now I know where to go now with it.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Just now?

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
No, from earlier.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
No, I had no epiphany now,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
but from earlier, what I'm saying,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
because I figured out how I'm going to do the engine

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
so now I can build the engine.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Gotcha, gotcha.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
All right, well, best of luck to you,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
and best of luck to Sam as well,

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
and I kind of neglected to tell him this,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
but Missile Command is one of my

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
all-time old-school favorite arcade games,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
so even though we had a little joke

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
and a laugh there in the beginning about,

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
well, basically, it's Missile Command,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
it really does kind of feel like

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
what that might look like with a 2016 tool.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
When they developed Missile Command,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
they did it for what, a four-bit system

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
that was very capable of holding only a little bit of data,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
and now with a game like Silent Earth,

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
we can talk about a soundtrack that kind of changes itself

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
as you progress further into the game

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
and unlock more measures and so forth.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
It's a very different thing.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Yeah, it really does remind me of a remix take

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
on those old classic arcade games

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
like the Pac-Man Championship Edition

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
or the extreme Namco games that they have.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Well, let's actually,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
what a perfect segue into my gaming week

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
and talk about the video games I've been playing this week

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
because I've been spending a lot of time this week

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
with Pac-Man Championship Edition 2,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
which came out this week on PlayStation 4

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
as the platform I picked it up on,

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
but I think it's also on Xbox One and it's on PC as well.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
And I've got to say, I'm having a ton of fun with it.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Like, the music is really, really good.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I think I kind of made a joke

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
that they should have called the game Pac-Rave

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
because that's what the music kind of feels like to me.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
And you know, I loved Championship Edition

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and I love DX, and it's really interesting

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
because I find it hard to play the original Pac-Man these days.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
I mean, you know, if I walk by a Ms. Pac-Man machine

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
or something at an arcade, which I actually did,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
we were at a downtown arcade this week,

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
a friend of ours was in from out of town, so we took him to the coin-op.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
You know, that bar?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah, all the old school.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
So we took him to coin-op and we actually,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
they have a Ms. Pac-Man machine there.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
So you have to play Ms. Pac-Man, right?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
But you kind of go, okay, I'm playing this for the memories.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
This isn't exactly, you know, a game that might hold my attention

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
in a marathon style in the year 2016.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
But what I think the Championship Edition

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
and the Championship Edition Deluxe

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
and now part two bring into that is that

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
it really takes a new spin on the classic formula

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
that really, like, draws you in.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
And so, you know, with DX and DX2, it's speed.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
A lot of it is speed

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
and really running through those mazes and the precision.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
So with DX2, they changed a couple big, big things from DX,

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
and one of the biggest things they changed is

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
Pac-Man can collide with ghosts now,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
which you kind of take a step back from that for a minute

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
and go, well, wasn't that the whole part of Pac-Man

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
was not to touch ghosts?

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
You can touch ghosts now.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
So the whole thing is, but you can touch the ghost three times.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
And when you bump into the ghost the third time,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
the ghost gets mad, and he'll move faster

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
and chase you around the maze a little bit more aggressively.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
So it sounds like a really simple thing,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
but it really changes the way you move through mazes

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
because you kind of think to yourself,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
oh, no big deal if I bump into this train one time

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
while I'm trying to eat these other dots.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
But if it's like completely in the way,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I might have to think differently about where I'm going.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
The other big change that they did, which I don't like as much,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
is that when you eat the dot,

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
the ghost trains start to move at these hyper speeds,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
like they move super fast.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
But what you see in the maze is a wire frame,

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
like a white wire frame of here's where the ghost may go.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
And so you have to catch the ghost

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
by predicting where it's going to go on the white wire frame,

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
which it's neat in the way that it's fast paced,

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
but it really kind of slows the game down in a way too

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
because you eat the power pellet,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
and then it's like you're in this chase phase.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
And it's a really hard phase to control.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Like if you're trying to go for a really higher score,

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
it's really hard sometimes to eat the ghost train fast.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
And you might get screwed on your score

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
just because the ghost train is not where you need it to be.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
It didn't go down the right path.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
So I don't know, that element of it I don't like as much,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
but it's kind of a minor complaint all things considered.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
I like a lot of the visual flair they have in the game,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
really a step up from the deluxe.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I mean, the music's really good as it was in deluxe.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Now you have this whole thing where like when you eat the fruit

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
after clearing the board from a ghost train,

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Pac-Man kind of flies through the middle of the board

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
and lands on a new board.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
It's this really cool little visual flair

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
that the music just kind of adds to that environment and everything.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
So I really like what they did in that way.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
But I guess the only negatives I could really say too,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
as well as besides the wireframe thing,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
is that they have this whole adventure mode that's in the game,

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
and it's kind of a throwaway mode to me.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
And if you saw like the boss ghosts in the trailer and all that stuff,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
that's all in the adventure mode.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
And all the boss thing is is like six mazes rapid fire succession back to back.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
You don't actually like attack the ghost, right?

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
It's really none of that.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
So it's just a visual flair thing.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
It's cool the first time you see it.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
But honestly, adventure mode really struck me as like a throwaway thing.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
It's really all about the competition mode,

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
which is very similar to the core structure of Championship Edition

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
and Championship Edition Deluxe.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
But the game's priced, right?

51:45.000 --> 51:50.000
It's about $13.99, $12.99, somewhere in between that $10 to $15 range.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
And I think that's a fair price.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
They're not asking $60 for it.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
They're asking between $10 and $15.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
I think that's a good way to do it.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
So I like that.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Let's see.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
ActDeftInChat says, ghost get irritated if you touch them.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
I can imagine Pac-Man going like, I'm not touching you.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
Well, you have to kind of assess that as you're moving really fast through the maze

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
is that do you have enough room to bump into the ghost one time

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
so you don't set him off?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
And actually, if you're playing on a more advanced mode,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
you can only bump into them one time.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
But you can still bump into them, which is a very new thing for Pac-Man.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
So I thought that was a pretty neat concept on an old game.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Other than that, the only game I've been playing a lot a lot of this week

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
is World of Warcraft because of the expansion I've been catching up

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
from being out from Dragon Con.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I hit max level. I hit 110.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
So I guess that says something.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
I really think it might be early to say,

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
and I really have to see what the support for this expansion looks like

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
because with some of the previous World of Warcraft expansions,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
especially the last one, Draenor,

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
the support is almost what killed the expansions because there was hardly any.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
So we really have to see what that looks like.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
But I can just say the outside the box experience,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
I think this is the best expansion since Wrath of the Lich King.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
I really do.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
And most people stopped playing WoW after Wrath of the Lich King.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
So I think that kind of says a lot about the quality of this expansion.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
I really like some of the choices they made with it.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I think they're learning some things from their competition.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
I see elements of things I enjoy about Final Fantasy XIV in World of Warcraft.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
So I knew these MMOs could only help each other out in that regard.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
So that's really exciting to see.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Still love me some Final Fantasy XIV,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
but that game is getting a patch in two weeks.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
So I still feel like I have enough ample time to really sink into WoW,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
and then I'll probably go back to Final Fantasy XIV to check out that new patch.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
So yes, I'm paying for two MMOs right now.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I don't know how long that's going to last,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
but I guess it depends on where the people are. We'll see.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
But that was my gaming week.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
It was pretty much those two games.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
We're going to get into some gaming news here.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
I do first, though, want to plug a few things coming up.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Did you like tonight's interview?

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
Guess what? With Jamie being on hiatus,

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
it kind of motivated me for more content on the show

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
to really try to book more interviews.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I always wanted us to get more interviews on the show.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
I think they're a lot of fun.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Hey, I got some good news for you guys.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
We have interviews booked through mid-October right now.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
So I'm going to tell you about some of the guests we have coming up on OLR.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Are you guys ready for this? This is awesome.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Next week, Aethernaut is going to be here.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Aethernaut is going to be one of the performers at GX4.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
He's a musician, and he's very well known.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
He used some violins on stage when he was performing and so forth,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
kind of incorporates that with Chiptunes.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
So really excited to welcome him to the show.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Aethernaut is going to be here next week.

54:38.000 --> 54:46.000
On October 9th, our pal Ryan showed off a game at PAX West

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
called Monsters and Monocles.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
And that game got a lot of great feedback.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
And that's available on Early Access on Steam.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
So Monsters and Monocles is going to be here on October 9th.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
And guess what? October 23rd.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Very excited about this.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
O. A. Rock Studios is going to be here on the show.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
You may not know them by their name,

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
but they made a game on Steam called Cat President.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
And they will be here on OLR October 23rd.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
So we will talk to them about Cat President

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
and what the inspiration for a game like that might have been.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
No, I'm sure it's the election craziness and all that stuff,

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
but we're going to laugh it off, some of the similarities between that

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
and Suki Bancho, Sochao Renowii and all that stuff we went through

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
like eight years ago.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
So very excited to welcome them to the show on October 23rd.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
So if you or somebody you know that's developing a game

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
or is a part of gaming culture might want to come on OLR,

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
be sure to contact us.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
So very excited about that.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
And then of course, as we're moving into November,

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
on 20 November, Episode 666 of OLR,

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
which will be a devilishly good time.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase FLOWER.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Very excited about all that stuff that's coming up.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
There will be no show, however, on October 2nd.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
We will not be here live that night.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Unfortunately, that is because myself and DarkSakura,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
even though she's on hiatus for the show,

56:24.000 --> 56:29.000
she does have the weekend off work, so she can attend GamerX4 with me,

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
Loki sadly, not going, you know, family, kids, all that stuff.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
We're going to be at GamerX4.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
VOG Network does have a table once again at the show,

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
so you can come up and say hi to us throughout the show.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I'll be there. DarkSakura will be there.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Some of our other VOG Network hosts will be there.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
Extifer from guys on the show will be there.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
For those of you who used to listen to Hoard House, he's there.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Shane may be there.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
He's on the fence right now, if he can make it work or not.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
So he may be there.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
I know Captain Spike from Game Buoy,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
also First Make Slidekick, also from Game Buoy.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
They will also be there.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
So we're going to have a lot of representation there at GamerX.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
So check us out there at the show.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
Also, we're going to be having a panel called the Indie Gamer Super Show

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
on October 2nd, actually, that Sunday at 2 p.m.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
We're one of the last panels of the event,

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
so I'm a little nervous about the fact it's after checkout time,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
but at the same time, you know,

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
the Sunday at last year's thing was still pretty hopping,

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
so I think we'll get a lot of folks that want to check that out

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
who aren't ready yet to say goodbye to the con.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
So if you're one of those folks, be sure to mark it on your schedule

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
to join us for the Indie Gamer Super Show

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
October 2nd at 2 p.m. at GamerX4.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
VOG Network, of course, will be at the Expo Hall throughout the show,

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
right in the same room with companies like Blizzard, Microsoft.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I don't have the list right in front of me,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
but I know they've got a lot of cool stuff this year,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
so excited to see that.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
All right, let's move on.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Let's get into some gaming news for the week.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Loki, starting us off.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
So one thing that was coming out of Tokyo Game Show

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
was some actual gameplay for Metal Gear Survive.

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
You know, that kind of, well, we're Konami,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
we have to make something for Metal Gear,

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
but I don't know, it looks stupid.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
But someone decided, hey, you know what,

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
let's ask Kojima and see what he thinks about Metal Gear Survive.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And of course, you know, one of the first things he says is,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
ah, that has nothing to do with me.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
It's not my game, it has nothing to do with me.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Sorry.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
So then finally, you know, he asked, you know,

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
they asked him what was he thinking about,

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
you know, how it fits in with the rest of the series.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
He says the Metal Gear games have been about

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
political fiction and espionage.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
Where do zombies fit in with that?

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
He basically said if he had worked on the game,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
it would have had mechs in it.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
So...

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
I just like how he's like, ah, that's not me.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Yeah, it wasn't me.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
That's not mine.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
I didn't make that.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Not something I want to be involved with

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
or associated with when the time comes.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Something that he is working on, of course,

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
is that Death Stranding game,

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
which we still know too much about.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
However, one of the things we do know now

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
is that it is an open world action game.

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
No, not really sure what exactly the details are of it.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Basically saying, you know,

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
that he basically wants to,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I don't know, he's waiting to unveil

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
more information about it, of course.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
But, yeah, basically saying, though,

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
that he is working on the engine still.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
They have selected one and, you know,

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
basically they will accommodate 4K and HDR.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Wouldn't that be funny?

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Which I imagine most engines are going to be nowadays.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
So, yeah, well, hopefully next E3

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
we'll hear some more about the game.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
Going back to the Metal Gear that's not really a Metal Gear

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
or what have you, do you think,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I mean, when you hear that, like,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
okay, it's kind of like they're just basically

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
reusing the assets from Metal Gear.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It is exactly that.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Like, I watched some of the gameplay from it

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
and it's like, yeah, we had all this desert.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
That's why it's in the desert.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It's like, oh, well, it was in the water,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
but it's actually the desert now.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's because they had a bunch of desert assets

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
and then they just kind of mocked something else.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I got to admit, I got to admit, look,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I understand the controversy and everything,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
but I got to admit it's a little clever on Konami's part

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
to get the most bang for their buck

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
because they did spend, to be fair,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
they did spend a lot of money on Metal Gear Solid 5.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I don't know how much of it they made back,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
but regardless, why not make a little more off of it?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Then the thing that looks interesting about it, though,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
is the co-op.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I mean, that would be kind of cool

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
because you're being able to, like,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
kind of take down stuff, you know,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
with friends, so that was kind of neat,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
but, yeah, it's just really, really weird.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I don't know.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Well, we asked some of our users on social media

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
to tell us their thoughts on what's going on

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
with Metal Gear Survive,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and if you're interested in it or not.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And, of course, you can follow us over on Google+,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
where actdef said, I'm not interested in it one bit.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It's just Konami doing what Konami does best right now,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
milking a franchise until it stops giving them money

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's sad.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Over on Facebook, over at, of course,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
William Murderface said, it looks like Left 4 Dead

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
with the Metal Gear skin, so probably not.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
It seems like a cheap knockoff, and without Kojima,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I wonder if they can maintain the direction

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
and allure of the series,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
especially given their shenanigans

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
over the last few years.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I'm surprised they just didn't, like, rebrand it.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Like, just use the engine, use, like,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
kind of the assets that you have,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
and rebrand it as something else,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
you'll come up with some new main characters,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
and that's it.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But I guess, you know, they want to have

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
that Metal Gear brand name attached to it.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It's just, it doesn't really feel like a Metal Gear game.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I mean, it's kind of, I don't know,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
it's like kind of how, what they did with Lords of Shadows,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
where it was supposed to be its own thing,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
and it's like, oh, we'll throw Castlevania on there.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
But it's not really a true Castlevania game.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Dartetsuya pointed out, is it just me,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
or does the new director look almost exactly like Hideo Kojima?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Well, clone him.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
If you won't work for Konami, I'll clone you.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Now, here's two very different sides of the coin,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
but with the same answer.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
You ready?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
So Andy R. said,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I've only played the last few Metal Gear games.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
So far, this one hasn't hooked me,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
partially because I'm tired of zombies,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
partially because fuck Konami,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
partially because it just doesn't look good.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
A very sound, reasonable explanation, right?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Then listen to this side, from Cane I Am.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Is there even enough words in the English language

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
to express my displeasure with Konami?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Answer, no, no, there is not enough words

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
in the English language to properly articulate

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
my extreme displeasure with them.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Suffice to say, if they were on fire

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
and my genitals contained the only source of liquid

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
to extinguish the raging inferno of bullshittery

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
that is Konami, I would relieve myself across the street

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
in full sight of them, then sit and roast marshmallows

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
over their engulfed walls.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Sit and roast marshmallows over their engulfed corpse

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and drink beer until finally I lost interest.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
As have most of the people in this Metal Gear franchise.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Also a sound and reasonable explanation, right?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It's just, it's hard to like, after Konami just was such,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
they were such assholes to fucking Kojima.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It's like, oh hey!

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
We brought back that game you guys like with zombies

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
because I know you guys love zombies.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It's like asking marketing people with someone,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
or not necessarily marketing people,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
like asking executives what people like

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
for games and stuff.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It's like, well what's doing hot right now?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Well, we've got this zombie game that's doing well

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and this other zombie game, well let's put zombies

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
in our game, people will like that.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It just doesn't work that way.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I do want you guys to know a lot of the chatters

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
are kind of laughing at that comment.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
TungentBuster's saying, let the hate flow down

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
let the hate flow through you.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
SSU100matt's saying, they won the internet,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
whoever that was.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I will let you know I did a very rare thing

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I don't usually do from the Orange Lounge Radio account.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I liked that comment over on Facebook

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
and you should too.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Alright, let's talk about, let's talk about,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
this is interesting because-

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Speaking of delays.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Well, it's not so much that, but it's more like the whole,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
so you're milking the franchise over here

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and everybody's like, fuck Konami.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But you're milking the franchise over here

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and everybody's like, yay, yay, yay, give me more.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And that would be Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Can we please explain the fucking numbering

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
of this franchise because I am-

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Well-

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Absolutely sick and tired of these stupid numberings.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Because it's after 2.5, but before three.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So they took 2.75 and rounded up, I think.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I don't know.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Look, it's the continued story

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
beyond what you saw in the 2.5 remix

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
as we move into three.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
So, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
is releasing-

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Nah, Final Chapter, my ass.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Is releasing in Japan on January 12th, 2017

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and there was a whole new trailer

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and some cover art for that as well.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But of course, I know people want to check this game out

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
and I do too.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You know, having it all remastered

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
with the nice coat of paint

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
and available on the PlayStation 4,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
a lot of folks are going to be very excited about that.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So those appear to be the new dates

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
for Kingdom Hearts 2.8.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Now, some other games were announced by Square Enix

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
including a new game in the Saga series.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Saga Scarlet Grace, which I think was actually announced-

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I won't say it was announced previously,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
but it's been announced now

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
that it will come out on December 15th, 2016

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
for PlayStation Vita.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And they announced a new trailer with that as well.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
So folks that are in the Saga series,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I'm sure can appreciate that.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
But since it's on the Vita,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
don't expect it to come here.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Unless they do a remaster for PlayStation 4

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
so it has to do really well for that to happen, I think.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Also announced, you know, with the delay

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
with Final Fantasy XV,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I'm sure there's some sadness there.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
But Hajime Tabata did make an appearance

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
during the PlayStation press conference

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
to talk about a limited edition PlayStation 4 slim model.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It's called the Luna Edition PlayStation 4,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and it's got the big moon on it

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
that you see kind of in some of the screenshots of the game.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And that's it. It's a giant moon,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
which the moon is always, you know,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
makes me think of Final Fantasy IV.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
The moon is usually a theme in a lot of the-

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
It doesn't make you think of Legend of Zelda?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Well, I definitely think of that as well,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
but I'm trying to think of it in the Final Fantasy context.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
But that game will be out-

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
No, it is not a giant butt, Brad from Pod Culture.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It's not that kind of moon.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
It's like, you know, the thing in space.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
So you can get-

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
A giant butt of space.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Yes, it's the giant ass of space.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Look, I gotta say, it's a nice-looking box.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And, you know, if I didn't already have a PlayStation 4,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
and if this was something that could play, you know, US pla-

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Actually, I think PlayStation 4 is region-free, right?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Yes.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
So I guess it could play US PlayStation 4 games,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
but I'm just- I'm not gonna invest the money

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
in yet another PlayStation 4 when I already have one.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I think that's coming over here too.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Is it really? I didn't-

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I wanna say it is, yeah.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Oh, I didn't hear that that was coming over here as well.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I do know it's launching in Japan on November 29th

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
when the game is coming out as well.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
It's gonna set you back 39,980 yen,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
which roughly is where 399 US would be.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
But, you know, obviously exchange rates

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
are a little crazy right now.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So, there you go.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Some stuff from Square Enix out of Tokyo Game Show.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Loki.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
All right.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So, Sony is unfortunately having some layoffs.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
This is with their Sony London studio

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
and also San Diego studios.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
You know, basically they have confirmed the layoffs

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
at Sony San Diego.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Nothing really yet for London,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
but, you know, basically said we can confirm

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
that there has been a reduction

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
in headcount at San Diego studios.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
The teams working on MLB The Show,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Drawn to Death, and Guns Up have not been affected.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
We continually evaluate teams and programs

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
at SIE Worldwide Studios to ensure

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
that we have the proper resources in place

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
to deliver innovative products and blah, blah, blah PR speak.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
So, yeah.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And then on top of that also, I guess,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Sony London that are working on the VR exclusive,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
at least that portion of, was it VR Worlds or whatever,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
the London Heist, they're, you know,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
facing layoffs as well because of the wrapping of production.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So, that's unfortunate.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
But it seems like, you know, just, you know,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
given our history and stuff with these studios,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
it's kind of just, you know,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
the normal workflow of these companies.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
You know, you lay people off at the end of these projects.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Yeah, it's kind of one of those things,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
it's just like the ebb and flow of game development.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
But it's still, you know, it just sucks to see that,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
you know, especially like on Twitter,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I was actually seeing people, you know, say,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
hey, I just got laid off from Sony today.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Anybody have any job openings?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Because, you know, I have friends who are in the industry

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
that will sometimes retweet, you know, things like that.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
And so, you know, I saw that kind of playing out live.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And it's still sad to see, especially when you kind of picture

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
in your mind that Sony is having a lot of success

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
with PlayStation 4 and a lot of those titles.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
It's kind of weird to see that going on.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
But, you know, it is what it is.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So, all right, moving on.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Let's talk about a little change with Blizzard

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
that some of you will like and some of you will hate.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
It has to do with battle tags, you know,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
especially as more and more of you are getting into Overwatch

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
and probably maybe reentering the World of Warcraft and so forth.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
You might think it might be time to change your battle tag.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And, you know, if you didn't already do it,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
you can change your battle tag one time for free.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
But if you want to change it a second time,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
it used to be too fucking bad.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
You're up a creek, no way you can change it a second time.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But now...

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
But then they decided that they want more money.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
That is exactly right.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, we have a winner.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Now you can change it, but it'll cost you money.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
There will be a fee behind that

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
if you want to change your battle net tag.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Ten dollars to change it a second time.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
By the way, though, I should point out,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
this is exactly like Microsoft's system.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Microsoft lets you change it one time for free,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
and then if you want to do it...

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I keep waiting to see if something like Rob Roberts

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
or something else will open up, and they haven't yet.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
So, I don't know.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I guess I'll keep the one I have on Xbox for now.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
But, yeah.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
So, Blizzard, now you can change your gamertag over there as well.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
But no matter what you change it to,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
you're still always going to have those four digits after it.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Like, you know, your gamertag is...

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Mine is Sky, like my Twitter handle, pound,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
and then I don't even know the four digits that come after it.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I don't have them memorized.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I have to have my battle net open so I can share it with you

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
if I choose to or whatever.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
So, I guess that means that allows me to have the name Sky

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and 10,000 other people just under to have that name as well,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
but it's still a little weird when you're trying to give out your handle.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So, anyway.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
By the way, jklol and orangewright,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
both in our chat over at live.bognetwork.com,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
bring up a good point.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Sony, when?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And on PSN, no luck.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
And jklol elaborates, and you know it's total BS.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
If your name is offensive on PSN,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
they will allow you to change it just fine.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
So, you got to make sure you start with an offensive name

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
and then you'll have to change it.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Sony is still kind of missing that capability of being able to change that.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So, even though I keep waiting for this to change on Microsoft

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
where my name frees up,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I'll never be able to change it on PlayStation unless, who knows,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
maybe that will be one of the little things behind the curtain

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
they unveil at the inevitable PlayStation conference this winter

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
like they've been doing for the past two years.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I'm just assuming they're going to do another one this year,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
but we will find out.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So, anyhow, let's move on.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Speaking of PlayStation, Loki?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Yes. So, you know, with PlayStation VR right around the corner,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
you may be wondering, hey, what do I get with PlayStation VR?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Well, one of the things that they're bringing with it is a demo disc.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Yes, a demo disc.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
It's like something that we haven't seen in a long time.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
But they're actually going to be including 18 demos with this.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
The game is included with that.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
We've got Illuminate, Battlezone, Drive Club VR,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
E-Valkyrie, Nog, I guess, or GNOG,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Harmonix Music VR, Headmaster, Here They Lie,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Job Simulator, PlayStation VR Worlds,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Resident Evil 7 Biohazard, The Kitchen Teaser,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Rez Infinite, Riggs Mechanicized Combat League,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Thumper, Tumble VR, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Wayward Sky, and Within.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And I guess in Europe, they get a slightly smaller list of titles,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Drive Club VR, PlayStation VR Worlds, Riggs,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Tumble VR, Battlezone, E-Valkyrie, Wayward Sky, and Headmaster.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
But, yeah, so that's pretty cool.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
That's going to be included.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
At least give you kind of a taste of some of those.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I wish they would have given some free games with it.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Well, you still get that PlayStation, the...

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
The Worlds?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
No, not Worlds.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Worlds is something separate that you get to buy.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But you get that, like, game...

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Not gamer, but it's...

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
What are they called?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
They have the one with, like, all the robots and stuff, Playroom.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
There's, like, VR Playroom or something like that.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
That does come with it.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I don't know.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
My sons like Playroom.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I mean, they like playing with the robot stuff that's on there,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
so I'm down for more of that, I guess.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Still haven't cancelled my pre-order yet, so...

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
But, like, a lot of these games, though,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
like, I don't know after playing the demo if I'm going to buy the full game.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I mean, there's a lot of these that are really short experiences.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I guess I'm going to have to wait until to see what all the buzz is.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And I still haven't made it over to the Best Buy to check out PlayStation VR yet.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
You know, I have a PlayStation VR on pre-order,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and I've been telling you guys this for the past few weeks.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I'm still on the fence.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I'm hovering over the cancel button with that PlayStation VR.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I just don't know.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I feel the money adding up,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
and I'm starting to think about all the other things

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
that that money could buy right now,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
and, you know, going to the chat room,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
there's a comment here that, you know, is a common theme,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I think, with new hardware.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Glorp Bibbledop in chat says...

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Which is the best name, by the way.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
This is a pretty rad name.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I predict PlayStation VR will fade away into nothing like Kinect.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I hope not.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I mean, honestly, because I think that VR so far

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
seems to be a little bit more solid than Kinect,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
whereas Kinect, it was kind of hard to see

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
what they would use the experience for,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
but we have some pretty good experiences with VR,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
most of which are like on the Vive, but, you know...

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Well, that's the thing.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
That's the interesting monkey wrench is that, you know,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
there was really only the one Kinect.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I mean, I know there was PlayStation Move and Wii,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
but those are very different.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
But, you know, we have some other VR things

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
that are kind of battling for...

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
You know they're not all gonna flourish.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Some are gonna fade away.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
But here's what makes me a little bit sad,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
because I know this is gonna happen.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
If they're willing to fucking update the PlayStation 4

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
to have a PlayStation 4 Pro,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
you better believe that within a year...

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I bet within a year to a year and a half time,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
you will have a PlayStation VR Pro.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Hey, that worries me a lot.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
That's a very sad but possible analogy there.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
But here's the thing.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
The point I wanted to make is that, you know,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
for the PlayStation VR to be able to sell,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
it's gonna take what?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It's gonna take games.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Games, games, games.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And PlayStation VR is going to have to have that game

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
that is a must play.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
PlayStation VR needs its Wii Sports.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And I'm not saying it actually has to be a sports game

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
or a mini game collection.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
It just needs to have a good game for it

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
that like people want to play.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And see, here's the thing.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And the reason why I'm still tilting in the yes column

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
is that I go, oh, Res. Res and VR.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Yes, I've played that game a million times before,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
but it's one of my favorite games.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
To be able to play it in VR is going to be so fucking rad.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And it's kind of like if we just had a little more like that,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
like when they announced the Space Channel 5 thing

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
until I realized it was only a demo,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I was like, oh, shit, this might be pretty awesome.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Well, yeah, same concept, right?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
But like, I mean, Res is all right,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
but I've played Res before.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And like I just think like the VR thing will be just kind of like,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
oh, that's cool.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It's going to wear off like the wow factor is going to wear off

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
really fast with it.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Zippo25 in chat says,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
do you guys think Oculus will be available on the new Xbox

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
if PlayStation VR sells well?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I'm going to be honest, you know,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
like I'm not interested in the Oculus anymore.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I'm more interested in the Vive, honestly.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I think the Vive seems like a better,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
the thing with me, the Vive, though,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000
is the setup is like that shit is not going to fly in my house.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I got sensors and stuff and she's like,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
no, it's not going to fucking happen.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I mean, you could, I mean, Bobby brought it to Dragon Con.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
You can build it up and tear it down pretty easily.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But yeah, it is.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
It is.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You know, it's fine.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
But it's just like that seems more interesting.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Maybe when they come out with their controller

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
and stuff for the Oculus, that might be a little bit different.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But honestly, it's just, it seems like more of the cool stuff

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
is happening with the Vive.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And I wonder if that's because you're kind of a gamer

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
and Vive is, it seems like the gamer VR right now, whereas Oculus.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Well, they've got all the room space stuff.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I mean, that makes a big difference versus just like, you know,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
the sit-in chair.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Anything can do the sit-in chair and like look around stuff.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Hell, my Gear VR can do that.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
But like that seems more interesting to me.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It's just that moving around and interacting with this space

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
versus just the Oculus Rift.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I like the Oculus, but it's, I think if I was going to pick two,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
like if I'm building a PC for VR, I'm getting a Vive.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I'm not buying an Oculus.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Bobby Black Wilson or chat over at live.vognetwork.com

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
saying the number one games people want to play in VR

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
are Mario, Zelda established games.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
That's why Rez is a big thing.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It's something familiar that you can play in VR.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
See, I kind of like, I like half agree

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
because I'm like, I totally get why.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And I understand there's, you know,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
somebody ported 8-bit Zelda to Oculus Rift

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
and it's like, that's a horrible idea

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
because that game was not designed for that environment

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
and it doesn't work well.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And so like I kind of understand why I don't really want

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
a Mario, Zelda type port.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I mean, if Nintendo were to suddenly get into VR tomorrow,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
which I don't see them doing, but I'll humor this line of thought,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
you know, maybe they did a Mario Galaxy-esque type game for VR,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
but that's designed with VR in mind.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Nintendo's pretty good at selling a peripheral at this point.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
It's got to be F-Zero though,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
because if you're going to make a VR game,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
it's got to be like, I'm going to puke, let's go too fast.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
If Nintendo made a VR game, they would fucking do it.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
But at the end, I don't think,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I think this is why Nintendo is not going VR.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I'm not sure Nintendo is fully invested on wanting to do that.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
But anyway, I'm digressing.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
The thing with Rez is that I look at a game like Rez

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
and well, yes, it's one of my favorite games,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
but you know, just that whole like,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Rez has always been about an extra sensory experience, right?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
With the trance vibrator, Teehee, and the Xbox controller.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And then when it went on to Kinect and Child of Eden,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
it was always about trying to be like these bigger experiences

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
than maybe just what you could be in with a TV.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And I kind of look at a game like that and I go,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
well, in VR now, that could work.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I'm surprised you don't have force feedback in the PlayStation VR,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
like the headset or like, you know,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
like imagine like having, you know,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
kind of four areas of feedback in your head, you know,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
left, right, back, front or something like that,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
where, you know, that might lend itself to something, you know.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Bobby reminding me of an experience that happened at Dragon Con saying,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
the PlayStation VR, excuse me, sorry,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Sky refused to play the F-Zero Lite game in the Vive.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I offered, I had radial G, I just played it for him.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Yeah, well, at that point, see, and here's the other thing with VR.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I can do VR, but after about 30 minutes or so,

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I'm kind of like, okay, I need a break.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
You know, like I don't know if it's the 3D pull on the eyes

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000
or just the fact that it is so like since you're a bit like,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I can't do VR for a long, long, long time.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Like it starts to just like, okay, I need a break.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And so, you know, I think I had played,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I think that was around the time I was playing the audio shield game

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
or whatever that was called.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Then he mentioned the F-Zero game and I was like,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
you know, I need a break.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So he played it instead because I was actually worried.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I'm like, an F-Zero experience might be too much right now.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
But anyway, don't forget though, and this has been a long tangent,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
but an important one,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Microsoft is also invested in this AR thing with HoloLens.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And, you know, I responded very positively to AR and HoloLens.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
No, and I think AR is going to be fantastic

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
and what they're going to do with it,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
especially when we get into the technology,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
actually is going to be beaming images into your retinas.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
You know, instead of having a screen, basically it's going to,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.000
because they have like some prototype glasses and stuff to kind of do that.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
They beam images, but it's more of like peripheral stuff,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
like, you know, speedometers and that type of thing.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But that's kind of cool like that it uses that.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:11.000
But I also very much understand with AR that it is a whole new canvas

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
that you have to make games on.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And especially this Mario and Zelda thing is not going to work in AR.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And yes, I realize some guy made an emulator that projects the emulator in AR,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
but it's, I mean, what is it?

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
It's the 2D experience just on the HoloLens delivery system.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
It's not really anything, you know, it's going to take a new thing.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
But that fragments thing I played, I was like,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
okay, this is like a 90s Sierra game with today's technology.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And it was rad.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Like, I really, really enjoyed it.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
So here's something that's kind of interesting also

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
that they announced during a Tokyo game show with this Sony VR.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
So with PlayStation VR, you're actually going to be able to untether it

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
from your PlayStation 4 and use it with your mobile phone.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
So they had basically it's called Anywhere VR

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
and allows you to connect your mobile phone to the PlayStation VR

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
to use it like as a virtual world with some different backdrops

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
and you can use your own music in it and stuff.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Now, I'm not sure what exactly its intent is

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
if it's just to use your like mobile device with it.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
But, I mean, they have like some screenshots

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
that show like you can select some backgrounds.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
They've got like, you know, your smartphone screen,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Twitter and some sort of like mini games and stuff that you can play on there.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So that's interesting that it wasn't kind of unaware

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
that they'd be able to do that without, you know,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
being hooked up to the PlayStation 4.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
So I don't know.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
That'd be kind of neat to have something that does mobile in that.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Although, let's be honest, I think it's fucking bulky.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I don't know.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I wouldn't carry it.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I would like wouldn't ride on a train or something with that thing on there.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000
It's a concept that maybe somebody can figure out a really good use for.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
That type of thing.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Now, you know what I'm looking for?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
What is the fucking PC drivers for this shit?

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
That's what I'm saying.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Like if I'm buying a PlayStation VR, I like it.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Let's see some PC drivers for that.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
All right.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Let's talk about another big Sony event and that is No Man's Sky

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
and no secret that some folks have been very critical of No Man's Sky.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
And I'm kind of at this point where it's like, okay, you know,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I liked No Man's Sky, which is funny because even in the beginning

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
during all these previews and things,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I was pretty critical of like show us the fucking game already.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Remember that like two years ago when they showed it?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I'm like, what's the game?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But now that I've played No Man's Sky, I enjoy it for what it is.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.000
And I look at it as a Zen experience kind of like Minecraft.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Of course, the Sentinels kind of screw that up.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
But it's, you know, creepers will do that to you in Minecraft as well.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
It's kind of a very similar thing.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Like I see more of Minecraft in No Man's Sky than anything else for me.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I don't know.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
The Sentinels are really a pain in the ass.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
But I think that's literally the worst part of the game.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
There's a lot of worst parts of it.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Well, here's the thing.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I'm just saying like I enjoy the game for what it is,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
but I also I understand the criticisms.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
And even I'm getting to a point where I'm like their Twitter has been

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
radio silent for like a month.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I don't know if Sean Murray went in a witness protection program

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
or if he's taking, you know, honestly, you've spent years of your life

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
making this game.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
You do deserve a break of some sort.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
But at the same time, you kind of need to support the game.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
You kind of promised me.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I mean, it's a very tricky line to watch.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000
So this weeks upon weeks of complete radio silence

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
is getting a little irritating.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And I say that as somebody who's really tried to support No Man's Sky.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I'm kind of at a point where I'm like they are like the longer they go

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
with not saying anything in response to some of these criticisms

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
and the future development of the game and what they want to do with patches,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
like the harder it is for me to cheer them on, if that makes sense.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Right.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Well, now, even this week, the noteworthy thing that happened,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Sony Studios president Yoshida, Suhei Yoshida said he understands

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
some of the complaints from players who don't feel like they're getting

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
what was promised to them, saying, quote,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I understand some of the criticisms especially Sean Murray is getting

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
because he sounded like he was promising more features in the game from day one.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000
It wasn't a great PR strategy because he didn't have a PR person helping him.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And in the end, he is an indie developer.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
So he goes on to talk about, you know, it's a great indie accomplishment,

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
but he's probably overwhelmed with the work going on in the game.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Yoshida does reiterate, though, I am super happy with the game, actually,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
and I'm amazed with the sales the game has gotten.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
But it's very interesting that even Yoshida was willing to be a little bit critical,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
and I don't think it comes from a place of, you know, trying to hurt the guy or whatever,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
but he's definitely willing to point out, like, yeah, dude kind of overpromised,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and it's because he didn't have a PR filter.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Very interesting, though, because on the flip side of things,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
why did I get sick of going to E3?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Because I don't hear anything but PR speak at these types of shows,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and that's why I like to interview indie developers more often,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
because they will tell me stuff that's going on,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
and they will talk a little more about game development and go off script and stuff.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
But at the same time, I think we can have that conversation,

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
but not necessarily overpromise, and that may have been where Sean Murray made mistakes.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I don't think it's necessarily he made mistakes.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I think it's more of there is pressure on him to release the game at a certain period of time,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
and he just couldn't get all the features done in a time.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And I think the longer it got delayed, the more pressure he got from Sony to release that title,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
and I think that's kind of what led to all this, if I were to guess.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000
But I don't know. I mean, I don't see him as bad as, like, Peter Molyneux,

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
you know, where it's like, Peter Molyneux blows, you know.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Yeah, whatever happened to the Milo game. Whatever happened to that? Anyway.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
SSU 100 Matt says, I particularly, I partially blame Sony for this.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
They really hype the hell out of this game like it's a triple-A title at E3,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
when in reality, it's just an indie game.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
So, SSU 100 Matt's saying, you know, maybe Yoshida should take some of his blame as well.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Interesting. JK LOL wants to point out, you can get beta updates.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000
As radio silent as they seem, there's a channel to follow active development.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
So, that's something to keep in mind.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And then Bobby Blackwolf says, you know what's a PR blunder? Time to car.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I was so hyped for that game, only to be utterly disappointed.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Hey, you and me both. Seriously, that's why I didn't release anything,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
because it was utterly disappointing.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
It was like, you know, hey, I could have released the game as is.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I still can. But it's not that fun.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And I don't want to release a fun game. Plus, I know I'm a PR person.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
But fuck them.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I'd be your PR person.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Ah, fuck that. I don't need a PR person.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Like, I'm willing to tell you that the game's not good.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I'm like, sorry, I just didn't release it, because it's not ready yet.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:00.000
It's not what I wanted to, you know, what I wanted to do with it.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
It's not even close to being like that.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
So, hopefully with this next one, it'll be a lot better,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
because I'm more hopeful with it and more inspired on this one.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
You're not going to tell us a goddamn thing and tell us right away.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
You are going to try to Beyonce us with this, aren't you?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I'm not trying to Beyonce you. I just have to have something to show you.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I can't talk about it until I have something to show you.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000
All right, well, speaking of PR nightmares, what do we have next, Loki?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
So, I've been following this, because I'm a pretty big fan of Jim Sterling,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
you know, the Jimquisition stuff.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And he does, you know, the kind of go way back.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
He does a series called, you know, Best of Steam Greenlight Trailers

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
and stuff like that, and he'll basically take these really terrible games

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
that are on Steam that have these really terrible greenlight trailers

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
and kind of just, you know, make fun of them, I guess, or criticize them.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
And so, one of the games, and this actually may have been, like,

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
one of his little, like, kind of Let's Plays that he did,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
was a game called The Slaughtering Grounds,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.000
which is a game from a company that's called Digital Homicide.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And so, they didn't like that he, you know, poo-pooed on the game,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
and so they, you know, did a review of the reviewer type thing,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
and then he did a review of the reviewer type thing.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It was ridiculous. And so, but they put out tons of games.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
They put out, like, god, over 60 games in, like, two years.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I mean, it's just shovelware, basically asset flipping stuff,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
which is not bad. I mean, you can buy assets off the Unity store.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
They're all Unity games, so you can buy assets off the Unity store

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and then, you know, use those assets to make games.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
But these were just, like, they're literally just buying the assets

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
and, like, just kind of doing nothing with it.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
It's just bare minimum work to get stuff out.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
So, they later on went to sue him, you know, for 15 million dollars

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
because they didn't like how he was, you know, they said that they were,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
you know, he was causing libel or some other damages and stuff.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And it's just, it's a big cringey thing that they,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
and he didn't air view with them. It's just, it's ridiculous.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
So, they've taken it a step further because he hasn't talked about them

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000
for a long time. Now, they've decided that, hey, guess what?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
You know, basically Steam users are still making fun of these games.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
They're not, they're criticizing the games.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
We're going to sue the Steam users.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.000
So, they're suing 100 Steam users for a total of 18 million dollars

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
for personal injury is what they claim.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And so, on top of that, not only are they suing them,

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:41.000
but they're actually, you know, they are seeking, basically,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I think they got a subpoena from, yeah, Arizona.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
They got a subpoena to find out, you know, who these 100 users are.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
And with that, you know, they're now going after Valve as well.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And they're trying to actually get somebody to help represent them

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
because right now they're representing themselves, which is fun.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Okay, wait, wait, wait. They're going to subpoena 100 users who left reviews.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Like, don't they have to agree to terms and conditions

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
when they list their game on the store?

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Well, it's not even really reviews.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It's just like, you know, they're saying, you know, usual internet shit.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Like, oh, you know, these guys are, you know, these devs are crap.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
You know, they're going to probably end up turning out being like,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
you know, serial killers versus, you know, game devs.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And it's in its response to, like, you know, some of the interviews

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
and stuff that they had.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And, you know, just, just the usual internet shitery.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Steam does need to do something about that, and I understand they are.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000
But, you know, suing for all that money?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Yeah, basically saying, you know, that, oh, it's because of these,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
it's because of these reviews and these people's comments

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
that we're not selling our games.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Not because the quality of our games are shit.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
It's because of these comments.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So on the last straw that they have, you know, when they, with Steam,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
you know, they were basically saying, we need this information.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Seems like, fuck you, bye-bye.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And they, so they pulled their games off the store

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
because they're not going to have them abuse their system.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Did you hear the quote?

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Because Dungeon Buster posted the quote here in chat.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I like what Lombardi said, short and simple.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Valve has stopped doing business with digital homicide

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
for being hostile to Steam customers.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Pretty much.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
So, yeah, they're continuing for the lawsuit.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I don't know if really anything's going to come of it

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
because I don't think they actually have a lawyer yet.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
They don't have the legal fees.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
In fact, they try to do like a Kickstarter thing on their own website

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
to, you know, raise legal fees.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Do you know what this, I'm sorry, but do you know what this reminds me of,

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
like, to a T?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
You know what this reminds me of, like, to a T?

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
It's a completely different industry, but exact same thing going on.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Okay, you're a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, right?

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Hell's Kitchen and all that stuff.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
This is Amy's Baking Company all over again.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Do you guys remember?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And by the way, what do both those things have in common?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Amy's Baking Company and digital homicide.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Arizona. That's the common thread, y'all.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Arizona. No offense to our listeners in Arizona,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
but I'm thinking most of you are probably nodding your head in agreement right now.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
So, if y'all didn't see that episode, what was that show called?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Kitchen Nightmares?

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Yeah, Kitchen Nightmares.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Okay, where these folks at Amy's Baking Company just flew off the handle, right?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
And then, you know, it was just, it was a mess.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Gordon Ramsay walked off the shelf, but then it was the fallout

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
where people started leaving these reviews on Yelp,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
and what happened?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
They threatened to sue the people on Yelp.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
If you've got, like, a good 45 minutes to waste,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
you really want to listen through a really cringe-worthy audio recording,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
go to TheJimquisition.com and actually check out the special podcast

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Jim Sterling and Digital Homicide Hash It Out.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Go look that up.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
It's just, once you listen to that and you're like,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
oh, that's why they're acting like this, because they're just not all there.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I mean, it's just, who does this? But whatever.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And you're sinking themselves.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
And again, the same thing with Amy's Baking Company.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Countless interviews done with those people,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
and you're kind of sitting there going,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
these guys really need a second person to filter a lot of this through.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Like, they should not be doing interviews directly.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
It's like the same type of thing.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I'm sorry, I couldn't help but think of that.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
It's the Amy's Baking Company of the gaming world.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And I have to wonder if they're actually going to be taken off Steam,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
because even though the games are, you can still redeem keys

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
and play the games if you really wanted to,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
which I don't know why you would.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
But they've had several games come out that were under other pseudonyms

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
for their company names,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
so I'm wondering if they're just going to release them under those instead.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I don't know.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
But yeah, that's the fun Digital Homicide thing that's going on.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Hopefully none of our listeners are one of those 100 Steam users,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000
although, to be honest, I don't know how much a threat you would actually be,

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
what kind of trouble you'd be in.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Hey, if anyone actually does get sued, I would totally recommend hitting up,

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
was it Ryan Morrison, the video game attorney on Reddit,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
because he'd be someone that I can imagine defending these people.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I wonder if he's had a take on this at all.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I'd be very pleased to hear.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I thought about the other day looking up to see what his comment would be on that.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I follow him on Twitter.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I haven't seen anything yet, though.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I don't know if he would comment yet.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
All right.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Well, something I think a little less controversial

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
is we start to get into the Classic Game of the Week

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
because we are going to get into the Classic Game of the Week here shortly,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
but of course Dark Sakura is on a bit of a hiatus from the show

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
due to some conflicts with her day job.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
She'll be out for a couple months.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
But if she was here, I know she'd be really excited about this

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
coming from Tokyo Game Show,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
and that is Digimon World Next Order.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
It is coming out in the West.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
That's right.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
We are getting Digimon World Next Order here in the West

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
on the PlayStation 4, apparently not the Vita in the West,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
although that's something that's going to be happening in Japan,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
although that doesn't really surprise me whatsoever.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.000
So anyway, yes, it will be released in North America and Europe in 2017.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
The game has over 200 Digimon,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
and you can have two of them at your side while you're out in the digital world

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000
on a quest to stop the machine-dramones and get home.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Apparently this is on the calendar for release in early next year,

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
not something you have to wait for for holiday.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Again, that coming out of Tokyo Game Show.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
You know, I can't help but wonder,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
even though I know some people are going to cringe at this comparison,

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
but you can't help but wonder,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
does the success of Pokemon Go play into this at all?

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Yes, I realize Digimon and Pokemon are completely different,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
but you know some business person's got to be sitting there going,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
yeah, I smell money.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I smell the money.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I smell money, and it's with monsters in your pocket.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
So, oh, oh, what, we have a game about monsters?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Oh, yes, put it out.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Oh, yes, they love the Pokemon in the States.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
They'll love this too.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So I can't help but wonder how much of that played into that,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
but regardless, I know fans of Digimon probably don't want to hear that,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.000
but I just feel like that probably is something that was considered

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
before this announcement was made.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
So, yeah, there you go.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Digimon World will be released early next year,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000
but we are going to take an opportunity now to take a step back in history,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
long before there were MMOs,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
and long before there was even a PlayStation Vita.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
We're going to take a step into the gaming vault with a segment we call

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
the Classic Game of the Week.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And thanks to the magic of radio,

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Dark Soccer is here.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Hi.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Fresh from having dove into the vault to find a classic game

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
for all of you this week,

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
because every week Dark Soccer picks a classic game,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
ten years or older, that she says, hey, listen you little brats,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000
stop playing your newfangled war crafts and your Pokemans and play this.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
This game could have been their grandparent.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It's probably old enough to be somebody's grandparent.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Yeah.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
What is the Classic Game of the Week, Dark Soccer?

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Turbo.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Turbo is a-

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Wait, I thought that was a system.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
No.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Rab.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
It is a game.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
It is a game.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
It is a game by Sega.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
It came out in 1981 in the arcades.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Oh, my gosh.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Yeah, I was, um, five.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Yeah, I was young.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So anyway, Turbo, um, came out in 1981 by Sega.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
And by the way, that's what the game sounds like.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And now I'm going to mute it because it's very monotonous and kind of a little bit annoying.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Yeah.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000
The soundtrack was not the game's strong point.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Soundtrack?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Exactly.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Soundtrack.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Anyway, it had three formats.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000
There was a standard upright and there was a cabaret mini style

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
and then an environmental cockpit style.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
So a seated one.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Cockpit.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Cock.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
The cock goes in the pit.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
What kind of game is this, Dark Soccer?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
It's a special game.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
You go turbo.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
For special people.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
You go turbo style on it.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
You play with the stick.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
You twist it and see what happens.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Anyway, um, so with this particular game, um, you had a steering wheel and you had a gear shift for low and high and an accelerator pedal.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And, um, it had 20 inch raster display, which I mean, what else do they have back then?

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
20 inches is pretty impressive for 1981.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Anyway, um, it had an onscreen display and an LED panel that had your player's score and your high score table.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:48.000
And it also had lighted oil and temperature gauges on either side of the steering wheel.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
So for its day, it was pretty advanced.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
That's kind of cool. I remember that in Spy Hunter too.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
It had the actual lights that would show up on the machine.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
That is pretty cool.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
At least that one had a soundtrack.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Yes.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Um, at any rate, turbo was ported to both the Intellivision and the Cliquovision.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I had the Cliquovision version as a kid.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:17.000
It was the best thing ever because, and this is where I'm going to take a bit of a deviation.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
With the Cliquovision.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Are you being a deviant here on OLR?

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Always.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000
With the Cliquovision, you would unplug one of the controllers and plug in the steering wheel controller.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
And the steering wheel, it had this thing that you could take out that was an accelerator pedal.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And you'd put, we used to put it on the TV tray, you know, the old school aluminum TV trays.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
You'd have the small little wheel on top.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:47.000
And then the place that you took the pedal out to put it on the floor, you would actually put your controller there.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
And the controller had all those numbers on it to choose your difficulty.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.000
But then it became your gear shift when you were driving.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
And it was the coolest thing.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
My mom would just play the shit out of this game.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
And my mom was like, I don't like video.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Bull. Bullshit, mama.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
You played that game more than me.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Anyway.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Turbo requires you to go down a road, a different kind of race in urban and rural locations with different weather conditions and during different times of the day.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
The cars are meant to resemble Formula 1 race cars.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And you have to pass and stay ahead of at least 30 competing cars before the time expires.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And then some of the opponents are easy. Some of them swerve around.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
So you do have a difficulty curve on it.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000
In the first round, you have unlimited lives.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Collisions will return your car back to the starting line.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000
In later rounds, though, you have three lives, but you can get an additional life up to four.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And then you sometimes have to avoid an ambulance.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:01.000
It can overtake you and run into you.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Yes. Death by ambulance.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Wait, so the ambulance will try to run you off the road?

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Yeah.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Running into one will make you lose a life.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Well, yeah, running into cars generally is not a good idea for your health.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Specifically the ambulance. If you tap it, you'll die.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I see. It's representative of the lawsuit that's coming.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Right?

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Yeah.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
The game was designed and coded by a guy named Steve Hanawa.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000
And he said, and I'm just going to go ahead and quote a little bit here,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:41.000
that despite its historical significance as a precedent-setting racing video game,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.000
he considers that the process of creating it to have been his worst development experience at Sega.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Oh, my.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:55.000
He said that it required such a difficult and protracted schedule of coding and debugging that he was hospitalized for a month.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Yikes.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
For a stress exhaustion and a spontaneously collapsed lung.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Oh, my God.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
So it wasn't just Atari that was working there.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I think the difference is that Atari was drugging up a lot of their people or they were on drugs.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Allegedly.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Allegedly.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
They were on the drugs.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Look out for your children.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And just go watch some of the old documentaries.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I'm not, like, being a jerk.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Like, you hear some of the old documentaries and you hear some of the developers talking about some of the crazy stuff that went down at Atari.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Not to make this about Atari, but maybe Sega needed a little bit of, you know, at least some liquor or something.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Well, this game actually had a little, actually quite a bit of bad luck around it, around its development.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I'll get into that in a moment.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Is it like the Poltergeist of video games?

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Maybe.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I'll get into that in a minute.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:56.000
But the thing about this game that really made that precedent is that it set the stage for pretty much all racing games down the line.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:04.000
It was the first full color raster display racing game that had the third person perspective rear view racer.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:17.000
It also had scaling sprites for competing AI drivers, trees, cityscape elements, and the first third person racing game to feature multiple landscapes.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000
So it was also one of the first ones to also have hills in it.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:28.000
So this game really set, you know, a new level for racing games.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
The hills are alive.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
With the sounds of motors.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
With the sounds of ambulances killing you.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:47.000
The hills are alive with the sound of music.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
There's the ambulance.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Oh yeah, there he is.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
The wha-ambulance.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
It does kind of make a hideous noise as it goes by, doesn't it?

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Everything about that game makes a hideous noise, including me screaming when I run into trees.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Anyway, so here's where some of the worst of the drama gets in.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
There was an Atari 2600 port planned by Coleco.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:20.000
And it was even advertised by Coleco, but it was never completed because the lead programmer, Michael Green, had been struck and injured by a drunk driver when he was riding a bicycle.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Yikes.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:34.000
And so the prototype was about 80% complete, and it was found by another Coleco programmer named Anthony Henderson in his attic in 2006.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Oh wow.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
There was also a turbo board game that came out in 1983 by Milton Bradley.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Huh.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.000
So, yeah, the game got great reviews.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:58.000
It was reviewed by Computer and Video Games magazine in the July 1982 issue, and they really found it to be very realistic for its time, you know, and thought it was amazing.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:07.000
It pretty much had been, like, the king of racing games for a while.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:32.000
And then the ColecoVision version was reviewed in 1983, and it scored a 10 out of 10 by Arcade Express, and said that while it wasn't as graphically arresting as the arcade version, it comes reasonably close to matching the multi-scenario brilliance, and the special control panel lifts this cartridge to greatness.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
So there you go.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Turbo also was the inspiration for Turbo Time in Wreck-It Ralph.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000
So there you go.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:55.000
All right. So when did Pole Position come out comparatively? Because when I look at this, I go, oh, it's kind of like Pole Position, but Pole Position had to have been a few years later. Pole Position had to have been, like, 83 or 84, right?

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Yeah, I think so. Give me a second.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:10.000
A little later, because remember Pole Position had the audio, and it just was a little more advanced, but you definitely see a lot of, I think, what you see in Pole Position, kind of like you see early forms of that in Turbo.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Pole Position came out in Japan July 1982.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Oh, yeah, it was only a year later. Wow, okay.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Yeah.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000
But still, I mean, still very neat.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Pole Position, I mean, while, yes, it is, of course, graphically superior, I don't think it would have existed if not for Turbo.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:38.000
No, no, and definitely I think you see a lot of, like, the early forms. I guess what I'm saying is that, like, Turbo kind of looks like an early form of Pole Position in some ways, so.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
But it was Sega.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Sega.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Sega.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Turbo.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Beep, beep, beep.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:49:00.000
You know, speaking of classic games of the week, I feel like, you know, last week on the show, we just did an anniversary.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
We had the Dreamcast, right, had a birthday.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Well, this week, the GameCube is turning 15, believe it or not.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:20.000
The Nintendo GameCube turning 15 years old this week, and I think we're going to probably have a lot of these birthdays in the coming weeks, because we're starting to get into that holiday period, you know, when things, you know, start, you know, systems and stuff come out.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Before the holiday period, so we're going to be seeing a lot of anniversaries.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000
But yeah, the GameCube, 15 years old this week.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Memories of the GameCube? You owned one, right?

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Yeah, I still do somewhere. My sister has it in storage or something. I don't know what she did with it.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I don't know, I'd say Animal Crossing was definitely, you know, a fond memory.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Zelda Wind Waker.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Enter the Matrix.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
A little game called F-Zero GX.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
F-Zero GX, absolutely.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:12.000
So, I will never forget, though. You actually bought me a GameCube and Animal Crossing. Isn't that ironic that all those years ago, you got me into that Nintendo system, although I knew I really wanted one. It was just, you know, at the time, I didn't have a job where I could just buy things that I want.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:21.000
So that was a really awesome gift that you got from me at the time. But yeah, I would say in some ways, Animal Crossing changed my life, especially the old one.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Yeah, the old one was great with the NES games and stuff in there.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I mean, well, no, it wouldn't be very good on mobile, but I was just thinking, can you imagine the Animal Crossing game?

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Well, you're going to find out next year because that's one of the Nintendo IPs. It's going mobile, so there you go.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:49.000
So you have that to look forward to. No, actually funny, you guys all know Shane, who's on this show quite frequently and hosts his own shows that are on the VOG Network.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:51:00.000
But I met him through an Animal Crossing LiveJournal community. Yes, I did. That's a true story. And so, all these years later, here we are. So it's just kind of funny how that works out.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:10.000
But that used to be where you could like, you know, you would put in the codes to like, I think, I think the LiveJournal community was about you could actually like send gifts to people with the codes in the game.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And, you know, there was, I remember there was a thing where like, if you were Link from Hyrule, somebody had the code for like every single thing for your village.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:26.000
And so a lot of people like work the system like that. But if you wanted something like custom for you, somebody had to generate the code in their town.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And at the time, that was a pretty, you know, considering that the GameCube kind of danced around the online thing.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:39.000
There was Phantasy Star Online and nothing else that ever went online to that system. The code thing worked out like really, really well.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:47.000
So that was, they did a lot of like innovative stuff, like especially with like hooking up like the Game Boy Advance, you know, to play NES games or the Wii U islands.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:55.000
It's like that. That was pretty cool. That's innovation. Wii U wasn't innovation. It's just kind of like, oh, it's the second screen.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:01.000
It's like, well, very kind of done. The game, you know, the Game Boy Advance, the DS.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Which wasn't really supported very well, unfortunately. I mean, there was that Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game that was pretty badass that used that, right?

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:16.000
And there was the Zelda Four Swords. Of course, everybody knows that one. But I feel like there really weren't a lot of games that used that whole setup for as awesome as it was at the time.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Too bad. I mean, if only cell phones had controllers on them, we could have a lot of cool shit.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:30.000
All right. Let's do some rapid fire news. Quickly cover some of the other things going on in the industry this week.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:38.000
So speaking of mobile, RPG Maker is going mobile. So I know that kind of checking in, for some reason, like I got this idea.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I was like, hey, it might be fun to make something in an RPG Maker. You know, I was like, I think I bought some of those a while back.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Let me go check my Humble, you know, license page or whatever. And so I saw that they had a new RPG Maker MV, which was like $80.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I was like, fuck that. I am not buying that for $80. But they're going to be launching it as RPG Creator for iOS, which is going to be launching September 25th.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:12.000
And then also, you know, it looks a little bit more basic than the other stuff, but at least you can do that. It's only going to cost $9.99.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:21.000
And so that's kind of neat. And then you'll be able to upload your games to a creator's portal where others can try them out as well.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I know that the RPG Maker MV, I think you can output the mobile on that. So that's kind of cool. If you really want to make like an RPG or something, then that might not be a bad route to do it.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Although, just wait for another Humble bundle because they had one a while back, you know, where it was really marked down. Or hell, if you really want to get the coding stuff, got 48 more hours for that Game Maker bundle, which is honestly, just pick that up.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
That is worth it for 15 bucks.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Yeah.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:58.000
And with that RPG Maker, you know, even though you kind of roused the $80 price, like you can actually release full games from that, right? That's where I like To The Moon came from.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Yeah, you can release full games with that. I just think, I don't know. I mean, it's all right for what it is. I think it's just a little bit limited.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Although, to be honest, so the MV though is a lot more open. Like I think they support like JavaScript in there or Java.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:20.000
So there is actual programming language support with it. So it's a lot more full featured versus like some of the earlier RPG Makers, which is a little bit more basic and what you could do with them.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Plus, they also have, you know, built into that was the, because they had kind of like a Dragon Quest style battle system, whereas basically, you know, you would see it head on versus sideways like Final Fantasy.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000
But they added that sideways battle system in Final Fantasy or from Final Fantasy in this latest version as well.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:46.000
So maybe worth it for some people. I'm not going to drop $80 for it for something that I'm not sure I'm going to use, but I'll wait for it to go on sale maybe.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Fair enough.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Yeah. And then this is kind of interesting, but I just, I saw this and like, oh man, you know, like, because we didn't really get Dead or Alive over here, but our Dead or Alive Extreme.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:12.000
But guess what? It is coming to Steam. So you know what that means? There will be nude mods for this shit like day one.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:24.000
I mean, you want nude bonds in this, that's how you get nude bonds. But Dead or Alive Extreme Venus Vacation will be coming out on PC. I guess it's via a website.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Oh, maybe not Steam. I'm sorry. I misread that. So it's actually maybe not mods since it's based off a website, but you never know. People can get creative.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:44.000
So that's coming to PC. What is coming to Steam though is Galgun. So that'll be coming to Steam soon as well. I may have to check that out. I actually like the first Galgun game, so we'll have to see about that.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
That's coming to Steam September 27th.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:58.000
All right. Lots of stuff getting ported to PC, huh? I doubt this will come to PC, but some of you will probably be interested in this on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in Japan anyway.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:08.000
In 2017, a new Fortune Street game is coming out. What's pretty neat about this, it is Fortune Street Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary Edition.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:15.000
So it's a new Fortune Street game that actually incorporates those two franchises as well, and a new little trailer was shown for that.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000
So Fortune Street's kind of like, if I remember right, it's kind of like a board game-ish type of hybrid game. So it's pretty cool that it's gonna...

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
They did that with Mario as well. There's a Fortune Street game.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Yeah, so I don't know if they... Do they release those over here? I don't think they...

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Yeah, it got released over here.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Did they?

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
It was on the Wii U, I think.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Well then maybe this one will come out.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Maybe it was on 3DS. It was either Wii U or 3DS.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Dartatouille. Yeah, that's right. Dartatouille said they had the one on the Wii with Mario. That's right. I do remember that.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:46.000
It was just like the Fortune Street game. So yeah, I think they get more of them in Japan, but they do release them over here once in a while.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
So maybe that one will come out.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Also, if you are still playing Animal Crossing or gonna go back to Animal Crossing, because Animal Crossing New Leaf is getting an update this fall,

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:03.000
but I think a lot of you, like me, are probably scared to go back to Animal Crossing because your town is overrun with weeds,

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000
and you're gonna have to spend hours and hours picking goddamn weeds on every single screen in your town.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Well, good news is there was a tweet that came out from Isabelle. Isn't that adorable?

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Animal Crossing UK account. Isabelle actually tweeted and said,

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:25.000
been away from your town for a while. When the free update arrives this autumn, I'll take care of all the weeds.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
So Isabelle's gonna clean your town for you.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000
And actdeftinchat says, bitches don't know about the clean town initiative.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Yeah, I guess there's actually, you know, you can set like perks and stuff at the mayor's office from what I remember about the game.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I think I always took the extended hours so that things would actually be open at night.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Or I think you can actually like flip the clock, like within the game or something like that. There was a way you could do that.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.000
But anyway, if you were to choose the clean town initiative, you would not have weeds either.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
But it sounds like initiative or no. Isabelle's getting out the weed whacker,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.000
and she's gonna take care of the town for you when you come back to check out the amiibo update.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
She probably couldn't just like, you know, have you like push a lawnmower. That'd be kind of cool.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
That would be funny. Like a rideable lawnmower going to town.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.000
That'd be cool. Except for all the murdering that would happen when you run over the townsfolk, you know, with the lawnmower.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
But some people might want that.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I can't imagine that. Like you dig a trap hole, they're stuck there head high. It's like I'm running over the lawnmower.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
That was in the first episode of Scream Queens, wasn't it?

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
I don't remember.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Rest in peace, Def Taylor Swift.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Somebody else saw that show, right? Somebody else out there had to see that show.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
My dad watched that show.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Why?

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Well then your dad would get the joke.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Because he likes visual effects artwork or makeup and stuff.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
That makes sense what he said.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Alright, let's check out what is in stores this week. Starting off in the US, Logie.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:53.000
So of course we still have lots of stuff coming out. So this week we've got Shin Megami Tensei 4 Apocalypse on 3DS.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Also Firewatch is finally making its way out to Xbox One.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Pankupu on PC.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.000

A House with Many Doors on PC.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
And finally The Bunker on Xbox One.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
That was a busy week.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Yeah, a little bit later.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I'm more excited about the week after that where ClusterTruck comes out.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Oh yay.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
That looks awesome.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Alright, well in Japan there's some games to look forward to this week as well.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000
On September 21st, Destiny Complete Edition is released in Japan.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I'm assuming that is the all-in-one bundle to bring us up to the current expansion.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
That is out in Japan this week.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:41.000
And Utaware Rumono Futari no Hakudo comes out in regular and a premium edition this week in Japan.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And that is all of course on the PlayStation 4.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.000
But the PlayStation Vita gets releases as well and that same Utaware Rumono game comes out on the Vita as well.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:59.000
But the Vita is also getting a game in regular and limited editions called Magic Cuyune Renaissance comes out on the Vita this week.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
On the 3DS this week, nothing.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
No, I take that back. There is a game.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000
One Piece Dai Kaizuko Coliseum is out this week.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Looks like it's from Bandai Namco and it looks like kind of a fighting game that looks like a bit of a royal rumble of sorts.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
That is available this week.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000
That is actually, I'm sorry, that is a 3DS game, not a Wii U game.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
How did I get that mixed up? Shame on me.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.000
So that is the only release on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:38.000
I was looking to see if there was a Wii U game but it doesn't look like there's anything on the Wii U until Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens in October.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
So that is on the 3DS this week.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
So that is it for Japanese releases.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000
How about the UK, Loki?

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Not so much in the UK.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000
We've got coming out this week NBA 2K17 as well.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
And then COS-X3 on PC and Firewatch on Xbox One.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to participate with the show.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
You can send us your email.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
You should send us some emails.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I know Dark Soccer is not here to read them but I will read them for you and we'll still respond to them here on air.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
So send us your emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
We do have one email this week so just one to read.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
But it's from JT who emails us the following.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Quick question about the new NES Classic Mini System.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:39.000
I've dabbled in emulation over the years and despite having some pretty beefy hardware and numerous plug-in and wireless controllers,

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I still experience noticeable, albeit generally minimal, lag.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:50.000
While this is only a real issue with technical platformers and seems to be very dependent on emulator, ROM, monitors, etc.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I've yet to get anything to feel as tight as an original system and CRT setup.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Now Nintendo has some pretty strict quality control concerns with their products and IP.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
So I was curious about how this box will work.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Is it an emulator? Is there any way it can account for the varying display lag from modern HD displays?

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Have mini box systems like this from the past played well on modern displays?

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Thoughts? Much love to you and the show, JT.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Well JT, it's tough to know because the box isn't out.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000
We've seen some glimpses of it at like trade shows and things.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000
But even when they showed it at trade shows, I think they just showed the physical body of it.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
They haven't really shown what it looks like.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Like we don't know what the menu system looks like or any of that stuff.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Like how you pick from the 30 games. We don't know any of that.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Now here's the thing is that you mentioned in your email about Nintendo having strict quality control.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000
And that is true and is probably why virtual console releases are so slow.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:52.000
But I do want to point out, virtual console games have gotten by Nintendo's quality thing.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000
And some people have their complaints about the way things look on Wii or Wii U.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Especially like the colors being washed out sometimes.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.000
So that could still apply.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000
We don't know if this is a new system that's being made.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:14.000
We don't know if they just took like a Wii U and just only have the part that does virtual console.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Like it could be just a virtual console device for all we know.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I kind of, I don't know. We don't know.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000
And so until we have some of those answers, I'm not sure we can fully answer the question.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:30.000
But I will point out, you know, how have other consoles, you know, retro things done this.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I think about Atari Flashback.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
And I remember that like the Atari Flashback, I think it was the 2.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Like was a full on Atari 2600.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
And like you could play other cartridges on it.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000
But it had all these things that were like preloaded on it.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:51.000
But it was set up to work with, I think it was the white, yellow, red plugs.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I don't remember if that ran on HDMI or not.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
No, probably not for that.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
The Flashback 2 might have been a little too old to get into that.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
But that one worked out pretty well.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.000
So, yeah.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:13.000
My speculation tells me that you are kind of on the right track with the quality control thing.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.000
And the fact that they know that most people own HDTVs and all this stuff.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:22.000
So they know that it has to meet a certain standard on these HDTVs.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000
We also know, and they've talked about, there's going to be some types of filters.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:33.000
So it does seem like there is going to be some type of menu in there to change graphical type filtering.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Like you see in emulators.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000
So I'm thinking because of that, inherently you're going to have something to adjust lag.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:48.000
And if they know that there's the different types of HD sets, that tells me that I have a pretty good feeling there will be something in there to adjust lag.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:55.000
But we just don't know for sure until we see this at some type of show or out in the wild or what have you.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:02.000
But it's through HDMI, so it's going to be made with the HD sets in mind.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000
But will it support 4K TVs and all that stuff? I'm sure it'll work.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
With HDMI.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Yeah, I guess through HDMI it will, but it's not going to look any better or anything.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
You know, that type of thing.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Anyway, I want to say they have, I forget who was working on the actual software with it.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:25.000
They named, like, it was somebody that does the virtual console ports or something like that, that was working on it.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
So, I don't know.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.000
And they kind of talked, I'm trying to find the article right now.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:35.000
They talked about, like, what, let's see here.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
So, who was working on this here?

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
They have like, yeah, different modes.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
There will be a 4 by 3 aspect ratio option if you want to do that.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
They have different filters. You can also do a pixel perfect option.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I'm trying to see who they had working on it, because they did name who it was, I thought.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I don't know.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000
But yeah, I mean, I would be pretty confident that it's going to end up being good when it comes out.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Yeah, I'm sure it'll be a good box that's worth your money.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I mean, I don't know, because I have all this stuff on virtual consoles, so I don't know if I necessarily need to drop the extra money.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:19.000
And we're also talking Nintendo hardware, so I kind of feel like it's going to be really hard to get one the first day anyway.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Nobody's taking preorders on this yet, right?

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
I think I heard that somewhere. Nobody's really taking preorders.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Like, not Amazon, not GameStop.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
You know, and this thing's supposed to be out, what, November 11th?

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
So, I think everybody's kind of waiting to hear how many they're going to get.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:37.000
So, I would encourage you, because this is Nintendo hardware, try to get reserves early.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Actually, Amazon's taking preorders, I think.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Oh, no, it's unavailable.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Yeah, I was like, I just looked today, and I'm pretty sure I didn't see it on there, so.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Target and Best Buy, they've listed here. Let me see if those are on there as well.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
You can't, no.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Yeah, I think everybody's waiting to see how many they get, so we'll see.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000
You know, somebody in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, where was it here?

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Oh, Brad from Pod Culture said,

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
That fucker will be hacked in a heartbeat.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
You think we're going to be able to sideload our own games on this thing?

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I'm just not sure how we would get them in there, because this thing isn't going to take any type of storage.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.000
There's no, like, storage media, right? It's not going to take a USB card or an SD card or anything.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:23.000
How would you inject something in there? I don't know.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
I don't know how you would do that.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Yeah, it's some sort of mod chip, I would imagine.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Yeah, it would have to be something a lot more hardwired.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:36.000
It would be cool if it was something that's plugged into, like, the controller port or something like that, but I don't think that they would be able to do that.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Yeah, but we'll see. I mean, surely somebody's going to try.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Anyway, thanks for the great email. Participate at orangeloundtrader.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000
It'd be like, was it the, I think it was either the first flashback or the second one, whatever.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:59.000
They had one that didn't have, like, the actual cartridge port, but it had the pinout for all the cartridges, so all you had to do was solder your own cartridge port onto it, and it could take external cartridges.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Yeah, yeah. Crazy.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.000
All right, let's see. Let's move on to some other gaming news.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000
All right, so, you know, I don't know how we would say this.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Farming Simulator does what Bethesda don't. I don't know, but apparently Farming Simulator 2017 is going to do something that's unheard of on the PlayStation 4.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:33.000
It's going to have mod support. And, yeah, I mean, but then again, though, Bethesda said they would have mod support, so I guess we'll have to actually see when it comes out.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:44.000
But, you know, according to the Twitter account, they said, just to confirm, Farming Simulator 17's mod support on both Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be available when the game comes out.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:54.000
So, neat, I guess. I mean, I don't know what kind of mods they have for Farming Simulator, but I can only hope it's insane.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Well, of course it'll be insane.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
It might be worth it just to pick it up for the mod support.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Topless mods.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Topless mods.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:11.000
I don't know what on a farm would be topless. I guess the crows. Scarecrows, the big boobs. That's what'll be the mods.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I can only hope.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:21.000
SSU100Matt in chat says, people are going to mod it to grow crops of dicks and boobs. Yeah, probably, probably.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Marijuana crops.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:31.000
BobbyBlackWolf says, Bethesda's issue with having PlayStation 4 mod support was more about how Sony wanted it implemented, not necessarily a technical limitation.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Sony might have put some restrictions Bethesda didn't agree to, but Farming Simulator did.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Yeah, and it kind of annoys me that no one can come to an agreement, and here I have this Fallout 4 on PlayStation 4 and I'm unable to use mods with it, which is very disappointing.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Yeah, it's disappointing.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Alright, well, moving on to something different, not a mod, but official DLC for a game that just keeps on giving.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Shovel Knight. And I thought they were totally done with development on this game, but I guess not.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Shovel Knight is getting more DLC. It's called Specter of Torment, and it's supposed to release in Spring of 2017.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:16.000
And they are saying that the Specter Knight adventure is a huge game, so it's going to be a whole little kind of side thing going on.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000
And Act F pointing out there's actually two DLC left, including this one.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:29.000
So, it sounds to me like this is probably going to be, I'm assuming, especially since it's been a while they've been working on this, almost probably the size of the original game.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Probably, type of expansion we're talking about here. I mean, we'll see. Don't take my word for it.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Wait for Yacht Club Games to say something more official, but that's pretty cool.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:45.000
They did unveil at least the title, logo, and some of that good stuff there, so that is coming out Spring of 2017.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Alright. So, Sonic, the franchise that's been kind of plagued with not-so-great games recently.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:11.000
So, there's been a lot of fan games made with it, and in fact, one of those was actually, they had shown some gameplay on YouTube, and the official Sonic channel responded to the video.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Basically saying, hey, BRB, DMCA time. Just kidding, keep making great stuff, Sonic fans.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
That was a little shade.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:33.000
So, basically, they have given the go-ahead to, you know, make fan games. So, if you're going to make a fan game, they're not going to smack it down, at least is what it sounds like.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Whereas Nintendo, at least their social media channels won't.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Exactly. So, I mean, obviously, if you try to profit from it, maybe, you know, they may have a problem with it, but as of just releasing a free fan game or something, they don't seem to have a problem with it.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:13:00.000
So, I'm very relieved with that, I guess. It's kind of disappointing that Nintendo doesn't have the same stance, but they're Nintendo, so what are you going to do?

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Hmm, I'm curious to see now that the floodgates have, well, I'm curious to see if they really do stick to that, because, you know, Sega's a big company, and I'm sure the social media arm's a little different than the legal arm and so forth, but, I mean, I don't think there would be that big of a disparity.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:23.000
I don't think they're suddenly going to try to shut this game down, but I'd be very, very curious to see how this kind of opens the floodgates, maybe, for other fan things.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Well, if you remember, like, you know, with Sonic, you know, the Sonic Mania has a fan game in it, so, I mean, that's kind of...

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
True, and sometimes, didn't they hire the people who made a fan game to...

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Yeah.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Yeah, so, there you go. Bobby Blackwolf says in our chat, time for Voggick the hedge-vog.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
As long as he doesn't have shitty friends.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:51.000
We'll just do Sonic Jam. There'll be another game jam that no one will make games for. It's Sonic Jam. It's all Sonic.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:14:01.000
All Sonic, all the time. Hey, this is neat. Xbox One's backward compatibility, you know, they keep adding to it every week, and they just added this past week.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown, Bound by Flame, and The Maw. If you've bought one of these games previously, or you have them on disc, you can add them into your library.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:18.000
But what's notable about this, this brings up the total number of backwards compatible games to 250 games.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
That's 250 more than PlayStation 4.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Yes, so, and 250 games that you don't have to pay for, unlike Nintendo. So, there you go. So, Good Guy, Microsoft.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
The things that happen when you're in second place.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:38.000
You know, that's, it's so weird, like, like such a turnaround, but I guess, you know, Sony did the same thing.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000
The things that happen when you're in second place. That's what it, this is what it all boils down to.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Seriously, and it's just like, there's, you know, I'm, it's all very positive for them. I mean, I'm just, I don't know what to say. I mean, it's great. I think that I really hope they keep up with that.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:04.000
It's great, but there are still more games I want to see, like Lost Odyssey, still waiting on that. Where's those multi-disc games? We know it got to work.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000
And a digital version. Can we, you know, pick that up? Because I don't think I have a disc version anymore.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Well, it'd be nice. It'd be very nice. Anyhow, a couple more stories here before we open up our Skype line. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call tonight, we'll be opening that up in just a moment. But first, Loki.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:36.000
So, speaking of backwards compatibility, we talked last week about an NES emulator that almost made it through the whole certification process to appear as an Xbox or Windows Universal app on the Xbox One to be able to play NES games.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:51.000
And of course, you know, that got shut down and they weren't unable to put that out. But that did not stop them. That's right. NESBox actually has created a version of their emulator that runs in the web browser.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:16:02.000
That's right. It actually uses the Xbox One's Edge browser to be able to play games. Can't block that shit. So, that's very cool.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Interesting workaround from all that.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
What are you going to do? I mean, there's not much you can do at that point.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000
No, then it's just an internet thing. It's just on the internet. What can you do at that point?

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:23.000
And apparently it works only with the Xbox One gamepad. It supports the A, B, select and all that stuff. And they're going to be adding OneDrive support to store your ROMs.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Before I get to the last story here, I have a comment in chat I want to answer that was on the backwards compatibility thing. Shehulk in chat over at live.vognetwork.com said,

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:38.000
How about getting the original Xbox games converted? That would be great. That would be great. That's a very good point.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:49.000
You know, what would be a great Xbox 360 thing to get working would be the Xbox emulator. That's right. I'm suggesting we emulate an emulator. But if it works, it works.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:57.000
You know, there was a lot of original Xbox games that worked pretty well on 360. But again, it was still limited, right? Like the DDR games were never playable.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Yeah, it was still limited.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.000
But there was still a lot that did work. I mean, that was cool.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:09.000
It would be kind of hard, though, going from emulating an architecture to emulating another architecture. I mean, you'd basically want to recreate that from the ground up.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
I don't know where we're at.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000
I feel like he commented, though, it's something they're looking at.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I don't know. I'd be even fine with them just going the PlayStation around and reselling them. I don't know, maybe not.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:32.000
But I don't think a lot of people have those original discs anymore for the Xbox. Maybe they do, but if you really want to emulate those, I guess you have the Xbox 360.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:40.000
And I don't really know what kind of games you would get. I mean, I guess you could have the Xbox original Halo or Halo 2, but they have remasters of those now.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
True.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I don't know.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
They practically come with most Xbox Ones at this point.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I don't know what the point would be, really, but I think what they're doing is fine right now. If they can manage to do that, that's cool, but I just don't think the time invested in making something like that and the return on that wouldn't be as great.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:10.000
All right. Well, we'll see. I still would like to see them maybe do it at some point, but I understand why maybe they want to work on it. I want the backwards compatibility for Lost Odyssey more.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I would love to go back to that. At this point, I probably have to start all over again, but I do want to play it.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:26.000
We all probably would. Anyhow, one more story here before we open up Skype, and that is about, did you ever play the classic NES game Super Pitfall?

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Not to be confused with Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns, which was a great game. The original Pitfall is obviously legendary on the Atari 2600, but the NES made a game called Super Pitfall.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.000
I don't think it did.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:49.000
It's awful. It's one of the worst NES games ever made. I remember buying it because I loved, well, asking my mommy very nicely to buy it for me, because I loved the original Pitfall.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:57.000
I loved Pitfall 2, especially on the Commodore 64, so I was like, oh, Super Pitfall, shit, there's a new Pitfall game, I've got to have it, and it was garbage.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:06.000
It was buggy, like you would just randomly fall off ladders to your death. I don't even know how something like this got past QA back in the day, but I guess it was a different time.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
In Tennessee, low quality.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Yeah, right. So this game was pretty garbage. So, and I guess it was supposed to actually be a conversion of Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns, but something went really, really, really wrong.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Well, anyway, this game is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and for the most part, you would probably think, who the fuck cares?

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:39.000
But, maybe in a state of win, it's a good thing somebody did care, a person named NESRocks decided to actually give the original game a makeover.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Changing the visuals, redesigning levels, including new music composed on FC and Chill. So apparently, it actually fixes a lot of the issues with the original game.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Here's the crazy part. David Crane, who originally made Pitfall, legendary designer from the 80s, definitely on my dream list of people I'd like to have on this show someday.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:10.000
David Crane, who created the original Pitfall, which by the way had nothing to do with Super Pitfall, because at that point, you know, the brand...

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
No, no, that's not me.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Well, yeah, he said this, but he actually reached out to NESRocks and said, truly an amazing and impressive effort, and to learn assembly language programming in order to pull it off is equally impressive.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I run into Super Pitfall haters all the time, and I'm quick to point out I had nothing to do with it, but now I can point them to your improved version.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Well, that's quite the compliment coming from a legendary game designer like David Crane, and you can actually play it too. What it is, it's actually a patch, so if you have the Super Pitfall cartridge, you get the modification, and then you use the patch on your Retron 5 or Retro Freak, and you can actually mod the game, basically, and play it.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:21:00.000
And it's questionably illegal, but, I mean, are they really making money off Super Pitfall all these years later?

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:10.000
See, that's too bad. Like, imagine having that kind of mod support on the NES Mini. Can you imagine how awesome that would be, and horribly disgusting at the same time?

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Stopy says, the PS2 Pitfall game is surprisingly good.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:28.000
S2100Matt says, I just remember Jack Black being in the Pitfall commercial, and Dungeon Buster saying, oh, David Crane, he co-founded Activision and made that neat Ghostbusters game.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Yeah, he made a lot of the classic 80s Activision games that were on the Atari 2600. He's a real legendary game designer, so, yeah, I would love to get him on the show someday.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:46.000
So, Dark Tetsuya says, I played a little bit of it. I think I might try to beat this. So, yeah, you can revisit this game 30 years later.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:53.000
So, anyway, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, if you want to give us a call on Skype.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:22:05.000
While we wait for some calls to come in, though, we need to let a little bit of angst out of our system to kind of cleanse things before we take some nice calls and smile for our callers, with a statement we call the FUs of the Week.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
This is fucked up.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:38.000
You know, I don't really know who to... I guess, you know, it doesn't really affect me personally. I mean, it sort of did in the reverse sense, because I was going to throw an ice field, and then this giant field came right as I got to the other portal I was going to throw to, you know, for Ingress and stuff.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:54.000
But an FU to people that spoof their location in Ingress to knock down stuff, because I think that has more of an impact in the gameplay versus people spoofing shit in Pokémon GO, which really doesn't fucking matter at all, I mean, honestly.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:03.000
But yet Niantic isn't doing bullshit. They're doing jack shit about that instead of just fucking people over left and right, you know. They're just not focusing on the right.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I don't really have a lot of angsty things to put out there this week. Just FU to the fact that the weekend flew by too fast, and I've got, like, a lot of work to do at work tomorrow, which, you know, I like my job and all, but it's just like, oh man, I feel like I didn't get to rest enough this weekend.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:28.000
It didn't help that they were having a party next door last night that was going to, like, 1230, so I had to sleep on the couch last night, because, like, I couldn't sleep through all the noise from that end of the house, so, bleh.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:32.000
But, um, yeah. Otherwise, honestly, things are mostly okay.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:39.000
There. I feel better. Hopefully you do as well. Let's get to the phones and take some calls. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Hey, hey, it's Rama. What's up, everyone?

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Hey, Rama, how you doing? You sound different tonight. Are you calling from somewhere else?

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Yes, it's called a train on NJ Transit trying to get back home to New York City.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:24:07.000
My gosh, you are calling us from a train, so coming to you live somewhere between New Jersey and New York, which, by the way, I heard about that incident in New York yesterday, and I'm glad to hear that, you know, there's injuries, which sucks, but thank God, no fatalities.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Yes, definitely. And also, I apologize for the audio quality, because I am tethering off one of my many cellphones that I have, so thank goodness for that.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000
That's okay. We'll make do. So, tell us what's on your mind tonight.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:29.000
I want to talk back to the beginning of tonight's show. You talked about those idiots who are suing Steam customers over bad reviews.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Please, what do you want to say about it?

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I'm not going to name names, but there is a guy who runs a variety of anime, manga, and comic conventions in the Midwest, some on the West Coast and some on the East Coast. We've talked about him on our show.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:58.000
It seems that he does something similar. Pretty much, whether you are pressed with him or not, if you write up a bad review about his convention, he will sue you for defamation of character and slander.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:05.000
I feel like even I've heard about this guy from Facebook posts and stuff. So, the anime circuit has their own Amy's Baking Company.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Yes, and right now, when the lawsuit happened, the press outlet actually started a Kickstarter, you know, to raise funds, and people threw money at it.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:24.000
It went to court, it got thrown out because of the jurisdiction, so this guy actually set up shop in this guy's jurisdiction and refiled the lawsuit.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Oh my gosh. So, I mean, are these people going to have to actually defend themselves, or is this going to get laughed out of court, or what?

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:44.000
No, this guy actually has to defend himself, and if you look around, you can find a complete PDF of the entire docket of what's going on.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
He's countersuing for legal fees, right?

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Yes.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Good. I think that's a very important thing to do in these scenarios, so that way when these things do get thrown out of court, you know, the countersuit for legal fees, at least you're hopefully not getting stuck with all that, because what a mess.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I know. I just think it's absolutely ridiculous. I mean, you put a game out, people are going to like it and talk about it. People are going to hate it and talk about it.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.000
People will be indifferent and talk about it. You've got to learn to take your lumps and go with it.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:25.000
No matter what you do out there, no matter what you do, and it can be something that you're asking people for money, it could be something you're doing for free, like this podcast.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:31.000
No matter what you do, there are always going to be haters. There's always going to be haters.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Yes, yes, yes.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:42.000
I get crazy weird emails and tweets and sometimes one-star podcast reviews for Orange Lawn Radio and so forth, and, you know, it happens. We have haters.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:56.000
But it's just kind of one of those, you just kind of have to learn how to deal with those situations, and you just, for me, I just, you know, I'll kind of, there's a really good line I picked up at a podcast panel at Dragon Con that I think would apply here.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:06.000
If one person complains about it, don't really give it a second thought. If two people complain about it, look into it. If three people complain about it, change it. You know what I mean?

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:13.000
And I think that's a pretty good rule of thumb is that there's always going to be people that complain about those strangest things.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:21.000
And, you know, I try to evaluate everything and kind of go, is there something legit to this? And if there is, maybe I'll look into it.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:32.000
But if it's just kind of strikes me as one of those, like, somebody just didn't agree with an opinion that we had on the show, and so they're lashing out with all these, you know, which is why we're garbage and all this.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:37.000
It's just like, I just kind of roll my eyes and move on and just go, haters gonna hate.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Damn right. See, I live by the 85-15 rule. If 85% of the people like what I'm putting out, I'm gonna roll with it. If 15% don't, they can leave it as is.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:58.000
When those numbers get reversed, then I know I have to stop what I'm doing, reevaluate, and flip the numbers back.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:10.000
You know what, though? Even if one person likes what I'm doing, I'm pretty happy. Although, I don't know, 99 haters would be a lot. So, I'm glad for the most part we seem to have more levers than we do haters.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Yes, and you know, and it's an amazing thing, because every year I go to conventions, I can't go a year running into somebody who listens to the show, and I'm just like, I just get humbled.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:34.000
And I take my picture with them, and I post it on the site. I'm just like, got a listener, they like the show, you should check it out. You know, I just get extremely humbled, because it makes me feel good knowing there's actually someone out there who likes to hear me rant about outlandish shit and fandom.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Same, same. You know, like when I get fortunate enough to do a panel, let's say at some type of gaming show or what have you, you know, I'm always, you know, the day leading up to the panel, I'm always kind of have those thoughts.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Like, I think a lot of people do in their heads, like, nobody's gonna fucking show up, Rob. Nobody listens to your show, Rob. Nobody cares. Nobody's gonna show up to this thing, because there's better stuff going on at the same time, ba-da-ba-da-ba.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:10.000
And then I'm always humbled. Like, even if just like 10 people show up to my panel, I'm like, holy shit, people actually made time to come see this, and like, we're into it, because I'm associated with it, and it just like blows my mind. It's so humbling. It really is.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Mm-hmm. I mean, I've done live podcasts at conventions. The least I've gotten is like four people, and we get a good conversation going, and there's the times I've walked in, there's like 20 or 30. I'm like, y'all really want to hear the three of us get down and dirty?

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Do you realize what you're getting yourselves into? And then we're like, oh, we gotta be PG, because you never know who's walking by.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
That's right. Never know.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Yeah, I don't know if that'd work for me.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.000
What?

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Being PG.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Oh, well, you kind of warned the con in advance, you know, it just depends on...

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:52.000
You know, like, if we were doing a live panel, let's say, and you look out in the audience and you see kids out there, you'll be able to self-edit. I know you will.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Mm-hmm.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
And if that doesn't work, that's what duct tape is for.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Yeah. All right, well, Rama, anything else you want to share before we open up the Skypoint again?

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:08.000
I ate over two, three pounds of delicious Tasty Pig and Brisket yesterday.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Delicious?

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Yes.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Mm, you have me thinking about barbecue now. You know, I went to round one in Concord yesterday. I didn't talk about this during my gaming week.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:24.000
But I went to the brand new round one in Concord, and it's right next door to Lucille's barbecue. So you can just smell the barbecue as you're going in.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:31.000
It's so good, which is hilarious because, you know, Shane, who, of course, drug me to round one because, you know, who else does that type of stuff?

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:37.000
He hates barbecue. He hates barbecue the way I hate mayonnaise. Like, really, really, really hates it, right?

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:43.000
So he's just like, ugh, ugh, ugh, like anytime he can smell the barbecue. So it's just kind of funny.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:51.000
I can get hating mayonnaise. I get that. Not everyone likes condiments. But how can you hate barbecue? I'm not going to get it.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:59.000
You know, I think it's crazy, too, but I also kind of look at it and go, well, barbecue sauce is a condiment as well as mayonnaise.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
So I can see if I'm allowed to hate mayonnaise.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000
But there's such a variety of barbecue sauces versus mayonnaise, which is usually just mayonnaise.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Well, they'll do. It's an aioli sauce. No, it's fucking mayonnaise.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Oh, no, it's mayonnaise.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
See? See? So there is...

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Just like the overuse of Chipotle. We don't need fucking Chipotle everything, okay? Like, I see a Chipotle aioli or whatever.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:20.000
The only Chipotle we need is actual Chipotle.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Eh, we don't even need that, but...

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Alright. Rama, I'm going to let you go, buddy.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Alright, take care, brother.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Take care, my friend. Bye.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Bye.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call, and say hello.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Which, actually, the phones are ringing right now, so let's get to another call.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio. You might be muted.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Oh, sorry.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
There we go. Hi. Who's this?

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.000
This is Eric RPG.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Hey, Eric RPG. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.000
I am just calling to talk about what I've been up to lately.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000
What have you been up to lately?

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Uh, I got a cold on, like, Thursday, so I've been dealing with it.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Wait a minute, though. Okay, but in your picture, you have little Dragon Quest slimes on your shoulder,

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.000
so if you've been sick, then clearly you've been playing Dragon Quest VII on the DS non-stop, right?

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Uh, the 3DS, yes.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Yeah.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Um, so, yeah. That's one way I can enjoy my weekend, despite feeling like crap.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:24.000
And I didn't even go to a con, either.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Well, something's going around. It is that time of year where people are supposed to be getting flu shots and all that stuff, so...

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:34.000
So, you called to just complain about how you're sick, or is there some games you can play?

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
No, I'm gonna talk about the games.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Oh, okay. Yes, please. What have you been playing?

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Uh, I, uh, in addition to Dragon Quest, I've also been playing Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Ah. And how's that?

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Um, it's a very much improved version of the original Shin Megami Tensei IV,

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:58.000
and they look like they actually put some effort into the story this time,

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:04.000
because even though the series hasn't really been big on a story,

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:08.000
they usually just put up a structure and then you just do things.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Um, they actually seem to have... make a better resolution than they did in the last game,

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:22.000
because the last game, no matter which path you picked, the ending was primarily the same,

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:29.000
and the conclusion of the neutral ending, which is the true ending of the game, was not very satisfactory,

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:35.000
and the biggest problem with that game is the fact that the maps didn't have labels.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I don't even know how they shipped the game out without telling you where to go or what the names of places were on the map,

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:49.000
because wandering around aimlessly isn't exactly fun, even though I still loved that game to death.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000
It was, like, one of the worst things about that game, so they fixed that.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.000
So because I know you do game reviews and stuff, you must have an early copy of this,

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.000
because I'm noticing that Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse isn't actually out until this coming week, right?

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Yeah, it's out Tuesday.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
It's out on Tuesday, so you're kind of getting a little...

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.000
The reviews went up, like, Thursday, but I haven't written mine yet because I've been sick.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Well, and I think the Japanese reviews were very kind to this game, because it's been out...

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Of course, it's been out in Japan, like, for a year, since February.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:21.000
It's when it came out in Japan, and, what, Famitsu gave it a 35, which is respectable, certainly.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:27.000
It has an average of 9.0... I'm sorry, GameSpot gave it a 9.0, I guess, so it's getting pretty good scores.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:34.000
The only thing I could knock it for is that you're going to a lot of the same locations you did in the last game,

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.000
but that's understandable, since it's in the same setting.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Well, what if I'm somebody new to the series? Would I, like, because I've got to admit,

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:44.000
I haven't played a lot of these games, just because there's only so many hours in a day,

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.000
and I can't play everything, so I'm kind of newer to these games.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:53.000
So, seeing as I would be bringing no knowledge of what was wrong with, you know, the past games into this,

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
would I get a kick out of it?

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:03.000
I mean, if you like the whole monster collecting aspect, but you want something a little bit more edgy, I guess,

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.000
it's a good start, but it is more challenging.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Than most RPGs, but there is a casual difficulty for those who don't want to play on the normal one.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:22.000
To be honest, Erika, I actually bought Dragon Quest VII when it released, but I only played, like, two minutes of it.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:26.000
I was so busy during the weekend, since I went on a road trip and everything,

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I haven't been able to play Dragon Quest VII at all, so I didn't talk really about it in the intro,

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.000
but to be fair, that's going to be the 3DS RPG that dominates some time this week,

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.000
and probably for the next few weeks, because Dragon Quest VII is a very, very, very long game.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Yeah, it's like 100 hours.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Yeah, that's not even the side quests, right?

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
With the side quests, that probably is about right.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Oh, okay, okay.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:56.000
The original game took me about 110, and this one actually has more continent.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:02.000
I don't know if it has that much more, but they also streamlined the game, so it's probably about the same.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Okay, yeah, because I think they did do some street pass type stuff in it, too,

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:15.000
so I know they have some new things in it as well, but it's something I want to play through relatively soon,

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.000
because A, Pokemon Sun and Moon are coming, and obviously I'm going to have to play those.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
I really still need to beat...

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
God, why is it the Alpha Sapphire?

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I just skipped the name for a minute.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:33.000
I still need to beat that, and then Dragon Quest VIII is out in 2017, and I really want to play that,

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.000
because I actually didn't play a lot of Dragon Quest VII when it was first out,

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:41.000
but I did play a lot of Dragon Quest VIII when it was out on PlayStation 2,

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:44.000
and gorgeous soundtrack, and funny voice acting.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:50.000
About the soundtrack, apparently it, much like VII, is not going to feature the symphonic soundtrack.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Aw, that's sad.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
But in VII's case, I can kind of understand it,

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:00.000
because apparently when they did the game three years ago in 2013 in Japan for the 3DS,

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:07.000
they couldn't figure out how to code it properly, and they ended up using only about half the tracks before it would loop,

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
so that was pretty gross.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.000
So they were like, instead of half-assing this, let's just change it,

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:17.000
and plus it might have something to do with copyright, but I don't think it does,

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:21.000
because if that were the case, the new music would also be copyrighted.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Yeah, true, true.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Unless it's operating through a third party, and they don't have to worry about the legalities,

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:31.000
because they're willing to pay the price that they're asking.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Right.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:39.000
But other than that, I don't understand why they removed it for VIII,

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:47.000
other than the possibility of them just simply not having the room for both voice acting and five language text files.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Yeah, that does sound really, really big.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Yeah, because what they do with the North American releases is they basically make a base European version with all the language tracks on it,

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.000
and then they code it for the regions as needed.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Well, I'm sorry to hear that you're sick, but I'm glad to hear you have several RPGs that are very, very, very long to help you get through it.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:18.000
I'd also mention, while we're running on the subject of RPGs, I have a review up on VoG.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Yes, you do.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000
For Grand Kingdom.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Yes, you do. I hope folks should check that out and let their response...

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:33.000
It's a strategic turn-based RPG that has a perspective similar to Guardian Heroes in that there's three layers,

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:40.000
and you have to place your characters appropriately so they don't do splash damage to each other,

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
because there is friendly fire in that game.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:47.000
And you ended up giving that game... Well, I shouldn't spoil everything, but you gave it a positive review.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:50.000
I won't say exactly what the score is. You'll have to go to VoGnetwork.com to check that out.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:59.000
But you mentioned that there's a lot of load times in it as kind of one of the maybe downsides to it.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.000
I mean, they're short, but they're frequent, so that's annoying.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Yeah. All right. Well, everybody check out that review over at VoGnetwork.com.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:11.000
It's still on the front page. Just have to scroll down past the recent podcast to see it, but you can check that out.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.000
And if you've played the game yourself, don't forget to leave a response review to it.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:23.000
There's also a review of The Walking Dead Michonne, and hopefully I can get Season 3 up.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Excellent. All right. Well, thank you so much for the call. I'm going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls in, okay?

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Bye-bye.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
All right. Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:42.000
All right. I did something very strange to the audio recorder, and I'm worried that I've stopped recording.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
No, it's still going. Thank God.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:54.000
That is the first time in hundreds of episodes I've done that. I clicked on the recorder accidentally because I was trying to click to another window, and it stopped.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Usually I can see the little waveform as it's being created, but I accidentally clicked in the window and, yeah, screwed that up.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.000
But I fixed it. So we're good. We're still recording. Sorry.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Oh, boy. This has been an interesting technical night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
I'm going to see if we can squeeze in one more call.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:17.000
So Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, if you want to give us a call and talk about what have you.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Is that accurate? Stop, he says in chat. What? Can't hear? Don't scare me like that.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Can you really not hear us? Or is everything okay? I'm over here. Everything's okay.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:32.000
I see a waveform going, so I know it's recording fine, so I'm going to hope everything's fine. Okay.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Everything says it's all fine. Don't do that to me. Rude.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Hey, this is Hack Def.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Hey, Hack Def. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Well, I wanted to talk about a recent announcement for my city that got me pretty excited.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000
What's that?

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Well, Capcom Live.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Oh, Capcom Live. Is this going to be like a touring fighting thing, or what is this?

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000
No, it's actually a video game concert.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Really? How did I miss this? I had not heard about this.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Yeah, it didn't get that much attention. It was featured on Shoryuken.com, but very briefly.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:26.000
But, yeah, they made a local convention here named Gammacon.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:35.000
It's a video game development and business convention, basically, but it's open to the public.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:45.000
So, yeah, they're going to bring what is a Capcom Live concert on November 5th, if I remember correctly.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Interesting, because I'm looking at the website. You can check this out at CapcomLive.com.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:56.000
I noticed Tommy Tallarico is involved with this, who of course is very big with Video Games Live as well.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:02.000
So, I guess there's kind of that common thread there to Video Games Live, which is a great production.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:06.000
So, you know, you're going to have some of that audio-visual stuff coming into play. That's pretty cool.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Yeah, again, I'm pretty excited about it.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Also, Shota Nakama also works on it, and he has worked on many Square Enix games as F of Light.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:26.000
He's a pretty good composer. He actually, if I remember correctly, came last year to the same convention.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:34.000
They made a smaller concert, but it was decent enough, but it wasn't that great.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:40.000
So, hopefully, with this one, Capcom Live, it will be way, way better.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.000
You know, and Act Deaf, I think part of the reason why this isn't getting a lot of traction on blogs and stuff

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000
is that I'm looking at the site, and the only date that's on the list right now is this event in Mexico.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:54.000
So, I think it's probably off the radar for folks in the U.S. and Canada and so forth, since it's in another country.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:43:01.000
But maybe this is something where they're kind of, like, sometimes, especially when comedians, before they do a big tour,

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:08.000
they might do a test show in a smaller market, right, before they take things on tour in stadiums and stuff.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.000
So, maybe this is kind of like a test run for Capcom Live?

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Most probably. I am seeing on Capcom Live's page that they are having, I think, some shows on Japan.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Oh, cool.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:33.000
Not there until, like, December. So, probably, yeah, they're probably testing some stuff here, which I don't care about,

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.000
since we are getting it, and I'm gonna enjoy it equally.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.000
As you should. You know, sometimes, you guys in Mexico, you have to wait for things,

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:47.000
because you don't always have, you know, you don't have a lot of game companies that release stuff directly there.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Sometimes, you have to wait to get them from the States and what have you.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.000
So, you know what? That's totally fine that you guys get something first for a change,

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:59.000
but I fully expect you to go and then call into the show and tell us all about it.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Awesome. All right. Well, anything else on your mind, Act F?

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:09.000
No, that's pretty much it.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:10.000
All right.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Yeah, again, I'm pretty excited about it, and yeah, hopefully, it will be really, really great.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.000
I'm sure it'll be a good time. All right, take care, my friend. I'm gonna let you go.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Thanks.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.000
All right. Bye-bye.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
All right. So, I think that is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.000
I'm sorry if you didn't get through, but please consider sending us an email.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Just wanna check in with Loki real quick and see if there's any other last-minute stories before we wrap things up here at OLR.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Yes, I do have something. Apparently, coming from Microsoft, they made a comment regarding Scorpio,

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:50.000
and basically with USA Today said that any games that we're making that we're launching in the Scorpio timeframe,

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.000
we're making sure that they can natively render at 4K.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:45:00.000
So, any Xbox One games for Scorpio are gonna render at 4K, which is pretty impressive.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.000
It is impressive.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Also begs the question, how fucking expensive is Scorpio? So, we'll have to see.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.000
We'll see when they decide to give us some details on it, which I'm assuming is next E3,

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
but I suppose they could always do something sooner.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:13.000
$599 USD.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:18.000
$699 USD. We'll see. We'll see. It might be a very powerful system.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Anyhow, that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:24.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, please help us spread the word.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Tell a friend or five about the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:32.000
but we can't get those voices out there if they're not here joining us.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:38.000
So, a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or what have you

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:42.000
will go a long, long way in helping to spread the word.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:45.000
But, you know, word of mouth is always really the best referral.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:48.000
And I did just want to quickly footnote here somewhere in the show tonight,

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:52.000
talking about these places to hear podcasts just kind of reminded me.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:57.000
I did make a post on our forums, which I also linked on social media earlier this week.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.000
I did make a difficult decision to pull Orange Lounge Radio from Stitcher this week,

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:05.000
and so we're no longer on Stitcher Radio, and I'm fine with that,

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:10.000
because the show that was being presented on Stitcher Radio was out of date.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.000
There were episodes missing, and I was getting tweets all the time about,

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Where's your show? Did you stop doing your show? And all this stuff.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:19.000
And I can't allow a network. I don't care how big it is.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
You know, I know Stitcher's a very popular choice.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.000
I can't allow a network to misrepresent our show like that.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
So, I made that difficult decision.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Did you ever figure out, like, why is it that they can't update?

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Well, I did. I'll tell you this. I did get an email probably about a week ago

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.000
that said something about file length or something was coming into play,

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.000
and they were having a hard time figuring out what was going on, I guess.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.000
But the thing that actually really cheesed me, that really ticked me off

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.000
and actually kind of made me decide to pull the show is that they sent this, what, like a week ago?

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
They've known for months that this is happening,

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
and my understanding is that Stitcher has changed hands.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Like, they were owned by one company. They just recently got bought by another.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:00.000
So, hopefully this will change for the better.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:03.000
And I'm not going to rule out that we'll never go back to Stitcher.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:07.000
I mean, if they'll have us at this point, because obviously I'm not doing them a favor here with this.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:11.000
But I think most reasonable people will understand why I'm upset.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:18.000
And for the sake of our listeners and accurately reflecting the regular show

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.000
we're working very hard to put out here, I made a difficult decision to pull the plug.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.000
And it actually kind of irritated me more that they knew there was a problem for months

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.000
and didn't, like, I don't understand. No other sites have this problem.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:35.000
It completely has to do with the fact that Stitcher pulls down the shows for their own, you know, network,

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
which is controversial in and of itself.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:40.000
I know some podcast producers that really don't like that.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:46.000
But I always was kind of like, well, you know, it's not really about, since we're not trying to sell ads or anything,

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:49.000
I'm okay not having those impressions or whatever.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000
I just want to get the show out there.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:53.000
But I really hit my breaking point when things weren't being accurately reflected.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:48:01.000
So, if you're hearing this, then that tells me you migrated from somewhere other than Stitcher to be here this week.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
So, I just really want to thank you for making that.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:10.000
And I'm sorry to have put you in that position from your preferred Internet player or what have you.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:13.000
But I can't really stress this enough.

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:21.000
There was unfortunately a cost to being on that network that I was no longer willing to basically live with.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:24.000
And that was the fact that you were missing shows.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
And you weren't really getting the full OLR.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
So, there it is.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says, I switched to Google Play anyway for my podcasting listening.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:34.000
I was on Stitcher.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
You know, and I made a couple tweets about it.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:41.000
And I got to say, I didn't intend for this to happen because this was the choice that I made for our show.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:48.000
But I've heard from some other podcast producers that said, you know, I actually, I had a Stitcher widget on my site.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:53.000
And I've actually looked into getting listed on TuneIn so I can get a widget from them instead.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Because, yeah, the concerns you're voicing are pretty valid.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:01.000
So, I'm not out to ruin Stitcher or anything like that.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
I want to make it very clear, you know.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.000
But I just, they need to evaluate a lot of things over there.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:17.000
And just run something that is not going to put the blame on us because their thing can't read the show accurately.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
So, there you go.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Anyhow, that's really all I wanted to say on that.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
But I'm glad I remembered there through the different plugs.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.000
So, now let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
I guess I pretty much just gave a big final thought.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:38.000
But my other final thought I will give tonight is I can't wait for my Golden Girls pop figures to get here.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.000
I don't know why, but Amazon isn't delivering them to me until October.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:46.000
So, it's sad to see that they're out there in the wild and some of my friends are getting them.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.000
But at least I know they're all on reserve and they're all coming.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.000
And it's not like a pop figure is something I have to have right now.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.000
But it would be nice.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.000
And, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:08.000
My final thought is I am going to work more on my game and hopefully I'll actually have some in the show for it now that I've gotten past that mental block.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Good plan. I like that plan.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Alright, next week live via Skype, Aethernaut will be here for a live interview.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:23.000
I'm very excited to welcome him to the show and to welcome all of you back next week to talk about what happens in gaming then.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:26.000
So, until then, have a great gaming week everybody.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.000
