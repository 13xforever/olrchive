DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, the PlayStation 4 Pro is officially unveiled Sony makes the case for 4K and HDR to gamers Was it enough to convince you you need one? We find out tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice It is Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight, episode number 657 for this September the 11th of 2016 My name is Rob Roberts joining you here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California Here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle and with me in studio, as he always is, say hello to Techmaster Loki Hi Hi Loki, how are you doing? I'm alright Happy birthday! Today is your birthday Thank you I know there's other historical events weighing heavy on people's minds today for good reason and you know, obviously our thoughts go out to those that are affected all these years later but, you know, things go on and we still do our podcast and you still celebrate birthdays which is today Yeah And what did you do to celebrate? How was your day? Well, I... This does not sound like a happy birthday I'd like to say I did something fun but it really was just the wife was stressed out about the kids all day long so she was in a really fantastic mood this morning so I went out and got breakfast for her and then we went grocery shopping and the kids were just acting up like they usually do and then we bought stuff to make food she wanted me to make salmon wellingtons so I made salmon wellingtons and then she didn't want to buy, this week for some reason, the frozen macaroni or not macaroni cheese, spaghetti and meat sauce for our kids because it has MSG in it so I also had to make spaghetti with a meat sauce for two hours standing up, didn't eat lunch felt like shit until I had some cereal so I wouldn't pass out from stress which we'll get into in a little bit why I'm so fucking stressed and then... Don't worry about this, alright I mean, I guess we could talk about it now, why not? Why not? Let's talk briefly about why are you so stressed out? Do you need a hug? Yes, so here's what happened Yes, you need a hug? No What happened? So, obviously it's my birthday today and so I typically every year because I'm weird like this I buy myself something for my birthday Why not? Because everybody else is the excuse I don't know what they get you, you know, whatever so that's fine I get myself awesome birthday presents I treat myself the way I deserve to be treated Exactly My friends are very generous too but I know I'm gonna buy myself something And just on a whim and I don't even know what prompted it it was just like I was at work one day and I was on a whim and I was like, you know I haven't checked eBay in a while because I used to go on eBay and I used to go look at DDR stuff just for the hell of it Okay And this is where it started So in Rancho Cordova there was a guy selling a TechnoMotion machine for $99 starting and I was like, holy shit I'm never gonna be able to find something this perfect I feel like I already know the punchline that's coming and I'm really worried Go ahead No, it gets worse Oh, it gets worse I'm already upset about it So anyways, the whole week I'm stressing out I'm like, oh, I can't possibly do this My wife would kill me if I got this There's no way So we were just at Best Buy yesterday because we went out to dinner because we have to kill time because the kids are there and she's like, well, let's go get you something at Best Buy I'm like, okay, we'll go walk around, look at stuff and I didn't know what I really wanted, so whatever and so I brought up, I'm like, well, you know it'd be cool if I could get this, this cabinet I mean, it's really huge and she's constantly complaining, stressed out about how our house is a mess because there's just clutter everywhere which happens when you have kids, but yeah and she wants to get rid of it and I've already set up to throw away some of that but I still wanted this cabinet and stuff so earlier today I was talking with her about it and I'm like, at that point it was up to, I think, 102.50 or something like that or no, 205 is what it was sitting at and it was sitting at that for a few days and so I was like, okay so I gotta run this by the wife and see if I can get an okay and if it's okay, maybe I'll try, you know, bidding on it so reluctantly after, you know, she's very not happy with this idea she's like, fine, whatever, just do whatever you want and so, and then she finally kind of warmed up to it a little bit after she was like, you know, once she got in the car and drove away with the kids so I got basically the green light to go ahead and bid on this and I was gonna basically cap it at about $300 I may have gone a little higher than that just to see if I could, you know, get it so I'm getting everything ready I've got my computer up on the eBay page, ready to go and I'm putting away clothes and stuff and I'm watching the clock and the clock in our room's not right so it's about three minutes before I need to get there so I'm going to the living room I notice the clock in the kitchen says it's one minute before, not three minutes before I look at my computer, it's 30 seconds before the auction ends so it's like, oh shit, put in my bid, highest bidder but the problem was I put it in about 10 seconds too early I got outbid so I had it for $250 I had it for $250 for 10 seconds and then I got outbid and if I only fucking waited a few more seconds I would have had a fucking DDR machine whatever well sorry to hear it it's so frustrating though I always thought eBay worked like you're supposed to put in the most you're going to pay anyway no, it's bid sniping, it's always bid sniping you always got to bid snipe I decided to shop eBay I remember doing eBay but it was so perfect, like it was cheap I bought a copy of Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo it was cheap and it was fucking local like cheap and local and it was a Technomotion machine and the screen, the monitor didn't work on it or it may have not worked, something didn't work like the hardware for the Technomotion didn't work but it's a fucking seller on PC is basically what Technomotion is it's a seller on PC with an old ass video card I'm like, that's fucking perfect just rip it out, throw a new PC in there step mania done and then you know, fix up the pads you know, possibly put metal over the other pads or you know, we're golden it just wasn't to be, unfortunately and it would have been so fucking perfect but I was so stressed out because I had to talk to my wife about it and it's, you know, a big auction lady and it's so stressed out but now, okay, so you lost this one okay, caeser-a-ser-a but now, like, don't you kind of have like this pass like, don't you get to put that card in your pocket like, hey honey, remember when you said I could get the machine no, it doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way at all but it's fine, you know, because like you know, we're throwing away stuff in the garage and I gotta move my arcade cabinet out there anyways because, you know, the kids and originally I wanted to like set up you know, dance pads with it but it would have been so perfect not having to build because it was the same price to build those pads as it is to buy a whole fucking machine so, it's like you know, why not I mean, I wouldn't have picked Technomotion as my first choice but whatever, it's basically DDR machines some folks in our chat let me, of course, formally introduce the chat room hello chatters, and you can chat along with our show live we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and if you are listening live participating with our show, you can join our chat over at live.vognetwork.com so, real quick so I, here's what it actually went for so I bid $350 even though we agreed on $300, I still wanted to have a margin okay, because some folks wanted to know what does a little higher mean, so and I really should have counterbid but who knows if I would even want it it went for $366 it's still not that much no, it's not but whatever, I mean it's techno motion though it's a copy of a copy but it doesn't matter, I wanted it for the hardware I don't give a shit about that you deserve a prime DDR machine you deserve something legit I didn't, I mean, it's basically the pads are exactly the same, you just cover up the other the other buttons Tech 2030 in our chat wants to know a little more if eBay automatically lets the highest bidder win at the end of the auction how do you still snipe people? because what it is, is you put in basically say say someone wants to pay $250 for something and yes, you could think, okay $250 is all I can pay, you know, here's what I'm going to put in but you know, I would have paid a few extra, if I knew it was going to go for $366 I would put $367 in I mean, obviously, that's what it would have done and so, it would have stated that because, see, the problem was he had the person that had time to respond to, he saw I got outbid, and he had time to put in another bid the trick, when an early bid on that stuff, is you wait until like, there's 10 seconds left and there's no time, you, if you're lucky enough to be high enough, then you get it and there's no time for them to react it's all some damn psychological game you guys turned it into something way sicker but that's how you get stuff for cheaper though, because if you just put in, I want to pay $250 for it, then it's going to sit at $250 and someone's just going to pay $250 but it's all psychological, because you're like $250 is the most I'm willing to pay but then when you see somebody, some little fucker snipes you and gets $251, then you're like well shit, I'd pay $252 so, aha, $250 isn't the most you'd pay, you're actually willing to pay more that's the psychological game is, how much are you willing to pay for this shit is, how much are you really willing to pay for this it's a sick game it is, but see, I'm out of practice it's been several, it's been at least a couple of years since I've actually bit sniped somebody and I was panicked because I almost missed it, because I was putting away clothes from the laundry and I was like, shit, there's like 28 seconds left, I'm like holy fuck, I'm glad I got you here in time, I just like I put stuff in and I was like, worried because sometimes you put in a bid, they're like oh, please sign back in again, you know, because make sure that you're signed in or some shit, and you know, if that comes in there with 10 seconds left, it could fuck you with, you know, not being able to actually place a bid I do want to introduce our guest who's been sitting here very patiently listening to the horrors of your eBay day, but I do want to quickly acknowledge some folks may have forgot, where's DarkSakura? Remember DarkSakura, this is her first week of her hiatus from the show, she will be gone from the show for a couple of months due to an arrangement with her day job, she's just unable to make the show for a couple of months, however we will be hearing her a little later on during the Classic Game of the Week through the Magic Radio she will still be joining us every week for that and she did confirm to me this week she got November 20th off so she can be here for episode 666 so at least she's making sure that the important stuff is covered, so yeah, that's, literally, hell yeah so, anyway meanwhile, we have a guest here in studio with us and it's a friend of the show who's been here a couple of times before but we're really excited to welcome him back, it's always a good time to welcome to the show Gabe from Nascent Games creators of Crumple Kinship and whatever other projects this man takes on because he does games like I do podcasts and also involved with Sacramento IGDA, what's your role with SACIGDA? I'm the founder and chair of IGDA, you're the Grand Pooba basically, you are you are SACIGDA so I put it like I'm the face of IGDA Sacramento and then I have my vice chair of Brianna who's the voice of IGDA Sacramento because she's the vice chair that's a very good way of putting it because I know Brianna works her little fanny off for IGDA, she does great work, and hello Brianna if you're listening out there so I definitely want to talk to you a little bit about what's going on with Nascent Games and Crumple and all that, we're going to get to our kickoff topic first, I'm sure you have some things to say about this as well, one or two Loki, let's talk about what Sony unveiled this week in our kickoff topic so Sony had their little press conference if you will they unveiled basically hey, you know that Playstation Slim that came out, or that got leaked out and had reviewed and all that stuff, yeah it's real basically going to be replacing the Playstation 4 that's available now and I want to say that it was $2.99, and then they've got the Playstation Pro which is basically their Playstation Neo, it's what they're calling it now it's sponsored by GameStop well is it? no, because that's just the first thing I thought of when they announced that would you like a Pro card instead? that's a page out of Microsoft's playbook right there the Xbox Elite and the Xbox Pro system everything is Pro I'm okay with the name I didn't think it was actually going to be called Neo it's basically $3.99 it's more powerful it will do output to 4K not natively up res stuff, but it will be better looking than the other stuff is now and will supposedly help enhance VR and stuff like that not even you can say it in a complete sentence without just foaming at the mouth and that's precisely how Sony sounded because not even they can be like they just used a bunch of technobabble no one gave a shit about it it's just like talking about all this stuff and how they're gonna maybe at the end of the day it's like how much better are these games gonna look and a lot of these games are gonna be supporting these enhancements including starting off with Call of Duty for third party Call of Duty and even Black Ops 3 that came out last year will get a patch to support the higher resolution gameplay but will they be free? yes I heard that some publishers are gonna be free there's a story out there somewhere that Sony's saying that publishers can essentially set whatever price they want for it no they retracted that oh okay well that's good I think the first company to do it would have gotten a lot of internet BS yeah I can see them doing that so it's gonna be something that's gonna be available coming out in October and I'm not really interested in picking it up because I have a system already and I don't have a 4K TV although I did look at 4K TVs yesterday because I was at Best Buy and there's some pretty nice 4K TVs that aren't too expensive so you know what caught my eye amongst that whole press conference was the fact that they actually showed the first Mass Effect Andromeda like in-game footage and so that definitely had me laying on the couch going awwww I didn't know what any of it meant it didn't look interesting at all I was living for it every minute I was very happy it's very pretty oh my god and they're purposely obscuring some of the characters and so forth but I thought it looked great and so I'm certainly sitting there going okay well if Andromeda is gonna look better on a pro maybe I do need to get a PlayStation 4 pro but now here's where I'm stuck now is because okay yes these games like Final Fantasy 15 even I think they showed in the sizzle footage a lot of games coming up that people are very hyped for that will supposedly look better on the pro but then I worry my television even though I bought it last year as a 2014 model it doesn't do 4K and I don't think it does this other coloring stuff they were talking about so am I gonna get any benefit from the PlayStation Pro and I kind of feel like that message was garbled like I know they said oh yes conventional TVs will also see a benefit because down sampling I think is what they're talking about basically it's gonna be a little bit clearer of a picture but is that really worth selling your system and buying another system for $100 more? No it's not and honestly cause it's not just the system it's the TV too you gotta get a TV and that's gonna display that kind of content and there just isn't sufficient content right now period other than Netflix but even the discs it won't play 4K Blu-ray disc which was the dumbest thing ever because Sony came up with Blu-ray and they're the ones and oh yeah we beat HD DVD but now here you are coming out with PlayStation 4.5 instead of waiting like you should and they just they put the limitation on their own format which is ridiculous for them to have left the door open for Microsoft to be able to say hey our entry level Xbox One S system will do that that was a real faux pas Microsoft jumped on that like I mean they jumped on that it was that was hilarious yeah not this in particular but there's other things that have really gotten me like pro Microsoft camp now mainly one thing and we'll get to that later but there's one thing I'm like really you can't do this like this bullshit you can't fucking handle this Microsoft can do this no problem but Sony oh poor Sony can't fucking handle this shit and on top of like all this other nonsense I'm like maybe I should get an Xbox One then I can get this game on there instead because I would be purchasing all my games on Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4 with their multi-platform you know we asked our users on Facebook in our community over at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio about the PlayStation 4 Pro and here's some of the responses we got from our listeners about what they feel about this whole you know press conference and if they want a PlayStation 4 Pro or not our pal Critical Myth said it's not clear to me what the benefit of this console would be versus the existing PlayStation 4 they have a long way to go before I'm sold on the need for it you know I'm kind of in a similar spot with that because what really got me was when I went back to go watch the Mass Effect footage on YouTube or whatever it actually the president of BioWare or whoever it was sorry I forget who it was in the video actually said if you're not on a 4K TV to see this go to one and replay this or you know it's kind of like stop now and go to a 4K TV and I'm sitting here like oh okay let me just run to Best Buy and get one yeah let me just drop eight nine hundred thousand dollars you know because that's you know because you know you're the one percent so thank you in a weird way actually have them down about like four dollars yeah I kind of feel like if you bought a TV in the past maybe two years that was one of the past two years model you probably got I mean TVs are getting more reasonable yeah I'm surprised how cheap they were I mean they had those all did HDR and all that stuff but even I'm not gonna go drop a grand on a new TV just for this right and so you know and honestly I think it was that more than anything for me that said maybe I don't need this PlayStation Pro because I'm not gonna drop the money on a 4K TV then this guy is actually saying I'm gonna need one to see the difference so is Andromeda coming out whether that was the message Sony wanted to convey or not I'm sorry but that dude from BioWare that's how he phrased it Andromeda coming out on PC it is and don't don't think I haven't thought that exactly I need to go to that's like my thing right there like I actually started thinking about like why do I have a PlayStation 4 is it because of you know Sony first party exclusives that were like I was really interested in and I started thinking what Sony first party exclusives do I have that was really interested in oh no man sky well that came out of fucking PC anyways so ah infamous yeah that wasn't very good um nope don't have anything so I was like well why I forgot a war got a war is alright but you don't buy a system for one game Zelda so I don't know we'll have to see let me get through a couple other comments on this from Facebook some different perspectives here Tiger Claude said I currently own the regular PlayStation 4 and don't have a 4K TV so I don't need it however I heard that the PS4 Pro does not support 4K Blu-ray media so it's going to be a deal breaker for those who want to watch their 4K Blu-ray disc on the 4K TVs Degenerate Johnny had a very similar response to that talking about that 4K digital content from Netflix and Hulu but not physical content from 4K Blu-ray you know wasn't Microsoft placed in the hot seat years ago for doing something similar favoring digital content over physical content digital content's all good and stuff if you have the fucking bandwidth to do it yeah and we've already hearing what you know we hear what um our home IPs you know the ISPs are doing like Comcast and stuff they're putting a cap on bandwidth you know on a monthly basis already too so what's you know so now we so now we run into this conundrum of you know this rapid fire advancement in technology and and clarity in gaming and movies but now you've got you know the ISP saying well we're only going to let you enjoy it for a limited amount of bandwidth before we kind of start capping you so we're running into a problem here so it's like yeah it you know so we've become so obsessed and dependent on the streaming aspect of it you know um yeah but here we are you know you know questioning are we willing to drop another four hundred dollars on essentially minuscule upgrades well and then there's this thing about one more one more response from Facebook um Andy Ard said since I don't have a 4K TV I don't see too much of a reason to get one sure we'll have some improvements for 1080 TVs but not enough in my opinion plus I'd rather get PlayStation VR this fall and I don't have the funds to drop on two four hundred dollar boxes and that for me puts the nail in the coffin of why I think this it's this was not the right time well here's the other thing too now it has been wondering how well is this running on how well is PlayStation VR running on the regular PlayStation 4 I don't know yet well like how what they're demoing it and best buys on a regular yes I know I got there a few minutes too late yesterday so I was like oh hey oh man yeah but I mean I think for the most part I feel like I actually feel okay that the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to support the VR stuff okay but um you know I think that's a very good point is that Sony's putting out two new four hundred dollar products this year and I'm not sure that's the brightest thing to do especially when it seems too early for this 4K thing exactly and Microsoft's coming out with theirs probably I'd say next fall so already I mean technology is going to be so much better like or at least cheaper than what they've got there and they can put out a system that's more powerful same price when actually more people have content and like the devices actually watch this stuff on I just don't I it's too damn early it's like when they try to push that fucking 3D TV shit they actually had hey look it's the PlayStation TV and it's you know got fucking 3D you know TV and something it's a shitty small TV that did their 3D stuff and then they're like ah fuck 3D you know VR but do you want to hear the hilarious part of this I pre-ordered one on Amazon anyway you can because as you said you can just go on there and click pre-order I don't have to give them any money or commitment or anything and I can go in and cancel if I change my mind which I kind of think I'm going to do but Sony has 30 months to make me change my or 30 months 30 days or so to make me change my mind I just I still maybe change my mind on PlayStation VR yeah because the more I think about it I'm like what am I really getting out of this and I'm kind of wondering maybe if I should just wait and see if there's something if they're going to you know handle this like they did 3D I was hoping to hear a little more you know a lot of folks had said that this PlayStation conference they did this week felt very short and I was surprised they didn't talk more about VR considering that is coming out in a month you know obviously they talked about it in conjunction with the pro but they didn't really talk a lot about that kind of surprised me how is it better though is it just you know a higher frame rate and even still it's like that's kind of lame I think it's the same sort of textures improved and you know those sorts of like I don't understand why I would drop that kind of money for that I just I don't know it's just that's all you've got for me is that your games aren't that innovative it's just it's slightly prettier it's going to look much brighter you're going to be able to see the details but that's on any system though HDR is going to be supported you know on anything but we'll get into that a little bit later but I'm just saying what's the point in dropping money for this pro thing because you're not going to I don't know I don't really think there's any immediate needs for that and look at the titles that are going to support it yeah Call of Duty is going to support it but is it everything out of the gate I mean how many titles are going to be supporting this right away and not everybody has to support it I'm really curious what's going to happen for those households that don't have PlayStation 4s at all right now because I mean at first glance you would think oh well if I didn't have a PlayStation 4 at all then great I'm just going to buy the pro because it just makes sense but at the same time does it because now these households are faced with do I get the PlayStation 4 pro or do I save a hundred bucks and get a slim is this worth a hundred dollars that's going to be the question that these holiday sales numbers are going to be very interesting and for most families yes it is going to be a huge huge difference because I mean that's why Nintendo meanwhile Nintendo's in the background in the in the darkness just laughing maniacally like haha we're still going to be cheaper than all of you it does really feel like Nintendo is just riding off this well I shouldn't say they're riding off this holiday they're riding off the Wii U for this holiday but you're starting to see all these other plans like it's like okay well since our mega beast won't be available we're going to send all these other little gremlins out you know between the classic NES and the the thing we'll get into with the iPhone later on that I'm sure you all already know about with that and what else the physical Pokemon Go thing you know they're going to start attacking holiday from all these other angles I think instead and I think Wii U is just kind of like you know well come on down to your old old Wii U saloon not so much the Wii U just Nintendo in general with their next announcement and I mean because I think that's what more I was referring to just because you know they did pretty well last year you know with them being the cheapest at the time even though it didn't make a huge difference now but you know but still I think that you know Sony shot themselves in the foot majorly with this Microsoft's going to do a lot better which is kind of sad because the slim wasn't really necessary to begin with anyway but you know but yeah so we'll see yeah we will definitely see especially you know the games are going to be very important I know the last month of sales figures showed that Xbox One outsold PlayStation 4 now to be fair Xbox One put out that new S and that figure is the old one and the new one combined but still you know that is not a trend that Sony would want to see continue and here's the thing what's really amazing about the Pro is it's able to output you know 4K images you know upscaled but it's you know higher than 1080p greater detail more fidelity in the picture but still can't fucking run PlayStation 1 games or can't run PlayStation 2 games yet a fucking PSP can run a PlayStation 1 so what you're telling me is that system is fucking weaker than a PSP yeah the only thing yeah what was that the emotion chip in the PlayStation 2 that made all the difference with the virus compatibility but they still have now it's software emulated stuff on the PlayStation 3 so don't tell me that that fucking powerful ass fucking system can't play PlayStation 2 games oh but PlayStation Now has just no fuck you I am not buying your fucking PlayStation now well it does play select PlayStation 2 games available for $9.99 I am not subscribing to PlayStation Now ever fucking ever I am never ever subscribing to that more like PlayStation I'm gonna save that clip for when he subscribes a year from now I will never subscribe to it more like PlayStation never all right uh let's see Dungeon Buster in chat says it's been barely three years since the PlayStation 4 came out this still feels like a knee-jerk reaction to a changing market I just okay here's the weird thing for me I've been following video games for even longer than this show has existed 15 plus years at this point right what what is the what is the changing market I didn't understand that there there isn't there isn't they believe that there isn't there absolutely isn't and and it's the cell phones are fucking everything yeah I think I think it's the advancements of the smartphones and and you know the you know the the bigger publishers are like uh we can't we need to keep them at home we can't let them go out people think because people drop hundreds of dollars every other year on a nominal cell phone upgrade they're gonna do the same thing right they have the apple mentality and they like they think that that's okay but even we're seeing with Apple themselves it's like it's Apple's losing sales from the subs from the six because of you know these sort of things and you know it's gonna change it's it's gonna change after a while people are gonna get tired of spending five six hundred dollars a year because it's gonna it's gonna happen to Xbox as well that's that project Scorpio that better be something crazy good because because we're hyping the slim but now we're gonna have extra you know an xxl version of the one next year and it's like well rumor is and take this with a giant salt lick because rumor doesn't mean much but that Scorpio's like an expensive motherfucker like it's gonna be a seven hundred dollar thing like it is for gamers that are dedicated and need the power but you know we laugh but check out how much steam boxes cost you know like there's people willing to pay the higher end power and you want to play Xbox games buy a PC I mean seriously that they were fucking pimping that shit all fucking E3 Windows 10 and Xbox One exclusive then fuck you don't need them if you want a more powerful system why are you gonna drop money on an Xbox that you can't fucking upgrade unless you buy a brand new system buy a PC that's probably that's the thing is like that's why I was like oh I'll buy an Xbox One no way actually no I will buy a PC because why would I buy an Xbox One that you're gonna try to sell me a new one later on and I don't understand the point of this new PlayStation system because once again what is it what are they meeting I mean are there people out there going well that PlayStation 4 just doesn't look good enough I'm not buying it no one is saying that nobody is doing that I mean people might be like oh yeah I wish it was 4K well it fucking isn't and you know what it's still not fucking 4K it just outputs upscales to 4K it's not 4K but there's just still not enough content to justify you know 4K like that again other than Netflix and such but that's it like it's just it's like we all said earlier it's just too soon and you know who I pity the most and you know of course this is gonna come from me of course it's the developers the developers who've been so focused on even developing for the PlayStation platform as it is and then to hear now you're getting two different hardware upgrades or options and I remember hearing some point earlier this year that I remember I don't know if it was Game of Sutra or somewhere else were saying that for any new developers on Sony Sony made the developer sign this like exclusivity thing where it's like your games have to be 4K ready as an option like it can't just not have 4K option and you know or something along those lines it was very concerning because as a developer making a game in even 1080 is tough because you know because it's like you know there's so many limitations you know whatever you know as powerful as the consoles are you know we as indie developers only have such a limited amount of budget you know to make a game as pretty as possible I mean you know I mean for God's sake look at what happened to No Man's Sky as pretty as it was you know what I'm saying and the approach that they made with it they have a long way to go but they but they fell big time because of all the crap that they went through and they barely got by on the PC version but look what happened between PC and Playstation 4 all that stuff but my point is that there's there's a cost there's a huge cost to creating 4K textures 1080p textures and of course the people who are playing they're not thinking about that but people like myself that's a huge that's a huge hit on our budget because it's like we budget our games you know hopefully to get it right we hope to get it right and you know let's put our game in 1080p but now we're in 4K and it's so difficult to get 4K textures you know 4K textures implemented properly especially when we've never made you know huge games we don't have the support we don't have the size of a AAA studio and that's the other big problem too like that's where I was concerned with Sony announcing this because it's like how many developers are actually going to utilize that 4K? Can I tinfoil hat something for a minute because no just your line of thinking here kind of made me think of something is it possible that No Man's Sky you know because obviously people have their issues with some of the quality checks and things like that is it possible that No Man's Sky was rushed to market try not to laugh because I realized the game was delayed like five times but was it possible that No Man's Sky had to release now to get around this 4K directive? I think they did but I do think I think where they failed the most is that they they tried to they were trying to create an imagination imaginary world this massive not even world universe they were trying to create this imaginary universe and the procedural generation approach in the on the development side that's a really inexpensive way to create a massive to create a massive world a massive universe because procedural generation it's all in programming it's just all in programming but the problem the problem with them is I think partly you're right about that you know on the on the back end because they're like you know because even with myself with my kinship game kinship when I started kinship kinship was initially going to be on the 360 and then we hear about when they when Microsoft moved to Xbox One and they weren't bringing it wasn't supposed to be backward compatible so anything coming out on Xbox Indie wasn't going to be able to be played because they changed the whole architecture for Xbox One then the Nintendo opportunity came up with you know for Wii U we were like alright great you know you know this is our second chance but now Wii U is dissolving into the nether and now here we are again like well what's going to happen with NX let's see what happens with NX so now we've I've just ultimately decided we're just going to make it for PC and see what happens from that point but you come to the you know it is an extremely frustrating process because you know yeah at some point you know they No Man's Sky was so far in especially with the size of their game if their game was just a regular you know 10 level game you know couple worlds game maybe a six eight hour game they probably would have delayed it again but they were they were in too deep with No Man's Sky and they were like and they knew they didn't want to become and again this is I'm probably putting my tinfoil hat on myself but they probably didn't want to be a star citizen Well I still like No Man's Sky for what it is and you know I stand by my early impressions and review of that game but what I don't like is all of a sudden there's like some massive radio silence coming out of that company like after they patched the PC thing then like you check the Twitter it's like dead like and I realize okay you put out a game that you've been working on for years maybe you need a little vacation but you rotate that vacation so somebody can keep us in the loop of what the hell's going on Not for that kind and that's what I'm saying not for that kind of game they try to be and that's one you know even even when I do my meetups this is why I'm really proud to be to have founded the chapter because that's one of the things we talk about in our different chapter meetup sessions the one thing you don't ever want to do as your first game is make an MMO that's like game development 101 your first game should never be a World of Warcraft you just don't do that unless you're an inheritance baby but even then you still have to know what you're doing It's too much to chew It's huge and you don't have it's not just the skill set because one can have the skill set to make that scale of a game but you have to the one thing you know nerds a lot of nerds and especially developers don't have especially at the start of all this is discipline you need a mental discipline to make that to make a game of that scale and with everything those guys went through with No Man's Sky yeah they they should have they should have brought it out and you know they should have brought it on bits and pieces they would have been so much better off I think they kind of did well well I mean efficiently not just not just sloppy but you know okay well okay let's let's shift a little bit to talking a little more about you and what you're involved with and all this stuff so obviously you are you know founder and such as the Sakai GDA how are things going has there been growth here locally with developers absolutely yeah absolutely I mean we you know the the proof is always in you know our indie arcade event you know we we the I founded the chapter three and a half years ago and the whole point of the chapter founding the chapter was we needed I needed our game our Sacramento game developer group to be taken seriously I was tired of us getting laughed at by by our neighbors why would you laugh because we're Sacramento because we're Sacramento we we we are we are the red-headed stepchild of of California because we're also like if I'm not mistaken we are a top 20 media market right top 25 media market right but it's something something like that but I mean again but she's still on gigabit earn it though yeah but like San Francisco is right next to us sorry our houses are affordable right well yeah they won't be for long no we won't be really because all the Bay Area people are coming here no it's the fucking arena's fault yeah it is the arena's fault and and and you know and that's how you talk like a Sacramento playing everything on that goddamn arena well that's what I do and I'm from New Jersey and I already know better it's like no will the arena make them play better no it won't and and my and and I'm only I'm not going any further with the king's stuff other than in the arena suffer than this statement and I've said it a few times and it's racing my brows and I'm gonna do it again because I don't care my opinion on it is that the Kings the new arena should not have been a bit should not have been built until the Kings won something period so no arena should have been built for an average team period win a championship and then you get then you get a great Christmas gift a newer well to be fair counterpoint they've promised to bring the Monarchs back yeah Monarchs were able to win a champ yeah and God promised me to be six three with six pack sometimes that hasn't happened sometimes you need a woman to get it done well anyway I just showed you receipts right so but so nonetheless like so one of the biggest things was making sure that our game developer group was taken seriously and more importantly we weren't losing great talent you know you know a lot of talent leaving Sacramento to go to all the you know to go to all these different locations and such which I again I respect that you know they want to work you know they want to work for you know insert you know triple big triple A studio here whatever but if we had an opportunity to to create a job market here at SAC and make them be like whoa I don't have to leave home I can stay and not have to worry about paying three thousand dollars a month for a studio in San Francisco if I get lucky and excuse me so we'd like so that the idea was was that you know we have been nurturing and developing this chapter and it has expanded into wonderful proportions I just put out a newsletter last week and on our meetup group we we are over a thousand members now now it is both and I said this in the newsletter it is both a very interesting milestone but it's also a concerning one because we don't see a thousand members at a time ever but we have seen a lot more I will say that in our newest indie arcade oh yeah yeah see the next event that might change but for the moment we'll see what happens but with our most recent indie arcade back in April in West Sacramento you know we had about five hundred fifty attendees which was more than double the other two indie arcades I told you this I told Bree this you guys are sitting on the next big sack gaming con and it's it I would say it's going to happen but it is happening well I'm gonna I'm very proud I'm very proud of this number one I'm very proud of the people that have helped make this happen in the first place you you are part of this you know what I'm saying you guys were a part of this we just showed up and told you no you did more than that thank you so you did more than that with this microphone cord I'm just telling you you've done so much more than that because no no seriously because and because it's not just us our chapters defined by everybody I just host I just host and I try to and I try to be the push for everybody especially this man over here Loki trying to get his shit done you know what I'm saying that's what we do that's what that's that's what we try to do you can find a way for me to get more than four hours of sleep at night which is just I hear sedatives are pretty good but anyway I digress so the idea is is that have you got just quickly have you guys had some games that have that like people might recognize like the downloaded that have come out of Sac IG members oh my god the one I think of I just saw because Monsters and Monocles that guy in Davis that put that together in fact I need to invite him on the show that that just released on the steam early access and I know he was at the arcade event a couple years ago so you're starting to see and they were at PAX they went to PAX West while I was at Dragon Con and I know they had a lot of success there so I mean that's a really great success story and I'm sure you've got more because based on the games I saw at arcade yeah Venture 4th almost Venture 4th is done Venture 4th is done Venture 4th was out and actually I'm actually glad you said that because we're actually doing a meetup later this month in Elk Grove I believe it's in Elk Grove at Elk Grove and Ed at the Innogrove co-working space where we're going to do a Q&A for Skirmish Studios as well as ArcLight for the Venture 4th game and because they did very they both ran recently very successful Kickstarter campaigns and we're going to be talking to them and interviewing them to see why what went right what went wrong and what they could have done better so on and so forth but yeah I mean Monsters and Monocles is definitely one of those games that's done so well and yeah we've had a slew more and in fact we had we had a mystery judge who she used to work at Xbox I don't know if you were there for that but she came through and was like you know I'm going to look around I want to see what's going on but no one knew that someone from that used to work for Xbox she works for a subsidiary of Wargaming and she came through and was like here's you know I'm going to tap you guys and I feel so horrible I cannot remember the name of the game if Bree's in the chat I don't know if she's listening or in the chat right now Was that the one that was like a runner with polarity type of thing like it was black and white? Yes absolutely and I feel so bad we have the studios listening I'm so sorry guys because my mind my mind is just upon the mess Which one? The one that won that prize from the Microsoft developer that was that was really good it was the like you had like a it was like a black and white type of game and then like in the white spots would be the black character that's running through and then the white spots would be the white character I got the demo for that it was like the rabbit and the owl rabbit and the owl that's it yeah they they have been kicking butt they've been doing great they got selected Bree's actually in our chat I just realized she's the anonymous chatter in there she's like screaming at the top of her lungs Thanks Bree Thank you Bree so but again ultimately there's been a ton of growth here and we've started our most recent progressive game jam and a slew of new teams a slew of new faces as well as as well as the veterans that were there last year and the year before that it's been a tremendous tremendous thing and even now with myself I'm proud to say that now I can finally be a part of that with my crumple game coming out within the next month and a half-ish I'm so happy for you I was starting to wonder if your game was kind of like one of Loki's games we were going to see it come out I don't release stuff that's not fun and I am so mentally working on stuff so every day I think about my game and every day you know jot stuff down and I do research every day well maybe that's the problem every day I think about mowing the lawn alright no I don't actually who really does that? that's alright I'm one step ahead of you I just don't water the lawn so it doesn't grow well technically you're obeying the law because we're in California so fuck the lawn so yeah with crumple yeah I announced it maybe even 3-4 weeks ago that crumple's over 90% done now we're working on 90% left now we're working on the actual ending for the first episode since crumple for some who've been keeping close lock on our game crumple's going to be released in episodes and so the first episode is like I mentioned a little over 90% done we're working on the ending to how episode 1 will end it's going to be really pretty intense and we're just putting the final touches of any bugs squashing in the code but yeah we're almost done you wouldn't think a game starring an envelope would be intense but see one thing about me and this is something that this is another reason why I started this chapter because I came in as the idea guy I do not have any art skill I do not have any coding skill but I could tell a story because I've done poetry and I have a wacky imagination the thing with me it's about what's on the inside and that's anthrax let him finish shut up so what happens is you know what's on your inside? pepperoni I don't eat pepperoni it's all garlic and parmesan so what happens is that for me it was you know even if you have the imagination and the idea you can make something beautiful you can make something very intense and I mean I think we've seen I mean you know a lot of games that seem simple on the surface are actually very very intense Limbo which was part inspiration for Crumple comes to mind like okay a 10 year old boy black and white silhouette okay what's why and that game turned out to be incredibly intense and atmospheric so to be able to achieve that on Crumple knowing we were making it on a flash it's like how are we going to pull this off but we've been able to do it and I can't wait when we show the little progression reel of how Crumple started how it looked when it first started as compared to how it looks now with all the sounds and you know the attention to detail I'm excited to play it again I think the last time I played it was almost a year ago at that Reno thing oh my goodness yeah yeah you can actually play the demo now there's been a demo for probably near a year now on Newgrounds and well as a listener of this fine program please tell me where I can get this demo so oh man I did you have something on good old games though I thought or no I'm thinking of the other one Desura so the demo started on Desura went just dissipated into had some problems yes dissipated quietly so yes we'll call it um but yeah we so there's actually a demo on itch itch.io as well but I don't really remember but so it but on Newgrounds and they've been super supportive Newgrounds have actually been retweeting and liking my stuff as well which is pretty cool but on new but I don't have the exact link off the top of my head because it's like numerical so just Newgrounds go on Newgrounds.com on the search type Crumple it'll be the first link you'll see it you don't need to sign up for an account on Newgrounds you can just play it and yeah it's it's not the newest newest version but it it's pretty it's it's generally pretty close to where we're at we've made a number of upgrades and touch-ups since then but you'll still be able to give it a shot there's a link uh just given in our chat room too by Bree for all the listeners yes there you go thank you so much on Newgrounds yep that's yeah that's the link so for those listening on the podcast though you'll have to search for it but it's crumple yeah absolutely and and and I cannot stress this enough I talk about this on my Twitter on the time and for those who are not following me already on Twitter it's at nascent games so please please follow us say hi say what's up but feedback we always need your feedback we need to know what's right what's not so right we need to hear this stuff and and we recommend that for any developer you give feedback to don't be a poo-poo head about it you know be constructive you know give us give us good feedback because um if you this sucks doesn't tell me how to make it yeah this sucks you're never gonna play this again this game is so hard it's not gonna tell me anything it's like okay why we need to understand why so definitely when you play it give us that feedback we we would love to have that feedback um we need it we need the feedback because I don't know a damn thing but I know I know I want to make you want that feedback from the O.L.R. listeners before the rest of the internet we're very we're very fortunate here at O.L.R. that we have some pretty pretty decent minded people in this program thank you decent minded adults or children whichever that's great glad to glad to hear that well a lot of them did start off as children and now we're adults you have to have a little bit of a thick skin to put up a Loki's crap three hours three hours a week I have four sisters man he does not need they know he can do that hasn't already happened uh tell us briefly about kinship what what is kinship where's where's this at kinship right now um it you know just like any almost anything in the game development it has suffered its setbacks um you know both on a technological tech uh tech standpoint you know as well as um who who's able to help and and and you know so on and so forth and it's kinship is um it's funny because kinship initially started as a the original idea with kinship was that it was going to be a fan remake of Gradius 3 and I then I decided no fan remakes I can't be doing that I need to do something original if I'm going to spend three years making something might as well make something new and original you can come up with something Gabriel do something so I did so so here we are now again you know as we talked earlier kinship started as a 360 game you know was becoming what's going to hopefully be a Wii U game that's not going to happen now so now we we look at just PC for the moment and then console wise see what what comes from that um on the I've do you have your 4k textures ready to go hell no 4k you know can whatever so anyway so 4k this so the idea is is that um you know I've involved myself more in the development side I've actually learned how to do environments and build levels out so I'm not I was gonna I was gonna say and I just to back up a little bit I was very blown away when you just said now because I didn't even realize this you said that you didn't code crumple and I always had this thing in my mind that oh you you coded right in there with the best of them but you you're more of like a project manager is kind of what you're doing right you're making you see the plan and you're making sure all the moving parts are doing this but it sounds like you got your hands a little dirtier with kinship you actually got in there and and did some more of the environments yeah I've been developing more of the environments um if you look at it's not it's not a very very recent trailer but well actually no I actually posted a gameplay trailer back in March before the indie arcade event I posted a game our first gameplay trailer on our YouTube channel um youtube.com slash nascent games go there and and look up the stage three for kinship gameplay I actually created that that that it was a space you know just kind of the easiest thing to create first but I did but yeah it was a great place to start and you're gonna get to see get an idea of what kinship looks like how it feels so on and so forth and I I saw Bree's comment about the soundtrack yes uh we have definitely check our soundtrack on Bandcamp we have um a compilation soundtrack um and I just released a demo track on there now um yeah nascent games dot com dot excuse me nascent games dot bandcamp dot com yes definitely thank you so anyway so kinship um kinship is gonna end up I'm working on the next trailer now for kinship uh it's going to be it's gonna become much more personal for me because I've gone through both the technical setbacks as well as the personal setbacks with with with the development of this game when this game comes out it's probably gonna piss off a couple of people who know they were involved with it and were no longer involved with it and there's gonna be messages to them in very subtle subtle ways wait whoa whoa whoa whoa what fucking dynasty unfolding here dynasty in space unfolding here so you're are you wearing dirty laundry here on this project you did so you had people that you were working on this game with that are no longer a part of the project for I'm assuming creative differences is always politically correct yeah those two words but you are you're flat out saying listen listen all y'all I've left I left I left you bitches some messages in my game yeah the idea here yeah you're like the fucking Taylor Swift of video games I I hopefully don't want to go that way yeah snake game some more like a solid snake a sneaky snake fuck you so any good thank you good so here's so here's my whole thing with with that I don't I I I'm always grateful for both the good and the bad experiences whatever whatever we go through the one thing I mean we've seen it happen to so many game developers you know especially those who kind of kind of had their hands you know just by themselves and then they decide to sneak one more person in you know and I mean we won't you know I'm sure we can all we can all think of immediately who who we think of when I when I say that um you know uh anyway so nonetheless it's like we think about what we think about what happened you know what happened with those challenges with me it's not it with me it was more you it was a couple of things you had you had those who had the drive but didn't you know they they had the drive but their ego got in the way but then you had those who you know who were very humble but not not at all confident in their skill set and it affects you during your game development and after a while you know you try to you try to empower them there's one thing I learned very early on with this is that because I don't know anything about development you know I had to make sure I came at this from a very from you know from a very reasonable point of view and very empowering point of view and you know this year you know and I've run into the issue a few times I mean you know to the point where someone and this was very early on in development not recently but to the point where someone actually sat down with me and asked me to make them the producer of my game they asked me to make them a producer of my game and they hadn't actually made anything for me yet and they hadn't even graduated school yet I said why would I make you that why would I make you that at all because they were like well I need to have that on my resume I'm like no you need to earn it and we run into those egos and that's part of the biggest problem one of the biggest problems with this is that you know we you know I run into those things and I'm left speechless like what the hell do I how do I even respond to this sort of thing so for me you know it became and it's very frustrating because it's like again with the ton of other setbacks that I already had you know now that becomes you don't want to take it personal but it's like I don't share my story with why I'm making my games to just anybody you know unless I'm selling you the game and you want to understand why but if I'm asking you to help me make this game and I share my story it's for real and to just kind of for those things to happen is a big slap in the face but I don't vent about that sort of thing online I'm not typing multiple messages online or anything like that here us as friends we talk about that because and it's something I share with the people in my chapter too when we talk about that it's you know it's a thing was you have to be ready for that you're going to come across people like that and you have to know how to handle yourself when something like that happens that's part of life and also part of business is that there's going to be people that you have unfortunate you know run-ins with and circumstances with and you you know you learn from every experience so what I'm understanding here is I'm going to be the executive producer on this game that's fantastic but what I but what I do like about this and you know well I mean not that this story is unfortunate and everything but what I do like about what you know you're talking about with the story and how you were not really coding for crumple but you got in there a little more with kinship and I think this is a very very very important point that we don't always talk about but it does seem to come up whenever you or Brie are on the show and it's it's definitely worth repeating is that you don't necessarily have to be a and I'm gonna use my quote-y fingers code monkey right to get and no offense to the code monkeys of the world we wouldn't have gaming for y'all but here's the and it's a great Jonathan Colton song it is however however you don't necessarily have to already know unity you don't know uh c++ you don't have to know visual game makers on sale this week you don't have to know one dollar in order to make a game because sometimes the key part to making a game is networking with the right people that you want to make a game with but then that turns into a family and sometimes you get family problems right game development is all about chemistry no matter no no coding no coding skill no art skill no animation skill no 3d modeling skill or two or you know 2d or 2d our art assets go describing me right now none of that is gonna matter if you don't have the chemistry with your people and you know and that has to come from both ends and and and with that chemistry has to come accountability and part of the issue um with my with my past uh with the past issues I've run into has mainly been between you know the the just filthy arrogance and the and the filthy lack of accountability because it's you know you you know I myself start questioning my own capabilities on what what I can what I've been doing and the impact I've been leaving with both the community and my own games and it took me long it took me so long to finally decide what part of game development was I gonna do because I tried to get into animation back in the late 90s you know or mid 90s when when Donkey Kong Country came out on the Super Nintendo how inspired I was to like oh my god I want to do this seeing what they did to make that silicone graphics was my friend I wanted them I wanted to marry them and but as I got doesn't right well of course indeed but the idea was is that I as I learned more and more about animation what it took I like I can't draw so for the next 15 years I gave up on myself and just went with a regular life and I was part of the sheep and just worked and then and put my dreams aside and now here I am at this point where I'm so close now and I've got crumple coming out and and I turned 40 at the end of November and November 28th that crumple is going to be out through hell or high water before I turn 40 and and I'm telling you with all these things that I've gone through that you know that's why it's like we learn from this we chalk it up to the experience and when we put the credits when the when kinship finally is done and we put those credits up and in that special thanks section you know how you see the special thanks and all these different the special thanks are going to be to all those people who didn't do an effing thing for me and I can't wait I can't wait but it's also going to be mixed with the good people who were supportive and all that stuff but it's going to be a great guessing game because it's going to be like wow wow which one of them really pissed him off and which one actually supported him you'll never know and it's a beautiful thing so but anyway all that aside so I don't know how to follow that up but I'm excited to play that game and kinship which will be out so come hell or high water before your 40th birthday what's interesting in hearing you talk and say all that story is it was so funny to me in a way not funny haha but ironic is you could just replace like everything you said with radio and hey it's me because that's what I went to college to do was to do radio well originally it started that originally originally it started I was going to be a weatherman so was when I was a little kid when the weather channel came out oh my god I was so obsessed with that so you're not alone can you imagine Rob Roberts with the weather so there was and then I actually I did broadcast journalism I actually interned at a television station in the town where I went to school and I learned about how fucking miserable everybody was there and I started to realize like I don't know if this is really for me and then you start to get into radio and this was right when the internet was starting to boom and all this other stuff and there's this very like ho-hum attitude in radio and it's like you know you can work your way you can work and work and work and work all these hours but if you don't suck the right dick you're just not going to get anywhere with radio and I'm just kind of like I don't know if this is I don't know if this is the life I son of but here we are Bree who's big in radio now in TV she could totally tell you all you just got called out Rob Roberts Roker that's what he put you know and I have mad respect for people like Bree who stayed in that industry and have really worked on that from the inside for me I was like eh I'm going to just go work a temp job and see what I can do with my life and figure this out another way and started radio as a fun little thing on the side and shit here we are I'm going to be turning 40 in a couple years and we got some podcasts but I love it you know I've been able to do all this on my terms Absolutely and no one can ever take that away from you and that is the same thing with game development and that's the same thing that I have to tell myself everyday and that's the same thing I have to tell other people like this is going to probably be the one and only platform that I'm going to share kind of the more personal stuff that I kind of did here no one's ever going to hear this again because I got to keep going forward but I think this was healthy for me because I haven't really been able to share this because I'm glad we can be your psychological outlet you like how we have a couch here in the studio? I just, I'm not, should I put my feet up? If you want, make some home Put my feet up and lay back, that's just awesome Definitely, so thank you for that by the way I just feel a little weird that you talk about some of those difficulties and we follow that up with, hey but you should all try to get into game development No they have to be ready for that you have to be ready for the good and bad And that is life, you could be involved in sports, you could be involved in podcasting you could be involved, and there's going to be people that are great, that you work with great like Loki and Dark Soccer and there's going to be people in your life that you don't work with so well, greatly and that's just going to happen although honestly, like I don't want to I've made it sound shady like everybody's going to go try to figure out who does Rob Roberts not work well with, actually I've been pretty fortunate in the podcasting thing that everybody's been pretty decent, so I can't Yeah and I've had my, again I've had dealing with my bad eggs and you know it's good, the important thing is that I can complain about that and this is why I don't really ever talk about it, this way today was kind of the exception and I'm happy I was able to but once it happens I chalk it up to the experience and I just simply ask myself who am I not going to, what type of personality am I not going to deal with going ahead because they're not going to stop me from going forward in what I've got to do I've got a game to make and I've got games to release and I've got people waiting to play my game and no one is going to remove that dream of mine because I I'm the only one in control of that whether I decide to stop it or not and I'm not because as I said I did that for 20 years and that's not happening again so and I've got a community rooting me on waiting for me to get this done so, like you guys so hell yeah Well that's one of the most raw interviews we've probably had here on Orange Lawn Radio but I, no I appreciate it I love it, you know I appreciate it more, man If people want to get involved with making games, you know, again, and we just want to emphasize, you know, even though Gabe's talking about some dramatic experiences that he's had, you're going to get that with anything and you have to be prepared for it but there's a lot of great rewards I've gotten great rewards from podcasting you've gotten great rewards from making games and the best is yet to come when these things actually release, so keep an eye out at Nascent Games on Twitter and websites, nascentgames.net, right? nascentgames.net, that's our new website you can actually see the most up-to-date crumple gameplay trailer first thing on the video there, there's a lot more I'm going to be doing to that website I had to revamp it from the ground up but it's nice for what it is right now at the time, for the time being our YouTube, we're going to be posting more on that soon youtube.com slash nascentgames our Bandcamp where again, we have a compilation album right now to hear the different music tracks that we're making for the couple different games we're working on nascentgames.bandcamp.com I also posted a new demo track for our Kinship game it's free, so be sure to, I just posted I think a week or so ago, so be sure to have a listen to that, it's a demo track, but it's a good track, so be able to, be sure to catch that and then we're on Twitch, and we're actually going to be doing an extra livestream on this Tuesday at the Cafe Colonial we're going to be doing a livestream for Extra Life on Bioshock the Bioshock collection which comes out on Tuesday I'll be jamming out to Bioshock 1 because I love the hell out of that game and so that's how we're going to be repping the community a bit this Tuesday, I don't know if I'll be able to beat the whole game oh I will, I definitely will I don't know if I'm going to be able to beat all of Part 1 in one sitting on Tuesday, I'm going to try but yeah twitch.com slash nassongames and the Extra Life Brie if you have, thank you Brie if you find if you get the link for the yeah, because we're part of the Sac Indie Arcade team, because we have a team on Extra Life for Sac Indie Arcade and I'm one of the people for that I don't know if she'll be able to pull that up but if you're in the chat be sure to keep an eye on that but otherwise, yeah, so those are all my links two other quick questions and I've really got to move on with the show because we're running a little long, but that's okay so one, I'm sitting here, I'm passionate about games, I want to get involved with games hearing this has made me realize I don't necessarily have to know code to get involved with games, I need to meet people at my local IGDA how do I find them? So our meetup group, meetup.com slash game developer it is as easy as that, is that good anywhere in the world? Yeah, yeah, anywhere in the world but yeah, meetup.com slash game developer that's our chapters meetup group, be sure to check us out there there's other links for our Facebook, our Instagram and so on and so forth but definitely go there and yes, you the two things I ask for if you're going to come talk to us you need to be in this for the love of the development I don't need you walking up in my group saying I've got this great money making idea because I've had a few people do that I've happily showed them the door like don't come back because this is not why we're doing this, we hope to make money but that's not why I need you here we're trying to create a job market right now and if that's how you're going to be I can't have that right now I'm laughing because again the parallels to my own world are just uncanny. Yeah, it's crazy it's crazy stuff but I mean and yes, the extra life link oh man, I can't even follow that so yeah, sorry, if you're in the chat yeah, so extralife.org or .org. Does that game developer meet up, is that, like, if I remember our audience is all over the world let's say I've got somebody in New York City we have a few listeners there that wants to join the New York City IGDA of which I'm sure there's one in every borough, how could they find the IGDA in their area? Yeah, so IGDA.org and there's a section for chapters and there's a ton of chapters go there, check it out and even the, I haven't been there in a while but the chapters list the actual chapter head for each location and yeah, you'll be able to reach out to them. She posted a more friendly link to the Extra Life, so it's www.extra-life.org slash team slash sacindiarcade Yes, thank you. Brie's like our living breathing Rolodex. And thank you Brie because yeah, I know. Bring her with you next time where is she? I know she's home Yeah, she's home right now, but you know with her work schedule too, she works so much earlier but yeah, Brie I saw what you said, I know even though you're not here but yes, thank you, you're still helping me out but yeah, that's ultimately it just come with the drive and come with a genuine attitude that you're ready to make a difference and show others what you know because we're all about sharing knowledge if you come with that arrogant attitude, I'm gonna wipe the floor with you and I'm gonna I will ruin your day I will be the original ending in Mass Effect 3 and destroy many people's lives you're gonna wish for an alternative Let's focus on the positive Yeah, and unlike We're gonna make a game I'm gonna put you in a fucking special thanks So definitely come through with a great attitude, you know, even if you're shy I prefer shyness over nasty arrogant crap, we don't have time for all that, so yeah, so definitely come through and check us out and I have to say someone says something really really quick then god, I don't want to take up too much time on this one, someone says, oh, Dungeon Buster, he made the quote, we're here to make games not massage egos, thank you that's it, that's precisely it that's precisely it That's precisely it You want to be part of a team Yeah, or even feel that if you still want to be a solo act in your game development, that you want to be empowered, we talked about the feedback thing earlier, you have to be prepared for all this sort of thing, so we have to be supportive and give each other that constructive criticism, but we're here to empower each other, not push each other aside, so absolutely Alright, one last thing before we move on with the rest of our show Any teases for next year's indie arcade event? So, we will 99% sure be back at the West Sac Community Center there is that 1% opportunity I can't say yet because it's still early in discussion My brain says you're going to outgrow that place by next year Some people have said we've already outgrown the West Sac place, and it's like, wait, it's only our first time They could have used the second floor, there's still more room on the second floor they could have grown into so I don't think you've quite filled that space entirely, but I am worried for you guys that you're growing which is good, that's great It's a great problem to have, and yeah it's going to be interesting what happens for the next one, we already have our keynote speaker, she was so you remember Michelle Michelle the last speaker she was on the team that made Evolve, right? Evolve and making Mafia 3 Michelle Smith from 2K Games she's going to be our keynote she was phenomenal, and she's a Sacramento native, and there's no other person I would ask to be our keynote for this upcoming thing, so she's going to be our keynote we're planning a number of other things I will tease I think I'm okay to say this because it might happen but we incorporated the board game aspect which had a great response for the board game board game developers, we are planning to incorporate pinball for our next one so stay tuned Okay, I like that tease, that's good by the way, if we want to talk about panels maybe we want to get involved this year I would love, it would be an honor to have you guys as a panel please, be awesome no pressure I was going to ask y'all anyway we'll be there with bells on no matter what yes sir let's move on, we've got plenty of news we've got to cover, but of course we have to talk about our gaming weeks, I was in DragonCon last week, which is why we didn't have a show I've got to talk a little bit about that let's get into our gaming weeks, we'll try to quickly move through this, but we'll see Loki, how was your gaming week? I wish I played a lot of stuff, but I didn't I did stick with my I'm not playing Tatami Katamari because it erased my progress so I didn't, instead I played Non-Stop Night which is yet another mobile game thankfully though, this is not a clicker game because there's nothing you really click, except for, you know, special abilities every now and then, it's more of a clicker game without the clicking, if that makes sense and it's much more simplified, and it actually is kind of fun, because it is very easy to cheat in, so that that's what I've it's honestly though, the cheating at this point, I'm like so high level that it doesn't affect anything but it's kind of neat there's a little bit of strategy to it so there's kind of that but it's a good time waster so I'm playing that, I played a little bit of Ingress, not much Pokemon Go, and more stories later, but I may not be playing much Pokemon Go because I'm not too happy with Niantic right now Alright Hey Gabe, do you play games besides just making them, what have you been playing? Yeah, I've been I've been I've been dabbling more again, and I seem to talk about this every time I'm on this show my Earth Defense 4 is 4.1 because they just announced unofficially part 5 is coming out, which I expected to be a thing and that's great, so I've been rocking that on my PS4, I've been playing Horizon 2 Forza Horizon 2 again because the Horizon 3 demo came out today, so Yes, the demo came out, and the only reason I know what you're going to be doing, Lee I thought it was still in that soon area Well, here's the thing, the only reason I knew is because Microsoft sent me a code for the Halo vehicle, the Warthog They sent me a code that you could drive the Warthog in Forza Horizon 3 It's insanity, so when I redeemed the code, it took me to the page that said, okay, you'll be able to use this here and here but in the description it said, this vehicle will be applicable for Forza Horizon 3 and all these different versions that they mentioned and it said the different editions, and then at the bottom it said a demo, I said, bullshit what demo, so I clicked further, and it said demo coming out September 11th, I heard when it was coming and I realized it was today, nice Yeah, this evening, so I've been playing that, and then I've actually been, funny enough I started playing again, DuckTales Remastered I was playing that again because I got stuck on the very very last level, I just decided to start over and then I've been playing Chrono Trigger on my Super Nintendo and it's probably one of the best decisions I've ever made, because God help me that game, whoo, yeah so that's what I've been rocking out Look at you, going from new stuff to old school love it, my gaming week speaking of new stuff, okay, so I spent the weekend at Dragon Con, which is why I wasn't here which, by the way, I just want to give a quick shout out to Dragon Con and the people that I met there, had a great time on the podcasting track, we did end up doing a panel after all, on Sunday about social media and had a really good time, and yeah, it was just, we have presented the Parsec Awards, which was great, because yet again, they gave us the spot right at the very end next to last so it's really something to be on the stage right before Richard Garriott, aka Lord British who like, made Ultima, which is a series, you know, that I grew up with, it's just an honor to be in his presence and so forth and you know, all the great talent that goes with podcasting and all that so just, you know, my hat's off to everything involved there and Dragon Con this year, you know that is not usually an event that's big on gaming, you know, Dragon Con has always been big on other types of fandom, be it sci-fi Dungeons and Dragons board gaming you know, but I was always told ever since the first year I went, don't expect a big video gaming presence, but I gotta say this year, they started to step it up quite a bit, and I think this is because of a partnership they have with MomoCon, which also happens in Atlanta there's some type of strategic partnership thing going on there so this year, they had Tokyo Attack there, who actually had a 24-7 arcade running of Japanese import video games so I was playing Papa Music over and over and over again, it was fun they had Ubeat like six machines, I finally got to play a re-rave machine for the first time so if Kyle's still out there somewhere, I finally finally played a re-rave machine for the first time, so yeah, that was just that was an awesome addition to Dragon Con did you meet dragons though? there were definitely cosplays of dragons they call Dragon Con the Super Bowl of cosplay, and for good reason there was some really just elaborate stuff that happens there so yeah, I had a great time, there was also a classic gaming arcade that was set up in the dealer hall that wasn't 24 hour, but it was still nice to see I got to play a Mortal Kombat 2 machine, which I have in a long time, and I still remember how to chop somebody's head off with Katana, and that felt really good that's awesome, where you can remember and not have to pull it up on your game FAQs, hell yeah I actually got to beat some rando guy, we were playing Mortal Kombat, I think he was Johnny Cage and I was Katana, and I remembered block block block block block, high kick, and bye bye, chopped off the head I still remember that for scorpion, so kudos to you man, that was great alright, and let's see JD in chat says, what do you think of the what did you think of the re-raves guy, they have one at Sunnyvale Golf Land by the way I mean, if you've played the iPhone game which, if you're a fan of music games, you really ought to have by now, if you haven't friendly reminder to try it, because yeah, it's a great little touch game, and you know, it just felt like that, but on a much larger touch screen, because this thing is huge it's the size of a large television but it's a touch pad, and so for that it makes it almost harder for your eyes to get a sense of what all is on the play field at once, but I'd like to touch the big button, I like to touch the big screen and touch it, it's fun so yeah, I enjoyed it let's see, okay, so also at DragonCon, so Bobby you know, he does a lot with VR and AR and all that development so our pal Bobby Blackwolf was there and we had for the first time this year what we were calling the VoG Suite because we actually had a suite at one of the host hotels, and so Bobby brought his toys and we all got to try them so for the first time ever I got to try the Vive, the HTC Vive and I got to see some demos and that that was cool, I mean I was a fan of VR since I checked out Oculus Rift for the first time, so it was just cool to see some of the stuff in that, I watched other people play Job Simulator, which was cracking me up, we were laughing until three in the morning playing Job Simulator and I really like the Angry Birds type thing they had, but it was all Portal characters, which I think is a game called The Lab that has, it's like Valve's, you know, kind of VR playground game, a la Wii Sports sort of thing, so that was cool to see, but I was really all about because I got to try for the first time HoloLens because he actually has a HoloLens dev kit so for the first time I got to try HoloLens and the game that he had me play on HoloLens was called Fragments and it's pretty fucking cool, like I'm smiling because one of our developers actually has lent me the HoloLens because he got it, he got it as part of the pre-order That's not a cheap blend by the way, I was told how much those things cost and yes Your life It cost you your life Well here's the thing, so the HoloLens, you configure it and it actually scans the room, so it knows where couches are, it knows where tables are it knows where things are, so this game Fragments is like a crime scene type game, so it's like a frozen moment in time of a crime scene of a kidnapping basically, I'm not going to spoil too much but it's like a kidnapping basically, and so you look, what you're trying to do is determine where are they, because you can see the kid and the kidnapper and you're trying to determine where do you send the cops, so you're investigating things in the room and suddenly you might look at the wall and oh there's a brick sticking out of the wall so you actually pick up the brick and turn it around and you might see that it's N-O something so it's New Orleans is where you're supposed to go, type of thing is N-O or you might find that lying on the couch is a ticket for the ferry or something so you actually kind of have to look around the room looking for things, and you even look up at the ceiling and you can see that it's raining so you know that the scene is happening somewhere in the US right now or it's raining, so there's little clues like that that you have to put together, so I thought that that was really cool, that was like playing like a 90's adventure game, but instead of clicking on things that are in the scene, you're looking around you at the scene and actually touching them and interacting with them, and I just thought that was such a neat, that was such a cool use, and then when you're actually watching the cutscenes, here's the crazy shit, so since it scanned the room already you'll be watching like the chief and her two assistants or whatever, they're all talking and having conversation, one of them will be sitting on your couch and then suddenly stand up as part of the scene and stuff, it's like, okay so like it knew that you had a couch because it put this character on the couch and so I just thought that was so rad, how like it actually used the room so I would, now here's the thing, the one drawback to Hololens is that the field of vision very very small, it's like sitting right in front of a big screen TV type of thing, and so you, you know, it's very obvious where the holographic stuff begins and where it ends so I don't think it's ready for primetime so to speak? Oh definitely not, the plan with the Hololens was gonna be that, and this is why they released it now, and the release is not because the idea is that for the next probably three years, three or so years, we're gonna be, we're supposed to us as developers are supposed to get completely comfortable with the Hololens, and the goal right now from what I've learned again, this will obviously change it's to be earlier or later, but 2019 is supposed to be the year that the first actual full on games for the commercial or consumer version of the Hololens is supposed to be for 2019 at some point, so I'm not totally, you know, the experience I played was neat, I don't know what other types of games are gonna be doable on this, I mean it's I already have one I'm gonna make for it, so yeah it's, you have to think about games differently, I think in order to make for the Hololens, and you know, Bobby's had this conversation about, well he sees it more as something that's gonna benefit in non-gaming types of areas just like Kinect kinda had some of its biggest successes in hospitals and things like that, you know, things that had nothing to do with games, and Hololens may end up being very similar, and that may be true but I think there's going to be some great gaming experiences in this thing, and I think you're right, by them getting it out so early at least, people can really think about, you know, have plenty of time to consider what's that game gonna look like, but I gotta say I kinda, like everything I had heard about Hololens was pretty tepid, because I think they were showing things, like here's the Halo experience and everybody's too focused on, well you can't see, I mean the field of vision sucks da da da da, but this concept for this game that I saw was like okay, this shows me something that you can't, you can't even do this in VR Right, no you can't, right, absolutely and definitely sells the difference between here's the difference between holographic gaming and virtual reality, so I thought that was just, I thought it was neat. Absolutely, and I saw the I see the Hololens as a great, just like VR, I see the Hololens as a great supplemental piece for game development and gaming, not so much primary, which I think that's what a lot of people are quick, so quickly impulsively jumping to, it's like, oh this is going to be the next great gaming experience, I know, I think it's going to be a good supplemental gaming experience, as an as an add-on, but it, you know Virtual Boy tried, and we already saw what happened with that, so just don't just don't do that. We've come a long way since then. We've come a long way since then, yeah. Quickly, I want to talk about some other games I've played this week Overwatch is having a free weekend on PlayStation 4, so I finally got to play with some of my pals, like Exeter and Flaco Jones on PlayStation Xbox also. It is so, yeah, it is on Xbox One, it is so fucking hard to play on a controller when you've been playing on keyboard and mouse for so long, like it's just, it feels weird, especially playing something like Pharah, where I'm used to using the right mouse button to levitate, like now in this, it's like, okay, I have to use L1 to fly up, and then L2 to levitate, it's just, it took me a long time to get used to, and my aim still feels ridiculous, but, you know playing with friends has been fun. Am I going to double dip the $50 to buy it again? No, I'm sorry to my friends on console, which is, I can't justify that. And I think it's just, it's a little ridiculous that Blizzard knows it's me. No, because I tied my battle tag to it a long time ago with Diablo or something, which I guess I did kind of double dip on, but in my defense, the PC version had been free with World of Warcraft, so. So, but I'm not going to double dip on Overwatch. If they knock the price down to 20 bucks, maybe, but it's Blizzard, that's not going to happen for a good long time. But it was still fun to check out. Speaking of World of Warcraft, I've been playing Legion now that I'm back from Dragon Con. Hey, the new expansion, pretty darn good, I gotta say. And it brought back, I think, 3 million new people because of that expansion. You know, it's very interesting how they've really taken out a lot of the, you go to this zone to do these levels, and you go to this zone to do these levels, and they've kind of taken more of an approach of, nah, everything scales. Everything scales until you get to 110, so you do things in the order that you want to do for the story. And that alone is really, I don't know, it's just really changed a lot of the feel of the game, and it kind of gets you more into the quests and, you know, the dungeons really feel now more like an end piece to a storyline in a zone. It's just, it's very, very interesting the way they've done it. I'm into it. But isn't that, and maybe this is a dumb question, I apologize if this almost sounds ignorant, but isn't that the point? Isn't that, wasn't that what they should, what is, I don't, again, I don't know what, how it was initially, because I haven't touched, I've played, I've played two hours of WoW at the start, and that was, I couldn't do it anymore. No, because you would kind of feel this pressure to just, you know, you know, fuck how you get there, you just need to get to the max level as fast as you can. So once you're ready to go to a new zone, you just kind of stop where you're at and you go to that next zone. That's been a lot of how you've been playing MMOs in general till today. This one kind of stops, says, you know what, there's no, you just do whatever you want and everything's going to scale. And so it's really kind of changed the game in that regard. Interesting, that's nice. So I just, if you haven't played WoW in a little while, Legion's kind of worth checking out. I gotta say, I've been enjoying it. I've enjoyed it more than Draenor for sure. Pandaria, I think it's probably a better expansion than Pandaria, probably a better expansion than Cataclysm. It's a little early to say for sure, because I need to play more of it and see what the end game looks like, and more importantly what the support looks like. But I'm very encouraged, I'm very encouraged that they're already talking about 7.1. That's very encouraging, that Blizzard may be remedying what was their weakest point. Still trying to play Final Fantasy 14 though, even with WoW, because Final Fantasy 14 had an anniversary event going on and I had to check that out. So, I'm a little MMO'd out almost, but never, never. Okay, one more thing I gotta talk about. Luminous is out on iPhone. So, do you remember last week, or two weeks ago we talked about Luminous and we were like, oh it's new portrait mode, and we're like, no, that can't, that's not the orientation. No, it is. Portrait mode is the new orientation. You now play vertically with Luminous, which was kind of weird to see at first. It works, but oh, and Luminous on mobile phones has Shinen. They've got the classic pack that has all the old school songs, very, very cool. Here's the biggest problem with Luminous, it's on a touch phone. That's the biggest problem with Luminous, because again, the direction, the left-right movements and down to move the piece down a touch, it's just not responsive enough. And I need to remind myself, any time that I think a console experience is gonna make for a good iPhone experience, it's not. If it's just gonna be a port or vice versa, which y'all are gonna try to get me in a few minutes here when we talk about one of the big stories of the week from me just saying that, but there's a big difference between porting something that was originally on consoles and designing something with the mobile space in mind. So, that being said, I still think if you're a fan of Luminous, it's what, three bucks? It's worth checking out. It's far better than the one they put out years ago when I think the 4 was the iPhone that was going around. It's far better and more responsive than that, but from a precision standpoint, I just think if you're good at Luminous and you need the precision that comes with being good, you're gonna get really fucking frustrated that it's touch controls. But Shinen, that song rocks! That's a good call. That's a good call on that. So yeah, good look on that. So there you go. That was my gaming week. Some quick announcements, then we gotta get into the news. I gotta plug GamerX4. We're gonna be there. We're gonna be at GamerX4 at a table in like three weeks. I can't believe it's coming up that soon, but VOG Network will be there at a table. Myself, Dark Sakura, Shane now telling me he might go, so that's pretty cool. And a panel Sunday, 2 o'clock, the Indie Gamer Super Show with myself, Dark Sakura, Captain Spike from Gameboi.org, and whoever else we pull onto our thing at the last minute. Oh, congrats, man. That's gonna be fun. Wonderful. I'm very excited. Are you going? Because I know IGDA has a presence this year. I've heard bits and pieces a bit about it, but I don't know. I tried to myself get a table for NASA games, but budget-wise, it was out of my budget at the time. So I mean, I don't know too much about that. I know there's been a little more talk about the MagWest thing, because apparently MagWest is doing, they're having a gathering later this month in San Jose. I think they're doing the arcade portion of whatever's going on at GamerX too, so I think the early scenes. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. Which, by the way, I don't know, since I haven't seen you in a little while, I already have my hotel and tickets for MagFest 2017, just so you know. Nice. I'm gonna be there. I don't know if you're going back, but I'm hoping they'll go back. I've reconnected with them recently, so we're hoping. Good. Good. Sounds good. Alright, and then the DragonCon Super Show. So we did have a new show on VoG last week. We actually taped in the VoG suite. We did a special show with hosts from this show, Bobby Blackwolf, Pod Culture, British Invaders, Critical Myth. I'm leaving somebody out, and I'm gonna hate myself for it later, but people came together from all those shows, and we did this Super Show that's gonna be available. Here's the thing, since it wasn't really something to it's not gonna be on the podcast feed, it's gonna be on YouTube. So Bobby's putting that all together right now, putting on the B-roll in. I don't know when, but it will be on YouTube for you guys. Yeah, I know, we're trying to get our trying to warm up to that a little more. Do it! I've been only pushing you since the day I met you. I thought I said British Invaders. Did I not say British Invaders? You said British Invaders. I thought I did. That's what Brad from Pod Culture said. So anyway, hopefully I didn't leave anybody out, but yeah, we did a fun little show there. And that's probably a tradition we'll continue next year. We'll see. Okay, we gotta get to some gamer news. We're only what, an hour and a half into the show? Let's get to some news. Loki. So Apple had their conference where they talked about the new phone and everything, but one of the announcements that they had which was kind of odd was Nintendo was there. It was like, what the fuck? Why is Nintendo here? And so they had some game announcements. The first one is Super Mario Run, which is going to be coming to iOS first. It's a mobile game of Endless Runner, if you will, where you're Mario and you jump on platforms and... Or you could just play New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii U and have a better experience. Anyway, I'm done. I don't know. I'm not so ready to write it off because one of Nintendo's biggest strengths, always has been, always will be, is level design. And so even though we're calling this an Endless Runner, it's not really endless because it looks like there's definitely these setup stages and so forth and it just looks like the way things are set up there's going to be a definite, you know, there's the obvious path and then there'll be the path that includes all the red coins and all that other fun stuff. And so I just feel like there'll probably be more depth to this than your typical quote-unquote Endless Runner. So I'm curious, I want to know what the price is going to be. That's the big thing for me. Is this going to be a $3 game? If so, fuck yeah. It's going to have in-app purchases though. Or is, no it's not. They've, they've come, well, they wrote that off. It's a free demo and the in-app purchase is the game. That's it. Yeah, they wrote off the in-app purchase thing. They say we're not going to do that. That's what the description said. Yeah, no, the description says that because the game will be the one level demo and then the in-app purchase is the rest of it. Which a lot of other games do. Yeah. But here's, you know, could it be a $20 game? Because honest, honestly, Nintendo could get away with it. No. Square Enix does. Yeah, and that's funny. You said that I was going to actually, I was going to say they pulled it off they did it with Final Fantasy. Yeah. And everybody loves Square Enix for that. Be prepared. I think they're going to charge $19.99 for it. I think they will. I think they're going to be that bold. My hope is $9.99 but I fear you might be right but I hope $9.99. Yeah. Well that's good. They can charge rid of the fuck they want for it. I'll still buy it. I will. Part of the problem. I will. I don't, I just, I know it's going to be solid. Part of the problem, man. I know. I know. However, other things that were kind of in little footnotes there, they're going to have a Fire Emblem game and Animal Crossing. Animal Crossing. Well that's going to do pretty well. Well actually those games though, even though they talked about those games, those games are supposed to be out I believe by this holiday. Yeah. And they just, they suddenly put in there that Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing are now going to be coming out before the end of March 2017. So those games quietly getting delayed in favor of Super Mario. Will mobile games be for the NX? Could be. Well, who knows? I think there's going to be, I made I made a, I don't like, I hate speculation but I had to have a little fun with it anyway. I think there's going to be I think whatever the NX is going to be is going to have a straight up tie into why they're releasing the games on the iPhone. I think they're going to try to pull almost and please forgive me for those who, please forgive me guys, but I almost smell the same approach that Ouya did where the next console is going to be, yeah you can play it on our console you know, but you'll also be able to download it here and play it here and there will be some maybe crossplay or something like that. Yeah, it kind of vomited in my mouth a little bit when you said that. That's why I apologize in advance but I'm just saying because like just these announcements are really really weird. I gotta say, the Mario thing, it did throw me for a loop a little bit. I wasn't yep, props to Apple, props to Nintendo. I wasn't expecting that. Sorry Black Wolf I see you're here. It was courageous of them to put it on the platform. Yeah it was, yeah. Well just so you know though, they did say it's coming to Android as well. So you're not going to get left in the cold if you're on Android. Thank God. It's just iPhone first or something like that, right? Who cares? But then that raises the question about what happens with the next DS. That's what I want to know. That's why this surprised me because I was like well wait, hold hold up, hold up. If the NX is going to be portable then why is suddenly Nintendo going third party on another platform and all of a sudden all this endless ocean of wank that we have on Twitter about Nintendo should put Super Mario on the PlayStation 4. It's like shut up, that's never going to happen but it's like it kind of just fucking did this week. If you ever write a book you need to call it that. My endless ocean of wank. I thought that's what I tell the boys on Grindr. But we already had a similar title for that. Remember it was like pissing in an ocean of piss or something like that. That's right. That'll be the OLR documentary or the Behind the Music on the Making of Kinship. Anyway, no. If they ever did a documentary on the making of kinship you know it's going to be called Special Thanks. Word up. You heard that fools. Now here's the thing. They made it very clear it's not a traditional Mario game because Mario is obviously doing the endless running thing. You don't have to do the left and right controls. Having played Luminous let me tell you it's not going to fucking work and I'm glad they don't have Mario going left and right and all that. This is how you make it work. You have one button. This game is played with one button. Touch. Touch. Touch. Touch. That's how the game works. That's it. So if you want a more in-depth Mario experience you're going to have to go to the NX. But at the same time hasn't Nintendo told us that 2D Mario is kind of like Mario Maker was kind of the swong song for 2D Mario. Here comes your encore during the week we were off. They're doing new Super Mario Brothers games which are basically 2D Mario games. They look dumb. They're not 2D. Seriously. Fucking get the Rayman team on a 2D Mario game or any Zelda title. Hand drawn, hand painted Mario game. I'm sorry. They did that already. They had Wario Land shake. Which was fantastic looking. Just no one played it. I put up a tweet a couple days ago about I know we'll talk later about this with Interplay and them selling their assets. And all I said was Earthworm Jim Ubisoft Rayman Origins Legends team. That's what I need to see. So yeah. That's what I want to see. But I hope you're wrong though. I hope the Mario Maker is not the swong song because I really would love to see you know those type of graphics again. But yeah. Let me go to some chat comments over at live.vognetwork.com Ranma in our chat says iPhone users can lose their shit over Super Mario Run but us Android users still have our headphone jacks. Oh yes. Here's the thing you Android users get with your Note 7s. When you beat Super Mario Run and the fireworks go off at the end of the stage, your phone also blows up. That's what you get as a Note 7 user. Well that's alright you know because at least we don't have one of those iPhones that you can bend in half like a cracker. I thought that joke is so 2014. Come on. We're past the bendable iPhone. Like those stupid 3.5mm phone jacks or audio jacks. Here's my thing. I'm actually I have upgraded iPhone every time I'm eligible. I'm not going to get an iPhone 7. It actually has nothing to do with the headphone jack thing. It's just okay. It's a new camera. Yeah. Yeah. My 6 My 6 is good enough for now. It takes a better picture. It takes a better selfie. JD in chat says hey maybe they should port Rhythm Tengoku Gold to touchscreen smartphones. I'd be down with that. That would be a good franchise. You know we know that Nintendo was working on several. Well now we know Mario was one of them apparently. For whatever reason they've bumped this to the front of the line. I'm not sure maybe this has to do with Pokemon and the fact that their stock went way up with Pokemon. Namco. I could use some Taiko no Tatujin. All right. Let's move on. Loki what do you have next? Speaking of Pokemon Go right? Yes. Pokemon Go is getting an update. They're updating finally to 0.37 or something. And what it's going to add is the ability for players to turn one of their Pokemon into a buddy. So you can basically when you're walking or driving or whatever they earn candy for the distance that you walk. Also apparently there's a nice little easter egg where if you walk with Pikachu for 10 kilometers he hops on your shoulder. So that's kind of neat. The update will also I guess make it easier to choose smaller Pokemon on the map. Also prevent eggs hatching without animations or something like that. And I want to say that there was something that was supposed to make leveling up easier. Oh and fuck you for if you have a jailbroken or rooted phone like my son does because their fucking app is not supported on that phone despite the fact that it runs just perfectly fine so I had to fucking root it to get it on there. Oh but fuck him because he must be a cheater because that's what they're assuming because they're Niantic and don't want to fucking fix their problems. Instead they're just going to blame everybody that has a rooted phone for fucking cheating. There's already a workaround for it but it's a pain in the fucking ass. And why should I have to you know spend all this effort to play your fucking game that I paid money for as well to you know purchase items because I thought I would kick you some money before making this game. But then here's how you fucking repay me by fucking me over. Well what would you expect from a studio that can't even call its version version one? It has to be 0.3 point I mean what is this? I mean what happened here? Because the game's not fucking finished. It won't ever be done. It's going to be another No Man's Sky. So I mean it's like seriously. That's unfortunate. But you know what? You know what's good though? I'm so glad that they focused their shit on instead of fixing the problems. They've got Pokemon Go coming out for the new fucking iWatch or Apple thing. And oh it looks so fucking fantastic on that tiny little fucking screen. I'm so glad that they could focus their fucking efforts on that. But fuck all you guys. I guess fuck you if you have your own stupid rooted phone. You better fucking buy an iWatch because at least that shit will work. Hey you want to know something fucking funny? You're releasing this stupid Pokemon Go Plus in what literally days now that I'm going to fucking hack the shit out of and there's not a fucking thing you can do about it. But you know go ahead and punish everybody that has a fucking rooted phone because they're the fucking hackers. I don't have a rooted phone and I'm going to hack the shit out of your shit. The following comments are not necessarily of OLR and its affiliates. Okay so here's the thing. They actually counted how many fucks were in that segment in our chat room. 15. That's not enough. So okay I will say this. As cute as the Watch thing looks and if I were into the Apple Watch I'd probably be into the if Jamie were here she'd be raging so hard right now. But if I were into the Apple Watch thing I'd probably be into the Pokemon Go thing because it did look cute you know for what the Watch does. That's awesome. I can take both hands off the steering wheel when I play in the car. Okay that's funny. Okay but it does seem a little bit reductive to the physical Pokemon Go thing that Nintendo's trying to make money off of that's coming out next week. Like I don't fucking need that now if I have an Apple Watch it sure seems like. Well no you still do because you play the Apple Watch one just like you do the actual game. So you actually I think you throw balls and stuff like that. No you still hatch eggs and all that stuff. Yeah you still do all that. Here's the thing is like I mean seriously like like I've heard rumors that one of the other reasons that they may have you know blocked it for rooted people is because they're going to like somehow abuse the device. I'm like dude you don't even need a rooted device. Hello look at okay the way this device works is it indicates any time that you have to push the button. It flashes a light or rumbles. There's electricity going to that light there's electricity going to that rumble motor. You fucking just solder a goddamn wire from that to the switch. Bada bing eight fucking auto hacks your stupid fucking pokey stops and auto catches fucking Pokemon by one fucking wire. He just went sopranos on us. I'm with William Murderface in our chat. Loki dropped out of rant space. Someone vent the rant core breach. Good lord. It's fucking disappointing. Now I gotta explain to my son who fucking loves playing Pokemon Go. I'm sorry Niantic fucking hates you because you're a cheater so you can't play anymore. You're not worthy son. I mean seriously he is fucking in the Pokemon like crazy now because of Pokemon Go and now sorry fuck you. You don't get the play because you're a fucking cheater. Thank you. He's almost at 20. JD with the obvious question in chat that I have to ask as well live.vognorant.com just don't update the app on his phone. Oh I'm glad you thought of that except Niantic also fucking thinks about that because see I have this other app called Ingress and if you don't fucking update it it doesn't fucking work. So that's what's gonna fucking happen is because they'll check your version of it and I'm sorry you need to update your fucking app to play this. 26 This is great. Wow. And the most important about what he just said for those new to counting numbers you've just received a great lesson on how to count. I'll put it in the review of the app. Oh my god. Alright. Let's talk about something that God I just wish he'd won the goddamn techno motion machine. It would have been half the fucks. You'd be like I don't give a fuck about it. I don't give a fuck but life is great. I got a machine. Alright. Let's talk about Interplay. Gabe mentioned this earlier. They are going to be selling their games and intellectual property so if you want to buy an intellectual property such as Earthworm Jim or MDK or Clay Fighter fuck yeah. Oh my god. Clay Fighter was awesome. Or Descent or Battle Chess get to it. You can actually do that. Let's see. Wedbush Securities is going to be assisting Interplay with the sales of the IP so I'm very curious to see what happens in a couple months with who buys what. See it's moments like this that I as a startup indie studio wish I could afford to get something like that because I know that would be so beneficial for my team. Especially for some of my team where they're kind of the younger generation so they don't know. They aren't familiar with those older games back in the early mid 90s and so on and so forth. It'd be great to be like you have no idea. Earthworm Jim no idea. Clay Fighter I need you to write me a theme song like the Clay Fighter song which actually if you remember on the Super Nintendo I think had the vocal Yeah it did. It's like everybody remembers that because like when did the fucking new Super Nintendo talk to you during Super Metroid and during Clay Fighter. Well NBA Jam. Ok one or two other times too. Right. Very true. Very true. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase wolf. Anyhow, Loki what do you have next for us. Alright so the next thing I have we're going to talk a little bit about is Mario games and Miyamoto basically saying hey you know what Mario's just not going to really work out for VR. Damn right. It's not going to be a good fit and I kind of I could see that because I mean think about it. It's platforming. It's lots of movement. That's going to make people sick. Basically saying you know I agree that adapting Mario to new platforms is key to keeping him relevant but we want families to play together and virtual reality which requires players to be closed off from the real world doesn't really fit in there. We also like people playing for a long time and it's hard to do that with VR. You don't need VR to be closed off from the real world. That's been happening since the Atari days. That's an interesting statement. I don't know if that's a good reason why not to do it because if you think about it they can still do like you know like Sony's doing where they have you know the multi-screenplay thing where it's almost just like the Wii U where you add one person on a gamepad. Everybody else is on the TV. You know you could do that with VR. Don't put Mario on VR. Yeah I was going to say but they're still stationary and there isn't the restriction other than if you really want to vomit fast you put Sonic in VR. Like here's the thing. That's just punishment. Holy shit. And this goes back to what I was saying about you know fragments and the AR space and everything is that you know it's going to change the way the game developers think about games. It's like telling a painter that now instead of oil paints they have to paint with watercolor. It's a whole new canvas so that doesn't mean the same old ideas are going to necessarily work. I don't really take a lot of this you know what he says right now for I don't know like how much of it is just kind of a thing that he's saying right now because if you think about it like if VR becomes like the Del facto thing of course they're going to put fucking Mario in VR. I mean just like how they probably were saying oh well we're not developing mobile games because our games are too fucking awesome for that and here they are developing a mobile game so I don't know. Did you say Rob did you did I maybe I was just high but did you just say Mario Paint by any chance? No but I was comparing this to painting so I can see why somebody would actually come at the conclusion of Mario Paint. So okay cool. So I wasn't entirely losing my mind because I just had this wild thought like God Mario Paint in VR which that would be that would be freaking awesome. By the way perfect iOS Android opportunity for Nintendo just bring back Mario Paint and that most of all most importantly that music generator thing they had in Mario Paint. Oh my goodness yes. And use the magic of the interwebs that we can send our little Mario Paint creations as text messages and those silly little songs that we do in the music generator we can send those to each other somehow. Just food for thought. And that'll never happen because it's too brilliant of a night. Alright. Anyhow speaking of VR experiences this one would be worthy of VR by the way. Space Channel 5 Sega announced that there is a Space Channel 5 VR called Ooki Ooki Viewing Show and when I heard that Space Channel 5 was coming to VR I about made an Ooki Ooki in my pants because I fucking love Space Channel 5 and so the thought of just getting to you know strut along with choo choo right along that just I was so excited about that um but unfortunately it's actually not the game the key word is viewing show so you get to be a program viewer of the report show sadly it's not something that lets you play the rhythm game. However but see I still go okay but it seems like they're testing the waters if this does well that's that right there though see this type of thing is why I'm hesitant with jumping in on like Playstation VR because all these games that come out are experiences they're not a game it's just like it's a thing it's a small portion of what could be a game it's basically like a tech demo that's just why am I dropping $500 a platform for fucking tech demos it's gonna be a Tokyo game show so some folks will get to try that out first hand and here's the interesting part I just assumed it was Playstation VR right it's actually not it's a Vive um title so that kind of surprised me but then again Sega's been doing stuff for Steam so I guess it's not as surprising but uh yeah so it's actually an experience that's gonna be on the Vive so some folks that are going to Tokyo Game Show will get to check that out I don't know if Akuma JP is going this year but if you are you need to check that out for me please alright uh let's go to Loki with another news story so once again you know another reason like I'm I bought Fallout on Playstation 4 it's like sweet cause I can my laptop doesn't run these games that great and you know I can also do mods it's gonna be fucking awesome because they talked about it at E3 and everything yeah unfortunately that's not gonna happen on Playstation 4 they did get they ended up releasing mod support on Xbox um back I wanna say in May um it was supposed to be coming later for Playstation 4 but it's just not gonna happen anymore basically as Bethesda put it on their website after months of discussion with Sony we regret to say that while we have long been ready to offer mod support on Playstation 4 Sony has informed us they will not approve user mods the way they should work where users can do anything they want for either Fallout 4 or Skyrim Special Edition like you we are disappointed by Sony's decision to give uh given the considerable amount of time and effort we put into the project and the amount of time our fans have waited for mod support to arrive we consider this important initiative and we hope to find other ways um user mods can be available for the Playstation audience however until Sony will allow us to offer proper mod support for Playstation 4 that content for Fallout 4 and Skyrim on Playstation 4 will not be available thank you Sony I appreciate this is really making me warm up to your Playstation platform Sony's not having a good PR week they kick so much ass at E3 and god help us with this seriously though the ball is in their core for a lot of shit that's just not fucking working like Microsoft saying hey you know what we would do cross platform multiplayer balls in your court Sony fuck nothing ok and then like then this shit is just oh I'm sorry we promised this for our players you bought the game based on this promise yeah we're just not going to let you do that either they're like so worried that their console is going to get hacked or something or that this game would make you know the game crash or something like that who cares if it makes the game crash it's a mod it may do that put a fucking you know someone might put titties in the game and then there would be titties on your Playstation and then somebody calls channel 10 news because the kindergartner at home saw titties oh no they saw titties what god of war is fucking around the corner anyways there's always titties in god of war I mean who cares or there's titties in grand theft auto 4 right now or 5 I mean so you know what's the big deal there's titties already on there it's a mature rated game well we're not a mature rated society that's the problem so that's a good retort I already have most of my people in my you know settlements without clothing anyways because you can glitch it to do that it's just a thing you do so who cares I just think it's stupid and this right here I'm not buying Skyrim for Playstation 4 and if I do get an Xbox 1 I will be buying multi platform games on Xbox 1 because apparently they have their shit together where Sony can't fucking even emulate god damn Playstation 1 games yet on their powerful fucking hardware backwards compatibility folks remember that it's stupid it's Playstation now oh we got Playstation now no fuck you I don't want Playstation now I want this shit to fucking work because I bought it already well Sony screwed themselves up anyway because they built that Playstation 4 so advanced thinking oh Xbox 1 they changed their architecture and they essentially fell for the bluff if you will saying oh well Xbox 1 is not going to be able to play backwards compatibility that means we're in the clear now because Xbox because Microsoft said no our next system is not going to be able to play 360 games and then Microsoft went on Ninja on Sony and said hey surprise through a nice software update and Windows 10 we've just not made a couple hundred games and that just screwed Sony up it's sad they're doing backwards compatibility better they're doing multiplayer support better they're supporting you know innovative things on their platform it's just weird that that's happening it's also directly correlated to when they threw one president out and got another one yeah so that's right knock down the 1% fools all right DungeonBuster in chat saying Bethesda pretty much threw Sony under the bus yeah they did hell yeah that was that was air that Bethesda put Sony in the special thanks yes they did there were so because they put the effort into it and Sony's like yeah we're not doing it there were a bunch of issues such as mods not having any sound because the PlayStation 4 uses a proprietary sound format that they needed to work around so all right anyhow uh how would you like speaking of Microsoft I mean how crazy would it be if suddenly a Nintendo emulator came out for the Xbox one then boy Nintendo or excuse me Microsoft even more fans if they were to do that and it looked like for a little bit this week that it might be happening through the emulator nest box actually said on Twitter that their application had passed Microsoft certification process for the Xbox and so it looked like the nest box was going to be coming out on the Xbox one but a mere two days later and I can't possibly imagine what happened but a mere two days later all of a sudden not only did this emulator get yanked from even potentially coming to the Xbox one it got yanked from the mobile phone and I think it's on the windows 10 store or it's on one of the windows stores fronts as well which is interesting that okay well we'll put emulators on those storefronts you know nobody's paying attention to windows phone anyway so what the fuck we'll just let emulators on this platform cause literally nobody's watching so but oh no the minute you say you're going to put it on the Xbox now we're going to have a problem that's what actually happened here is that and the reason was apps that are targeted to Xbox one are primarily gaming experiences must be approved through the ID at Xbox program and that was the excuse they used to yank it all which makes sense because the ID at Xbox one they only care about the Xbox because do you know how many emulators and roms are on the windows mobile platform I had a windows phone I had no idea do you know I oh my god it was so easy to find super mario world just a super mario world and just play on my windows phone how is that legal no one cared because what because of the because what windows phone it was a windows phone that you know two people none of the seven people were that that were playing it you know that have the phone we're going to be like oh my god microsoft look what's happening oh no so yeah no absolutely not so I'm not yeah so that's the only reason they got called out was because of exactly that it you know they added it to Xbox if it was on the windows 10 the UWP the universal windows platform wouldn't none would have happened none would have happened at all that's just hilarious all right well all this talk of emulators and things in the past makes me think it's time to open the gaming vault with the classic game of the week every week of course dark sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you guys should be playing this game this week and thanks to the magic of radio radio magic here she is dark sakura why don't you find me under all the stuff it was it was a difficult task but it had to be done I'm too busy playing my demon hunter we we miss you already dark sakura but I'm glad I'm glad we can have you this like you're having fun with demon hunter yes I am demon hunting demon hunty yes demon hunties you're liking the new wow expansion I am because I like Illidan good he needs to be my secret demon boyfriend is that just what they need to do more often in world of warcraft is just bring back old stuff because it seems to work well for them then it just needs to be all space goats and Illidan cause he's like my favorite anti hero I don't think he's a bad guy that could be the next expansion space goats we already had space goats well we already had Illidan we had Draenor that was space goats anyway she's gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game for you guys to pay a little respect to this week in the classic game of the week respect your motherfucking elders and this is an elder in video gaming it's older than a lot of you it actually it could have birthed some of you that is a sad sad truth yes what is the classic game of the week dark sakura I was five I was two okay you were five too no I was two the classic game of the week is tempest not tempest 2000 which we've done before not txk which is fucking awesome and everyone needs to play it get a vita right now it's the reason to have a vita it's tempest it came out in 1981 babies oh then I was three just kidding okay whatever let me feel old it came out by atari and it was designed by some guy named dave and my husband is texting me while I am doing the classic game um dave thorough it takes place on this kind of tube thing it is a three dimensional game but it was done in vector the original was and so this surface is sometimes a tube sometimes it's planar but you can basically move this little claw shaped spaceship named blaster um around the play field from segment to segment um it was also one of the first games that used atari's color quadra scan vector display and you also got to choose your starting level and it was called the skill step that atari called it um you also uh could increase your maximum starting level depending on your performance in the previous game so you could keep continuing from there and it was so it was one of the first video games that had progressive level design um as far as the way that the game the object of the game you just basically have to survive as long as possible and score as many points as possible by cleaning off the screen which is harder than it sounds oh my god tempest is a whore because you pay for it you fucking pay for it okay anyway you get who's tempest why are you calling her such horrible things on this program dark sagra tempest is a 50 year old drag queen sorry not sorry um anyway um the players ship uh gets to shoot rapid fire shots down the screen and little enemies are trying to come up that segment that you happen to be on you also get a thing called a super zapper and it destroys all the enemies on the field um enemies will also um have different kinds of behaviors like one of them will leave a spike as they travel up the the little section um and so when you're moving on to the next play field the spike can impale you impale they also can go up to the top of the screen and try to capture your little blaster ship um and then when you destroy all the enemies on the play field you get warped to the next level and so that's pretty much tempest it has 16 screens with different shapes on them some like I said are closed um and some of them are open fields that have you know real end points um and each of them has a different color scheme based on difficulty level including invisible which are for level 65 to 80 okay people actually saw level 65 cause I never I knew that there were like red fields but like I never saw anything but blue stage wait I think maybe like one time on a port of this game maybe for like Commodore 64 I think I saw red which is like the next highest up you see red when I play that game I just like playing this in the arcade cause you have the little nub that you would turn back and forth and you could just spin it it felt like you liked playing with the nub yeah I like playing with the nub once in a while okay the nub like you played with once in a while okay anyway um the game was supposed to be in concept a 3D remake of Space Invaders but it had different problems so really cause it looks nothing like it yeah so the um the creator though said that he got the design from a dream where monsters were crawling out of a hole in the ground so the game started off as aliens to vortex and finally it was Tempest and there were different um uh cases different um cabinets for it um there was the upright one um there was also uh a shorter cabaret style cabinet that um it was a little I don't think that they made as many of them and then there was a cocktail style that allowed uh two players to play at opposite ends um but the screen would flip of course vertically for each of the players not that it really mattered in this game yeah if the screen didn't flip oh well except maybe left and right would kinda be screwed up and that that would make your nub turning a lot less fun well Jeff Minter um came later and created two authorized sequels one of them was Tempest 2000 which I have done his classic game because it's awesome years ago it was like one of the first classic games like years ago yeah and um it came out for the Atari Jaguar and um the Playstation version was called Tempest X3 was there anything else worth owning on the Jaguar what was it besides Tempest 2000 wasn't it like an Astol game no it was like an aliens and predator game or something no I thought that there was another like little 2D platformer that came out on it was it it wasn't Astol it was okay but seriously Tempest 2000 was the game was it Ristar maybe maybe I don't know okay um and then um there was Tempest 3000 uh for the new on DVD players and then um Minter did two more games that were inspired by Tempest Space Giraffe in 2007 and TXK which came out on the Playstation Vita which has been getting a lot of play in my house now that I have a Playstation TV that and Ultra Despair Girls so um it's had different ports it was the Atari 2600 and 5200 versions um well those were prototypes I actually do have the 5200 prototype and it's pretty pretty awesome we play it with the trackball um and then um there was an Atari Greatest Hits version um there was also Superior Software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron and one by Electric Dreams for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC there's also been Windows versions and different versions of the Playstation Saturn, Super Nintendo all kinds of different versions on it so basically you can find Tempest anywhere but play TXK because it's really good and Sony was kind of being dickish about um wanting to sue the guy I don't think that was Sony dear Not Sony Atari yeah whatever and Tempest was actually featured in a Rush video subdivisions get out that's awesome and as we know Rush is Canada's best export that just made like an awesome game like 1.5 times as awesome right? so that's your game Tempest play it right now play TXK on all the things TXK there it is your classic game of the week Tempest originally in the arcade but ported to everything in the 1980's everything it's very great to have Jamie on the show thanks to Radio Magic so we'll see her back next week for whatever next week's classic game of the week might be meanwhile we had a birthday this past week actually just a couple days ago which we just passed Nine and Nine which not only was the day for what a new Lady Gaga single and a Bastille album I think came out on that day no way! but it was also Dreamcast day Nine Nine 99 was the big day the Dreamcast came out in the US anyway so a happy belated birthday to the Dreamcast that would be 17 years ago any Dreamcast memories from you Gabe? I feel like we get into Dreamcast memories every year around this time but what about you Gabe? I'll be honest I only play the Dreamcast a little bit this is probably not the game people would expect but Soul Calibur when I played Soul Calibur the first time and I heard the orchestrated music I fell in love with that I was like oh my god how is this playing such gorgeous because that was N64 I was playing Nintendo 64 and I was still so used to music made in MIDI and then to hear fight music being played with actual full CD orchestrated sound I was like what is this? I lost my mind and then Virtua Fighter 2 or even 3 between those two games there was an import game on the Dreamcast that was partially inspired for Kinship but I... Border Down is what it's called but it never came to the states it was for the Dreamcast called Border Down thank god if someone has that game for me the big one is going to forever and always be Phantasy Star Online that just blew my mind to have that type of experience on consoles we were kind of introduced to the MMO experience a little bit on PC with Ultima Online and so forth but just to have that on which some argue if PSO was really an MMO or not but at the end of the day the point is that it was definitely something a game that you could just drop in at any time with other people and experience together it was so different for the time that's why I had to have a Dreamcast big social experiment and then that game I cannot believe I forgot about that game so yeah my back to the PSO fans but yeah that was a wonderful game for it's time absolutely you know we mentioned the Dreamcast anniversary on our social media pages earlier this week of course you can always follow us on Facebook over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio but you can also follow us on Google Plus google.com slash plus orange lounge radio and actually over on Google Plus Act Def did mention this week I still own one but I don't know if it still works but I do have fond memories of it and the games it has I remember completing Crazy Taxi haha yeah of course like just a mainstay game the first game I got for it it took me a lot to do it but I managed to I also remember playing lots of fighting games with friends lots of fun yeah wasn't Capcom SNK 2 on Dreamcast yes it was so fucking good god what a great game seriously wonderful over on Facebook Ragenator I think this says that I never bought a Dreamcast something that I regret to this day I do however have the Dreamcast collection Nights into Dreams Jet Set Radio all that stuff on Steam I wish there was more retro Sega stuff on Steam like Mr. Bones and the Panzer Dragoon games I've always wanted to play those Hunter R said I went through two different Dreamcast consoles after dropping my original Ray console thereby ruining the DVD drive on the console I got the black Sega Sports edition of the Dreamcast remember they used to make there was a Hello Kitty Dreamcast at one point oh don't tell that to Brianna Bri there's a Hello Kitty Dreamcast out there it's probably on eBay go quick oh she's all about that no it was awesome I remember I saw that in like Japantown in LA once or something and I was like it's cute did that whole thing it was awesome long nights playing Power Stone that was Loki's game right Power Stone yeah Power Stone is pretty awesome man I wish that's something that would come back and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater of course good memories it's just it's hard to kind of pinpoint like you know we have all these fond memories of the Dreamcast yet it sure doesn't seem like it lasted very long you know it did not and it's unfortunate because I think that was a console way ahead of itself yeah and and what I think it fell it just it fell during this massive transition because it came out because it was in between like the N64 and the PS2 at that point I think when the PS2 was coming out and and yeah and because of the impact the first Playstation made on everybody yeah I think it was too little too late for Sega which is very very unfortunate Bob C in our chat says Tekken was never on Dreamcast but didn't they have that tricky like was it okay speaking of like software yeah there's Blingcast right where you could you actually did put Tekken it was this weird thing and like you know we were joking about the Windows phone and the emulators earlier but it's like a lot of that stuff was going on on Dreamcast with the Blingcast and then like one reason I got a Dreamcast when it was only like 40 bucks I mean obviously there was PSO and all that stuff you could just like burn a disc with a Nintendo emulator on Dreamcast and it worked for the most part that's so weird that a Dreamcast is capable of playing Playstation 1 games oh but a Playstation 4 alright I'm sorry here we go simmer down Jesus and you see Bree freaked out we told her she's like show me see she's freaking out already but yeah yeah you right about yeah you mentioned yeah not Tekken but yeah that's why I said Soul Calibur nevermind alright nevermind I'm just drifting away alright that's why the chatters are here live to set us straight yeah gosh it's like it's that it's that instant feedback be careful what you wish for when you want feedback you get instant feedback thank you chatters I love you very much alright let's do some rapid fire news Loki alright so Bloodstained that awesome Castlevania Igarashi game it's been delayed you're gonna have to wait until 2018 to play it what a fucking

Japan okay now she's gonna go to Japan to get some fucking cards that's pretty that's hard more hardcore than me that's her homeland anyway I just bat my eyelashes if my dear friend Akuma will help me out or I think I think Amazon Japan did that thing a while ago where now they will ship over here directly Japan and China you know you don't have to worry about that as much anymore anyway there was a I guess Animal Crossing Nintendo Direct that has a little bit more on this so that's pretty cool also PlayStation 4 Arcade Archives is growing you know these games don't get featured a lot but essentially arcade ports of classic games such as Gradius 2 I think was one I did a live stream of not that long ago you know there's actually a growing library of really kinda like under the I mean

I thought that was the second one that was in there No, off the record was the it was the expansion of 2 Right, that's what It wasn't a standalone though Off the record was the alternate Dead Rising 2 where you play instead of It was an alternate? I thought it was an expansion No, it was an alternate because Dead Rising 2 you played a different dude Right, but off the record showed what happened to Frank after part one No, because the whole premise was like, here's how I would have done it and that's basically the game Interesting, okay But yeah, those will be coming out this week My Q, Labyrinth of Death on Vita, Mystery Chronicle One Way Heroics on PC NASCAR Heat Evolution on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One NHL 17 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Packet Man Championship Edition 2 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and holy shit it's a Konami game!

I don't believe you because even I'm looking at another Wikipedia page that says that it's out worldwide on Valentine's Day it will be out multiple weeks if it has to ok? and listen, I am like a weatherman I'm telling you what the weather is going to be like and then it will be like something it decides you know what, it probably still made your list because there's that many people that are planning on recording it this week over on this side honestly, but just want to clarify that it will be out in a secret location that you have no access to it's still coming out though that list is 100% accurate let's get to our emails every week you guys email us participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show and respond to them if appropriate is this appropriate? for these emails? or do you not know yet? yes, well I've just given them the once over meaning I open them up to make sure they didn't say fuck you, you fucking fuck but that could have been from Loki though or I had to make sure it wasn't something that said buy Viagra cheap we need to talk about that Viagra has a sponsor, FOLR no! hi but we do have some fabulous emails from listeners this week starting with Andy R who starts us off this week saying I'm sure you're already sick of talking about it this late in the podcast but after replying to the Facebook post I was musing more about the PlayStation 4 Pro and felt like emailing with some more thoughts mainly because I was watching a video gamer Eurogamer put up a video that Eurogamer put up about the event one guy talking had been to the event and the other, like most of us, only saw what was streamed the guy who only saw the stream was very much in line with the internet consensus, namely the I don't see the point or I don't see a huge change sentiment that is going around interestingly though, the guy who had been at the event seemed fairly impressed with what Sony had managed to coax out of a $400 box which got me to thinking, this reminds me a lot of VR, in general it seems like the people I talk to about VR tend to fall into two camps, ones who have tried it and think it is cool or ones that haven't tried it and don't see what the hubble is about in the case of PS4 Pro, watching footage of a 4K HDR game on a stream probably doesn't do justice, much like not having actually tried a VR headset I know I personally streamed the PS4 P meeting to on my phone over a cell signal which clearly wouldn't hold a candle to the kind of TVs the Pro is designed for, like VR Sony has probably got an uphill battle convincing people that this is the thing they need, especially since this one requires not only the box itself but a TV capable of really taking advantage of the box, maybe they're banking on people who don't have the TV yet future proofing and just going for the Pro anyway, at least we've seen the PlayStation 4's will fly off the shelves at $399 in the past, so getting it to that price point was a smart move, anyway just a few thoughts for the conversation, this holiday is going to be pretty interesting I imagine that email again from Andiar that is a very good point I really like the comparison about that VR can be a hard sell until you've tried it so considering that very few of us probably watched the PlayStation Pro thing on a 4K TV, maybe we are not really seeing the message whereas the people that were there well I'm sure Sony had 4K projection in that room taken care of, so people were very happy with what they saw I'm sure so very interesting perspective although that being said that fantastic demo that they had of Horizon Zero Dawn or whatever that is looked awesome Shadow of the Colossus awesome, it did look awesome so this tells me that Sony now needs to get PlayStation 4 Pros running on 4K TVs in every Best Buy around the nation, because that's really the best way all I need to hear is, hey Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to be one of those supported higher resolution games would that really do it for you? what about The Last of Us I haven't played The Last of Us because they're doing it with The Last of Us, they're adding 4K textures for The Last of Us because why not see for me, but Mass Effect, you know that's kind of my version of Loki's Grand Theft Auto you know, that, seeing that as part of it does kind of make me go maybe I do need a Pro, maybe I do need to future proof, but maybe I am a little worried that by the time I get a 4K TV Sony will have another console in three years, that's where I'm starting to worry, that sounds like it, because if it's a ten year cycle is what it's supposed to be you've already, we're not even halfway there and you're giving me a new console you're giving me an upgraded console, so speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5 uh huh so how much Grand Theft Auto 5 have you? to be fair, not a lot, it's one of those things that I think about playing it and then ooh, shiny, I get distracted by something else you know how it goes, I do alright, one more email this week from Dark Tetsuya, who says hey OLR, I thought I'd write you guys about a neat new indie film that came out while you guys were on break, it's called The Outrunners so basically the plot is our hero Eli was visiting the arcade with his friend one day and got to talking to a girl but the resident bully and his gang caught wind of it and challenged him to a high stakes race in Sega's The Outrunners, winner stays loser leaves the arcade for good it's a pretty neat film if you enjoy classic arcades and the racing games they had back in the 90's, because this sounds like a plot out of the 90's to be quite honest but um, there's even some subtle nods to anime like Initial D, like they actually used some of the music in the end racing scenes and Eli's car is the same car that the star of the Initial D drives the director told me on Facebook that Initial D was one of his favorite anime the film is available for free on YouTube and be sure to check them out on Facebook as well the gaming blogs haven't really said a lot about this, but I thought if I sent you guys an email, I could get more people to check this out, uh, you're right the dozens and dozens of people that listen to OLR will hopefully check this out so thank you for the heads up there that is again called The Outrunners well hey, I like old Sega 90 game let me ask this, since it is an ode to 90's racing game classics will we get to hear in this movie the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo like is that what plays as the 20th Century Fox logo comes, well I guess not, because it's not a 20th Century Fox movie but you know, that's what you expect right? Daytona hell yeah, heck yeah anyway, that would be a fantastic game for the remake seriously hell yeah alright, there it is, your emails participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for consideration in a future week alright, remake Daytona they did on the 360 and it was gorgeous it wasn't remade because 4k is where it's at 720p special thanks it was no, those are just the HD versions of like the Dreamcast games or whatever they had, or Saturn games no, but they like redid that from the ground up and they added a couple new things too it was great game, if you want the HD remake, play the 360 version it was good, that's the best I can give you I can't give you much else, so can't please you clearly, so it's all good alright, s2100matt posting a link there in our chatroom by the way some folks I'm sure will be watching that after the show or is Loki trying to watch it during the show I thought that's what Gabe was peering over and looking out of there no, I'm looking in the chatroom, someone said would a new EDF in 4k there would be no frame rate those games are so horribly optimized it would just be like it's just like nothing, in fact at the very least, Playstation 4 Pro would maybe bring it up to like 20 frames per second, I mean the 4.1 it was way better than the PS3 version because the PS3 version in 2025 was terrible, so that had frame rate issues from the 20 I like 2025 part of the way, it's just I don't know, it's not the same it was its own thing I guess but it was nice to have the co-op and stuff, I just haven't played co-op alright, let's get back into some other gaming news, Loki, that's fine we're such nerds anyways, so speaking of every Playstation 4, this is kind of a neat little thing to throw in there you don't have to buy a new system to get that wonderful HDR, so be able to support the wider range of color and everything the pictures will kind of pop more that's coming in a free update if you already have a Playstation 4, you can enjoy that right away, assuming they have a TV new enough to actually take advantage of that, which I don't again, we face this technical issue, and I almost begin to wonder if that's the mentality with these bigger game companies honestly though, it's been a long time since I had a TV, I got this TV, actually thankfully it was a promo thing from Sony ironically enough, it's a Sony HDTV, but they gave that to all of the employees of the company I worked for, and so I had a nice new HDTV from that, and at the time it was cutting edge, but now it's pretty old so I mean, I could use a new TV, it's just you're justifying buying a new one my concern is again, is a new console no longer enough do we have to have you gotta have a very powerful TV and here's what we can provide too, because now you're costing me not just four or five hundred dollars to enjoy a new gaming experience now I gotta pay a grand essentially, you know and on top of that, like why should I be dropping money on a new TV and a new system and VR and all this stuff for Sony, when you know, they can't even get like mod support working and stuff something that was promised to people like a long time ago well that's ultimately my point, because invest in a PC instead, I mean well even the original PS4 was supposed to do 4K, and that just disappeared into the nothing. The menus are 4K That's it. Right? And again, that's a whole other thing I appreciate the fact that these newer consoles and I said this earlier, okay fine you're gonna be able to display show off 4K and things like that but I can't wait to see how few developers actually utilize that that's gonna be the best part, so anyway I digress So, I mean if my TV doesn't really support this thing, then this patch does nothing for me or will I get to see some subtle differences or what? No. Brighter blues brighter blues and reds that's about it. Because I bought my, like my TV is pretty fucking nice I think, it's a 2014 model apparently and so it doesn't have this. Maybe it supports it. I looked on the Amazon thing, because I actually went back and looked at the TV I bought on Amazon which, just an interesting side story, I was gonna buy the TV at Sears, and it was on the display for it and everything, and then they told me, like, we don't have it like, they didn't they wanted me to go to another Sears on the other end of town, and I was like okay, I'll head over there now. I'm sorry, but the TV you're looking for is at another Sears. Yeah, it's in another castle right? So I just I came home and I bought it on Amazon, like anybody else would have done it Why are department stores dying? Or just go to Best Buy and have them price match Amazon. Uh, yeah I guess I could have done it, but anyway, it doesn't matter, because I got a fucking TV like two years ago, no, last year and it's a two year old model, but apparently, yeah, it doesn't do but it does do 3D Blu-rays and all that stuff Oh, goody goody. I have, like, two movies I can watch in 3D Tron's one of them, so Do you have the glasses for it? I do, but fuck if they ever seem to work I tried to use them on the ongoing, I was like these don't even really work And that's what I mean right there like, that's what I mean, you know, the other thing that made me push so hard on 3D Yeah, right? Look how well that worked out Boy oh boy Anyhow, um, well I still you know, I'm excited for the update to see if it'll do anything for me, but God, again, my TV is not that old and it doesn't support any of this Well, the 4K support ends are pretty nice, I mean, just even watching the little demos walking through Best Buy and stuff like that, it's like damn, that's a nice clear picture but it's just like, damn, is that gonna be the same nice clear picture when I stream it through Netflix on this crappy boxy they have? Nope I'm gonna need like, you know, a nicer new platform to be able to stream in 4K and a nicer new internet provider that's gonna be able to handle that bandwidth, but not Comcast Alright, well another big birthday that happened this week was the 50th anniversary of Star Trek and how appropriate that just this past week Star Trek Online has come out for consoles Star Trek Online what, came out, what is it like January 2012 when free to play, I think it had actually been out as a pay game maybe a year or two before that and then it was free to play in 2012 well now it is out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One so it took a little while for it to come out but what a good way to get an older MMO some new attention than by being right there for download on the consoles DC Universe Online kind of did this same type of thing a while ago as well, so anyhow Star Trek Online is now available and I think the audience over there seems to be growing a little bit, probably these console releases are helping so now might be a good time to check that out so, what's cool is that they actually have some of the cast from the movies, it's like voice over oh really, oh that's awesome that's pretty cool, I wanna say I may be wrong, I don't wanna step out of line but I wanna say they were able to get Leonard Nimoy in the game before he had passed well cause again this game's been out since 2010, so I wanna say he was in it, and they had at one point Zachary Kinto was in it too because he was Spock in the new movies, I think he was in the game when it first came out as well, so uh yeah, Kaijuto in chat says did they make the game better cause on PC it blows, and Fifth Dream confirms yes Nimoy is in the intro in the first five minutes, so that's pretty cool it might be worth checking out all on its own I'm curious if uh any of our friends from Starboard Power Coupling uh check that out on consoles cause I know some of them play Star Trek Online, I don't know if they went and checked it out on consoles though so uh let's move on, Loki so uh this is kinda cool there was a slight tease or a positive leaked tease that Earth Defense Force 5 might be a thing um apparently this was coming from um a count, they had a countdown teaser actually on the D3 publisher site, and I wanna say that this also leaked out from like another publication that it was out there um so yeah, it'd be interesting to check it out the moon hell yeah, EDF 5 baby oh boy you gonna pick this one up when it comes to Earth? of course you are alright it sounds like you and Gabe will have something to play together cause Gabe's definitely a fan as well nothing, that game just warms my soul so much destruction so goddamn hard alright we are gonna open up the pipeline to you guys, Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype, if you wanna give us a call and talk about anything that we've talked about tonight, maybe you wanna ask Gabe a question or uh anything else that might be on your mind, you can go ahead and give us a call Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype um while we wait for some calls to come in um Gabe let me ask you about this uh locally with Sacramento and development and all that, I know we had talked about earlier in the show, we mentioned that Sacramento can be seen by those in other areas it's kinda like, you know not as lucrative of an area or whatever, which seems a little silly to me cause it seems like, you know, we're growing a little bit with our, even our triple A game development right, which um, you know I forget what they were called back in the day, what, Click Play or Click and Play or something, Click Nation that's it, they grew into now Capital Games EA Capital Games, which uh I believe based on one of the trailers they showed recently, they're doing work with the Star Wars mobile development, right, yes they are yes they are, so that's pretty cool, do we know of any other like big big studios that are establishing a presence here locally? Um, I know so on the indie side um, on the indie side you've got Skirmish who just recently got a little office uh, so I think somewhere in Rancho or Sacramento, something like that I wanna, yeah, somewhere nearby for here I think, um, I know the other big one Fifth Planet Games, they're up in Rockland they were in Roseville, they moved up to Rockland, um, they've uh they've trimmed down a little bit on the size of their studio, but they're still a pretty significant size studio, Fifth Planet Games, and big shout out to Rob, um, you know, Rob Winkler he was one of our speakers for the first indie arcade, um, but yeah Fifth Planet is definitely one of the other well known studios so with their, um, oh my goodness I can't even think of their freaking game name right now but yeah, you can find them on Newgrounds and so on and so forth but, yeah, so there's a few but we definitely need more, I wish we connected with EA because, you know, that would have been great to establish something with them more, but we'll see alright, we'll see, well in the meantime let's get to the phones because they are ringing, hi you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Hey what's up guys, this is Kaijuto Hey Kaijuto, what's on your mind buddy? I got some game recommendations for you First off, I just want to say that I've been playing the Rumble, what is it, Rumble in the Rocket League that thing is great, I don't know if you guys tried that I haven't, I've heard about, God, the Rocket League, they have really done a great job Just continuing moving that game forward ever since its original release, I need to check that out There is some trouble in paradise with that game because now the fans are pissed off because they decided to go with the whole you got unlockables, but you have a crate that you have to open and you have to buy keys to open that crate Oh, pissed off because they're claiming that they need the money because they want to make it into an esport but fans are not buying that They're like pissed off There's some real Rocket League hate going on right now A lot of fans got that free from Playstation Plus but then again, Playstation Plus not really free so, alright Nothing ever is My game recommendations going to the Star Trek, the 50th anniversary thing I found this game, I think it just came out a couple of days ago, it's called Halcyon 6 and that game is so much fun, it's fantastic You got to think of that game that came out for the tablet, Trexels remember that game? It was like a remake of some other game, Pixels or some crap Think of that game as Trexels, but a lot better, it has a story there's humor in there there's base building, if you're the type of person you're all into that base building that they did with XCOM and that type of stuff they have that in there, they have away missions you can send your away team out there to have battles, for all you Final Fantasy fans, it has the whole type of turn-based system that Final Fantasy kind of invented where you have your three party members and then you fight either three monsters or two monsters they have that in there, it's all turn-based it's a lot of fun, it's 2D, it's not 3D, but there aren't any type of platforming that type of crap, you don't have to run and jump on stuff, you're basically trying to battle Is it space sci-fi, which is why you're tying this to Star Trek? No, it's basically a Star Trek, because you have your science officer, you have your captain your communications officer, they have the different colored suits you have spaceships that you're flying it's Star Trek Alright, I gotcha that's a good recommendation This is on Steam by the way and the second game is a matter of murder which I think is like $2.99, really affordable game and if you love the game Clue you're gonna love this game because it's basically Clue it has endless replayability because every time you play you can generate a new mystery, and it plays just like Clue, they have the mansion you gotta investigate, you gotta find the weapon, find the suspect, find the motive and then when you think you have all that together then you go into the accusation phase and then you have all the characters, they all come together in one room and then you have to retell what happened, like who committed the murder and why and all that stuff and if you got it right, then you get rewarded for it it's a really fun game, it has some really shitty art but it makes it funny it looks like a three year old kid drew the game, but that's part of the trauma I love it and the thing with the body it's hilarious because they don't show the entire body, you just see the feet the tasteful dead person just the legs sticking out from under the carpet yeah, yeah and the game makes fun of itself because when you do the tutorial I guess it's the maid or something she's like, what are you freaking out about? it's just a body, that seems to happen a lot in this place right away you're gonna be solving multiple murders just people being killed in that house so it doesn't have the board game element still where you roll a die to move around there's no dice it's almost like a point and click you're clicking the characters you're talking to them but the writing is done so well that you actually get involved they'll tell you stuff if you ask a guy a question he's nervously stroking his moustache to give you little hints that he may be lying it's a really cool deductive game because what I found out is when I played the game I was doing the tutorial and the guy was like I was in the pool room with so and so we were playing pool, so I went to the pool room and there was a guy in there and he confirmed his story that his alibi was legit because they were both playing pool but then you speak to another guy and that person's like, yeah, I was playing pool too and I'm like, no, you weren't playing it was just these two guys in there so that's how I knew that they were the murderer just cool stuff like that alright, so Matter of Murder I gotta check that out on Steam, so three bucks alright, very cool thanks, the one thing I'm ready to buy alright, Kaishudo, thanks for the call alright, later have a good one, bye alright we have the phones ringing, so let's get to another call hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio, who's this? hey guys, it's Jason what up? I am currently barreling down the east side of the Rockies which is why your voice was missed from the intro this evening as you're in your car, zooming down a mountain that is responsibly responsibly, I am answering both hands around the wheel I promise, alright, fair enough, fair enough what's on your mind? even if my car is magical enough that I technically don't have to I still do have both hands on the wheel you guys have brought up a couple of cons con things and VR things and so I just kind of wanted to chime in with my two cents of the last couple of weeks while you were down at Dragon Con I was quite literally in the opposite end of the US at PAX West oh yes, the other thing that happened over Labor Day how was it? the other four days of madness this was my first West as many of you know, it's been called Prime up until this year and now they're calling it West for consistency between East, West and South my first West, my second PAX I went to PAX South at the start of this year it was definitely a lot more hectic but at the same time a lot bigger a lot more events still very social largely to do with the fact of the more and more people I'm meeting in various communities Twitch spearheaded or not, but a number of those people are also involved with the games with the larger gaming community business wise so it just kind of steamrolls from there the show floor itself was nice and big very tiring everybody had their space you see all the Twitch and their mammoth streaming center and partner center Intel, Blizzard even Tiny Build had a shockingly good presence considering their up and up over the last couple of years but a lot of familiar faces but still a bunch of hidden gems and the Indie Mega Booth Mega Box I think it technically is and then various other locations tying specifically to the show there were two things that you guys have touched on that I wanted to bring up I don't know exactly who the individuals are, but with the story about Interplay going under and selling off IPs the founding members the founding creators of Descent have already moved on from Interplay and they were exhibiting their own game called Overload in VR at PAX West I don't think it was ever really covered on the show before, but they had a Kickstarter as one does, they're still offering pre-orders that count towards stretch goals but they have very significant plans a very great Vive backed demonstration of what Overload is going to do and it is six degrees of freedom multiplayer, robot zero gravity dogfighting I unfortunately didn't really feel like queuing up in the line, but watching it was absolutely spectacular and I absolutely am looking forward to another Descent game as well yeah, you're not the first one to say that logically those guys should be the ones that try to bid for that Descent IP, whether they have the money to do so or not we'll see, but yeah, it would make a lot of sense that they should probably try to make a play for it that would be quite a stretch goal fund our IP acquisition attempt well, you never know there might be a magical publisher out there who's willing to marry the two together like will front the money for this if that would be one of the better stories, like one of the most monumental stories that I've heard in the last jeez, decade I guess, I don't know if you guys want to look up more information, media and all that stuff, playoverload.com plenty plenty of media there to go up, screenshots screenshots, a little bit of gameplay video demonstration of what it does in and out of VR and then the common game's gonna have multiplayer and epic robot battles and huge boss battles, etc. VR more generally I, prior to PAX West I had only ever used Oculus Dead Kit 1 I never, I didn't queue up at E3 for VR, I haven't seen HoloLens and I haven't bumped anybody nearby to see their Vive or anything of the sort up on the sixth floor, which is where a lot of indie, both publishers and developers were exhibiting there was a little corner for University of Washington, UW I think it was, their game development program, I got talking to a couple of people because they just had a free throw a three point shootout simulator game and that was my first experience using the Vive and it was it was Loki was talking earlier about how everything with a big name attached to is an experience and so it's kind of less interesting but this game, like I said free throw or three point shootout I'm not quite sure where on the line it was but it was a basketball simulator running Vive called Nothing But Net or Nothing But Net and it was, I hadn't actually really paid attention to the controllers yet, but to extend those as your hands and use it for just simple ball grabbing, basketball grabbing, not that other kind, basketball grabbing oh my basketball grabbing, flick and release and the world that they created which was just like a high school gym, fairly nondescript but it still felt very good to be in it it was a very limited demo, you just had 60 or 90 seconds to shoot to make shots and but it was fun, it was cute it reminded me both of you possibly all three of you have talked about video game renaissance and I have played basketball in real life I played for a season in elementary school basketball has obviously been a part of American media forever and I played some basketball games on and off, it's never been my primary sport but it was still fun when talking to the developers of this Nothing But Net game I was talking to them about this very, very basic arcadey three point shootout game for DOS called Three Point Shootout and to see the progression of gaming all over again to take basic concepts to introduce developers, players and everybody else to how these things actually work out in 3D and finally being able to put full body motion into this kind of thing it really tickled me in a really really happy way and that was definitely one of my underrated gems of the show that I just enjoyed I just kind of hovered around listening to conversations, I had a great conversation with the husband and wife development pair talked about some of their plans what they could do, gave them reference to prior art and plenty of things the demo was just a single round of shots, they talked about a lot of other things like horse and multiplayer and MMO-esque simulation because it is a gem with multiple hoops and maybe maybe even going on into like a two on two NBA Jam style thing maybe but it was fun, it was simple it was conventional and it hit all of the spots to be able to take a basic concept and apply it into the VR world in such a simple but excellent way so it sounds like you had a pretty successful PAX West it's no longer PAX Prime I heard that's because PAX East is the real PAX Prime at this point but I won't go there how were the panels, did you go any panels any of that stuff? I did zero panels, I was incredibly line averse so the guide book was a map reference for me and I just didn't pay attention to any of the panels which is a little weird for me I guess, sort of, but I don't know I was there for the people I was there for the people and friends first that I don't get to see in person nearly enough and in between that I made my own adventure across the show floor very quickly I guess one of my other underrated ones that I haven't even been thinking about, talking about for some stupid reason if anybody knows the old Neo Geo game Windjammers, one of the multi game, multi game arcade machines we saw in mini golf and bowling alleys and all those kinds of things, that game is coming back to PC and PS4 in the form of a disc jam by people who also grew up with the game and loved it and are turning it into a little steep down pong that I break up a little bit yeah you're breaking up a little bit but you're back now that sounds disc jam already in some gamers hands PC and PS4 Windjammers-esque with an updated look and feel and that was quite a treat to be able to talk to other fans that finally did something with the game and moved into it and yeah alright, very cool, alright well sounds like you had a good time, TwitchCon are you doing that in a few weeks, isn't that the same weekend as GamerX right I heard? it is the last, it's like September 30th into the start of October same weekend as GamerX, that's some unfortunate timing I am I should be doing TwitchCon, I am tentatively doing it, I'm actually, I wasn't supposed to be heading home I was supposed to still be along the Pacific Coast, quite possibly in the studio next weekend, but I had a little home incident occur so that's why I am currently barreling down the east side of the Rockies I hope everything's okay, so alright, well I'm gonna go ahead and let you go, okay? Sounds good, have a good night! Alright, thanks for calling, take care Alright, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype Looking quickly, some chat comments Kajuda says, OMG, Twitch has a con too? What do they all do, meet up on Skype and stream? No, I went last year, actually because of Jason Jason was like, I have an extra ticket, are you sure you don't want to go? Because in San Francisco it would be very easy for you to go, so I was like sure I'll go, I thought it was interesting I actually, I left a little more motivated to do more streaming, which has been hit and miss, some weeks I'm able to do a bunch, I probably haven't done one in a month, just because, you know, I am doing four podcasts on and off, so it's kind of like a lot of my creative energy time goes into that, so alright, let's try to sneak in at least one more quick call here before we call it a night, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? Hey, this is Akdeft Hi Akdeft, how are you? Really great, really great What's on your mind? Well, anyways, I want to talk about the Super Mario Run announcement What do you think? Well, basically, it's not something that necessarily is well, I had the idea in my head, and I kind of missed my train of thought but basically what they're trying to do, or I think what they're trying to do is basically like, cross-promotion of some sort because they're not and this is something I was talking with other friends they're not offering the full game right now, it's even if you see like Super Mario Run as a full game it kind of isn't because it isn't like the full Super Mario experience and we can see it like in stuff like Super Mario Maker or New Super Mario Bros and all that stuff but something that was curious and this relates also to Pok\u00e9mon GO that the 3DS sales went up I think for July, and I don't think for August, I don't know but many people pre-ordered in expectation of Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon so I'm trying to guess here that basically they did this maybe because they want part of the mobile market, maybe that's something like secondary but I think they're trying to like promote their own stuff through other media I don't know if that makes sense You know, that's something that I this is Gabriel, good to meet you man this is something that I was mentioning earlier with my little speculation about the NX and me getting the impression that that's what I think Nintendo's trying to do I think them releasing this Mario game on iOS is a hint of what's coming for NX to an extent, that's just my impression of it, so I I really just need them to fucking reveal the NX already, get this fucking time Tokyo Game Show is in two weeks, I'm sick of the speculation all this wank you know I love that word all this Twitter wank granted, we've been no help either we have the wank and the tinfoil hats on this show as well, I'm fucking sick of it it's after labor day no more white shoes and a goddamn NX announcement let's do it Hey Act, can I ask that's just by the word of Rob can I ask you something really quick because you mentioned something that I found very intriguing as a mobile, you play games on mobile I take it right? Yeah. Okay. Do you feel that as a mobile gamer the price that you pay do you feel it's fair to say that one should still expect the full game experience on mobile or should it really just be are you really just paying for something that's going to be a quick time consuming thing and then we move on I mean do you fully expect do you fully expect the full video game experience on a mobile, should you expect that on a mobile phone? I think we should expect something like that it's not it's not necessarily like exclusive to a console or in this case to a mobile game but I think my point is because we have seen runners in consoles we have the bit trip runner series like for example maybe even Rayman I don't consider it a runner but they do have mobile versions that pretty much are runners right but my point was you don't get the full experience as in you only go right instead of going left to you don't have full control over Mario in this case where in a console in even a portable version of Mario you have full control of what you can what Mario does in the game so I I don't see like Super Mario Run like a bad thing at all it seems interesting enough but yeah I don't think Nintendo is putting all the all their money into the mobile market at least just yet and at one point it's exactly the next part or point of this yeah there's got to be a correlation somehow and there was a comment in the chat that I just seen when they I didn't see who it was that mentioned was the NX going to be running Android hardware they were going to be using a processor chip that can that fuels Android but not necessarily that doesn't necessarily mean you know it's going to be an Android based thing it's just a processor I can't remember what it was called similar parts but not necessarily how they function right like a Tegra or something like that it's like a Tegra processor but for me I think this is a way for Nintendo to be making money this holiday season when the Wii U is not going to be expected to really do anything I think this is something Nintendo is under a lot of pressure to do and I think again that's why you see them coming up with all these other creative ways to make money this holiday to keep their investors happy is oh we have the classic NES which we know stands to do well oh we have the Pokemon Go bracelet oh we have you know the mobile venture you know we're going to put our biggest thing on mobile so maybe this is why they bumped Mario up to this year was to kind of show that they're going to still be productive through this holiday so maybe even if the NX tanks which you know I don't want to see that happen I don't think any gaming fan would want that although I just want to know what the fuck it is already I think you know Nintendo can show that they as a company could still stay afloat no matter what definitely so anyway I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks for the call and for the insight hey thanks for having me alright that's going to do it for the skype line tonight but if you didn't get through tonight do consider sending us an email for a future week participate at orangeloungeradio.com alright now before we wrap up the show and say our good nights we have to make sure that we get any residual angst out of our system so that we can successfully start a new week nice and fresh and on a clean slate so we empty and reset our pallets with a segment we call here the FUs of the week music music music music music music music low key your FUs of the week I don't know I just have to be myself for being 10 seconds too early music there's so many jokes I can make with that but I'm going to be a nice person and not make them alright 10 seconds too early is not a bad thing well depends on the end goal but yes Gabe do you have any FUs you need to get out of your system a special thanks you need to give tonight ah no not necessarily I let it out I pretty much let it out earlier yeah enough I can't really think of anything right now so just you know thanks for everything though guys my FUs of the week goes to fucking food poisoning here's the fucking week I had you ready for this? alright so I get back from Dragon Con which was awesome no complaints there so I get back and of course I get sick from the plane or something cause Bobby's like I'm not sick and nobody else I know at Dragon Con was sick so I got something on the plane at the airport or something so I'm sick and I'm like out of work Tuesday and Wednesday I usually take the day after anyway just as like a recuperation day when I go to a big con but I have to take like another day I was like you know how that kind of looks to your boss was like I need one more day of vacation cause you know luckily my boss is pretty understanding she's great and everything but it's just like when you still feel like an asshole doing it you know like the work is piling up and I'm not coming back to do it yet cause so I go back to work on Thursday I go to get lunch on Thursday and it makes me sick like stomach sick I'll spare you the horror story but it was not a pretty 24 hours so it's like I couldn't catch a fucking break last week it's like

episode here it's not longer episode but a good one uh any final thoughts for our listeners tonight I'm just tired now yeah I'm depressed tired of eBay it'll be okay well happy birthday though you know what we have some awesome some listeners were saying we should you know what we should all put 25 bucks in and help Loki get the damn DDR machine that's not the thing that's why it was such a disappointment because those those cabinets and granted it was slightly broken I would have needed to you know fix up some stuff but that's fine I mean like a new cabinet goes for over a thousand dollars it's like yeah that's why it stings so bad because it's it's like that's actually more cost effective to do it that way than it would have been to build pads I got build pads but now you're reminding me like oh you know if I you know now that I'm not upgrading my phone this year now that it looks like I'm probably not going to get the PlayStation 4 Pro and I may not even get the VR at this point we'll see I'm kind of on the fence with that maybe this is the year Rob's finally going to get his cocktail cabinet because I really I really kind of want one I was gonna say you practically have the money for that for a cocktail cabinet now if you don't get those two things yeah I know you've got the money for that now only only if get it on Amazon you can pre-order it and then part of me is like you should save that money to do responsible things like home buying oh come on who needs adulthood we need cocktail tables come on man priorities exactly what future you got a bar top that I built oh well there you go you're halfway there man I know I know all right my final thought tonight I I can't think of an awful lot I'm just gonna say I'm gonna I'm gonna try to play more Overwatch which will make Alan very happy because Alan plays a fucking ton of Overwatch I think it's like all he ever he plays that and then I'll see him play No Man's Sky a little bit and he's back to playing Overwatch he plays a lot of fucking Overwatch and he has like like bro friends he made playing Overwatch and everything that he gets on there and he bro chats about how you know there's a reaper back behind the thing I just I'm like wow he's like really really good and when I play with him I'm fucking terrible so I need to up a game on Overwatch so I might be working on that this week or I might play Grand Theft Auto 5 to keep Loki happy and after all it is his birthday yes I hope you had a good birthday all things considered Loki indeed if not maybe maybe this week will be good too I have to go back to the call center in a few weeks so that's not making me too happy well enjoy the few weeks that you know you don't have to be there so it's like here's how frustrating it is yes we would love to hire you for this department but because of some corporate tree bullshit we've got to not hire people even though we desperately need people because some higher up person thinks it's a good idea not to spend money of course unlike corporate America which is also what your wife says it's a good idea not to spend money right and she says that about everything we can have like billions of dollars like don't spend any of it it's like I'm not I'm not gonna do that alright alright that's gonna do it have a great week happy gaming everybody we will see you back here in seven days and by the way I don't know how many of you long time listeners notice we kind of mix things up a little bit with our format and our layout tonight so hopefully you guys enjoyed that appreciate any feedback you guys have a five star review goes a long way in a place like iTunes or Google podcast or wherever it is you heard this show tell a friend about the show we are the show where every gamer has a voice but not unless you help us by you know recruiting friends and folks to listen to the program because we don't have a million dollar website or advertising campaign no we
