7000	13000	Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	26000	Tonight, it's been a busy week in video gaming and we've got a packed show to match. Join us for all the latest news in sequels, prequel sequels, lawsuits, and an interview too. All this, and yet still more, starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	54000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, September the 18th of 2016 with episode number 658 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me here in studio as he does every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
55000	56000	Hi Loki, how are you?
56000	57000	Doing fine.
57000	61000	Hopefully you're doing better this week. I know your birthday week didn't go so well, but I hope this week is doing better.
61000	62000	Oh, I'm over that now.
62000	69000	Okay, much better. So maybe less angry rants tonight, or will we still have plenty? I don't know.
69000	71000	I'm sure there will be something.
71000	77000	There will be something, something to get the rants going on. You guys of course can always rant along with our show.
78000	89000	Like the trial version of M-I-R-C, which is not letting me actually open it, which is ironic because I actually did pay for a copy of M-I-R-C and I don't know where my stupid registration code is.
89000	92000	I was going to say, maybe it's time to register.
92000	101000	No, I already paid it. I paid it, I just don't know which email they sent it to and they have no absolute way to track their registrations because they're fantastic.
102000	109000	All right. You can join us, of course, live. If you are listening to our show live every Sunday night at The Voice of Geeks Network is where we tape.
109000	114000	vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
114000	120000	And if you are listening live, we invite you to join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
120000	127000	And of course tonight we are going to be having an interview a little later, as was mentioned in the intro, kind of following a similar theme to what we had last week.
127000	132000	Gay was here last week with Sacramento IGDA talking about some of his indie game development things.
132000	135000	And we're actually going to have another indie game dev on tonight.
135000	142000	Sam from Remote Games is going to be here in a little over 15 minutes to talk about his project called Silent Earth.
142000	145000	So we'll talk to him more about that in a little while.
145000	147000	It's like Silent Hill, but bigger.
147000	150000	No, it's actually nothing like that.
150000	153000	I think that there's a concept in there somewhere.
154000	160000	You could have a game like Silent Hill, but it's like the randomly generated areas like No Man's Sky.
160000	161000	So it's huge.
161000	162000	It's just huge.
162000	164000	Maybe not, maybe not.
164000	168000	I think the game Sam's making might be a little more focused and possibly better too.
168000	171000	So we'll talk to him about that a little later.
171000	174000	For now, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.
174000	176000	So maybe speaking of rants, I don't know.
176000	183000	This is a topic that sometimes makes people angry, but I don't think it's like one of those things to like super get irritated over.
183000	186000	But we have some news of some big game delays.
186000	187000	Right, Loki? What happened?
187000	191000	Yeah, so basically there's two game delays that were announced this week.
191000	199000	The first one being that the Last Guardian is going to be delayed again in which everyone's like, no!
199000	202000	To December, which is about a month away.
202000	205000	Well, after 10 years, what's another month, right?
205000	209000	Yeah, so they just need some extra time on it and that's fine, whatever.
209000	216000	And then, you know, the South Park Fractured But Whole is going to be delayed to quarter one of 2017.
216000	221000	Which, honestly, I want to say that's, I don't know if that's what happened with the first one.
221000	226000	I know that it came out, it was delayed a few times the first one when it originally came out.
226000	233000	Yeah, and this is because there's this very interesting trend going on where every single game gets delayed.
233000	238000	Every single one of them gets, maybe not every single one, but it definitely seems like, I mean,
238000	243000	we hear stories about game delays far more often than we don't hear stories about game delays.
243000	251000	So that caused me to, you know, sometimes when I read a gaming story, I have this tendency to write a very reactive tweet.
251000	256000	I don't know, does anybody else do this? Maybe you go to Twitter to throw out a little sass.
256000	261000	So I did as well and I just, I wrote a little tweet that was like, and I used the little clapping emoji
261000	266000	because that's what you do when you have your point to get across, right? You know, stop doing that clap.
266000	276000	But I wrote a little tweet that was like, you know, game release dates are BS and they're nothing but a way to push preorders for retailers.
276000	281000	Do you think that, I mean, Loki, you worked in that industry for many, many years.
281000	289000	Do you think there's some truth to that? That, I mean, release dates really only exist to generate preorders and hype and all that?
289000	298000	Yeah, release dates change all the goddamn time, like all the time. And a lot of, it's just, the problem is that they announced the two early, I think.
298000	310000	And it is good that at least we're seeing them put out games that aren't completely buggy, aside from like, you know, No Man's Sky and stuff, which got delayed and still was buggy.
311000	324000	But, you know, South Park though, being that the pedigree of the game, I trust them a lot more than I would trust, say, you know, I don't know, The Last Guardian, God, it's been delayed so many times, who knows.
324000	326000	But I would assume that's going to be a good game.
326000	331000	Yeah, I mean, and here's the thing, it's not like I'm saying like, oh, delays are going to make a game bad. That's hardly the truth.
331000	345000	And it's fine too, especially with normally like it used to be like everything you get clumped into the fourth quarter. And then it's just like, I can't buy everything, which is, you know, so I was I was planning on picking up South Park and I already have it preordered.
345000	352000	So, you know, buying into the hype. No, I got it. The digital version preordered so I could play the original game.
352000	355000	Oh, yeah. I never finished that little freebie.
355000	358000	Hey, that's worth it for that. I mean, come on.
358000	365000	OK, so but yeah, normally I don't even digitally, I don't really preorder stuff unless I want it right away.
365000	372000	Tech 2030 in chat says, LOL, did Rob just do the clap emoji meme IRL? Yes, I did.
374000	382000	Let's see, a stoppie in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, NX announcement delayed. Maybe, probably, likely.
382000	388000	You know, I would have, I would have fully expected, you know, my prediction was NX was going to be announced.
388000	392000	Yeah, now the rumor is, oh, it's going to be October. Yeah, come on. No one knows what it's going to be.
392000	400000	It's just, yeah, everybody's guessing at this point. And we're all just setting ourselves up for disappointment. Isn't that that running trend with release dates and everything?
400000	407000	Like I said, South Park, I'm sure it's gonna be great. Last Guardian, it's gonna be great. All these games that get delayed usually end up pretty great.
407000	418000	I mean, the delays are often for a pretty good reason. So we've got to find this balance between the marketing department that wants to put on the PR that wants to put all these dates out there to generate the hype.
418000	430000	And the realistic scenario of that sometimes when you're developing for an HD platform, especially now, so we have to talk pro platforms with 4k and all this stuff, the game development takes a little bit longer.
430000	438000	Right? So where is the happy medium? And for me as a podcaster slash fan slash commentator slash whatever the hell you want to call me.
438000	448000	This stuff has been kind of frustrating for a while because it makes me go like, what I feel like when we do these stories on the show about release dates, which we have some tonight, right?
448000	454000	Tokyo Game Show happened this week. So they were talking about, oh, here's some big games that are coming come out and their release dates.
454000	466000	So I'm sitting here going, well, I want to talk about them on the show because these games do sound exciting, but I don't, I don't really want to hype these dates, because how often do these dates really end up sticking?
466000	480000	They probably won't. So I'm like, do I say they're there? It's a target date. That's kind of a term I've been liking lately as a release target, because it at least kind of puts that image out there that it's an ever moving thing.
480000	490000	We even do a segment here on the show called release dates. Now, granted, by the time we're talking about the games that are going to be out that week, I think the list is usually pretty accurate.
490000	496000	But even then we've had some games that we said on the show, they're going to be on shelves this week. And then suddenly there's something that happens that gets them delayed.
496000	504000	You know what I mean? I don't know. Like that part is just, it's frustrating. But and then I kind of look and go, does this really happen to like movies and stuff?
505000	515000	Well, yeah, actually it kind of does. It happens to movies a lot, right, Loki? Movies get moved around all the time. And a lot of that is strategical, usually, is that they don't want a movie to open up against another movie.
515000	522000	And that's what happened with the Warcraft movie, right? It got bumped back from like the holidays of 2016 to not compete with other stuff, right?
522000	527000	Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I never saw it. Didn't have an interest in seeing it. Don't care.
527000	537000	It wasn't bad. It wasn't bad. And then TigerConChat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says, don't be surprised if Nintendo delays the NX. You know it's a possibility. Oh, it's absolutely a possibility.
537000	544000	I just don't care at this point. And the reason for that is because like, I still don't know what the fuck it is. So why am I supposed to be excited about it?
544000	552000	Maybe that's an okay place to be. Maybe that's where we as gamers need to set our expectations right now is that you know what? We just don't know.
552000	560000	They're going to talk about it when they're going to talk about it. And let's just stop hyping up this thing that for all practical purposes doesn't exist.
560000	574000	Because as you start to set more and more and more and more expectations of, oh, the NX is going to be for sure a tablet and desktop thing because all these rumors say so that's going to let you stream your games live to the remote.
574000	582000	And it's going to have all this online platform. I don't know. I'm just making this stuff up at this point. But that's what a lot of these websites are doing is just really reaching with patents and all this other stuff.
582000	585000	Online platform.
585000	599000	Just bear with me here. All right. So you're setting these expectations that are may or may not be met. It's like you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. So I'm just kind of sitting here like, I'm just, I'm kind of like over it at this point. I'm just over it.
599000	613000	I will continue to talk about NX rumors and big things like that because this is a show that talks about gaming culture as well. And that conversation still continues to dominate a lot of gaming culture.
613000	623000	But that doesn't mean I'm not going to sit here at the same time and go, but maybe we should just stop letting that be a part of culture right now and just, you know, when they're going to announce it, they're going to announce it.
623000	635000	And we just don't freaking know at this point when that's going to be, and maybe y'all should just start realistically setting your expectations that NX could be a holiday 2017.
635000	647000	But the amiibos, the amiibos have a date of March the 4th. Oh, sure. Cause those, those retail days never change. Never change. Rock solid. Right?
648000	658000	That never changes ever. What day was beautiful Katamari coming out again? I don't know. Anyway, blast from the past there. Not everyone's going to get that reference and that's okay.
658000	670000	But anyway, uh, you know, you know what I mean? Those, those things, they're not really hard evidence, you know, retailers put stuff in their system. And yes, I know they've been hyping up Zelda for March for Wii U.
671000	682000	A variety of things could happen. They could just delay it. I mean, Final Fantasy 15 had the biggest pomp and circumstance event over the release date of the game and still delayed it.
682000	693000	So I'm sorry, but this whole Zelda is for sure coming out March thing holds just about as much water at this point. There's nothing to say that they couldn't release it on the Wii U and then the NX later.
693000	702000	Cause you know Nintendo loves the double dipping thing. I'm going to stop picking on them though. Cause I do, I, I want the NX to be great. I really do.
702000	712000	As a Nintendo fan, I want the NX to fucking kick a lot of ass. I want there to be an awesome Zelda game, an awesome Mario game, an awesome F-Zero. I'm just going to sneak that in there.
712000	720000	I want all that to be there, but I'm just like, you know what? I just need to just, just stop and just wait and see what's going to happen with this.
720000	724000	They feel very Apple to me. Like, dude, I'm sorry.
724000	727000	Is it because the Apple TV still hasn't happened? Is that what it is?
727000	730000	No, it's not because of the Apple TV. I don't give a shit about the Apple TV.
730000	731000	The Apple car?
731000	744000	They just, God, no, I'm glad that that's not a thing. No, it's basically just cause a lot of the Apple stuff seems to be like, here's how we're innovating or how, I'm sorry, here's how we're innovating.
745000	755000	You know, this is what you need, you know, versus like, here's what I want. They're like, no, but here's what you need.
755000	762000	It's like, you don't need that. You don't need headphones that don't are $160.
762000	765000	Are you saying that the NX is not going to have a headphone jack? Is that what you're saying?
765000	774000	I'm just saying that it's there. There's a lot of buzzwords going around about like how they're like, they're starting over. They're starting from scratch. They're taking it back to the root.
774000	781000	It's like none of this shit makes any, it means nothing to me. It means nothing because we don't know what the fuck it is.
781000	787000	All I'm thinking it is it's a goddamn system that's cartridge based, that's both portable and a home console.
787000	792000	Whoopity shit. That's not a fucking like, you know, innovative thing.
792000	802000	You know what's also portable and a home console? My phone. Because they play it at home and I play it while I'm walking around and going places.
803000	815000	So, so you, you've pre-ordered one of these affected games, the South Park game, but at the end of the day, you're just, the delay news just hits you with a resounding, meh, more time to play the first South Park game on PS4.
815000	825000	I've got like dozens of games I haven't played yet that I bought. So I mean, that's, I actually, we're just talking PlayStation library, dozens of games. We're talking Steam library, hundreds of games.
825000	831000	So I'm not like, whatever. Oh, darn, I will have a game of play. I'll just probably pick up Call of Duty or something.
832000	841000	Do you think we need to, I mean, you've, you've heard me talk a lot here about maybe we need to reevaluate all this hype behind release dates. What's your perspective on it?
841000	846000	Do you think we should just continue to go ahead and hype release dates? Do we need to think about this differently?
846000	852000	Just do it the way you've been doing it. Just don't get so bent out of shape when stuff gets delayed because you know what's going to happen. I mean, that's really the only thing.
852000	860000	They have to announce a date and maybe they weren't really firm on that date. And then it's like, you know what? We could release on that date, which is not going to be to the quality that we want. So we got to delay it.
860000	875000	I mean, that's what it is. I mean, as long as you're not like delaying it every single month or something like that and not talking with, you know, the people, the fans or the people that have it preordered and stuff, keeping that communication open is important.
876000	885000	You know, like Mighty No. 9 kind of did that. They didn't really talk to their fans too much and it kept getting delayed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed.
885000	899000	And then, especially, you know, if you're going to delay it, it better come out looking great. It better be fucking fantastic. Don't delay shit over and over and over again and then just have it come out being completely broken and unfinished. Because that's just stupid.
900000	908000	SSG100Matt in chat over at live.vongnetwork.com says, if you're violently mad about a game delay, let me introduce you to something. It's called going outside.
908000	917000	Well, and on top of that, like seriously, people like issuing death threats for game delays, how fucking childish are you? Would you fucking do that?
917000	922000	What is your view of the real world? Like seriously, what is your view of the world?
922000	926000	Like, I'm sorry, like I'm going like for perfect example today.
926000	932000	Do you threaten your mom when you don't get what you want for Christmas? Like, is that how this works?
932000	942000	Here's like, here's real life for you. On my way here to the show today, I decided to stop at Jack in the Box to get food because I was hungry and Jack in the Box has lagerous portions of food.
942000	951000	I stopped there and they're like, you know why that is, Loki? They cater to stoners. I know you don't smoke marijuana, but you still seem to benefit from the munchies galore thing they have at Jack in the Box.
951000	963000	So I went there and then like, um, I'm waiting, no one's answering, you know, the stupid, you know, the drive through. I'm like, okay, whatever. This is typical. They're fucking just minimum wage, whatever.
963000	976000	So finally, like there's like, hello? I'm laying in the manager comes out. Sorry, we're close for 30 minutes cause we just got robbed. I didn't go, you know, fuck you. I hope you die, you fucking asshole. Where's my goddamn food? I came here for food.
976000	988000	I mean that like, but you know, the car behind you did that. I mean, is that like, that's how those people that send death threats for like, I mean, can you, I can't imagine just like daily life with them.
988000	998000	You know, they're going to the grocery store. I'm sorry. They're locally. This is something that we have to do. If you don't bring a bag, you got to pay 10 cents for a bag, which is fucking stupid in its own right.
998000	1011000	But, um, you know, it's like, I'm sorry, you'd have to pay 10 cents for that bag. Fuck you. I hope your family dies in a fire. I hope your house burns down. Fuck you. I'm going to come to your house. I know where you live. I'm going to murder you in the goddamn face.
1011000	1020000	You know, it's like, do you do that laughing, but I'm laughing in a horror because this is what Twitter would be in real life. You don't like people don't do that.
1020000	1032000	And the reason they do that is because they're anonymous because if they knew who they were, if like you could like click on their name and see their face and where they live and all that shit, they wouldn't be fucking doing that shit because they'd be accountable for what they say.
1032000	1037000	But they're not. They're anonymous on the internet and they think that they could do whatever they want. So that's it.
1037000	1049000	Uh, let's see. Alan alchemy and Chad over at live.fognetwork.com says, I'm thinking of the chicken nuggets, super cyan lady. Now have you seen that video? This isn't even my final form. Have you seen that lady? They wouldn't sell her McNuggets at the drive through.
1049000	1057000	So she just like, she went like batshit crazy to drive it. It's really awkward to watch. Like you look at it and you just go, why did they not sell her nuggets ma'am? You've had enough.
1057000	1067000	I think it was like 10th. It was breakfast hours, so they didn't have McNuggets yet. She was probably still up from the night before because of the drugs, allegedly.
1067000	1075000	Uh, let's see. Dungeon Buster in chat says, all mess you up for delaying my game becomes all love pixels that look round and yummy.
1076000	1088000	As shown under Matt says, those people do not act like this in public. It's the anonymity of the internet that lets them get away with it. So there it is.
1088000	1098000	Uh, so we're going to, uh, we're going to just probably keep reporting these delays. So just, just anticipate if there's a big game coming out, it's probably going to get delayed.
1098000	1117000	I wonder if they could do something like with social media. I mean, I don't, I'm not against, you know, anonymity on social media, but like, you know, like how if you have a dispute on like eBay or something like that, when you, you know, file a complaint or something like that, like you get to see the seller's information, they get to see your information, like your contact information.
1117000	1128000	Can we do that? Like in social media, like if someone's being an absolute, you know, dipshit and fucking threatening people that like you file a complaint and you get to see who they are and they get to see who you are. I don't know.
1128000	1137000	It just opens a whole nother can of worms about that system being abused. There's more I could say on it, but that's just the long and the short.
1137000	1149000	No abuse on the internet. That's just ridiculous. I think at some point Twitter themselves has to step in, but Twitter is almost like Twitter would tell you they're too big and there's nothing they can do about it, but it's one of those.
1149000	1163000	Well, if you're that big, you need to be hiring some type of every situation, but you got to do something. It's too bad. Your direct messages now have read receipt stamps. Isn't that exciting?
1164000	1167000	So you can say, show me the receipts. Ah, yes, you did read that.
1168000	1184000	Alright, look, we got to change things up a little bit here. Let's just cut out the PR department. Let's just cut out the marketing. Let's cut all that out. Let's go back to when it's one or two people making the game and it'll be out when it's ready. That's how they do it in the indie scene.
1184000	1188000	I don't know. A lot of developers don't want to talk to fans or people.
1188000	1190000	Well, we've got one who wants to talk to us tonight.
1190000	1191000	Yeah, exactly.
1191000	1206000	I know. We're very excited about it. So we're going to bring him onto the show. His name is Sam. He's from a company called Remote Games and the game that they're working on is called Silent Earth. And so we're going to get Sam on the line here to talk about the game Silent Earth. Sam, are you here with us?
1206000	1208000	Yeah, I am. Can you hear me okay?
1208000	1210000	Yeah, we can. Welcome to OLR.
1210000	1212000	Hey, thanks for having me. This is pretty cool.
1212000	1218000	No problem. Thanks for being here. Tell us a little bit about your project, Silent Earth.
1219000	1247000	Okay, well, where do I start? Let's see. As far as what the game's about, it's a game that's very much thematically about simulations and how simulations reflect on reality versus looking at reality through the lens of a computer screen, like an interface of some kind.
1247000	1258000	How different is a simulation from something that you're looking through elsewhere? So it's really just about Missile Command.
1258000	1266000	Wait a minute, wait a minute. So you just told this whole big story and then you said that.
1266000	1271000	Sorry, I got super distracted and did a really bad intro for the game. Let me play again, okay? Sorry.
1271000	1275000	Sure, why not? We screw up all the time here on OLR. Why not?
1276000	1277000	You there with me?
1277000	1280000	Yeah, we are. I think we have a little bit of a delay though.
1280000	1281000	Hello?
1281000	1282000	Hi, we're here.
1282000	1283000	I can't hear you.
1283000	1289000	Uh-oh. Okay, these things happen. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to just drop the call here real quick.
1289000	1290000	Okay.
1290000	1300000	And I'm going to try calling him back. He had the video going. And so I'm going to tell him to try not doing video. And we're going to get him back on the line.
1300000	1308000	And of course, as live radio goes, sometimes these things happen and the chatters are having fun with it. Let's see.
1308000	1317000	Tiger Claw in chat says, some developers hire a PR person to talk to them because sometimes the developer opens their mouth saying things that would cause expectations to run really high.
1317000	1318000	And when the game comes out…
1318000	1320000	Okay, I'm here. Is that okay?
1320000	1322000	That's right. Hey, Sam, you here?
1322000	1332000	Loki, why don't you tell us about your gaming week here real quick while I try to fix this situation. We'll get into how is your gaming week and then we'll get Sam back on the line here.
1333000	1348000	Alright, so this week I basically played, well, basically just Ingress a little bit. And a little bit of Pokemon Go. I got that new update with the buddy Pokemon stuff.
1348000	1356000	And yeah, I completely still bitched about having to fix my son's phone. Thankfully it wasn't as hard to unroot it as I thought it would be.
1357000	1369000	Pretty much just running recovery and uninstalling Super User, which was pretty simple. And so he's up and running again as well. It's still a pain in the ass. I shouldn't have had to do that in the first place.
1369000	1382000	But we did that. And then I thought about picking up a Pokemon Go Plus, but then I've been hearing a lot of things regarding it. Just how it's basically just this $35 Poke Ball Waster.
1382000	1396000	It only throws the common, you know, your regular Poke Balls. It only throws it once and most of the time stuff escapes. Especially when you're high enough level in the game where you can't really catch stuff too easily.
1396000	1410000	So it's an absolute waste of money if you're kind of past level 20. On top of that, I mean I guess it could spin Poke Sops and stuff. So I still wanted to pick it up just to be able to hack it and all that.
1411000	1423000	I don't know. I just didn't find it. Because a lot of people are scalping them. They are selling them for over retail. And because people are dumb enough to buy them and I'm just not dumb enough to buy it for that kind of price.
1423000	1432000	Nor even $35. It's really kind of expensive. So I'm just not going to pick it up. The other stuff I've played, Nonstop Night. I've been playing a little bit more of that.
1433000	1451000	What else? Console gaming wise, I don't think I've really played anything. Which is too bad. But I'll probably go back. I've been working mentally. I'm mentally working because I haven't actually coded anything on my game.
1451000	1459000	But thankfully, as I posted on Twitter, I had an epiphany last night. Of course, where do you have most of your epiphanies? Sitting on the toilet.
1459000	1461000	TMI!
1461000	1475000	But no. I figured out. Because the thing that was giving me the hang up on that was my engine. Which was going to be almost like a voxel based engine. But I didn't really want it to be a voxel based engine.
1475000	1484000	I was struggling with how am I going to optimize this? How am I going to do certain things? And then last night it just kind of hit me how I'm going to do it.
1484000	1494000	And I was like, oh my god. This is so much easier than what I was thinking of doing. And just like, I completely am going to change how I was going to do it.
1494000	1506000	Alright. Glad to hear you've had an epiphany. Okay, I think I've got the Skype situation figured out. We're going to try to get Sam on the line the old fashioned way. Through the old telephone.
1506000	1514000	And we'll give him a call here. And finish his thoughts on his game. Hey Sam, you with us?
1514000	1516000	Yes I am. I can actually hear you now.
1517000	1526000	Skype sometimes has a really bad delay. And if there's WiFi and all that stuff it gets crazy. But I'm glad we were able to click in the back line to get you back on the show.
1526000	1533000	Yeah. I don't know how much of the game's intro you guys got. So I can sort of go over that again if you'd like.
1533000	1541000	Sure. We got a really nice description about your vision of the game. And then you kind of ended it with, yeah it's Missile Command.
1542000	1554000	Oh yeah. Maybe you missed a chunk or something. Okay cool. So I'll just go over it again. Basically it's sort of a new take on Missile Command.
1554000	1568000	That's put through, okay so what if we took the arcade formula of short rounds or levels with the intention of high difficulty for the sake of you having to start from the beginning over and over again.
1568000	1575000	What if we took that formula seriously? What does it mean dramatically? And so that's sort of my take on that, right?
1575000	1576000	Right.
1576000	1587000	In this case it's Missile Command. Because I had the idea from playing Missile Command, that's when I sort of came up with the idea of taking an arcade game formula seriously, right?
1588000	1602000	And it's just sort of talking about, I wouldn't say it's Missile Command on a, it's not a copy for copy of Missile Command. It's super updated, right?
1602000	1612000	So we focus on things like, for example, you have an upgradable missile with weapons that you can change in and out and there's lots of different ways to tailor your playstyle.
1612000	1615000	There is a narrative to the game and a whole bunch of other stuff.
1615000	1622000	Yeah, I noticed you were good enough to let me check out Silent Earth before our interview tonight, so I did check it out a little bit.
1622000	1627000	And admittedly at first, you know, when I fired up the game I said, oh, this is kind of, you know, it reminds me a lot of Missile Command.
1627000	1641000	But as I was starting to play it, like, not even like a minute into it, I realized, oh, but there's this giant shield that's protecting my town and oh, this energy meter is completely different from how Missile Command would have the missiles in it.
1641000	1654000	And oh, suddenly I got this upgrade that changes my weapon so it fires this big line across the screen that would kind of strategically change the way you might think about a game like this.
1654000	1664000	I guess maybe, I guess maybe I was like, what if somebody made Missile Command, like had the idea for Missile Command today, but had today's tools to do it? Is that fair to?
1665000	1677000	Yes, no, totally. You know, it's very much like a super modernization of that formula and then like, you know, like I said thematically, like how can we evaluate, like look at an arcade game thematically, right?
1677000	1687000	So yes, actually mechanically it's like a huge re-sort of imagining of what Missile Command was originally when it came out.
1687000	1701000	You know, what might it look like now? If they could, if they had access to like, you know, the decades of game design advancement and then like also like, you know, just like all the technology and all that stuff too.
1701000	1712000	Yeah. If you guys have a question for Sam, you can ask in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and we will ask him some of the questions from you guys here live listening to the show.
1712000	1718000	Silent Earth not actually released yet, but you guys are targeting early next year. Is that right?
1718000	1740000	Yes, that's what we want to do. Right now it's just me and one other guy, Command and Development team. I handle visuals, code, most of the writing and my buddy Thomas Hoey, who's based out of Bristol in the UK, handles all the audio and the audio programming.
1740000	1750000	We have a special software called S-Mod, which is our audio engine. And so he handles how the audio engine runs. And then I would just integrate that into the game.
1750000	1759000	Now, if I remember right from reading on the website, this is like it's a procedurally generated soundtrack? Like it's a soundtrack that's not always going to be the same?
1760000	1775000	Yeah, so it's not procedurally generated in the sense that we have an instrument generator that's making notes. We just have a huge bank of stems that the generator gets to pick from.
1775000	1782000	You'll always feel like a slightly different remixed version of the theme. Things will always be kind of different. The farther you go, the more...
1782000	1792000	We're working on this sort of sneaky little addition where the farther you go in the game, the more the stems unlock. So the diversity actually increases the more you play.
1792000	1803000	So yeah, unlocks are a big part of the game, but we actually wanted to make a game without any gameplay unlocks, aside from the upgrades.
1803000	1817000	So most of the things you'll be unlocking are like palettes, narrative is the biggest one, and then obviously the upgrades, but as you get them further on in the game.
1817000	1826000	So basically, the first time you encounter the wine mod, that means you'll have the wine mod forever, right? There's a force push mod that you may or may not have gotten to.
1826000	1839000	I think the build I sent you actually had a huge spike in difficulty. That may have prevented you from getting that, but you can get that force mod, and then the first time you get that, it'll be in the pool of things that you can get at any time.
1840000	1842000	Because you'll be playing it over and over.
1842000	1855000	So it encourages you, whereas the first time you play, you might be like, okay, so I've got missiles and this feels a little familiar. The further down the rabbit hole you go, so to speak, you start to get more and more elaborate and you get to keep these things with you.
1855000	1871000	Yes, yeah, 100%. The game definitely encourages you to keep playing it as far as mechanical interplay between all the different stuff goes, right?
1871000	1886000	So the game will be super basic when you start. By the time you edit, you'll have a much more depthful knowledge of the way the different bosses behave, the way different enemies behave, and that sort of stuff.
1886000	1893000	So we definitely want to have the game start really simple and then become complex, right? So the learning curve is a lot more shallower.
1894000	1913000	We have a chatter in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com named JKLOL, who actually gave a link to the game, which is interesting because the link actually goes to this other website, this TIGsource.com, which seems to be from what I'm not super familiar with it, but I'm guessing a lot of indie devs are. I haven't made a game.
1914000	1927000	Then you probably know this site better, Loki, but as I was starting to dig into it, I thought it was really cool because you were basically posting this big log of all the changes you've been making to the game, and you could really see how some of the feedback you were getting was influencing you.
1927000	1936000	And so I could see some of the earlier screenshots of your game and kind of go, oh, well, that's different from what I just played, so he's made some changes.
1936000	1942000	How is that process of being very, I guess, public with your game development?
1942000	1956000	Well, TIGsource is a great, great community. And a friend of me put it this way, because before I started on TIGsource, I was super about making this game in secrecy.
1956000	1965000	And I didn't even care about how much money I made on it, I just wanted it to be, to go out, and no one really did know what it was, and it to be kind of enigmatic.
1965000	1983000	But I went to IndieCade with a friend, and while we were there, he sort of convinced me that like, hey man, I know that more than working on this game and having it be like the thing that you want it to be when it comes out is not as important as making up a game later, right?
1983000	1994000	And so he said, even if you start showing all these people all the different feedback that you make and stuff, there's so many people who are going to see this game that just don't, like, have no clue what it is.
1994000	2004000	They haven't heard of it before or anything, right? So for a lot of these people, they will absolutely still get that magic, even though you're sort of like, even though on TIG, obviously, I'm not showing the game's guts, right?
2004000	2008000	Like, here's how we intend players to feel at this moment, and so on and so forth.
2008000	2021000	So the public part has only been good, you know? There's not been anything bad about it whatsoever, because the game has just improved since I started the TIG.
2021000	2028000	Yeah. It reminds me a lot of, just looking at the visuals, it reminds me a lot of like the Space Invaders Extreme or whatever that came out.
2028000	2033000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. I can see those parallels.
2033000	2039000	Speaking of the design and the look, we have a comment in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com from Dungeon Buster, who says,
2039000	2046000	The narrow orientation makes the action look a bit claustrophobic, but I'm guessing that's probably by design.
2046000	2053000	You know, that's a really good call out, is that Missile Command, you know, the old game, was on square TVs, basically, in the arcade and at home and so forth.
2053000	2062000	You know, when you decide that you're going to go with a cell phone for your platform, you went with the more, you know, a lot of games go widescreen with it,
2062000	2070000	but you went portrait with it, which I can totally see what Dungeon Buster is saying. It kind of gives a very different, more claustrophobic feel to the game,
2070000	2076000	especially if you are familiar with Missile Command. Was that a design choice? Like, what went into that?
2076000	2083000	Yeah, it was. It definitely was. When I started on the game, I realized that the vertical screen looked like I wanted to make a mobile game, right?
2083000	2090000	And so I realized that vertical games, I have always had more fun interacting with vertical games.
2090000	2098000	I don't know how much mobile gaming you guys do, but there's ridiculous fishing, obviously, the huge one down well.
2098000	2106000	You know, all these vertical games are just super fun to interact with, I think because that's how the phone is designed to be held,
2106000	2109000	and so you don't feel weird at all trying to control the phone like that.
2109000	2117000	Like, when you turn the phone sideways, there is a weird disconnect just from using the phone that way because you're not used to holding it like that.
2117000	2124000	Where it's like, you know, I can imagine if you try to hold, like, the first time you try to do claw hands on an Xbox controller or something like that,
2124000	2131000	it feels really weird and it takes you to get used to it. But the reason why I did edge of vertical is because it's very natural.
2131000	2139000	I also think that, you know, as far as the claustrophobic part of the game, it's claustrophobic by design for sure,
2139000	2145000	because I don't think that's a property of it being vertical, necessarily.
2145000	2153000	It's supposed to be that way because there's definitely tools like the different mods, for example, that will work with that,
2153000	2160000	and enemies that are designed to sort of, you know, make things more or less claustrophobic and intense and busy, right?
2160000	2161000	Right.
2161000	2162000	Right.
2163000	2168000	Looking at other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, I love this name and I hope I'm saying it right,
2168000	2175000	glorpbibbledop in chat says, I was looking for a game for my kid's iPad there too.
2175000	2180000	Do you think, first of all, luckiest kids in the world having an iPad at two, I'm guessing it might be a hamburger.
2180000	2181000	Yeah.
2181000	2183000	Do you think this would be easy enough for them?
2183000	2192000	I think, I don't think it would be easy enough to play.
2192000	2201000	I don't know if it's, like, what we plan on writing the game is necessarily going to be something I would, it would be like two-year-old material,
2201000	2206000	but it's also kind of one of those things that, like, when I was a kid, like really little, right, and was playing games,
2206000	2215000	I played Myst when I was five, and all of the content in Myst just went straight over my head, like narrative-wise, right?
2215000	2216000	Right.
2216000	2218000	And that's like a pretty intense story.
2218000	2220000	So, yeah, it might be great for a two-year-old.
2220000	2226000	I've never had a two-year-old play test it, but I don't see why any reason why playing it wouldn't be,
2226000	2229000	because it's all, there's no words in the game, the actual gameplay, right?
2229000	2232000	Like it's all just icons and like, you know, like shapes and stuff.
2232000	2240000	Yeah, I kind of think, based on my limited experience of the game, I kind of think a two-year-old's going to get a really big kick out of just like touching the screen and seeing the explosions happen.
2240000	2246000	I don't think they're going to understand the game at all, but I think they're just going to be like, ooh, when I touch it, it does things.
2246000	2247000	You know what I mean?
2247000	2248000	Right, totally.
2248000	2256000	Yeah, so I think, you know, as far as like, you know, a kid playing it and just like being able to interact with it mechanically, yeah, 100%.
2256000	2257000	Yeah.
2257000	2262000	And I mean, the controls are very, very simple, which you kind of have to have for a mobile game, right?
2262000	2266000	Yeah, I think I sent you a PC build, right?
2266000	2267000	Yes.
2267000	2268000	Yes, yeah.
2268000	2272000	The PC build is, you know, it's way more fun to interact with on the phone.
2272000	2281000	We're playing around with PC builds right now because we think it'd be cool to like have it on Steam just to, you know, have other, like basically to build interest for the mobile version.
2281000	2286000	But we're not entirely sure on that yet.
2286000	2289000	Most likely we will pursue Steam now.
2289000	2296000	Now tell us a little bit about, you know, because we've been talking a little bit in the first half of our show tonight about, you know, why games get delayed and all this good stuff.
2296000	2301000	And, you know, obviously what I played of your game was good.
2301000	2306000	I mean, it needs, you know, it probably just needs that polish, like a start screen and all that stuff.
2306000	2308000	But for the most part, it seems like you've got a good game in there.
2308000	2322000	So what are you kind of working on between, tell us a little bit about what it is you work on between now where your game is, you know, shaping up to be the game and let's say March or whatever when you are planning to release.
2322000	2325000	I'm throwing that out there based on the winter.
2325000	2328000	Right. Well, you know, can I give you a little history of the game's development?
2328000	2329000	Please.
2329000	2330000	That might help frame it.
2330000	2331000	Absolutely.
2331000	2338000	So like, so like I started on the game, like it's been a prototype, right, for like most of its life, which is like five years.
2338000	2342000	And this game doesn't feel like a five year game.
2342000	2352000	It's something like I've worked on other stuff and totally had this, like its progress isn't it five years and I totally had it on the back burner and worked on it and tweaked it.
2352000	2356000	I moved recently and decided to start working on it full time.
2356000	2358000	And that was back in January.
2358000	2363000	And it's just been, it's been this really, like the game did not play the same way back then.
2363000	2365000	It was way slower.
2365000	2368000	The game was like way more zoomed out.
2368000	2372000	The action was more, it was more like a zen game.
2372000	2376000	Like it wasn't even hard really to play.
2376000	2380000	And I ended up turning it into like more of a full fledged action game and it worked out really well.
2380000	2392000	So being that, being that it's just now become like what, what I think it's going to, like it's most resembling version of its like final form or whatever, you know, at this point we're just adding content.
2392000	2397000	So the build I sent you is just really like a super vertical slice of the game, right?
2397000	2399000	There's like three rounds and two upgrades.
2399000	2409000	None of the narrative stuff, you know, none of the, like there's no unlockable system, the round just repeats, there's no menus.
2409000	2415000	So as far as mechanical systems and all that go and like how it plays, it's going to stay about the same, right?
2415000	2419000	But we definitely, you know, at this point are just at the content stage.
2419000	2422000	Interesting. So it's like you have, you have the core of the game.
2422000	2430000	You have that, I don't know, whatever you want to call it, the, the, the chewy center or whatever the game is done, but now it's about building all the rest that kind of goes around it.
2430000	2436000	This is probably why they say in game design, what, like the first 90 or the last 10% takes as long as the first 90%, something like that.
2436000	2446000	Yeah, exactly. Cause, cause right now, you know, it was actually a pretty big effort for me to just get it to the point where it feels as good as it does.
2446000	2448000	And I really confident in how the game feels to play.
2448000	2453000	So, so I really feel like that that's most of the work, right.
2453000	2464000	Is getting, getting a concept that's legitimately fun because I feel like that, you know, that's something that like even people who have been making games for a really long time, like not me, right?
2464000	2467000	Like I'm, you know, I'm just an independent developer.
2467000	2473000	So like even people who have been making games for a really long time sometimes struggle to come up with games that are legitimately fun when you play them.
2473000	2484000	So that's the hardest part, but now I just have to, you know, flesh that out and explore the concepts in it and really try and just create a ton of content that really highlights all the aspects of the design.
2484000	2492000	I got to mention some of the chatters here when you talked about how it's been kind of like a concept that's been evolving for five years.
2492000	2496000	You know, our very own Loki here has been working on his own game called it's time to car.
2496000	2498000	And a lot of people have been giving him crap.
2498000	2499000	Oh, I stopped working on that.
2499000	2501000	Yeah, right. It's been, it's taken you years. Right.
2501000	2505000	But some folks in chat like JKLL says here that Loki five years.
2505000	2508000	So it's all because I'm not working on that one anymore.
2508000	2510000	I have another one that we're going to longer.
2510000	2511000	So it's fine.
2511000	2516000	All right. Let me I know we're a little bit past time here and I appreciate you staying on through all the tech difficulties and all that stuff.
2516000	2517000	But I want to ask you at least one.
2517000	2518000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2518000	2527000	I want to ask you at least one more question here from SSG100 Matt in our chat room saying, have you taken the game to any conventions or shows to have people demo it?
2527000	2530000	If not, do you plan to take it on the road to conventions?
2530000	2532000	Yes, we have.
2532000	2539000	We, we, we, we went to PixelFest, which, so I'm based out of Richmond, Virginia.
2540000	2551000	And we took that came to PixelFest, which is a tiny little, little, that was the first year they did it was this year is a tiny little festival in Norfolk, Virginia.
2551000	2556000	And then I went to IndieCade and got one of their show and tell tables.
2556000	2559000	And I think that's IndieCade East in New York City.
2559000	2564000	And then we are hoping we just submitted it for MagFest.
2564000	2566000	So we will see how that goes.
2566000	2567000	Well, good luck.
2567000	2570000	MagFest is the, I think the only East Coast show I do now.
2570000	2572000	So I'm going to be there in 2017.
2572000	2573000	So I'll cross my fingers for you guys.
2573000	2574000	Awesome.
2574000	2576000	I hope you guys get in so I can play this game at MagFest.
2576000	2578000	You have some people cheering for that in the chat as well.
2578000	2581000	SSG100 Matt who asked that question is a MagFest goer.
2581000	2583000	So best of luck.
2583000	2584000	I hope you guys get in there.
2584000	2586000	Yeah, well, we really appreciate it.
2586000	2590000	So if people want to check out the progress on Silent Earth,
2590000	2594000	I would give you the link to the dev blog, but it's a little lengthy.
2594000	2598000	So I'm going to encourage you to get the link from your company website,
2598000	2601000	which is remote-games.com.
2601000	2606000	And if they want to follow you guys on Twitter, it's at remotegamesco,
2606000	2607000	C-O, right?
2607000	2608000	Yes, remotegamesco, yeah.
2608000	2610000	And feel free to follow me also.
2610000	2617000	That's just at samloesschen, S-A-M-L-O-E-S-C-H-E-N.
2617000	2620000	And I'll tweet that out from the OLR account so people can follow you
2620000	2623000	and continue to watch this game progress
2623000	2628000	and see what the concept of Missile Command might look like
2628000	2631000	with 2016 bells and whistles on it.
2631000	2633000	Yeah, yeah, definitely.
2633000	2634000	Well, I appreciate your time.
2634000	2637000	Thanks for bearing with the technical difficulties
2637000	2640000	and for talking about the game.
2640000	2641000	It's been awesome.
2641000	2642000	Gosh, thank you.
2642000	2645000	We're an indie podcast, and we love to support indie developers,
2645000	2646000	and we want to wish you the best.
2646000	2648000	And I just want to say personally I think you made the right call
2648000	2651000	on being more transparent with your game's progress
2651000	2654000	because I think everybody wants to,
2654000	2656000	and to use a person's name as a verb here,
2656000	2659000	everybody wants to Beyoncé the industry
2659000	2661000	and drop their CD with no announcement and everything like that
2661000	2662000	and shock everybody,
2662000	2666000	but you can only Beyoncé the industry if you are Beyoncé.
2666000	2668000	Yeah, if you've already got the audience.
2668000	2669000	Exactly.
2669000	2670000	I 100% agree.
2670000	2672000	I think you made the right call there,
2672000	2674000	and I think this way it allows people to really kind of see
2674000	2675000	what you're going through there,
2675000	2679000	and I think people who might be considering developing their own game
2679000	2681000	can kind of learn from some of the stuff you've been going through.
2681000	2684000	Yeah, well, it's 100% a labor of love.
2684000	2691000	I'm making this my full-time job.
2691000	2694000	We 100% are doing this off of savings,
2694000	2696000	so we're doing this to make this,
2696000	2698000	we want to make it as good as we possibly can be,
2698000	2700000	and like what you're saying,
2700000	2703000	making it public and making it a transparent process
2703000	2705000	had it done so much for that.
2705000	2707000	You have to wonder how some other games
2707000	2709000	that have come out in the past year
2709000	2712000	would have done through a more transparent process like that,
2712000	2714000	but I'll leave it at that.
2714000	2715000	Sam, I want to wish you the best.
2715000	2716000	I totally agree with you.
2716000	2718000	All right, well, you guys have a nice night.
2718000	2719000	Thank you for having me on.
2719000	2720000	You too.
2720000	2721000	I want to wish you the best of luck with Silent Earth,
2721000	2722000	and thanks for being on tonight.
2722000	2723000	You take care.
2723000	2724000	Yep, take it easy. Bye.
2724000	2725000	All right, bye-bye.
2725000	2728000	All right, that was Sam from Remote Games
2728000	2730000	who's making Silent Earth,
2730000	2732000	and check that out, the screenshots and everything.
2732000	2734000	Again, that's remote-games.com.
2734000	2735000	You can follow him on Twitter as well,
2735000	2737000	at remotegamesco.
2737000	2739000	Stoppy in our chat room says,
2739000	2740000	Brave man.
2740000	2742000	Yeah, to putting all that out there publicly,
2742000	2744000	but again, I think he's right in saying
2744000	2746000	I noticed that community was very supportive,
2746000	2748000	and it's funny, we were talking earlier
2748000	2750000	about how there's a lot of nasty people
2750000	2752000	out there on Twitter and so forth,
2752000	2754000	but he kind of chose this site
2754000	2757000	that really kind of caters to people like him,
2757000	2759000	which I think is the way to do it,
2759000	2760000	to be public with something like that,
2760000	2762000	so that's great.
2762000	2765000	And yes, I am not working on that game.
2765000	2767000	There is another game.
2767000	2768000	No, seriously, there is another game
2768000	2771000	I was working on before I started
2771000	2773000	that other It's Time to Car
2773000	2775000	that I am still working on now,
2775000	2778000	and that hopefully now that I've had this epiphany,
2778000	2781000	you will actually see something for it
2781000	2785000	because now I know where to go now with it.
2785000	2787000	Just now?
2787000	2790000	No, from earlier.
2790000	2792000	No, I had no epiphany now,
2792000	2794000	but from earlier, what I'm saying,
2794000	2797000	because I figured out how I'm going to do the engine
2797000	2799000	so now I can build the engine.
2799000	2800000	Gotcha, gotcha.
2800000	2802000	All right, well, best of luck to you,
2802000	2804000	and best of luck to Sam as well,
2804000	2807000	and I kind of neglected to tell him this,
2807000	2809000	but Missile Command is one of my
2809000	2812000	all-time old-school favorite arcade games,
2812000	2814000	so even though we had a little joke
2814000	2816000	and a laugh there in the beginning about,
2816000	2817000	well, basically, it's Missile Command,
2817000	2819000	it really does kind of feel like
2819000	2823000	what that might look like with a 2016 tool.
2823000	2824000	When they developed Missile Command,
2824000	2827000	they did it for what, a four-bit system
2827000	2830000	that was very capable of holding only a little bit of data,
2830000	2832000	and now with a game like Silent Earth,
2832000	2837000	we can talk about a soundtrack that kind of changes itself
2837000	2839000	as you progress further into the game
2839000	2842000	and unlock more measures and so forth.
2842000	2843000	It's a very different thing.
2843000	2845000	Yeah, it really does remind me of a remix take
2845000	2847000	on those old classic arcade games
2847000	2850000	like the Pac-Man Championship Edition
2850000	2852000	or the extreme Namco games that they have.
2852000	2853000	Well, let's actually,
2853000	2855000	what a perfect segue into my gaming week
2855000	2857000	and talk about the video games I've been playing this week
2857000	2859000	because I've been spending a lot of time this week
2859000	2861000	with Pac-Man Championship Edition 2,
2861000	2863000	which came out this week on PlayStation 4
2863000	2865000	as the platform I picked it up on,
2865000	2868000	but I think it's also on Xbox One and it's on PC as well.
2868000	2871000	And I've got to say, I'm having a ton of fun with it.
2871000	2873000	Like, the music is really, really good.
2873000	2875000	I think I kind of made a joke
2875000	2877000	that they should have called the game Pac-Rave
2877000	2879000	because that's what the music kind of feels like to me.
2879000	2882000	And you know, I loved Championship Edition
2882000	2884000	and I love DX, and it's really interesting
2884000	2889000	because I find it hard to play the original Pac-Man these days.
2889000	2892000	I mean, you know, if I walk by a Ms. Pac-Man machine
2892000	2894000	or something at an arcade, which I actually did,
2894000	2896000	we were at a downtown arcade this week,
2896000	2899000	a friend of ours was in from out of town, so we took him to the coin-op.
2899000	2901000	You know, that bar?
2901000	2903000	Yeah, all the old school.
2903000	2905000	So we took him to coin-op and we actually,
2905000	2907000	they have a Ms. Pac-Man machine there.
2907000	2909000	So you have to play Ms. Pac-Man, right?
2909000	2911000	But you kind of go, okay, I'm playing this for the memories.
2911000	2915000	This isn't exactly, you know, a game that might hold my attention
2915000	2918000	in a marathon style in the year 2016.
2918000	2920000	But what I think the Championship Edition
2920000	2922000	and the Championship Edition Deluxe
2922000	2924000	and now part two bring into that is that
2924000	2928000	it really takes a new spin on the classic formula
2928000	2930000	that really, like, draws you in.
2930000	2934000	And so, you know, with DX and DX2, it's speed.
2934000	2936000	A lot of it is speed
2936000	2938000	and really running through those mazes and the precision.
2938000	2942000	So with DX2, they changed a couple big, big things from DX,
2942000	2945000	and one of the biggest things they changed is
2945000	2948000	Pac-Man can collide with ghosts now,
2948000	2951000	which you kind of take a step back from that for a minute
2951000	2954000	and go, well, wasn't that the whole part of Pac-Man
2954000	2956000	was not to touch ghosts?
2956000	2957000	You can touch ghosts now.
2957000	2961000	So the whole thing is, but you can touch the ghost three times.
2961000	2964000	And when you bump into the ghost the third time,
2964000	2967000	the ghost gets mad, and he'll move faster
2967000	2970000	and chase you around the maze a little bit more aggressively.
2970000	2972000	So it sounds like a really simple thing,
2972000	2974000	but it really changes the way you move through mazes
2974000	2976000	because you kind of think to yourself,
2976000	2978000	oh, no big deal if I bump into this train one time
2978000	2980000	while I'm trying to eat these other dots.
2980000	2982000	But if it's like completely in the way,
2982000	2984000	I might have to think differently about where I'm going.
2984000	2987000	The other big change that they did, which I don't like as much,
2987000	2989000	is that when you eat the dot,
2989000	2992000	the ghost trains start to move at these hyper speeds,
2992000	2994000	like they move super fast.
2994000	2996000	But what you see in the maze is a wire frame,
2996000	3001000	like a white wire frame of here's where the ghost may go.
3001000	3003000	And so you have to catch the ghost
3003000	3006000	by predicting where it's going to go on the white wire frame,
3006000	3010000	which it's neat in the way that it's fast paced,
3010000	3014000	but it really kind of slows the game down in a way too
3014000	3016000	because you eat the power pellet,
3016000	3018000	and then it's like you're in this chase phase.
3018000	3020000	And it's a really hard phase to control.
3020000	3022000	Like if you're trying to go for a really higher score,
3022000	3026000	it's really hard sometimes to eat the ghost train fast.
3026000	3029000	And you might get screwed on your score
3029000	3031000	just because the ghost train is not where you need it to be.
3031000	3033000	It didn't go down the right path.
3033000	3035000	So I don't know, that element of it I don't like as much,
3035000	3038000	but it's kind of a minor complaint all things considered.
3038000	3042000	I like a lot of the visual flair they have in the game,
3042000	3045000	really a step up from the deluxe.
3045000	3047000	I mean, the music's really good as it was in deluxe.
3047000	3050000	Now you have this whole thing where like when you eat the fruit
3050000	3052000	after clearing the board from a ghost train,
3052000	3055000	Pac-Man kind of flies through the middle of the board
3055000	3056000	and lands on a new board.
3056000	3058000	It's this really cool little visual flair
3058000	3061000	that the music just kind of adds to that environment and everything.
3061000	3063000	So I really like what they did in that way.
3063000	3066000	But I guess the only negatives I could really say too,
3066000	3068000	as well as besides the wireframe thing,
3068000	3071000	is that they have this whole adventure mode that's in the game,
3071000	3074000	and it's kind of a throwaway mode to me.
3074000	3077000	And if you saw like the boss ghosts in the trailer and all that stuff,
3077000	3079000	that's all in the adventure mode.
3079000	3083000	And all the boss thing is is like six mazes rapid fire succession back to back.
3083000	3086000	You don't actually like attack the ghost, right?
3086000	3087000	It's really none of that.
3087000	3089000	So it's just a visual flair thing.
3089000	3091000	It's cool the first time you see it.
3091000	3094000	But honestly, adventure mode really struck me as like a throwaway thing.
3094000	3097000	It's really all about the competition mode,
3097000	3100000	which is very similar to the core structure of Championship Edition
3100000	3102000	and Championship Edition Deluxe.
3102000	3105000	But the game's priced, right?
3105000	3110000	It's about $13.99, $12.99, somewhere in between that $10 to $15 range.
3110000	3111000	And I think that's a fair price.
3111000	3113000	They're not asking $60 for it.
3113000	3114000	They're asking between $10 and $15.
3114000	3116000	I think that's a good way to do it.
3116000	3118000	So I like that.
3118000	3120000	Let's see.
3120000	3124000	ActDeftInChat says, ghost get irritated if you touch them.
3124000	3127000	I can imagine Pac-Man going like, I'm not touching you.
3127000	3130000	Well, you have to kind of assess that as you're moving really fast through the maze
3130000	3134000	is that do you have enough room to bump into the ghost one time
3134000	3135000	so you don't set him off?
3135000	3137000	And actually, if you're playing on a more advanced mode,
3137000	3139000	you can only bump into them one time.
3139000	3143000	But you can still bump into them, which is a very new thing for Pac-Man.
3143000	3146000	So I thought that was a pretty neat concept on an old game.
3146000	3149000	Other than that, the only game I've been playing a lot a lot of this week
3149000	3152000	is World of Warcraft because of the expansion I've been catching up
3152000	3154000	from being out from Dragon Con.
3154000	3156000	I hit max level. I hit 110.
3156000	3157000	So I guess that says something.
3157000	3160000	I really think it might be early to say,
3160000	3164000	and I really have to see what the support for this expansion looks like
3164000	3167000	because with some of the previous World of Warcraft expansions,
3167000	3169000	especially the last one, Draenor,
3169000	3173000	the support is almost what killed the expansions because there was hardly any.
3173000	3176000	So we really have to see what that looks like.
3176000	3180000	But I can just say the outside the box experience,
3180000	3183000	I think this is the best expansion since Wrath of the Lich King.
3183000	3184000	I really do.
3184000	3188000	And most people stopped playing WoW after Wrath of the Lich King.
3188000	3193000	So I think that kind of says a lot about the quality of this expansion.
3193000	3197000	I really like some of the choices they made with it.
3197000	3199000	I think they're learning some things from their competition.
3199000	3204000	I see elements of things I enjoy about Final Fantasy XIV in World of Warcraft.
3204000	3208000	So I knew these MMOs could only help each other out in that regard.
3208000	3210000	So that's really exciting to see.
3210000	3212000	Still love me some Final Fantasy XIV,
3212000	3215000	but that game is getting a patch in two weeks.
3215000	3219000	So I still feel like I have enough ample time to really sink into WoW,
3219000	3222000	and then I'll probably go back to Final Fantasy XIV to check out that new patch.
3222000	3225000	So yes, I'm paying for two MMOs right now.
3225000	3227000	I don't know how long that's going to last,
3227000	3230000	but I guess it depends on where the people are. We'll see.
3230000	3232000	But that was my gaming week.
3232000	3234000	It was pretty much those two games.
3234000	3236000	We're going to get into some gaming news here.
3236000	3239000	I do first, though, want to plug a few things coming up.
3239000	3241000	Did you like tonight's interview?
3241000	3244000	Guess what? With Jamie being on hiatus,
3244000	3247000	it kind of motivated me for more content on the show
3247000	3249000	to really try to book more interviews.
3249000	3251000	I always wanted us to get more interviews on the show.
3251000	3252000	I think they're a lot of fun.
3252000	3253000	Hey, I got some good news for you guys.
3253000	3256000	We have interviews booked through mid-October right now.
3256000	3259000	So I'm going to tell you about some of the guests we have coming up on OLR.
3259000	3261000	Are you guys ready for this? This is awesome.
3261000	3264000	Next week, Aethernaut is going to be here.
3264000	3267000	Aethernaut is going to be one of the performers at GX4.
3267000	3269000	He's a musician, and he's very well known.
3269000	3272000	He used some violins on stage when he was performing and so forth,
3272000	3274000	kind of incorporates that with Chiptunes.
3274000	3276000	So really excited to welcome him to the show.
3276000	3278000	Aethernaut is going to be here next week.
3278000	3286000	On October 9th, our pal Ryan showed off a game at PAX West
3286000	3288000	called Monsters and Monocles.
3288000	3291000	And that game got a lot of great feedback.
3291000	3293000	And that's available on Early Access on Steam.
3293000	3296000	So Monsters and Monocles is going to be here on October 9th.
3296000	3300000	And guess what? October 23rd.
3300000	3302000	Very excited about this.
3302000	3306000	O. A. Rock Studios is going to be here on the show.
3306000	3308000	You may not know them by their name,
3308000	3312000	but they made a game on Steam called Cat President.
3312000	3316000	And they will be here on OLR October 23rd.
3316000	3319000	So we will talk to them about Cat President
3319000	3323000	and what the inspiration for a game like that might have been.
3323000	3327000	No, I'm sure it's the election craziness and all that stuff,
3327000	3330000	but we're going to laugh it off, some of the similarities between that
3330000	3334000	and Suki Bancho, Sochao Renowii and all that stuff we went through
3334000	3335000	like eight years ago.
3335000	3339000	So very excited to welcome them to the show on October 23rd.
3339000	3343000	So if you or somebody you know that's developing a game
3343000	3347000	or is a part of gaming culture might want to come on OLR,
3347000	3348000	be sure to contact us.
3348000	3352000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
3352000	3353000	So very excited about that.
3353000	3356000	And then of course, as we're moving into November,
3356000	3360000	on 20 November, Episode 666 of OLR,
3360000	3363000	which will be a devilishly good time.
3363000	3367000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
3367000	3371000	at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase FLOWER.
3371000	3373000	Very excited about all that stuff that's coming up.
3373000	3377000	There will be no show, however, on October 2nd.
3377000	3379000	We will not be here live that night.
3379000	3382000	Unfortunately, that is because myself and DarkSakura,
3382000	3384000	even though she's on hiatus for the show,
3384000	3389000	she does have the weekend off work, so she can attend GamerX4 with me,
3389000	3393000	Loki sadly, not going, you know, family, kids, all that stuff.
3393000	3395000	We're going to be at GamerX4.
3395000	3398000	VOG Network does have a table once again at the show,
3398000	3400000	so you can come up and say hi to us throughout the show.
3400000	3402000	I'll be there. DarkSakura will be there.
3402000	3404000	Some of our other VOG Network hosts will be there.
3404000	3407000	Extifer from guys on the show will be there.
3407000	3409000	For those of you who used to listen to Hoard House, he's there.
3409000	3411000	Shane may be there.
3411000	3413000	He's on the fence right now, if he can make it work or not.
3413000	3415000	So he may be there.
3415000	3418000	I know Captain Spike from Game Buoy,
3418000	3420000	also First Make Slidekick, also from Game Buoy.
3420000	3421000	They will also be there.
3421000	3424000	So we're going to have a lot of representation there at GamerX.
3424000	3426000	So check us out there at the show.
3426000	3430000	Also, we're going to be having a panel called the Indie Gamer Super Show
3430000	3434000	on October 2nd, actually, that Sunday at 2 p.m.
3434000	3436000	We're one of the last panels of the event,
3436000	3439000	so I'm a little nervous about the fact it's after checkout time,
3439000	3441000	but at the same time, you know,
3441000	3444000	the Sunday at last year's thing was still pretty hopping,
3444000	3447000	so I think we'll get a lot of folks that want to check that out
3447000	3449000	who aren't ready yet to say goodbye to the con.
3449000	3452000	So if you're one of those folks, be sure to mark it on your schedule
3452000	3454000	to join us for the Indie Gamer Super Show
3454000	3458000	October 2nd at 2 p.m. at GamerX4.
3458000	3462000	VOG Network, of course, will be at the Expo Hall throughout the show,
3462000	3466000	right in the same room with companies like Blizzard, Microsoft.
3466000	3468000	I don't have the list right in front of me,
3468000	3470000	but I know they've got a lot of cool stuff this year,
3470000	3472000	so excited to see that.
3472000	3474000	All right, let's move on.
3474000	3476000	Let's get into some gaming news for the week.
3476000	3478000	Loki, starting us off.
3478000	3480000	So one thing that was coming out of Tokyo Game Show
3480000	3484000	was some actual gameplay for Metal Gear Survive.
3486000	3490000	You know, that kind of, well, we're Konami,
3490000	3492000	we have to make something for Metal Gear,
3492000	3495000	but I don't know, it looks stupid.
3495000	3498000	But someone decided, hey, you know what,
3498000	3502000	let's ask Kojima and see what he thinks about Metal Gear Survive.
3502000	3504000	And of course, you know, one of the first things he says is,
3504000	3506000	ah, that has nothing to do with me.
3506000	3509000	It's not my game, it has nothing to do with me.
3510000	3511000	Sorry.
3511000	3513000	So then finally, you know, he asked, you know,
3513000	3515000	they asked him what was he thinking about,
3515000	3517000	you know, how it fits in with the rest of the series.
3517000	3519000	He says the Metal Gear games have been about
3519000	3521000	political fiction and espionage.
3521000	3524000	Where do zombies fit in with that?
3524000	3527000	He basically said if he had worked on the game,
3527000	3529000	it would have had mechs in it.
3529000	3531000	So...
3531000	3534000	I just like how he's like, ah, that's not me.
3534000	3535000	Yeah, it wasn't me.
3535000	3536000	That's not mine.
3536000	3537000	I didn't make that.
3537000	3539000	Not something I want to be involved with
3539000	3541000	or associated with when the time comes.
3541000	3543000	Something that he is working on, of course,
3543000	3545000	is that Death Stranding game,
3545000	3547000	which we still know too much about.
3547000	3549000	However, one of the things we do know now
3549000	3552000	is that it is an open world action game.
3552000	3557000	No, not really sure what exactly the details are of it.
3557000	3559000	Basically saying, you know,
3559000	3564000	that he basically wants to,
3565000	3567000	I don't know, he's waiting to unveil
3567000	3570000	more information about it, of course.
3570000	3573000	But, yeah, basically saying, though,
3573000	3576000	that he is working on the engine still.
3576000	3580000	They have selected one and, you know,
3580000	3583000	basically they will accommodate 4K and HDR.
3583000	3584000	Wouldn't that be funny?
3584000	3587000	Which I imagine most engines are going to be nowadays.
3587000	3590000	So, yeah, well, hopefully next E3
3590000	3592000	we'll hear some more about the game.
3592000	3596000	Going back to the Metal Gear that's not really a Metal Gear
3596000	3598000	or what have you, do you think,
3598000	3600000	I mean, when you hear that, like,
3600000	3602000	okay, it's kind of like they're just basically
3602000	3604000	reusing the assets from Metal Gear.
3604000	3605000	It is exactly that.
3605000	3607000	Like, I watched some of the gameplay from it
3607000	3610000	and it's like, yeah, we had all this desert.
3610000	3612000	That's why it's in the desert.
3612000	3614000	It's like, oh, well, it was in the water,
3614000	3616000	but it's actually the desert now.
3616000	3618000	It's because they had a bunch of desert assets
3618000	3620000	and then they just kind of mocked something else.
3620000	3622000	I got to admit, I got to admit, look,
3622000	3624000	I understand the controversy and everything,
3624000	3628000	but I got to admit it's a little clever on Konami's part
3628000	3630000	to get the most bang for their buck
3630000	3632000	because they did spend, to be fair,
3632000	3635000	they did spend a lot of money on Metal Gear Solid 5.
3635000	3637000	I don't know how much of it they made back,
3637000	3640000	but regardless, why not make a little more off of it?
3640000	3642000	Then the thing that looks interesting about it, though,
3642000	3643000	is the co-op.
3643000	3644000	I mean, that would be kind of cool
3644000	3646000	because you're being able to, like,
3646000	3648000	kind of take down stuff, you know,
3648000	3650000	with friends, so that was kind of neat,
3650000	3653000	but, yeah, it's just really, really weird.
3653000	3655000	I don't know.
3655000	3657000	Well, we asked some of our users on social media
3657000	3659000	to tell us their thoughts on what's going on
3659000	3660000	with Metal Gear Survive,
3660000	3662000	and if you're interested in it or not.
3662000	3664000	And, of course, you can follow us over on Google+,
3664000	3667000	google.com slash plus orange lounge radio,
3667000	3670000	where actdef said, I'm not interested in it one bit.
3670000	3673000	It's just Konami doing what Konami does best right now,
3673000	3676000	milking a franchise until it stops giving them money
3676000	3677000	It's sad.
3677000	3681000	Over on Facebook, over at, of course,
3681000	3684000	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio,
3684000	3686000	William Murderface said, it looks like Left 4 Dead
3686000	3688000	with the Metal Gear skin, so probably not.
3688000	3690000	It seems like a cheap knockoff, and without Kojima,
3690000	3692000	I wonder if they can maintain the direction
3692000	3694000	and allure of the series,
3694000	3696000	especially given their shenanigans
3696000	3697000	over the last few years.
3697000	3699000	I'm surprised they just didn't, like, rebrand it.
3699000	3701000	Like, just use the engine, use, like,
3701000	3702000	kind of the assets that you have,
3702000	3704000	and rebrand it as something else,
3704000	3706000	you'll come up with some new main characters,
3706000	3707000	and that's it.
3707000	3708000	But I guess, you know, they want to have
3708000	3711000	that Metal Gear brand name attached to it.
3711000	3714000	It's just, it doesn't really feel like a Metal Gear game.
3714000	3717000	I mean, it's kind of, I don't know,
3717000	3720000	it's like kind of how, what they did with Lords of Shadows,
3720000	3722000	where it was supposed to be its own thing,
3722000	3724000	and it's like, oh, we'll throw Castlevania on there.
3724000	3727000	But it's not really a true Castlevania game.
3727000	3729000	Dartetsuya pointed out, is it just me,
3729000	3732000	or does the new director look almost exactly like Hideo Kojima?
3732000	3735000	Well, clone him.
3735000	3739000	If you won't work for Konami, I'll clone you.
3739000	3743000	Now, here's two very different sides of the coin,
3743000	3744000	but with the same answer.
3744000	3745000	You ready?
3745000	3747000	So Andy R. said,
3747000	3749000	I've only played the last few Metal Gear games.
3749000	3751000	So far, this one hasn't hooked me,
3751000	3753000	partially because I'm tired of zombies,
3753000	3755000	partially because fuck Konami,
3755000	3757000	partially because it just doesn't look good.
3757000	3760000	A very sound, reasonable explanation, right?
3760000	3762000	Then listen to this side, from Cane I Am.
3762000	3765000	Is there even enough words in the English language
3765000	3767000	to express my displeasure with Konami?
3767000	3769000	Answer, no, no, there is not enough words
3769000	3771000	in the English language to properly articulate
3771000	3773000	my extreme displeasure with them.
3773000	3775000	Suffice to say, if they were on fire
3775000	3777000	and my genitals contained the only source of liquid
3777000	3780000	to extinguish the raging inferno of bullshittery
3780000	3783000	that is Konami, I would relieve myself across the street
3783000	3786000	in full sight of them, then sit and roast marshmallows
3786000	3788000	over their engulfed walls.
3788000	3791000	Sit and roast marshmallows over their engulfed corpse
3791000	3794000	and drink beer until finally I lost interest.
3796000	3799000	As have most of the people in this Metal Gear franchise.
3799000	3802000	Also a sound and reasonable explanation, right?
3802000	3805000	It's just, it's hard to like, after Konami just was such,
3805000	3808000	they were such assholes to fucking Kojima.
3808000	3810000	It's like, oh hey!
3810000	3813000	We brought back that game you guys like with zombies
3813000	3816000	because I know you guys love zombies.
3817000	3821000	It's like asking marketing people with someone,
3821000	3824000	or not necessarily marketing people,
3824000	3826000	like asking executives what people like
3826000	3828000	for games and stuff.
3828000	3830000	It's like, well what's doing hot right now?
3830000	3832000	Well, we've got this zombie game that's doing well
3832000	3834000	and this other zombie game, well let's put zombies
3834000	3837000	in our game, people will like that.
3837000	3839000	It just doesn't work that way.
3839000	3841000	I do want you guys to know a lot of the chatters
3841000	3843000	are kind of laughing at that comment.
3843000	3845000	TungentBuster's saying, let the hate flow down
3845000	3847000	let the hate flow through you.
3847000	3849000	SSU100matt's saying, they won the internet,
3849000	3850000	whoever that was.
3850000	3852000	I will let you know I did a very rare thing
3852000	3855000	I don't usually do from the Orange Lounge Radio account.
3855000	3858000	I liked that comment over on Facebook
3858000	3859000	and you should too.
3859000	3863000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3865000	3868000	Alright, let's talk about, let's talk about,
3868000	3869000	this is interesting because-
3869000	3870000	Speaking of delays.
3870000	3873000	Well, it's not so much that, but it's more like the whole,
3873000	3877000	so you're milking the franchise over here
3877000	3879000	and everybody's like, fuck Konami.
3879000	3881000	But you're milking the franchise over here
3881000	3884000	and everybody's like, yay, yay, yay, give me more.
3884000	3887000	And that would be Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8.
3887000	3890000	Can we please explain the fucking numbering
3890000	3893000	of this franchise because I am-
3893000	3894000	Well-
3894000	3896000	Absolutely sick and tired of these stupid numberings.
3896000	3899000	Because it's after 2.5, but before three.
3900000	3903000	So they took 2.75 and rounded up, I think.
3903000	3904000	I don't know.
3904000	3907000	Look, it's the continued story
3907000	3910000	beyond what you saw in the 2.5 remix
3910000	3912000	as we move into three.
3912000	3916000	So, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
3916000	3917000	is releasing-
3917000	3919000	Nah, Final Chapter, my ass.
3919000	3924000	Is releasing in Japan on January 12th, 2017
3924000	3925000	and there was a whole new trailer
3925000	3928000	and some cover art for that as well.
3928000	3931000	But of course, I know people want to check this game out
3931000	3932000	and I do too.
3932000	3934000	You know, having it all remastered
3934000	3936000	with the nice coat of paint
3936000	3938000	and available on the PlayStation 4,
3938000	3940000	a lot of folks are going to be very excited about that.
3940000	3942000	So those appear to be the new dates
3942000	3944000	for Kingdom Hearts 2.8.
3944000	3947000	Now, some other games were announced by Square Enix
3947000	3950000	including a new game in the Saga series.
3950000	3956000	Saga Scarlet Grace, which I think was actually announced-
3956000	3958000	I won't say it was announced previously,
3958000	3960000	but it's been announced now
3960000	3964000	that it will come out on December 15th, 2016
3964000	3965000	for PlayStation Vita.
3965000	3968000	And they announced a new trailer with that as well.
3968000	3970000	So folks that are in the Saga series,
3970000	3971000	I'm sure can appreciate that.
3971000	3972000	But since it's on the Vita,
3972000	3974000	don't expect it to come here.
3974000	3977000	Unless they do a remaster for PlayStation 4
3977000	3980000	so it has to do really well for that to happen, I think.
3980000	3982000	Also announced, you know, with the delay
3982000	3983000	with Final Fantasy XV,
3983000	3985000	I'm sure there's some sadness there.
3985000	3987000	But Hajime Tabata did make an appearance
3987000	3989000	during the PlayStation press conference
3989000	3994000	to talk about a limited edition PlayStation 4 slim model.
3994000	3997000	It's called the Luna Edition PlayStation 4,
3997000	4000000	and it's got the big moon on it
4000000	4003000	that you see kind of in some of the screenshots of the game.
4003000	4005000	And that's it. It's a giant moon,
4005000	4007000	which the moon is always, you know,
4007000	4009000	makes me think of Final Fantasy IV.
4009000	4011000	The moon is usually a theme in a lot of the-
4011000	4014000	It doesn't make you think of Legend of Zelda?
4014000	4016000	Well, I definitely think of that as well,
4016000	4018000	but I'm trying to think of it in the Final Fantasy context.
4018000	4020000	But that game will be out-
4020000	4023000	No, it is not a giant butt, Brad from Pod Culture.
4023000	4024000	It's not that kind of moon.
4024000	4026000	It's like, you know, the thing in space.
4026000	4027000	So you can get-
4027000	4029000	A giant butt of space.
4029000	4031000	Yes, it's the giant ass of space.
4031000	4036000	Look, I gotta say, it's a nice-looking box.
4036000	4039000	And, you know, if I didn't already have a PlayStation 4,
4039000	4043000	and if this was something that could play, you know, US pla-
4043000	4045000	Actually, I think PlayStation 4 is region-free, right?
4045000	4046000	Yes.
4046000	4048000	So I guess it could play US PlayStation 4 games,
4048000	4050000	but I'm just- I'm not gonna invest the money
4050000	4052000	in yet another PlayStation 4 when I already have one.
4052000	4053000	I think that's coming over here too.
4053000	4054000	Is it really? I didn't-
4054000	4055000	I wanna say it is, yeah.
4055000	4057000	Oh, I didn't hear that that was coming over here as well.
4057000	4060000	I do know it's launching in Japan on November 29th
4060000	4061000	when the game is coming out as well.
4061000	4064000	It's gonna set you back 39,980 yen,
4064000	4068000	which roughly is where 399 US would be.
4068000	4070000	But, you know, obviously exchange rates
4070000	4071000	are a little crazy right now.
4071000	4072000	So, there you go.
4072000	4075000	Some stuff from Square Enix out of Tokyo Game Show.
4075000	4076000	Loki.
4076000	4077000	All right.
4077000	4082000	So, Sony is unfortunately having some layoffs.
4082000	4086000	This is with their Sony London studio
4086000	4090000	and also San Diego studios.
4090000	4093000	You know, basically they have confirmed the layoffs
4093000	4094000	at Sony San Diego.
4094000	4096000	Nothing really yet for London,
4096000	4099000	but, you know, basically said we can confirm
4099000	4100000	that there has been a reduction
4100000	4102000	in headcount at San Diego studios.
4102000	4104000	The teams working on MLB The Show,
4104000	4107000	Drawn to Death, and Guns Up have not been affected.
4107000	4109000	We continually evaluate teams and programs
4109000	4113000	at SIE Worldwide Studios to ensure
4113000	4115000	that we have the proper resources in place
4115000	4118000	to deliver innovative products and blah, blah, blah PR speak.
4118000	4121000	So, yeah.
4121000	4123000	And then on top of that also, I guess,
4123000	4128000	Sony London that are working on the VR exclusive,
4128000	4132000	at least that portion of, was it VR Worlds or whatever,
4132000	4136000	the London Heist, they're, you know,
4136000	4139000	facing layoffs as well because of the wrapping of production.
4139000	4142000	So, that's unfortunate.
4142000	4144000	But it seems like, you know, just, you know,
4144000	4147000	given our history and stuff with these studios,
4147000	4149000	it's kind of just, you know,
4149000	4153000	the normal workflow of these companies.
4153000	4156000	You know, you lay people off at the end of these projects.
4156000	4158000	Yeah, it's kind of one of those things,
4158000	4160000	it's just like the ebb and flow of game development.
4160000	4162000	But it's still, you know, it just sucks to see that,
4162000	4164000	you know, especially like on Twitter,
4164000	4166000	I was actually seeing people, you know, say,
4166000	4168000	hey, I just got laid off from Sony today.
4168000	4170000	Anybody have any job openings?
4170000	4172000	Because, you know, I have friends who are in the industry
4172000	4174000	that will sometimes retweet, you know, things like that.
4174000	4176000	And so, you know, I saw that kind of playing out live.
4176000	4179000	And it's still sad to see, especially when you kind of picture
4179000	4181000	in your mind that Sony is having a lot of success
4181000	4183000	with PlayStation 4 and a lot of those titles.
4183000	4185000	It's kind of weird to see that going on.
4185000	4188000	But, you know, it is what it is.
4188000	4191000	So, all right, moving on.
4191000	4196000	Let's talk about a little change with Blizzard
4196000	4199000	that some of you will like and some of you will hate.
4199000	4201000	It has to do with battle tags, you know,
4201000	4203000	especially as more and more of you are getting into Overwatch
4203000	4208000	and probably maybe reentering the World of Warcraft and so forth.
4208000	4211000	You might think it might be time to change your battle tag.
4211000	4214000	And, you know, if you didn't already do it,
4214000	4218000	you can change your battle tag one time for free.
4218000	4221000	But if you want to change it a second time,
4221000	4223000	it used to be too fucking bad.
4223000	4227000	You're up a creek, no way you can change it a second time.
4227000	4228000	But now...
4228000	4230000	But then they decided that they want more money.
4230000	4232000	That is exactly right.
4232000	4233000	Ding, ding, ding, ding, we have a winner.
4233000	4236000	Now you can change it, but it'll cost you money.
4236000	4239000	There will be a fee behind that
4239000	4241000	if you want to change your battle net tag.
4242000	4244000	Ten dollars to change it a second time.
4244000	4246000	By the way, though, I should point out,
4246000	4248000	this is exactly like Microsoft's system.
4248000	4250000	Microsoft lets you change it one time for free,
4250000	4252000	and then if you want to do it...
4252000	4254000	I keep waiting to see if something like Rob Roberts
4254000	4257000	or something else will open up, and they haven't yet.
4257000	4258000	So, I don't know.
4258000	4261000	I guess I'll keep the one I have on Xbox for now.
4261000	4262000	But, yeah.
4262000	4267000	So, Blizzard, now you can change your gamertag over there as well.
4267000	4269000	But no matter what you change it to,
4269000	4272000	you're still always going to have those four digits after it.
4272000	4274000	Like, you know, your gamertag is...
4274000	4278000	Mine is Sky, like my Twitter handle, pound,
4278000	4281000	and then I don't even know the four digits that come after it.
4281000	4282000	I don't have them memorized.
4282000	4285000	I have to have my battle net open so I can share it with you
4285000	4287000	if I choose to or whatever.
4287000	4291000	So, I guess that means that allows me to have the name Sky
4291000	4296000	and 10,000 other people just under to have that name as well,
4296000	4298000	but it's still a little weird when you're trying to give out your handle.
4298000	4300000	So, anyway.
4302000	4305000	By the way, jklol and orangewright,
4305000	4307000	both in our chat over at live.bognetwork.com,
4307000	4309000	bring up a good point.
4309000	4310000	Sony, when?
4310000	4313000	And on PSN, no luck.
4313000	4316000	And jklol elaborates, and you know it's total BS.
4316000	4318000	If your name is offensive on PSN,
4318000	4321000	they will allow you to change it just fine.
4321000	4324000	So, you got to make sure you start with an offensive name
4324000	4325000	and then you'll have to change it.
4325000	4326000	Yeah, that's a good point.
4326000	4329000	Sony is still kind of missing that capability of being able to change that.
4329000	4333000	So, even though I keep waiting for this to change on Microsoft
4333000	4335000	where my name frees up,
4335000	4338000	I'll never be able to change it on PlayStation unless, who knows,
4338000	4341000	maybe that will be one of the little things behind the curtain
4341000	4345000	they unveil at the inevitable PlayStation conference this winter
4345000	4347000	like they've been doing for the past two years.
4347000	4348000	I'm just assuming they're going to do another one this year,
4348000	4350000	but we will find out.
4350000	4354000	So, anyhow, let's move on.
4354000	4356000	Speaking of PlayStation, Loki?
4356000	4359000	Yes. So, you know, with PlayStation VR right around the corner,
4359000	4362000	you may be wondering, hey, what do I get with PlayStation VR?
4362000	4366000	Well, one of the things that they're bringing with it is a demo disc.
4366000	4367000	Yes, a demo disc.
4367000	4370000	It's like something that we haven't seen in a long time.
4370000	4374000	But they're actually going to be including 18 demos with this.
4374000	4375000	The game is included with that.
4375000	4379000	We've got Illuminate, Battlezone, Drive Club VR,
4379000	4383000	E-Valkyrie, Nog, I guess, or GNOG,
4383000	4388000	Harmonix Music VR, Headmaster, Here They Lie,
4388000	4391000	Job Simulator, PlayStation VR Worlds,
4391000	4395000	Resident Evil 7 Biohazard, The Kitchen Teaser,
4395000	4399000	Rez Infinite, Riggs Mechanicized Combat League,
4399000	4403000	Thumper, Tumble VR, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood,
4403000	4405000	Wayward Sky, and Within.
4406000	4412000	And I guess in Europe, they get a slightly smaller list of titles,
4412000	4415000	Drive Club VR, PlayStation VR Worlds, Riggs,
4415000	4419000	Tumble VR, Battlezone, E-Valkyrie, Wayward Sky, and Headmaster.
4420000	4424000	But, yeah, so that's pretty cool.
4424000	4425000	That's going to be included.
4425000	4428000	At least give you kind of a taste of some of those.
4429000	4432000	I wish they would have given some free games with it.
4432000	4436000	Well, you still get that PlayStation, the...
4436000	4437000	The Worlds?
4437000	4438000	No, not Worlds.
4438000	4440000	Worlds is something separate that you get to buy.
4440000	4442000	But you get that, like, game...
4442000	4444000	Not gamer, but it's...
4444000	4445000	What are they called?
4445000	4447000	They have the one with, like, all the robots and stuff, Playroom.
4447000	4448000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4448000	4450000	There's, like, VR Playroom or something like that.
4450000	4451000	That does come with it.
4452000	4453000	I don't know.
4453000	4455000	My sons like Playroom.
4455000	4458000	I mean, they like playing with the robot stuff that's on there,
4458000	4461000	so I'm down for more of that, I guess.
4463000	4466000	Still haven't cancelled my pre-order yet, so...
4468000	4470000	But, like, a lot of these games, though,
4470000	4473000	like, I don't know after playing the demo if I'm going to buy the full game.
4473000	4476000	I mean, there's a lot of these that are really short experiences.
4476000	4480000	I guess I'm going to have to wait until to see what all the buzz is.
4480000	4483000	And I still haven't made it over to the Best Buy to check out PlayStation VR yet.
4483000	4485000	You know, I have a PlayStation VR on pre-order,
4485000	4487000	and I've been telling you guys this for the past few weeks.
4487000	4489000	I'm still on the fence.
4489000	4493000	I'm hovering over the cancel button with that PlayStation VR.
4493000	4494000	I just don't know.
4494000	4496000	I feel the money adding up,
4496000	4498000	and I'm starting to think about all the other things
4498000	4500000	that that money could buy right now,
4500000	4503000	and, you know, going to the chat room,
4503000	4505000	there's a comment here that, you know, is a common theme,
4505000	4507000	I think, with new hardware.
4507000	4509000	Glorp Bibbledop in chat says...
4509000	4510000	Which is the best name, by the way.
4510000	4512000	This is a pretty rad name.
4512000	4516000	I predict PlayStation VR will fade away into nothing like Kinect.
4516000	4517000	I hope not.
4517000	4520000	I mean, honestly, because I think that VR so far
4520000	4523000	seems to be a little bit more solid than Kinect,
4523000	4525000	whereas Kinect, it was kind of hard to see
4525000	4527000	what they would use the experience for,
4527000	4530000	but we have some pretty good experiences with VR,
4530000	4534000	most of which are like on the Vive, but, you know...
4534000	4536000	Well, that's the thing.
4536000	4538000	That's the interesting monkey wrench is that, you know,
4538000	4540000	there was really only the one Kinect.
4540000	4542000	I mean, I know there was PlayStation Move and Wii,
4542000	4543000	but those are very different.
4543000	4545000	But, you know, we have some other VR things
4545000	4547000	that are kind of battling for...
4547000	4549000	You know they're not all gonna flourish.
4549000	4551000	Some are gonna fade away.
4551000	4553000	But here's what makes me a little bit sad,
4553000	4555000	because I know this is gonna happen.
4555000	4558000	If they're willing to fucking update the PlayStation 4
4558000	4560000	to have a PlayStation 4 Pro,
4560000	4562000	you better believe that within a year...
4562000	4565000	I bet within a year to a year and a half time,
4565000	4567000	you will have a PlayStation VR Pro.
4567000	4569000	Hey, that worries me a lot.
4569000	4574000	That's a very sad but possible analogy there.
4574000	4575000	But here's the thing.
4575000	4577000	The point I wanted to make is that, you know,
4577000	4580000	for the PlayStation VR to be able to sell,
4580000	4581000	it's gonna take what?
4581000	4583000	It's gonna take games.
4583000	4584000	Games, games, games.
4584000	4587000	And PlayStation VR is going to have to have that game
4587000	4589000	that is a must play.
4589000	4592000	PlayStation VR needs its Wii Sports.
4592000	4594000	And I'm not saying it actually has to be a sports game
4594000	4595000	or a mini game collection.
4595000	4597000	It just needs to have a good game for it
4597000	4598000	that like people want to play.
4598000	4599000	And see, here's the thing.
4599000	4601000	And the reason why I'm still tilting in the yes column
4601000	4604000	is that I go, oh, Res. Res and VR.
4604000	4606000	Yes, I've played that game a million times before,
4606000	4608000	but it's one of my favorite games.
4608000	4611000	To be able to play it in VR is going to be so fucking rad.
4611000	4614000	And it's kind of like if we just had a little more like that,
4614000	4616000	like when they announced the Space Channel 5 thing
4616000	4618000	until I realized it was only a demo,
4618000	4621000	I was like, oh, shit, this might be pretty awesome.
4621000	4624000	Well, yeah, same concept, right?
4624000	4627000	But like, I mean, Res is all right,
4627000	4628000	but I've played Res before.
4628000	4631000	And like I just think like the VR thing will be just kind of like,
4631000	4632000	oh, that's cool.
4632000	4637000	It's going to wear off like the wow factor is going to wear off
4637000	4639000	really fast with it.
4639000	4640000	Zippo25 in chat says,
4640000	4643000	do you guys think Oculus will be available on the new Xbox
4643000	4645000	if PlayStation VR sells well?
4645000	4646000	I'm going to be honest, you know,
4646000	4650000	like I'm not interested in the Oculus anymore.
4650000	4653000	I'm more interested in the Vive, honestly.
4653000	4655000	I think the Vive seems like a better,
4655000	4657000	the thing with me, the Vive, though,
4657000	4663000	is the setup is like that shit is not going to fly in my house.
4663000	4667000	I got sensors and stuff and she's like,
4667000	4670000	no, it's not going to fucking happen.
4670000	4673000	I mean, you could, I mean, Bobby brought it to Dragon Con.
4673000	4675000	You can build it up and tear it down pretty easily.
4675000	4676000	But yeah, it is.
4676000	4677000	It is.
4677000	4678000	You know, it's fine.
4678000	4681000	But it's just like that seems more interesting.
4681000	4683000	Maybe when they come out with their controller
4683000	4685000	and stuff for the Oculus, that might be a little bit different.
4685000	4688000	But honestly, it's just, it seems like more of the cool stuff
4688000	4690000	is happening with the Vive.
4690000	4692000	And I wonder if that's because you're kind of a gamer
4692000	4696000	and Vive is, it seems like the gamer VR right now, whereas Oculus.
4696000	4698000	Well, they've got all the room space stuff.
4698000	4700000	I mean, that makes a big difference versus just like, you know,
4700000	4701000	the sit-in chair.
4701000	4703000	Anything can do the sit-in chair and like look around stuff.
4703000	4705000	Hell, my Gear VR can do that.
4705000	4708000	But like that seems more interesting to me.
4708000	4711000	It's just that moving around and interacting with this space
4711000	4713000	versus just the Oculus Rift.
4713000	4716000	I like the Oculus, but it's, I think if I was going to pick two,
4716000	4719000	like if I'm building a PC for VR, I'm getting a Vive.
4719000	4721000	I'm not buying an Oculus.
4721000	4724000	Bobby Black Wilson or chat over at live.vognetwork.com
4724000	4727000	saying the number one games people want to play in VR
4727000	4729000	are Mario, Zelda established games.
4729000	4731000	That's why Rez is a big thing.
4731000	4733000	It's something familiar that you can play in VR.
4733000	4735000	See, I kind of like, I like half agree
4735000	4737000	because I'm like, I totally get why.
4737000	4739000	And I understand there's, you know,
4739000	4742000	somebody ported 8-bit Zelda to Oculus Rift
4742000	4744000	and it's like, that's a horrible idea
4744000	4746000	because that game was not designed for that environment
4746000	4748000	and it doesn't work well.
4748000	4751000	And so like I kind of understand why I don't really want
4751000	4754000	a Mario, Zelda type port.
4754000	4758000	I mean, if Nintendo were to suddenly get into VR tomorrow,
4758000	4761000	which I don't see them doing, but I'll humor this line of thought,
4761000	4765000	you know, maybe they did a Mario Galaxy-esque type game for VR,
4765000	4768000	but that's designed with VR in mind.
4768000	4771000	Nintendo's pretty good at selling a peripheral at this point.
4771000	4773000	It's got to be F-Zero though,
4773000	4775000	because if you're going to make a VR game,
4775000	4779000	it's got to be like, I'm going to puke, let's go too fast.
4779000	4782000	If Nintendo made a VR game, they would fucking do it.
4782000	4785000	But at the end, I don't think,
4785000	4787000	I think this is why Nintendo is not going VR.
4787000	4791000	I'm not sure Nintendo is fully invested on wanting to do that.
4791000	4793000	But anyway, I'm digressing.
4793000	4796000	The thing with Rez is that I look at a game like Rez
4796000	4798000	and well, yes, it's one of my favorite games,
4798000	4800000	but you know, just that whole like,
4800000	4803000	Rez has always been about an extra sensory experience, right?
4803000	4807000	With the trance vibrator, Teehee, and the Xbox controller.
4807000	4810000	And then when it went on to Kinect and Child of Eden,
4810000	4814000	it was always about trying to be like these bigger experiences
4814000	4816000	than maybe just what you could be in with a TV.
4816000	4818000	And I kind of look at a game like that and I go,
4818000	4821000	well, in VR now, that could work.
4821000	4825000	I'm surprised you don't have force feedback in the PlayStation VR,
4825000	4827000	like the headset or like, you know,
4827000	4829000	like imagine like having, you know,
4829000	4832000	kind of four areas of feedback in your head, you know,
4832000	4834000	left, right, back, front or something like that,
4834000	4838000	where, you know, that might lend itself to something, you know.
4838000	4843000	Bobby reminding me of an experience that happened at Dragon Con saying,
4843000	4845000	the PlayStation VR, excuse me, sorry,
4845000	4848000	Sky refused to play the F-Zero Lite game in the Vive.
4848000	4852000	I offered, I had radial G, I just played it for him.
4852000	4854000	Yeah, well, at that point, see, and here's the other thing with VR.
4854000	4857000	I can do VR, but after about 30 minutes or so,
4857000	4859000	I'm kind of like, okay, I need a break.
4859000	4861000	You know, like I don't know if it's the 3D pull on the eyes
4861000	4865000	or just the fact that it is so like since you're a bit like,
4865000	4868000	I can't do VR for a long, long, long time.
4868000	4871000	Like it starts to just like, okay, I need a break.
4871000	4873000	And so, you know, I think I had played,
4873000	4875000	I think that was around the time I was playing the audio shield game
4875000	4877000	or whatever that was called.
4877000	4879000	Then he mentioned the F-Zero game and I was like,
4879000	4880000	you know, I need a break.
4880000	4882000	So he played it instead because I was actually worried.
4882000	4885000	I'm like, an F-Zero experience might be too much right now.
4885000	4890000	But anyway, don't forget though, and this has been a long tangent,
4890000	4891000	but an important one,
4891000	4896000	Microsoft is also invested in this AR thing with HoloLens.
4896000	4900000	And, you know, I responded very positively to AR and HoloLens.
4900000	4903000	No, and I think AR is going to be fantastic
4903000	4904000	and what they're going to do with it,
4904000	4906000	especially when we get into the technology,
4906000	4908000	actually is going to be beaming images into your retinas.
4908000	4911000	You know, instead of having a screen, basically it's going to,
4911000	4917000	because they have like some prototype glasses and stuff to kind of do that.
4917000	4920000	They beam images, but it's more of like peripheral stuff,
4920000	4922000	like, you know, speedometers and that type of thing.
4922000	4925000	But that's kind of cool like that it uses that.
4925000	4931000	But I also very much understand with AR that it is a whole new canvas
4931000	4932000	that you have to make games on.
4932000	4937000	And especially this Mario and Zelda thing is not going to work in AR.
4937000	4942000	And yes, I realize some guy made an emulator that projects the emulator in AR,
4942000	4944000	but it's, I mean, what is it?
4944000	4948000	It's the 2D experience just on the HoloLens delivery system.
4948000	4952000	It's not really anything, you know, it's going to take a new thing.
4952000	4955000	But that fragments thing I played, I was like,
4955000	4960000	okay, this is like a 90s Sierra game with today's technology.
4960000	4961000	And it was rad.
4961000	4963000	Like, I really, really enjoyed it.
4963000	4965000	So here's something that's kind of interesting also
4965000	4970000	that they announced during a Tokyo game show with this Sony VR.
4970000	4974000	So with PlayStation VR, you're actually going to be able to untether it
4974000	4978000	from your PlayStation 4 and use it with your mobile phone.
4978000	4981000	So they had basically it's called Anywhere VR
4981000	4984000	and allows you to connect your mobile phone to the PlayStation VR
4984000	4988000	to use it like as a virtual world with some different backdrops
4988000	4990000	and you can use your own music in it and stuff.
4990000	4993000	Now, I'm not sure what exactly its intent is
4993000	4996000	if it's just to use your like mobile device with it.
4996000	4999000	But, I mean, they have like some screenshots
4999000	5001000	that show like you can select some backgrounds.
5001000	5004000	They've got like, you know, your smartphone screen,
5004000	5008000	Twitter and some sort of like mini games and stuff that you can play on there.
5008000	5012000	So that's interesting that it wasn't kind of unaware
5012000	5014000	that they'd be able to do that without, you know,
5014000	5016000	being hooked up to the PlayStation 4.
5016000	5019000	So I don't know.
5019000	5021000	That'd be kind of neat to have something that does mobile in that.
5021000	5023000	Although, let's be honest, I think it's fucking bulky.
5023000	5024000	I don't know.
5024000	5025000	I wouldn't carry it.
5025000	5028000	I would like wouldn't ride on a train or something with that thing on there.
5028000	5033000	It's a concept that maybe somebody can figure out a really good use for.
5033000	5034000	That type of thing.
5034000	5036000	Now, you know what I'm looking for?
5036000	5038000	What is the fucking PC drivers for this shit?
5038000	5040000	That's what I'm saying.
5040000	5042000	Like if I'm buying a PlayStation VR, I like it.
5042000	5044000	Let's see some PC drivers for that.
5044000	5045000	All right.
5045000	5049000	Let's talk about another big Sony event and that is No Man's Sky
5049000	5053000	and no secret that some folks have been very critical of No Man's Sky.
5053000	5055000	And I'm kind of at this point where it's like, okay, you know,
5055000	5059000	I liked No Man's Sky, which is funny because even in the beginning
5059000	5061000	during all these previews and things,
5061000	5064000	I was pretty critical of like show us the fucking game already.
5064000	5066000	Remember that like two years ago when they showed it?
5066000	5067000	I'm like, what's the game?
5067000	5071000	But now that I've played No Man's Sky, I enjoy it for what it is.
5071000	5076000	And I look at it as a Zen experience kind of like Minecraft.
5076000	5078000	Of course, the Sentinels kind of screw that up.
5078000	5080000	But it's, you know, creepers will do that to you in Minecraft as well.
5080000	5081000	It's kind of a very similar thing.
5081000	5085000	Like I see more of Minecraft in No Man's Sky than anything else for me.
5085000	5086000	I don't know.
5086000	5088000	The Sentinels are really a pain in the ass.
5088000	5090000	But I think that's literally the worst part of the game.
5090000	5092000	There's a lot of worst parts of it.
5092000	5093000	Well, here's the thing.
5093000	5096000	I'm just saying like I enjoy the game for what it is,
5096000	5100000	but I also I understand the criticisms.
5100000	5104000	And even I'm getting to a point where I'm like their Twitter has been
5104000	5106000	radio silent for like a month.
5106000	5109000	I don't know if Sean Murray went in a witness protection program
5109000	5113000	or if he's taking, you know, honestly, you've spent years of your life
5113000	5114000	making this game.
5114000	5117000	You do deserve a break of some sort.
5117000	5120000	But at the same time, you kind of need to support the game.
5120000	5121000	You kind of promised me.
5121000	5123000	I mean, it's a very tricky line to watch.
5123000	5126000	So this weeks upon weeks of complete radio silence
5126000	5129000	is getting a little irritating.
5129000	5132000	And I say that as somebody who's really tried to support No Man's Sky.
5132000	5137000	I'm kind of at a point where I'm like they are like the longer they go
5137000	5140000	with not saying anything in response to some of these criticisms
5140000	5143000	and the future development of the game and what they want to do with patches,
5143000	5148000	like the harder it is for me to cheer them on, if that makes sense.
5148000	5149000	Right.
5149000	5152000	Well, now, even this week, the noteworthy thing that happened,
5152000	5157000	Sony Studios president Yoshida, Suhei Yoshida said he understands
5157000	5160000	some of the complaints from players who don't feel like they're getting
5160000	5161000	what was promised to them, saying, quote,
5161000	5166000	I understand some of the criticisms especially Sean Murray is getting
5166000	5170000	because he sounded like he was promising more features in the game from day one.
5170000	5175000	It wasn't a great PR strategy because he didn't have a PR person helping him.
5175000	5177000	And in the end, he is an indie developer.
5177000	5181000	So he goes on to talk about, you know, it's a great indie accomplishment,
5181000	5185000	but he's probably overwhelmed with the work going on in the game.
5185000	5188000	Yoshida does reiterate, though, I am super happy with the game, actually,
5188000	5191000	and I'm amazed with the sales the game has gotten.
5191000	5197000	But it's very interesting that even Yoshida was willing to be a little bit critical,
5197000	5202000	and I don't think it comes from a place of, you know, trying to hurt the guy or whatever,
5202000	5206000	but he's definitely willing to point out, like, yeah, dude kind of overpromised,
5206000	5208000	and it's because he didn't have a PR filter.
5208000	5213000	Very interesting, though, because on the flip side of things,
5213000	5215000	why did I get sick of going to E3?
5215000	5219000	Because I don't hear anything but PR speak at these types of shows,
5219000	5223000	and that's why I like to interview indie developers more often,
5223000	5226000	because they will tell me stuff that's going on,
5226000	5229000	and they will talk a little more about game development and go off script and stuff.
5229000	5232000	But at the same time, I think we can have that conversation,
5232000	5237000	but not necessarily overpromise, and that may have been where Sean Murray made mistakes.
5237000	5239000	I don't think it's necessarily he made mistakes.
5239000	5243000	I think it's more of there is pressure on him to release the game at a certain period of time,
5243000	5246000	and he just couldn't get all the features done in a time.
5246000	5251000	And I think the longer it got delayed, the more pressure he got from Sony to release that title,
5251000	5255000	and I think that's kind of what led to all this, if I were to guess.
5255000	5261000	But I don't know. I mean, I don't see him as bad as, like, Peter Molyneux,
5261000	5264000	you know, where it's like, Peter Molyneux blows, you know.
5264000	5267000	Yeah, whatever happened to the Milo game. Whatever happened to that? Anyway.
5267000	5272000	SSU 100 Matt says, I particularly, I partially blame Sony for this.
5272000	5276000	They really hype the hell out of this game like it's a triple-A title at E3,
5276000	5278000	when in reality, it's just an indie game.
5278000	5282000	So, SSU 100 Matt's saying, you know, maybe Yoshida should take some of his blame as well.
5282000	5287000	Interesting. JK LOL wants to point out, you can get beta updates.
5287000	5292000	As radio silent as they seem, there's a channel to follow active development.
5292000	5295000	So, that's something to keep in mind.
5295000	5300000	And then Bobby Blackwolf says, you know what's a PR blunder? Time to car.
5300000	5303000	I was so hyped for that game, only to be utterly disappointed.
5303000	5307000	Hey, you and me both. Seriously, that's why I didn't release anything,
5307000	5309000	because it was utterly disappointing.
5309000	5315000	It was like, you know, hey, I could have released the game as is.
5315000	5319000	I still can. But it's not that fun.
5319000	5323000	And I don't want to release a fun game. Plus, I know I'm a PR person.
5323000	5324000	But fuck them.
5324000	5325000	I'd be your PR person.
5325000	5327000	Ah, fuck that. I don't need a PR person.
5328000	5330000	Like, I'm willing to tell you that the game's not good.
5330000	5333000	I'm like, sorry, I just didn't release it, because it's not ready yet.
5333000	5340000	It's not what I wanted to, you know, what I wanted to do with it.
5340000	5342000	It's not even close to being like that.
5342000	5346000	So, hopefully with this next one, it'll be a lot better,
5346000	5349000	because I'm more hopeful with it and more inspired on this one.
5349000	5352000	You're not going to tell us a goddamn thing and tell us right away.
5352000	5354000	You are going to try to Beyonce us with this, aren't you?
5354000	5357000	I'm not trying to Beyonce you. I just have to have something to show you.
5357000	5359000	I can't talk about it until I have something to show you.
5359000	5363000	All right, well, speaking of PR nightmares, what do we have next, Loki?
5363000	5368000	So, I've been following this, because I'm a pretty big fan of Jim Sterling,
5368000	5370000	you know, the Jimquisition stuff.
5370000	5373000	And he does, you know, the kind of go way back.
5373000	5376000	He does a series called, you know, Best of Steam Greenlight Trailers
5376000	5379000	and stuff like that, and he'll basically take these really terrible games
5379000	5383000	that are on Steam that have these really terrible greenlight trailers
5383000	5386000	and kind of just, you know, make fun of them, I guess, or criticize them.
5386000	5390000	And so, one of the games, and this actually may have been, like,
5390000	5393000	one of his little, like, kind of Let's Plays that he did,
5393000	5397000	was a game called The Slaughtering Grounds,
5397000	5402000	which is a game from a company that's called Digital Homicide.
5402000	5408000	And so, they didn't like that he, you know, poo-pooed on the game,
5408000	5411000	and so they, you know, did a review of the reviewer type thing,
5411000	5414000	and then he did a review of the reviewer type thing.
5414000	5417000	It was ridiculous. And so, but they put out tons of games.
5417000	5421000	They put out, like, god, over 60 games in, like, two years.
5421000	5426000	I mean, it's just shovelware, basically asset flipping stuff,
5426000	5430000	which is not bad. I mean, you can buy assets off the Unity store.
5430000	5432000	They're all Unity games, so you can buy assets off the Unity store
5432000	5435000	and then, you know, use those assets to make games.
5435000	5438000	But these were just, like, they're literally just buying the assets
5438000	5441000	and, like, just kind of doing nothing with it.
5441000	5444000	It's just bare minimum work to get stuff out.
5444000	5450000	So, they later on went to sue him, you know, for 15 million dollars
5450000	5455000	because they didn't like how he was, you know, they said that they were,
5455000	5458000	you know, he was causing libel or some other damages and stuff.
5458000	5462000	And it's just, it's a big cringey thing that they,
5462000	5465000	and he didn't air view with them. It's just, it's ridiculous.
5465000	5467000	So, they've taken it a step further because he hasn't talked about them
5467000	5473000	for a long time. Now, they've decided that, hey, guess what?
5473000	5478000	You know, basically Steam users are still making fun of these games.
5478000	5480000	They're not, they're criticizing the games.
5480000	5482000	We're going to sue the Steam users.
5482000	5488000	So, they're suing 100 Steam users for a total of 18 million dollars
5488000	5491000	for personal injury is what they claim.
5491000	5495000	And so, on top of that, not only are they suing them,
5495000	5501000	but they're actually, you know, they are seeking, basically,
5501000	5504000	I think they got a subpoena from, yeah, Arizona.
5504000	5508000	They got a subpoena to find out, you know, who these 100 users are.
5508000	5514000	And with that, you know, they're now going after Valve as well.
5514000	5517000	And they're trying to actually get somebody to help represent them
5517000	5520000	because right now they're representing themselves, which is fun.
5520000	5526000	Okay, wait, wait, wait. They're going to subpoena 100 users who left reviews.
5526000	5530000	Like, don't they have to agree to terms and conditions
5530000	5532000	when they list their game on the store?
5532000	5534000	Well, it's not even really reviews.
5534000	5539000	It's just like, you know, they're saying, you know, usual internet shit.
5539000	5543000	Like, oh, you know, these guys are, you know, these devs are crap.
5543000	5545000	You know, they're going to probably end up turning out being like,
5545000	5548000	you know, serial killers versus, you know, game devs.
5548000	5551000	And it's in its response to, like, you know, some of the interviews
5551000	5552000	and stuff that they had.
5552000	5555000	And, you know, just, just the usual internet shitery.
5555000	5558000	Steam does need to do something about that, and I understand they are.
5558000	5561000	But, you know, suing for all that money?
5561000	5564000	Yeah, basically saying, you know, that, oh, it's because of these,
5564000	5567000	it's because of these reviews and these people's comments
5567000	5569000	that we're not selling our games.
5569000	5571000	Not because the quality of our games are shit.
5571000	5573000	It's because of these comments.
5573000	5577000	So on the last straw that they have, you know, when they, with Steam,
5577000	5580000	you know, they were basically saying, we need this information.
5580000	5583000	Seems like, fuck you, bye-bye.
5583000	5586000	And they, so they pulled their games off the store
5586000	5589000	because they're not going to have them abuse their system.
5589000	5590000	Did you hear the quote?
5590000	5593000	Because Dungeon Buster posted the quote here in chat.
5593000	5595000	I like what Lombardi said, short and simple.
5595000	5598000	Valve has stopped doing business with digital homicide
5598000	5601000	for being hostile to Steam customers.
5601000	5603000	Pretty much.
5603000	5605000	So, yeah, they're continuing for the lawsuit.
5605000	5607000	I don't know if really anything's going to come of it
5607000	5609000	because I don't think they actually have a lawyer yet.
5609000	5610000	They don't have the legal fees.
5610000	5614000	In fact, they try to do like a Kickstarter thing on their own website
5614000	5616000	to, you know, raise legal fees.
5616000	5619000	Do you know what this, I'm sorry, but do you know what this reminds me of,
5619000	5621000	like, to a T?
5621000	5623000	You know what this reminds me of, like, to a T?
5623000	5625000	It's a completely different industry, but exact same thing going on.
5625000	5627000	Okay, you're a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, right?
5627000	5629000	Hell's Kitchen and all that stuff.
5629000	5632000	This is Amy's Baking Company all over again.
5632000	5633000	Do you guys remember?
5633000	5636000	And by the way, what do both those things have in common?
5636000	5639000	Amy's Baking Company and digital homicide.
5639000	5642000	Arizona. That's the common thread, y'all.
5642000	5645000	Arizona. No offense to our listeners in Arizona,
5645000	5648000	but I'm thinking most of you are probably nodding your head in agreement right now.
5648000	5652000	So, if y'all didn't see that episode, what was that show called?
5652000	5653000	Kitchen Nightmares?
5653000	5654000	Yeah, Kitchen Nightmares.
5654000	5659000	Okay, where these folks at Amy's Baking Company just flew off the handle, right?
5659000	5661000	And then, you know, it was just, it was a mess.
5661000	5663000	Gordon Ramsay walked off the shelf, but then it was the fallout
5663000	5666000	where people started leaving these reviews on Yelp,
5666000	5667000	and what happened?
5667000	5669000	They threatened to sue the people on Yelp.
5669000	5673000	If you've got, like, a good 45 minutes to waste,
5673000	5677000	you really want to listen through a really cringe-worthy audio recording,
5677000	5682000	go to TheJimquisition.com and actually check out the special podcast
5682000	5685000	Jim Sterling and Digital Homicide Hash It Out.
5685000	5687000	Go look that up.
5688000	5691000	It's just, once you listen to that and you're like,
5691000	5695000	oh, that's why they're acting like this, because they're just not all there.
5695000	5699000	I mean, it's just, who does this? But whatever.
5699000	5700000	And you're sinking themselves.
5700000	5702000	And again, the same thing with Amy's Baking Company.
5702000	5704000	Countless interviews done with those people,
5704000	5705000	and you're kind of sitting there going,
5705000	5710000	these guys really need a second person to filter a lot of this through.
5710000	5713000	Like, they should not be doing interviews directly.
5713000	5716000	It's like the same type of thing.
5716000	5718000	I'm sorry, I couldn't help but think of that.
5718000	5721000	It's the Amy's Baking Company of the gaming world.
5721000	5724000	And I have to wonder if they're actually going to be taken off Steam,
5724000	5727000	because even though the games are, you can still redeem keys
5727000	5729000	and play the games if you really wanted to,
5729000	5730000	which I don't know why you would.
5730000	5734000	But they've had several games come out that were under other pseudonyms
5734000	5736000	for their company names,
5736000	5739000	so I'm wondering if they're just going to release them under those instead.
5739000	5740000	I don't know.
5740000	5743000	But yeah, that's the fun Digital Homicide thing that's going on.
5743000	5746000	Hopefully none of our listeners are one of those 100 Steam users,
5746000	5751000	although, to be honest, I don't know how much a threat you would actually be,
5751000	5753000	what kind of trouble you'd be in.
5753000	5758000	Hey, if anyone actually does get sued, I would totally recommend hitting up,
5758000	5761000	was it Ryan Morrison, the video game attorney on Reddit,
5761000	5765000	because he'd be someone that I can imagine defending these people.
5765000	5768000	I wonder if he's had a take on this at all.
5768000	5769000	I'd be very pleased to hear.
5769000	5773000	I thought about the other day looking up to see what his comment would be on that.
5773000	5775000	I follow him on Twitter.
5775000	5777000	I haven't seen anything yet, though.
5777000	5778000	I don't know if he would comment yet.
5778000	5779000	All right.
5779000	5781000	Well, something I think a little less controversial
5781000	5783000	is we start to get into the Classic Game of the Week
5783000	5785000	because we are going to get into the Classic Game of the Week here shortly,
5785000	5788000	but of course Dark Sakura is on a bit of a hiatus from the show
5788000	5790000	due to some conflicts with her day job.
5790000	5792000	She'll be out for a couple months.
5792000	5795000	But if she was here, I know she'd be really excited about this
5795000	5796000	coming from Tokyo Game Show,
5796000	5799000	and that is Digimon World Next Order.
5799000	5801000	It is coming out in the West.
5801000	5802000	That's right.
5802000	5805000	We are getting Digimon World Next Order here in the West
5805000	5809000	on the PlayStation 4, apparently not the Vita in the West,
5809000	5811000	although that's something that's going to be happening in Japan,
5811000	5814000	although that doesn't really surprise me whatsoever.
5814000	5820000	So anyway, yes, it will be released in North America and Europe in 2017.
5820000	5822000	The game has over 200 Digimon,
5822000	5825000	and you can have two of them at your side while you're out in the digital world
5825000	5830000	on a quest to stop the machine-dramones and get home.
5830000	5834000	Apparently this is on the calendar for release in early next year,
5834000	5836000	not something you have to wait for for holiday.
5836000	5839000	Again, that coming out of Tokyo Game Show.
5839000	5840000	You know, I can't help but wonder,
5840000	5843000	even though I know some people are going to cringe at this comparison,
5843000	5845000	but you can't help but wonder,
5845000	5848000	does the success of Pokemon Go play into this at all?
5848000	5851000	Yes, I realize Digimon and Pokemon are completely different,
5851000	5854000	but you know some business person's got to be sitting there going,
5854000	5856000	yeah, I smell money.
5856000	5857000	I smell the money.
5857000	5859000	I smell money, and it's with monsters in your pocket.
5859000	5862000	So, oh, oh, what, we have a game about monsters?
5862000	5863000	Oh, yes, put it out.
5863000	5865000	Oh, yes, they love the Pokemon in the States.
5865000	5866000	They'll love this too.
5866000	5869000	So I can't help but wonder how much of that played into that,
5869000	5872000	but regardless, I know fans of Digimon probably don't want to hear that,
5872000	5877000	but I just feel like that probably is something that was considered
5877000	5879000	before this announcement was made.
5879000	5882000	So, yeah, there you go.
5882000	5885000	Digimon World will be released early next year,
5885000	5890000	but we are going to take an opportunity now to take a step back in history,
5890000	5892000	long before there were MMOs,
5892000	5895000	and long before there was even a PlayStation Vita.
5895000	5898000	We're going to take a step into the gaming vault with a segment we call
5898000	5900000	the Classic Game of the Week.
5902000	5905000	And thanks to the magic of radio,
5905000	5906000	Dark Soccer is here.
5906000	5908000	Hi.
5908000	5914000	Fresh from having dove into the vault to find a classic game
5914000	5916000	for all of you this week,
5916000	5919000	because every week Dark Soccer picks a classic game,
5919000	5924000	ten years or older, that she says, hey, listen you little brats,
5924000	5930000	stop playing your newfangled war crafts and your Pokemans and play this.
5930000	5932000	This game could have been their grandparent.
5932000	5935000	It's probably old enough to be somebody's grandparent.
5935000	5936000	Yeah.
5936000	5939000	What is the Classic Game of the Week, Dark Soccer?
5939000	5941000	Turbo.
5941000	5942000	Turbo is a-
5942000	5943000	Wait, I thought that was a system.
5943000	5945000	No.
5945000	5946000	Rab.
5946000	5947000	It is a game.
5947000	5948000	It is a game.
5948000	5950000	It is a game by Sega.
5950000	5954000	It came out in 1981 in the arcades.
5954000	5955000	Oh, my gosh.
5955000	5961000	Yeah, I was, um, five.
5961000	5962000	Yeah, I was young.
5962000	5967000	So anyway, Turbo, um, came out in 1981 by Sega.
5967000	5969000	And by the way, that's what the game sounds like.
5969000	5976000	And now I'm going to mute it because it's very monotonous and kind of a little bit annoying.
5976000	5977000	Yeah.
5977000	5980000	The soundtrack was not the game's strong point.
5980000	5981000	Soundtrack?
5981000	5982000	Exactly.
5982000	5983000	Soundtrack.
5983000	5985000	Anyway, it had three formats.
5985000	5989000	There was a standard upright and there was a cabaret mini style
5989000	5992000	and then an environmental cockpit style.
5992000	5993000	So a seated one.
5993000	5994000	Cockpit.
5994000	5996000	Cock.
5996000	5999000	The cock goes in the pit.
5999000	6001000	What kind of game is this, Dark Soccer?
6001000	6003000	It's a special game.
6003000	6004000	You go turbo.
6004000	6005000	For special people.
6005000	6006000	You go turbo style on it.
6006000	6008000	You play with the stick.
6008000	6011000	You twist it and see what happens.
6011000	6022000	Anyway, um, so with this particular game, um, you had a steering wheel and you had a gear shift for low and high and an accelerator pedal.
6022000	6030000	And, um, it had 20 inch raster display, which I mean, what else do they have back then?
6030000	6033000	20 inches is pretty impressive for 1981.
6033000	6042000	Anyway, um, it had an onscreen display and an LED panel that had your player's score and your high score table.
6042000	6048000	And it also had lighted oil and temperature gauges on either side of the steering wheel.
6048000	6051000	So for its day, it was pretty advanced.
6051000	6053000	That's kind of cool. I remember that in Spy Hunter too.
6053000	6057000	It had the actual lights that would show up on the machine.
6057000	6058000	That is pretty cool.
6058000	6060000	At least that one had a soundtrack.
6060000	6061000	Yes.
6061000	6066000	Um, at any rate, turbo was ported to both the Intellivision and the Cliquovision.
6066000	6069000	I had the Cliquovision version as a kid.
6069000	6077000	It was the best thing ever because, and this is where I'm going to take a bit of a deviation.
6077000	6079000	With the Cliquovision.
6079000	6081000	Are you being a deviant here on OLR?
6081000	6082000	Always.
6082000	6088000	With the Cliquovision, you would unplug one of the controllers and plug in the steering wheel controller.
6088000	6094000	And the steering wheel, it had this thing that you could take out that was an accelerator pedal.
6094000	6099000	And you'd put, we used to put it on the TV tray, you know, the old school aluminum TV trays.
6099000	6101000	You'd have the small little wheel on top.
6101000	6107000	And then the place that you took the pedal out to put it on the floor, you would actually put your controller there.
6107000	6110000	And the controller had all those numbers on it to choose your difficulty.
6110000	6115000	But then it became your gear shift when you were driving.
6115000	6117000	And it was the coolest thing.
6117000	6120000	My mom would just play the shit out of this game.
6120000	6122000	And my mom was like, I don't like video.
6122000	6124000	Bull. Bullshit, mama.
6124000	6126000	You played that game more than me.
6126000	6128000	Anyway.
6128000	6140000	Turbo requires you to go down a road, a different kind of race in urban and rural locations with different weather conditions and during different times of the day.
6140000	6143000	The cars are meant to resemble Formula 1 race cars.
6143000	6149000	And you have to pass and stay ahead of at least 30 competing cars before the time expires.
6149000	6155000	And then some of the opponents are easy. Some of them swerve around.
6155000	6157000	So you do have a difficulty curve on it.
6157000	6161000	In the first round, you have unlimited lives.
6161000	6166000	Collisions will return your car back to the starting line.
6166000	6171000	In later rounds, though, you have three lives, but you can get an additional life up to four.
6171000	6177000	And then you sometimes have to avoid an ambulance.
6177000	6181000	It can overtake you and run into you.
6181000	6183000	Yes. Death by ambulance.
6183000	6187000	Wait, so the ambulance will try to run you off the road?
6187000	6188000	Yeah.
6188000	6191000	Running into one will make you lose a life.
6191000	6196000	Well, yeah, running into cars generally is not a good idea for your health.
6196000	6200000	Specifically the ambulance. If you tap it, you'll die.
6200000	6203000	I see. It's representative of the lawsuit that's coming.
6203000	6204000	Right?
6204000	6205000	Yeah.
6205000	6209000	The game was designed and coded by a guy named Steve Hanawa.
6209000	6214000	And he said, and I'm just going to go ahead and quote a little bit here,
6214000	6221000	that despite its historical significance as a precedent-setting racing video game,
6221000	6226000	he considers that the process of creating it to have been his worst development experience at Sega.
6226000	6227000	Oh, my.
6227000	6235000	He said that it required such a difficult and protracted schedule of coding and debugging that he was hospitalized for a month.
6235000	6236000	Yikes.
6236000	6240000	For a stress exhaustion and a spontaneously collapsed lung.
6240000	6241000	Oh, my God.
6241000	6244000	So it wasn't just Atari that was working there.
6244000	6250000	I think the difference is that Atari was drugging up a lot of their people or they were on drugs.
6250000	6251000	Allegedly.
6251000	6253000	Allegedly.
6253000	6256000	They were on the drugs.
6256000	6257000	Look out for your children.
6257000	6259000	And just go watch some of the old documentaries.
6259000	6261000	I'm not, like, being a jerk.
6261000	6267000	Like, you hear some of the old documentaries and you hear some of the developers talking about some of the crazy stuff that went down at Atari.
6267000	6275000	Not to make this about Atari, but maybe Sega needed a little bit of, you know, at least some liquor or something.
6275000	6281000	Well, this game actually had a little, actually quite a bit of bad luck around it, around its development.
6281000	6282000	I'll get into that in a moment.
6282000	6284000	Is it like the Poltergeist of video games?
6284000	6285000	Maybe.
6285000	6286000	I'll get into that in a minute.
6286000	6296000	But the thing about this game that really made that precedent is that it set the stage for pretty much all racing games down the line.
6296000	6304000	It was the first full color raster display racing game that had the third person perspective rear view racer.
6305000	6317000	It also had scaling sprites for competing AI drivers, trees, cityscape elements, and the first third person racing game to feature multiple landscapes.
6317000	6322000	So it was also one of the first ones to also have hills in it.
6322000	6328000	So this game really set, you know, a new level for racing games.
6328000	6330000	The hills are alive.
6330000	6332000	With the sounds of motors.
6332000	6335000	With the sounds of ambulances killing you.
6335000	6338000	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
6338000	6347000	The hills are alive with the sound of music.
6347000	6348000	There's the ambulance.
6348000	6349000	Oh yeah, there he is.
6349000	6351000	The wha-ambulance.
6351000	6354000	It does kind of make a hideous noise as it goes by, doesn't it?
6354000	6360000	Everything about that game makes a hideous noise, including me screaming when I run into trees.
6360000	6365000	Anyway, so here's where some of the worst of the drama gets in.
6365000	6369000	There was an Atari 2600 port planned by Coleco.
6369000	6380000	And it was even advertised by Coleco, but it was never completed because the lead programmer, Michael Green, had been struck and injured by a drunk driver when he was riding a bicycle.
6380000	6381000	Yikes.
6381000	6394000	And so the prototype was about 80% complete, and it was found by another Coleco programmer named Anthony Henderson in his attic in 2006.
6394000	6395000	Oh wow.
6395000	6399000	There was also a turbo board game that came out in 1983 by Milton Bradley.
6399000	6400000	Huh.
6401000	6406000	So, yeah, the game got great reviews.
6406000	6418000	It was reviewed by Computer and Video Games magazine in the July 1982 issue, and they really found it to be very realistic for its time, you know, and thought it was amazing.
6418000	6427000	It pretty much had been, like, the king of racing games for a while.
6427000	6452000	And then the ColecoVision version was reviewed in 1983, and it scored a 10 out of 10 by Arcade Express, and said that while it wasn't as graphically arresting as the arcade version, it comes reasonably close to matching the multi-scenario brilliance, and the special control panel lifts this cartridge to greatness.
6452000	6454000	So there you go.
6454000	6460000	Turbo also was the inspiration for Turbo Time in Wreck-It Ralph.
6460000	6462000	Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay.
6462000	6465000	So there you go.
6465000	6475000	All right. So when did Pole Position come out comparatively? Because when I look at this, I go, oh, it's kind of like Pole Position, but Pole Position had to have been a few years later. Pole Position had to have been, like, 83 or 84, right?
6475000	6477000	Yeah, I think so. Give me a second.
6477000	6490000	A little later, because remember Pole Position had the audio, and it just was a little more advanced, but you definitely see a lot of, I think, what you see in Pole Position, kind of like you see early forms of that in Turbo.
6490000	6495000	Pole Position came out in Japan July 1982.
6495000	6497000	Oh, yeah, it was only a year later. Wow, okay.
6497000	6498000	Yeah.
6498000	6501000	But still, I mean, still very neat.
6501000	6509000	Pole Position, I mean, while, yes, it is, of course, graphically superior, I don't think it would have existed if not for Turbo.
6509000	6518000	No, no, and definitely I think you see a lot of, like, the early forms. I guess what I'm saying is that, like, Turbo kind of looks like an early form of Pole Position in some ways, so.
6518000	6520000	But it was Sega.
6520000	6521000	Sega.
6521000	6522000	Sega.
6522000	6524000	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Turbo.
6524000	6527000	Beep, beep, beep.
6532000	6540000	You know, speaking of classic games of the week, I feel like, you know, last week on the show, we just did an anniversary.
6540000	6543000	We had the Dreamcast, right, had a birthday.
6543000	6548000	Well, this week, the GameCube is turning 15, believe it or not.
6548000	6560000	The Nintendo GameCube turning 15 years old this week, and I think we're going to probably have a lot of these birthdays in the coming weeks, because we're starting to get into that holiday period, you know, when things, you know, start, you know, systems and stuff come out.
6560000	6563000	Before the holiday period, so we're going to be seeing a lot of anniversaries.
6563000	6566000	But yeah, the GameCube, 15 years old this week.
6566000	6569000	Memories of the GameCube? You owned one, right?
6569000	6574000	Yeah, I still do somewhere. My sister has it in storage or something. I don't know what she did with it.
6576000	6581000	I don't know, I'd say Animal Crossing was definitely, you know, a fond memory.
6583000	6584000	Zelda Wind Waker.
6586000	6588000	Enter the Matrix.
6589000	6591000	A little game called F-Zero GX.
6591000	6593000	F-Zero GX, absolutely.
6595000	6612000	So, I will never forget, though. You actually bought me a GameCube and Animal Crossing. Isn't that ironic that all those years ago, you got me into that Nintendo system, although I knew I really wanted one. It was just, you know, at the time, I didn't have a job where I could just buy things that I want.
6613000	6621000	So that was a really awesome gift that you got from me at the time. But yeah, I would say in some ways, Animal Crossing changed my life, especially the old one.
6621000	6626000	Yeah, the old one was great with the NES games and stuff in there.
6629000	6636000	I mean, well, no, it wouldn't be very good on mobile, but I was just thinking, can you imagine the Animal Crossing game?
6636000	6641000	Well, you're going to find out next year because that's one of the Nintendo IPs. It's going mobile, so there you go.
6642000	6649000	So you have that to look forward to. No, actually funny, you guys all know Shane, who's on this show quite frequently and hosts his own shows that are on the VOG Network.
6649000	6660000	But I met him through an Animal Crossing LiveJournal community. Yes, I did. That's a true story. And so, all these years later, here we are. So it's just kind of funny how that works out.
6660000	6670000	But that used to be where you could like, you know, you would put in the codes to like, I think, I think the LiveJournal community was about you could actually like send gifts to people with the codes in the game.
6670000	6680000	And, you know, there was, I remember there was a thing where like, if you were Link from Hyrule, somebody had the code for like every single thing for your village.
6680000	6686000	And so a lot of people like work the system like that. But if you wanted something like custom for you, somebody had to generate the code in their town.
6686000	6692000	And at the time, that was a pretty, you know, considering that the GameCube kind of danced around the online thing.
6692000	6699000	There was Phantasy Star Online and nothing else that ever went online to that system. The code thing worked out like really, really well.
6699000	6707000	So that was, they did a lot of like innovative stuff, like especially with like hooking up like the Game Boy Advance, you know, to play NES games or the Wii U islands.
6707000	6715000	It's like that. That was pretty cool. That's innovation. Wii U wasn't innovation. It's just kind of like, oh, it's the second screen.
6715000	6721000	It's like, well, very kind of done. The game, you know, the Game Boy Advance, the DS.
6721000	6727000	Which wasn't really supported very well, unfortunately. I mean, there was that Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game that was pretty badass that used that, right?
6727000	6736000	And there was the Zelda Four Swords. Of course, everybody knows that one. But I feel like there really weren't a lot of games that used that whole setup for as awesome as it was at the time.
6736000	6744000	Too bad. I mean, if only cell phones had controllers on them, we could have a lot of cool shit.
6744000	6750000	All right. Let's do some rapid fire news. Quickly cover some of the other things going on in the industry this week.
6750000	6758000	So speaking of mobile, RPG Maker is going mobile. So I know that kind of checking in, for some reason, like I got this idea.
6758000	6763000	I was like, hey, it might be fun to make something in an RPG Maker. You know, I was like, I think I bought some of those a while back.
6763000	6773000	Let me go check my Humble, you know, license page or whatever. And so I saw that they had a new RPG Maker MV, which was like $80.
6773000	6784000	I was like, fuck that. I am not buying that for $80. But they're going to be launching it as RPG Creator for iOS, which is going to be launching September 25th.
6784000	6792000	And then also, you know, it looks a little bit more basic than the other stuff, but at least you can do that. It's only going to cost $9.99.
6792000	6801000	And so that's kind of neat. And then you'll be able to upload your games to a creator's portal where others can try them out as well.
6801000	6812000	I know that the RPG Maker MV, I think you can output the mobile on that. So that's kind of cool. If you really want to make like an RPG or something, then that might not be a bad route to do it.
6812000	6825000	Although, just wait for another Humble bundle because they had one a while back, you know, where it was really marked down. Or hell, if you really want to get the coding stuff, got 48 more hours for that Game Maker bundle, which is honestly, just pick that up.
6825000	6827000	That is worth it for 15 bucks.
6827000	6828000	Yeah.
6829000	6838000	And with that RPG Maker, you know, even though you kind of roused the $80 price, like you can actually release full games from that, right? That's where I like To The Moon came from.
6838000	6845000	Yeah, you can release full games with that. I just think, I don't know. I mean, it's all right for what it is. I think it's just a little bit limited.
6845000	6851000	Although, to be honest, so the MV though is a lot more open. Like I think they support like JavaScript in there or Java.
6851000	6860000	So there is actual programming language support with it. So it's a lot more full featured versus like some of the earlier RPG Makers, which is a little bit more basic and what you could do with them.
6860000	6872000	Plus, they also have, you know, built into that was the, because they had kind of like a Dragon Quest style battle system, whereas basically, you know, you would see it head on versus sideways like Final Fantasy.
6872000	6878000	But they added that sideways battle system in Final Fantasy or from Final Fantasy in this latest version as well.
6878000	6886000	So maybe worth it for some people. I'm not going to drop $80 for it for something that I'm not sure I'm going to use, but I'll wait for it to go on sale maybe.
6886000	6887000	Fair enough.
6887000	6903000	Yeah. And then this is kind of interesting, but I just, I saw this and like, oh man, you know, like, because we didn't really get Dead or Alive over here, but our Dead or Alive Extreme.
6903000	6912000	But guess what? It is coming to Steam. So you know what that means? There will be nude mods for this shit like day one.
6912000	6924000	I mean, you want nude bonds in this, that's how you get nude bonds. But Dead or Alive Extreme Venus Vacation will be coming out on PC. I guess it's via a website.
6924000	6933000	Oh, maybe not Steam. I'm sorry. I misread that. So it's actually maybe not mods since it's based off a website, but you never know. People can get creative.
6933000	6944000	So that's coming to PC. What is coming to Steam though is Galgun. So that'll be coming to Steam soon as well. I may have to check that out. I actually like the first Galgun game, so we'll have to see about that.
6944000	6946000	That's coming to Steam September 27th.
6947000	6958000	All right. Lots of stuff getting ported to PC, huh? I doubt this will come to PC, but some of you will probably be interested in this on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in Japan anyway.
6958000	6968000	In 2017, a new Fortune Street game is coming out. What's pretty neat about this, it is Fortune Street Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary Edition.
6968000	6975000	So it's a new Fortune Street game that actually incorporates those two franchises as well, and a new little trailer was shown for that.
6975000	6980000	So Fortune Street's kind of like, if I remember right, it's kind of like a board game-ish type of hybrid game. So it's pretty cool that it's gonna...
6980000	6983000	They did that with Mario as well. There's a Fortune Street game.
6983000	6986000	Yeah, so I don't know if they... Do they release those over here? I don't think they...
6986000	6987000	Yeah, it got released over here.
6987000	6988000	Did they?
6988000	6989000	It was on the Wii U, I think.
6989000	6991000	Well then maybe this one will come out.
6991000	6993000	Maybe it was on 3DS. It was either Wii U or 3DS.
6994000	6999000	Dartatouille. Yeah, that's right. Dartatouille said they had the one on the Wii with Mario. That's right. I do remember that.
6999000	7006000	It was just like the Fortune Street game. So yeah, I think they get more of them in Japan, but they do release them over here once in a while.
7006000	7008000	So maybe that one will come out.
7008000	7016000	Also, if you are still playing Animal Crossing or gonna go back to Animal Crossing, because Animal Crossing New Leaf is getting an update this fall,
7016000	7023000	but I think a lot of you, like me, are probably scared to go back to Animal Crossing because your town is overrun with weeds,
7023000	7029000	and you're gonna have to spend hours and hours picking goddamn weeds on every single screen in your town.
7029000	7035000	Well, good news is there was a tweet that came out from Isabelle. Isn't that adorable?
7035000	7039000	Animal Crossing UK account. Isabelle actually tweeted and said,
7039000	7045000	been away from your town for a while. When the free update arrives this autumn, I'll take care of all the weeds.
7045000	7048000	So Isabelle's gonna clean your town for you.
7048000	7052000	And actdeftinchat says, bitches don't know about the clean town initiative.
7052000	7056000	Yeah, I guess there's actually, you know, you can set like perks and stuff at the mayor's office from what I remember about the game.
7056000	7060000	I think I always took the extended hours so that things would actually be open at night.
7060000	7066000	Or I think you can actually like flip the clock, like within the game or something like that. There was a way you could do that.
7066000	7071000	But anyway, if you were to choose the clean town initiative, you would not have weeds either.
7071000	7075000	But it sounds like initiative or no. Isabelle's getting out the weed whacker,
7075000	7080000	and she's gonna take care of the town for you when you come back to check out the amiibo update.
7080000	7084000	She probably couldn't just like, you know, have you like push a lawnmower. That'd be kind of cool.
7084000	7087000	That would be funny. Like a rideable lawnmower going to town.
7087000	7092000	That'd be cool. Except for all the murdering that would happen when you run over the townsfolk, you know, with the lawnmower.
7092000	7094000	But some people might want that.
7094000	7099000	I can't imagine that. Like you dig a trap hole, they're stuck there head high. It's like I'm running over the lawnmower.
7099000	7102000	That was in the first episode of Scream Queens, wasn't it?
7102000	7103000	I don't remember.
7103000	7105000	Rest in peace, Def Taylor Swift.
7105000	7108000	Somebody else saw that show, right? Somebody else out there had to see that show.
7108000	7110000	My dad watched that show.
7110000	7112000	Why?
7112000	7114000	Well then your dad would get the joke.
7114000	7117000	Because he likes visual effects artwork or makeup and stuff.
7117000	7119000	That makes sense what he said.
7119000	7124000	Alright, let's check out what is in stores this week. Starting off in the US, Logie.
7124000	7133000	So of course we still have lots of stuff coming out. So this week we've got Shin Megami Tensei 4 Apocalypse on 3DS.

7177000	7182000	Also Firewatch is finally making its way out to Xbox One.
7182000	7188000	Pankupu on PC.
7188000	7193000	Toy Odyssey The Lost and the Found on PC and Xbox One.

7203000	7207000	A House with Many Doors on PC.
7207000	7210000	And finally The Bunker on Xbox One.
7210000	7211000	That was a busy week.
7211000	7212000	Yeah, a little bit later.
7212000	7217000	I'm more excited about the week after that where ClusterTruck comes out.
7217000	7218000	Oh yay.
7218000	7219000	That looks awesome.
7219000	7222000	Alright, well in Japan there's some games to look forward to this week as well.
7222000	7226000	On September 21st, Destiny Complete Edition is released in Japan.
7226000	7230000	I'm assuming that is the all-in-one bundle to bring us up to the current expansion.
7230000	7232000	That is out in Japan this week.
7232000	7241000	And Utaware Rumono Futari no Hakudo comes out in regular and a premium edition this week in Japan.
7241000	7244000	And that is all of course on the PlayStation 4.
7244000	7251000	But the PlayStation Vita gets releases as well and that same Utaware Rumono game comes out on the Vita as well.
7251000	7259000	But the Vita is also getting a game in regular and limited editions called Magic Cuyune Renaissance comes out on the Vita this week.
7259000	7262000	On the 3DS this week, nothing.
7262000	7264000	No, I take that back. There is a game.
7264000	7268000	One Piece Dai Kaizuko Coliseum is out this week.
7268000	7276000	Looks like it's from Bandai Namco and it looks like kind of a fighting game that looks like a bit of a royal rumble of sorts.
7276000	7279000	That is available this week.
7280000	7284000	That is actually, I'm sorry, that is a 3DS game, not a Wii U game.
7284000	7286000	How did I get that mixed up? Shame on me.
7286000	7289000	So that is the only release on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
7289000	7298000	I was looking to see if there was a Wii U game but it doesn't look like there's anything on the Wii U until Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens in October.
7298000	7299000	So that is on the 3DS this week.
7299000	7301000	So that is it for Japanese releases.
7301000	7302000	How about the UK, Loki?
7302000	7304000	Not so much in the UK.
7304000	7308000	We've got coming out this week NBA 2K17 as well.
7308000	7312000	And then COS-X3 on PC and Firewatch on Xbox One.
7313000	7315000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
7318000	7320000	Every week you guys send us emails.
7320000	7324000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to participate with the show.
7324000	7326000	You can send us your email.
7326000	7328000	You should send us some emails.
7328000	7335000	I know Dark Soccer is not here to read them but I will read them for you and we'll still respond to them here on air.
7336000	7339000	So send us your emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7339000	7342000	We do have one email this week so just one to read.
7342000	7346000	But it's from JT who emails us the following.
7346000	7351000	Quick question about the new NES Classic Mini System.
7351000	7359000	I've dabbled in emulation over the years and despite having some pretty beefy hardware and numerous plug-in and wireless controllers,
7359000	7363000	I still experience noticeable, albeit generally minimal, lag.
7363000	7370000	While this is only a real issue with technical platformers and seems to be very dependent on emulator, ROM, monitors, etc.
7370000	7374000	I've yet to get anything to feel as tight as an original system and CRT setup.
7374000	7379000	Now Nintendo has some pretty strict quality control concerns with their products and IP.
7379000	7382000	So I was curious about how this box will work.
7382000	7387000	Is it an emulator? Is there any way it can account for the varying display lag from modern HD displays?
7387000	7391000	Have mini box systems like this from the past played well on modern displays?
7391000	7395000	Thoughts? Much love to you and the show, JT.
7395000	7399000	Well JT, it's tough to know because the box isn't out.
7399000	7403000	We've seen some glimpses of it at like trade shows and things.
7403000	7407000	But even when they showed it at trade shows, I think they just showed the physical body of it.
7407000	7409000	They haven't really shown what it looks like.
7409000	7412000	Like we don't know what the menu system looks like or any of that stuff.
7412000	7415000	Like how you pick from the 30 games. We don't know any of that.
7415000	7420000	Now here's the thing is that you mentioned in your email about Nintendo having strict quality control.
7420000	7425000	And that is true and is probably why virtual console releases are so slow.
7425000	7432000	But I do want to point out, virtual console games have gotten by Nintendo's quality thing.
7432000	7436000	And some people have their complaints about the way things look on Wii or Wii U.
7436000	7438000	Especially like the colors being washed out sometimes.
7438000	7442000	So that could still apply.
7442000	7447000	We don't know if this is a new system that's being made.
7447000	7454000	We don't know if they just took like a Wii U and just only have the part that does virtual console.
7454000	7457000	Like it could be just a virtual console device for all we know.
7457000	7461000	I kind of, I don't know. We don't know.
7461000	7465000	And so until we have some of those answers, I'm not sure we can fully answer the question.
7465000	7470000	But I will point out, you know, how have other consoles, you know, retro things done this.
7470000	7472000	I think about Atari Flashback.
7472000	7476000	And I remember that like the Atari Flashback, I think it was the 2.
7476000	7479000	Like was a full on Atari 2600.
7479000	7482000	And like you could play other cartridges on it.
7482000	7485000	But it had all these things that were like preloaded on it.
7485000	7491000	But it was set up to work with, I think it was the white, yellow, red plugs.
7491000	7494000	I don't remember if that ran on HDMI or not.
7494000	7496000	No, probably not for that.
7496000	7499000	The Flashback 2 might have been a little too old to get into that.
7499000	7501000	But that one worked out pretty well.
7501000	7506000	So, yeah.
7506000	7513000	My speculation tells me that you are kind of on the right track with the quality control thing.
7513000	7518000	And the fact that they know that most people own HDTVs and all this stuff.
7518000	7522000	So they know that it has to meet a certain standard on these HDTVs.
7522000	7527000	We also know, and they've talked about, there's going to be some types of filters.
7527000	7533000	So it does seem like there is going to be some type of menu in there to change graphical type filtering.
7533000	7535000	Like you see in emulators.
7535000	7540000	So I'm thinking because of that, inherently you're going to have something to adjust lag.
7540000	7548000	And if they know that there's the different types of HD sets, that tells me that I have a pretty good feeling there will be something in there to adjust lag.
7548000	7555000	But we just don't know for sure until we see this at some type of show or out in the wild or what have you.
7555000	7562000	But it's through HDMI, so it's going to be made with the HD sets in mind.
7562000	7566000	But will it support 4K TVs and all that stuff? I'm sure it'll work.
7566000	7568000	With HDMI.
7568000	7571000	Yeah, I guess through HDMI it will, but it's not going to look any better or anything.
7571000	7573000	You know, that type of thing.
7573000	7578000	Anyway, I want to say they have, I forget who was working on the actual software with it.
7578000	7585000	They named, like, it was somebody that does the virtual console ports or something like that, that was working on it.
7585000	7587000	So, I don't know.
7587000	7590000	And they kind of talked, I'm trying to find the article right now.
7590000	7595000	They talked about, like, what, let's see here.
7595000	7599000	So, who was working on this here?
7599000	7601000	They have like, yeah, different modes.
7601000	7605000	There will be a 4 by 3 aspect ratio option if you want to do that.
7605000	7609000	They have different filters. You can also do a pixel perfect option.
7609000	7616000	I'm trying to see who they had working on it, because they did name who it was, I thought.
7616000	7618000	I don't know.
7618000	7623000	But yeah, I mean, I would be pretty confident that it's going to end up being good when it comes out.
7623000	7627000	Yeah, I'm sure it'll be a good box that's worth your money.
7627000	7633000	I mean, I don't know, because I have all this stuff on virtual consoles, so I don't know if I necessarily need to drop the extra money.
7633000	7639000	And we're also talking Nintendo hardware, so I kind of feel like it's going to be really hard to get one the first day anyway.
7639000	7641000	Nobody's taking preorders on this yet, right?
7641000	7643000	I think I heard that somewhere. Nobody's really taking preorders.
7643000	7645000	Like, not Amazon, not GameStop.
7645000	7647000	You know, and this thing's supposed to be out, what, November 11th?
7647000	7650000	So, I think everybody's kind of waiting to hear how many they're going to get.
7650000	7657000	So, I would encourage you, because this is Nintendo hardware, try to get reserves early.
7657000	7662000	Actually, Amazon's taking preorders, I think.
7662000	7664000	Oh, no, it's unavailable.
7664000	7668000	Yeah, I was like, I just looked today, and I'm pretty sure I didn't see it on there, so.
7668000	7672000	Target and Best Buy, they've listed here. Let me see if those are on there as well.
7672000	7674000	You can't, no.
7674000	7678000	Yeah, I think everybody's waiting to see how many they get, so we'll see.
7678000	7682000	You know, somebody in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, where was it here?
7682000	7684000	Oh, Brad from Pod Culture said,
7684000	7686000	That fucker will be hacked in a heartbeat.
7686000	7689000	You think we're going to be able to sideload our own games on this thing?
7689000	7694000	I'm just not sure how we would get them in there, because this thing isn't going to take any type of storage.
7694000	7700000	There's no, like, storage media, right? It's not going to take a USB card or an SD card or anything.
7700000	7703000	How would you inject something in there? I don't know.
7703000	7705000	I don't know how you would do that.
7705000	7707000	Yeah, it's some sort of mod chip, I would imagine.
7707000	7710000	Yeah, it would have to be something a lot more hardwired.
7710000	7716000	It would be cool if it was something that's plugged into, like, the controller port or something like that, but I don't think that they would be able to do that.
7716000	7719000	Yeah, but we'll see. I mean, surely somebody's going to try.
7719000	7725000	Anyway, thanks for the great email. Participate at orangeloundtrader.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
7725000	7729000	It'd be like, was it the, I think it was either the first flashback or the second one, whatever.
7729000	7739000	They had one that didn't have, like, the actual cartridge port, but it had the pinout for all the cartridges, so all you had to do was solder your own cartridge port onto it, and it could take external cartridges.
7739000	7741000	Yeah, yeah. Crazy.
7741000	7746000	All right, let's see. Let's move on to some other gaming news.
7746000	7750000	All right, so, you know, I don't know how we would say this.
7750000	7762000	Farming Simulator does what Bethesda don't. I don't know, but apparently Farming Simulator 2017 is going to do something that's unheard of on the PlayStation 4.
7762000	7773000	It's going to have mod support. And, yeah, I mean, but then again, though, Bethesda said they would have mod support, so I guess we'll have to actually see when it comes out.
7773000	7784000	But, you know, according to the Twitter account, they said, just to confirm, Farming Simulator 17's mod support on both Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be available when the game comes out.
7785000	7794000	So, neat, I guess. I mean, I don't know what kind of mods they have for Farming Simulator, but I can only hope it's insane.
7794000	7796000	Well, of course it'll be insane.
7796000	7799000	It might be worth it just to pick it up for the mod support.
7799000	7800000	Topless mods.
7800000	7802000	Topless mods.
7802000	7811000	I don't know what on a farm would be topless. I guess the crows. Scarecrows, the big boobs. That's what'll be the mods.
7811000	7813000	I can only hope.
7814000	7821000	SSU100Matt in chat says, people are going to mod it to grow crops of dicks and boobs. Yeah, probably, probably.
7821000	7822000	Marijuana crops.
7822000	7831000	BobbyBlackWolf says, Bethesda's issue with having PlayStation 4 mod support was more about how Sony wanted it implemented, not necessarily a technical limitation.
7831000	7837000	Sony might have put some restrictions Bethesda didn't agree to, but Farming Simulator did.
7837000	7847000	Yeah, and it kind of annoys me that no one can come to an agreement, and here I have this Fallout 4 on PlayStation 4 and I'm unable to use mods with it, which is very disappointing.
7847000	7849000	Yeah, it's disappointing.
7849000	7856000	Alright, well, moving on to something different, not a mod, but official DLC for a game that just keeps on giving.
7856000	7861000	Shovel Knight. And I thought they were totally done with development on this game, but I guess not.
7861000	7869000	Shovel Knight is getting more DLC. It's called Specter of Torment, and it's supposed to release in Spring of 2017.
7869000	7876000	And they are saying that the Specter Knight adventure is a huge game, so it's going to be a whole little kind of side thing going on.
7876000	7880000	And Act F pointing out there's actually two DLC left, including this one.
7880000	7889000	So, it sounds to me like this is probably going to be, I'm assuming, especially since it's been a while they've been working on this, almost probably the size of the original game.
7889000	7893000	Probably, type of expansion we're talking about here. I mean, we'll see. Don't take my word for it.
7893000	7897000	Wait for Yacht Club Games to say something more official, but that's pretty cool.
7897000	7905000	They did unveil at least the title, logo, and some of that good stuff there, so that is coming out Spring of 2017.
7905000	7916000	Alright. So, Sonic, the franchise that's been kind of plagued with not-so-great games recently.
7916000	7931000	So, there's been a lot of fan games made with it, and in fact, one of those was actually, they had shown some gameplay on YouTube, and the official Sonic channel responded to the video.
7931000	7939000	Basically saying, hey, BRB, DMCA time. Just kidding, keep making great stuff, Sonic fans.
7939000	7941000	That was a little shade.
7942000	7953000	So, basically, they have given the go-ahead to, you know, make fan games. So, if you're going to make a fan game, they're not going to smack it down, at least is what it sounds like.
7953000	7956000	Whereas Nintendo, at least their social media channels won't.
7957000	7969000	Exactly. So, I mean, obviously, if you try to profit from it, maybe, you know, they may have a problem with it, but as of just releasing a free fan game or something, they don't seem to have a problem with it.
7969000	7980000	So, I'm very relieved with that, I guess. It's kind of disappointing that Nintendo doesn't have the same stance, but they're Nintendo, so what are you going to do?
7981000	7995000	Hmm, I'm curious to see now that the floodgates have, well, I'm curious to see if they really do stick to that, because, you know, Sega's a big company, and I'm sure the social media arm's a little different than the legal arm and so forth, but, I mean, I don't think there would be that big of a disparity.
7995000	8003000	I don't think they're suddenly going to try to shut this game down, but I'd be very, very curious to see how this kind of opens the floodgates, maybe, for other fan things.
8003000	8010000	Well, if you remember, like, you know, with Sonic, you know, the Sonic Mania has a fan game in it, so, I mean, that's kind of...
8010000	8013000	True, and sometimes, didn't they hire the people who made a fan game to...
8013000	8014000	Yeah.
8014000	8020000	Yeah, so, there you go. Bobby Blackwolf says in our chat, time for Voggick the hedge-vog.
8022000	8024000	As long as he doesn't have shitty friends.
8024000	8031000	We'll just do Sonic Jam. There'll be another game jam that no one will make games for. It's Sonic Jam. It's all Sonic.
8031000	8041000	All Sonic, all the time. Hey, this is neat. Xbox One's backward compatibility, you know, they keep adding to it every week, and they just added this past week.
8041000	8052000	Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown, Bound by Flame, and The Maw. If you've bought one of these games previously, or you have them on disc, you can add them into your library.
8052000	8058000	But what's notable about this, this brings up the total number of backwards compatible games to 250 games.
8058000	8060000	That's 250 more than PlayStation 4.
8060000	8068000	Yes, so, and 250 games that you don't have to pay for, unlike Nintendo. So, there you go. So, Good Guy, Microsoft.
8068000	8069000	Yeah, exactly.
8069000	8071000	The things that happen when you're in second place.
8071000	8078000	You know, that's, it's so weird, like, like such a turnaround, but I guess, you know, Sony did the same thing.
8078000	8083000	The things that happen when you're in second place. That's what it, this is what it all boils down to.
8083000	8096000	Seriously, and it's just like, there's, you know, I'm, it's all very positive for them. I mean, I'm just, I don't know what to say. I mean, it's great. I think that I really hope they keep up with that.
8096000	8104000	It's great, but there are still more games I want to see, like Lost Odyssey, still waiting on that. Where's those multi-disc games? We know it got to work.
8104000	8108000	And a digital version. Can we, you know, pick that up? Because I don't think I have a disc version anymore.
8108000	8120000	Well, it'd be nice. It'd be very nice. Anyhow, a couple more stories here before we open up our Skype line. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call tonight, we'll be opening that up in just a moment. But first, Loki.
8120000	8136000	So, speaking of backwards compatibility, we talked last week about an NES emulator that almost made it through the whole certification process to appear as an Xbox or Windows Universal app on the Xbox One to be able to play NES games.
8136000	8151000	And of course, you know, that got shut down and they weren't unable to put that out. But that did not stop them. That's right. NESBox actually has created a version of their emulator that runs in the web browser.
8151000	8162000	That's right. It actually uses the Xbox One's Edge browser to be able to play games. Can't block that shit. So, that's very cool.
8162000	8165000	Interesting workaround from all that.
8165000	8168000	What are you going to do? I mean, there's not much you can do at that point.
8168000	8172000	No, then it's just an internet thing. It's just on the internet. What can you do at that point?
8172000	8183000	And apparently it works only with the Xbox One gamepad. It supports the A, B, select and all that stuff. And they're going to be adding OneDrive support to store your ROMs.
8184000	8192000	Before I get to the last story here, I have a comment in chat I want to answer that was on the backwards compatibility thing. Shehulk in chat over at live.vognetwork.com said,
8192000	8198000	How about getting the original Xbox games converted? That would be great. That would be great. That's a very good point.
8198000	8209000	You know, what would be a great Xbox 360 thing to get working would be the Xbox emulator. That's right. I'm suggesting we emulate an emulator. But if it works, it works.
8209000	8217000	You know, there was a lot of original Xbox games that worked pretty well on 360. But again, it was still limited, right? Like the DDR games were never playable.
8217000	8218000	Yeah, it was still limited.
8218000	8221000	But there was still a lot that did work. I mean, that was cool.
8221000	8229000	It would be kind of hard, though, going from emulating an architecture to emulating another architecture. I mean, you'd basically want to recreate that from the ground up.
8229000	8231000	Yeah, that's true.
8231000	8233000	I don't know where we're at.
8233000	8236000	I feel like he commented, though, it's something they're looking at.
8237000	8244000	I don't know. I'd be even fine with them just going the PlayStation around and reselling them. I don't know, maybe not.
8244000	8252000	But I don't think a lot of people have those original discs anymore for the Xbox. Maybe they do, but if you really want to emulate those, I guess you have the Xbox 360.
8252000	8260000	And I don't really know what kind of games you would get. I mean, I guess you could have the Xbox original Halo or Halo 2, but they have remasters of those now.
8260000	8261000	True.
8261000	8262000	I don't know.
8262000	8264000	They practically come with most Xbox Ones at this point.
8264000	8280000	I don't know what the point would be, really, but I think what they're doing is fine right now. If they can manage to do that, that's cool, but I just don't think the time invested in making something like that and the return on that wouldn't be as great.
8280000	8290000	All right. Well, we'll see. I still would like to see them maybe do it at some point, but I understand why maybe they want to work on it. I want the backwards compatibility for Lost Odyssey more.
8290000	8297000	I would love to go back to that. At this point, I probably have to start all over again, but I do want to play it.
8297000	8306000	We all probably would. Anyhow, one more story here before we open up Skype, and that is about, did you ever play the classic NES game Super Pitfall?
8306000	8317000	Not to be confused with Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns, which was a great game. The original Pitfall is obviously legendary on the Atari 2600, but the NES made a game called Super Pitfall.
8317000	8318000	I don't think it did.
8318000	8329000	It's awful. It's one of the worst NES games ever made. I remember buying it because I loved, well, asking my mommy very nicely to buy it for me, because I loved the original Pitfall.
8329000	8337000	I loved Pitfall 2, especially on the Commodore 64, so I was like, oh, Super Pitfall, shit, there's a new Pitfall game, I've got to have it, and it was garbage.
8337000	8346000	It was buggy, like you would just randomly fall off ladders to your death. I don't even know how something like this got past QA back in the day, but I guess it was a different time.
8346000	8348000	In Tennessee, low quality.
8348000	8359000	Yeah, right. So this game was pretty garbage. So, and I guess it was supposed to actually be a conversion of Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns, but something went really, really, really wrong.
8359000	8366000	Well, anyway, this game is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and for the most part, you would probably think, who the fuck cares?
8366000	8379000	But, maybe in a state of win, it's a good thing somebody did care, a person named NESRocks decided to actually give the original game a makeover.
8379000	8392000	Changing the visuals, redesigning levels, including new music composed on FC and Chill. So apparently, it actually fixes a lot of the issues with the original game.
8392000	8403000	Here's the crazy part. David Crane, who originally made Pitfall, legendary designer from the 80s, definitely on my dream list of people I'd like to have on this show someday.
8403000	8410000	David Crane, who created the original Pitfall, which by the way had nothing to do with Super Pitfall, because at that point, you know, the brand...
8410000	8412000	No, no, that's not me.
8412000	8423000	Well, yeah, he said this, but he actually reached out to NESRocks and said, truly an amazing and impressive effort, and to learn assembly language programming in order to pull it off is equally impressive.
8423000	8431000	I run into Super Pitfall haters all the time, and I'm quick to point out I had nothing to do with it, but now I can point them to your improved version.
8432000	8453000	Well, that's quite the compliment coming from a legendary game designer like David Crane, and you can actually play it too. What it is, it's actually a patch, so if you have the Super Pitfall cartridge, you get the modification, and then you use the patch on your Retron 5 or Retro Freak, and you can actually mod the game, basically, and play it.
8453000	8460000	And it's questionably illegal, but, I mean, are they really making money off Super Pitfall all these years later?
8460000	8470000	See, that's too bad. Like, imagine having that kind of mod support on the NES Mini. Can you imagine how awesome that would be, and horribly disgusting at the same time?
8470000	8478000	Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Stopy says, the PS2 Pitfall game is surprisingly good.
8478000	8488000	S2100Matt says, I just remember Jack Black being in the Pitfall commercial, and Dungeon Buster saying, oh, David Crane, he co-founded Activision and made that neat Ghostbusters game.
8488000	8499000	Yeah, he made a lot of the classic 80s Activision games that were on the Atari 2600. He's a real legendary game designer, so, yeah, I would love to get him on the show someday.
8499000	8506000	So, Dark Tetsuya says, I played a little bit of it. I think I might try to beat this. So, yeah, you can revisit this game 30 years later.
8506000	8513000	So, anyway, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, if you want to give us a call on Skype.
8513000	8525000	While we wait for some calls to come in, though, we need to let a little bit of angst out of our system to kind of cleanse things before we take some nice calls and smile for our callers, with a statement we call the FUs of the Week.
8530000	8538000	Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
8538000	8540000	This is fucked up.
8541000	8558000	You know, I don't really know who to... I guess, you know, it doesn't really affect me personally. I mean, it sort of did in the reverse sense, because I was going to throw an ice field, and then this giant field came right as I got to the other portal I was going to throw to, you know, for Ingress and stuff.
8558000	8574000	But an FU to people that spoof their location in Ingress to knock down stuff, because I think that has more of an impact in the gameplay versus people spoofing shit in Pokémon GO, which really doesn't fucking matter at all, I mean, honestly.
8574000	8583000	But yet Niantic isn't doing bullshit. They're doing jack shit about that instead of just fucking people over left and right, you know. They're just not focusing on the right.
8584000	8598000	I don't really have a lot of angsty things to put out there this week. Just FU to the fact that the weekend flew by too fast, and I've got, like, a lot of work to do at work tomorrow, which, you know, I like my job and all, but it's just like, oh man, I feel like I didn't get to rest enough this weekend.
8598000	8608000	It didn't help that they were having a party next door last night that was going to, like, 1230, so I had to sleep on the couch last night, because, like, I couldn't sleep through all the noise from that end of the house, so, bleh.
8608000	8612000	But, um, yeah. Otherwise, honestly, things are mostly okay.
8612000	8619000	There. I feel better. Hopefully you do as well. Let's get to the phones and take some calls. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8619000	8622000	Hey, hey, it's Rama. What's up, everyone?
8622000	8625000	Hey, Rama, how you doing? You sound different tonight. Are you calling from somewhere else?
8625000	8630000	Yes, it's called a train on NJ Transit trying to get back home to New York City.
8630000	8647000	My gosh, you are calling us from a train, so coming to you live somewhere between New Jersey and New York, which, by the way, I heard about that incident in New York yesterday, and I'm glad to hear that, you know, there's injuries, which sucks, but thank God, no fatalities.
8648000	8655000	Yes, definitely. And also, I apologize for the audio quality, because I am tethering off one of my many cellphones that I have, so thank goodness for that.
8655000	8658000	That's okay. We'll make do. So, tell us what's on your mind tonight.
8658000	8669000	I want to talk back to the beginning of tonight's show. You talked about those idiots who are suing Steam customers over bad reviews.
8669000	8671000	Please, what do you want to say about it?
8672000	8685000	I'm not going to name names, but there is a guy who runs a variety of anime, manga, and comic conventions in the Midwest, some on the West Coast and some on the East Coast. We've talked about him on our show.
8685000	8698000	It seems that he does something similar. Pretty much, whether you are pressed with him or not, if you write up a bad review about his convention, he will sue you for defamation of character and slander.
8698000	8705000	I feel like even I've heard about this guy from Facebook posts and stuff. So, the anime circuit has their own Amy's Baking Company.
8705000	8715000	Yes, and right now, when the lawsuit happened, the press outlet actually started a Kickstarter, you know, to raise funds, and people threw money at it.
8715000	8724000	It went to court, it got thrown out because of the jurisdiction, so this guy actually set up shop in this guy's jurisdiction and refiled the lawsuit.
8725000	8735000	Oh my gosh. So, I mean, are these people going to have to actually defend themselves, or is this going to get laughed out of court, or what?
8735000	8744000	No, this guy actually has to defend himself, and if you look around, you can find a complete PDF of the entire docket of what's going on.
8744000	8746000	He's countersuing for legal fees, right?
8746000	8747000	Yes.
8747000	8760000	Good. I think that's a very important thing to do in these scenarios, so that way when these things do get thrown out of court, you know, the countersuit for legal fees, at least you're hopefully not getting stuck with all that, because what a mess.
8760000	8770000	I know. I just think it's absolutely ridiculous. I mean, you put a game out, people are going to like it and talk about it. People are going to hate it and talk about it.
8770000	8775000	People will be indifferent and talk about it. You've got to learn to take your lumps and go with it.
8775000	8785000	No matter what you do out there, no matter what you do, and it can be something that you're asking people for money, it could be something you're doing for free, like this podcast.
8785000	8791000	No matter what you do, there are always going to be haters. There's always going to be haters.
8791000	8792000	Yes, yes, yes.
8792000	8802000	I get crazy weird emails and tweets and sometimes one-star podcast reviews for Orange Lawn Radio and so forth, and, you know, it happens. We have haters.
8802000	8816000	But it's just kind of one of those, you just kind of have to learn how to deal with those situations, and you just, for me, I just, you know, I'll kind of, there's a really good line I picked up at a podcast panel at Dragon Con that I think would apply here.
8816000	8826000	If one person complains about it, don't really give it a second thought. If two people complain about it, look into it. If three people complain about it, change it. You know what I mean?
8826000	8833000	And I think that's a pretty good rule of thumb is that there's always going to be people that complain about those strangest things.
8833000	8841000	And, you know, I try to evaluate everything and kind of go, is there something legit to this? And if there is, maybe I'll look into it.
8841000	8852000	But if it's just kind of strikes me as one of those, like, somebody just didn't agree with an opinion that we had on the show, and so they're lashing out with all these, you know, which is why we're garbage and all this.
8852000	8857000	It's just like, I just kind of roll my eyes and move on and just go, haters gonna hate.
8857000	8871000	Damn right. See, I live by the 85-15 rule. If 85% of the people like what I'm putting out, I'm gonna roll with it. If 15% don't, they can leave it as is.
8871000	8878000	When those numbers get reversed, then I know I have to stop what I'm doing, reevaluate, and flip the numbers back.
8879000	8890000	You know what, though? Even if one person likes what I'm doing, I'm pretty happy. Although, I don't know, 99 haters would be a lot. So, I'm glad for the most part we seem to have more levers than we do haters.
8890000	8901000	Yes, and you know, and it's an amazing thing, because every year I go to conventions, I can't go a year running into somebody who listens to the show, and I'm just like, I just get humbled.
8901000	8914000	And I take my picture with them, and I post it on the site. I'm just like, got a listener, they like the show, you should check it out. You know, I just get extremely humbled, because it makes me feel good knowing there's actually someone out there who likes to hear me rant about outlandish shit and fandom.
8915000	8926000	Same, same. You know, like when I get fortunate enough to do a panel, let's say at some type of gaming show or what have you, you know, I'm always, you know, the day leading up to the panel, I'm always kind of have those thoughts.
8926000	8936000	Like, I think a lot of people do in their heads, like, nobody's gonna fucking show up, Rob. Nobody listens to your show, Rob. Nobody cares. Nobody's gonna show up to this thing, because there's better stuff going on at the same time, ba-da-ba-da-ba.
8936000	8950000	And then I'm always humbled. Like, even if just like 10 people show up to my panel, I'm like, holy shit, people actually made time to come see this, and like, we're into it, because I'm associated with it, and it just like blows my mind. It's so humbling. It really is.
8951000	8966000	Mm-hmm. I mean, I've done live podcasts at conventions. The least I've gotten is like four people, and we get a good conversation going, and there's the times I've walked in, there's like 20 or 30. I'm like, y'all really want to hear the three of us get down and dirty?
8966000	8972000	Do you realize what you're getting yourselves into? And then we're like, oh, we gotta be PG, because you never know who's walking by.
8972000	8974000	That's right. Never know.
8974000	8976000	Yeah, I don't know if that'd work for me.
8976000	8977000	What?
8977000	8978000	Being PG.
8978000	8982000	Oh, well, you kind of warned the con in advance, you know, it just depends on...
8982000	8992000	You know, like, if we were doing a live panel, let's say, and you look out in the audience and you see kids out there, you'll be able to self-edit. I know you will.
8992000	8994000	Mm-hmm.
8994000	8997000	And if that doesn't work, that's what duct tape is for.
8997000	9002000	Yeah. All right, well, Rama, anything else you want to share before we open up the Skypoint again?
9003000	9008000	I ate over two, three pounds of delicious Tasty Pig and Brisket yesterday.
9008000	9010000	Delicious?
9010000	9011000	Yes.
9011000	9017000	Mm, you have me thinking about barbecue now. You know, I went to round one in Concord yesterday. I didn't talk about this during my gaming week.
9017000	9024000	But I went to the brand new round one in Concord, and it's right next door to Lucille's barbecue. So you can just smell the barbecue as you're going in.
9024000	9031000	It's so good, which is hilarious because, you know, Shane, who, of course, drug me to round one because, you know, who else does that type of stuff?
9031000	9037000	He hates barbecue. He hates barbecue the way I hate mayonnaise. Like, really, really, really hates it, right?
9037000	9043000	So he's just like, ugh, ugh, ugh, like anytime he can smell the barbecue. So it's just kind of funny.
9043000	9051000	I can get hating mayonnaise. I get that. Not everyone likes condiments. But how can you hate barbecue? I'm not going to get it.
9051000	9059000	You know, I think it's crazy, too, but I also kind of look at it and go, well, barbecue sauce is a condiment as well as mayonnaise.
9059000	9061000	So I can see if I'm allowed to hate mayonnaise.
9061000	9065000	But there's such a variety of barbecue sauces versus mayonnaise, which is usually just mayonnaise.
9065000	9068000	Well, they'll do. It's an aioli sauce. No, it's fucking mayonnaise.
9068000	9069000	Oh, no, it's mayonnaise.
9069000	9071000	See? See? So there is...
9071000	9077000	Just like the overuse of Chipotle. We don't need fucking Chipotle everything, okay? Like, I see a Chipotle aioli or whatever.
9077000	9080000	The only Chipotle we need is actual Chipotle.
9080000	9082000	Eh, we don't even need that, but...
9082000	9084000	Alright. Rama, I'm going to let you go, buddy.
9084000	9085000	Alright, take care, brother.
9085000	9086000	Take care, my friend. Bye.
9086000	9087000	Bye.
9087000	9093000	Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call, and say hello.
9093000	9096000	Which, actually, the phones are ringing right now, so let's get to another call.
9096000	9098000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9101000	9104000	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio. You might be muted.
9104000	9105000	Oh, sorry.
9105000	9107000	There we go. Hi. Who's this?
9107000	9108000	This is Eric RPG.
9108000	9110000	Hey, Eric RPG. What's on your mind, buddy?
9110000	9114000	I am just calling to talk about what I've been up to lately.
9114000	9115000	What have you been up to lately?
9115000	9120000	Uh, I got a cold on, like, Thursday, so I've been dealing with it.
9120000	9126000	Wait a minute, though. Okay, but in your picture, you have little Dragon Quest slimes on your shoulder,
9126000	9131000	so if you've been sick, then clearly you've been playing Dragon Quest VII on the DS non-stop, right?
9131000	9133000	Uh, the 3DS, yes.
9133000	9134000	Yeah.
9134000	9140000	Um, so, yeah. That's one way I can enjoy my weekend, despite feeling like crap.
9141000	9144000	And I didn't even go to a con, either.
9144000	9150000	Well, something's going around. It is that time of year where people are supposed to be getting flu shots and all that stuff, so...
9150000	9154000	So, you called to just complain about how you're sick, or is there some games you can play?
9154000	9155000	No, I'm gonna talk about the games.
9155000	9157000	Oh, okay. Yes, please. What have you been playing?
9157000	9165000	Uh, I, uh, in addition to Dragon Quest, I've also been playing Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse.
9165000	9167000	Ah. And how's that?
9167000	9173000	Um, it's a very much improved version of the original Shin Megami Tensei IV,
9173000	9178000	and they look like they actually put some effort into the story this time,
9178000	9184000	because even though the series hasn't really been big on a story,
9184000	9188000	they usually just put up a structure and then you just do things.
9188000	9194000	Um, they actually seem to have... make a better resolution than they did in the last game,
9195000	9202000	because the last game, no matter which path you picked, the ending was primarily the same,
9202000	9209000	and the conclusion of the neutral ending, which is the true ending of the game, was not very satisfactory,
9209000	9215000	and the biggest problem with that game is the fact that the maps didn't have labels.
9215000	9223000	I don't even know how they shipped the game out without telling you where to go or what the names of places were on the map,
9223000	9229000	because wandering around aimlessly isn't exactly fun, even though I still loved that game to death.
9229000	9233000	It was, like, one of the worst things about that game, so they fixed that.
9233000	9237000	So because I know you do game reviews and stuff, you must have an early copy of this,
9237000	9242000	because I'm noticing that Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse isn't actually out until this coming week, right?
9242000	9243000	Yeah, it's out Tuesday.
9243000	9245000	It's out on Tuesday, so you're kind of getting a little...
9245000	9249000	The reviews went up, like, Thursday, but I haven't written mine yet because I've been sick.
9249000	9252000	Well, and I think the Japanese reviews were very kind to this game, because it's been out...
9252000	9255000	Of course, it's been out in Japan, like, for a year, since February.
9255000	9261000	It's when it came out in Japan, and, what, Famitsu gave it a 35, which is respectable, certainly.
9261000	9267000	It has an average of 9.0... I'm sorry, GameSpot gave it a 9.0, I guess, so it's getting pretty good scores.
9267000	9274000	The only thing I could knock it for is that you're going to a lot of the same locations you did in the last game,
9274000	9277000	but that's understandable, since it's in the same setting.
9277000	9280000	Well, what if I'm somebody new to the series? Would I, like, because I've got to admit,
9280000	9284000	I haven't played a lot of these games, just because there's only so many hours in a day,
9284000	9287000	and I can't play everything, so I'm kind of newer to these games.
9287000	9293000	So, seeing as I would be bringing no knowledge of what was wrong with, you know, the past games into this,
9293000	9295000	would I get a kick out of it?
9296000	9303000	I mean, if you like the whole monster collecting aspect, but you want something a little bit more edgy, I guess,
9303000	9306000	it's a good start, but it is more challenging.
9308000	9315000	Than most RPGs, but there is a casual difficulty for those who don't want to play on the normal one.
9315000	9322000	To be honest, Erika, I actually bought Dragon Quest VII when it released, but I only played, like, two minutes of it.
9322000	9326000	I was so busy during the weekend, since I went on a road trip and everything,
9326000	9330000	I haven't been able to play Dragon Quest VII at all, so I didn't talk really about it in the intro,
9330000	9335000	but to be fair, that's going to be the 3DS RPG that dominates some time this week,
9335000	9339000	and probably for the next few weeks, because Dragon Quest VII is a very, very, very long game.
9340000	9342000	Yeah, it's like 100 hours.
9342000	9344000	Yeah, that's not even the side quests, right?
9346000	9348000	With the side quests, that probably is about right.
9348000	9349000	Oh, okay, okay.
9349000	9356000	The original game took me about 110, and this one actually has more continent.
9356000	9362000	I don't know if it has that much more, but they also streamlined the game, so it's probably about the same.
9362000	9367000	Okay, yeah, because I think they did do some street pass type stuff in it, too,
9367000	9375000	so I know they have some new things in it as well, but it's something I want to play through relatively soon,
9375000	9379000	because A, Pokemon Sun and Moon are coming, and obviously I'm going to have to play those.
9379000	9381000	I really still need to beat...
9384000	9386000	God, why is it the Alpha Sapphire?
9386000	9388000	I just skipped the name for a minute.
9388000	9393000	I still need to beat that, and then Dragon Quest VIII is out in 2017, and I really want to play that,
9393000	9397000	because I actually didn't play a lot of Dragon Quest VII when it was first out,
9397000	9401000	but I did play a lot of Dragon Quest VIII when it was out on PlayStation 2,
9401000	9404000	and gorgeous soundtrack, and funny voice acting.
9404000	9410000	About the soundtrack, apparently it, much like VII, is not going to feature the symphonic soundtrack.
9410000	9411000	Aw, that's sad.
9411000	9414000	But in VII's case, I can kind of understand it,
9414000	9420000	because apparently when they did the game three years ago in 2013 in Japan for the 3DS,
9420000	9427000	they couldn't figure out how to code it properly, and they ended up using only about half the tracks before it would loop,
9427000	9429000	so that was pretty gross.
9429000	9433000	So they were like, instead of half-assing this, let's just change it,
9433000	9437000	and plus it might have something to do with copyright, but I don't think it does,
9437000	9441000	because if that were the case, the new music would also be copyrighted.
9441000	9443000	Yeah, true, true.
9443000	9447000	Unless it's operating through a third party, and they don't have to worry about the legalities,
9447000	9451000	because they're willing to pay the price that they're asking.
9451000	9452000	Right.
9452000	9459000	But other than that, I don't understand why they removed it for VIII,
9459000	9467000	other than the possibility of them just simply not having the room for both voice acting and five language text files.
9467000	9470000	Yeah, that does sound really, really big.
9470000	9478000	Yeah, because what they do with the North American releases is they basically make a base European version with all the language tracks on it,
9478000	9482000	and then they code it for the regions as needed.
9482000	9492000	Well, I'm sorry to hear that you're sick, but I'm glad to hear you have several RPGs that are very, very, very long to help you get through it.
9493000	9498000	I'd also mention, while we're running on the subject of RPGs, I have a review up on VoG.
9498000	9499000	Yes, you do.
9499000	9500000	For Grand Kingdom.
9500000	9503000	Yes, you do. I hope folks should check that out and let their response...
9503000	9513000	It's a strategic turn-based RPG that has a perspective similar to Guardian Heroes in that there's three layers,
9513000	9520000	and you have to place your characters appropriately so they don't do splash damage to each other,
9520000	9522000	because there is friendly fire in that game.
9522000	9527000	And you ended up giving that game... Well, I shouldn't spoil everything, but you gave it a positive review.
9527000	9530000	I won't say exactly what the score is. You'll have to go to VoGnetwork.com to check that out.
9530000	9539000	But you mentioned that there's a lot of load times in it as kind of one of the maybe downsides to it.
9539000	9542000	I mean, they're short, but they're frequent, so that's annoying.
9542000	9546000	Yeah. All right. Well, everybody check out that review over at VoGnetwork.com.
9546000	9551000	It's still on the front page. Just have to scroll down past the recent podcast to see it, but you can check that out.
9551000	9555000	And if you've played the game yourself, don't forget to leave a response review to it.
9555000	9563000	There's also a review of The Walking Dead Michonne, and hopefully I can get Season 3 up.
9563000	9569000	Excellent. All right. Well, thank you so much for the call. I'm going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls in, okay?
9569000	9570000	Bye-bye.
9570000	9572000	All right. Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.
9573000	9582000	All right. I did something very strange to the audio recorder, and I'm worried that I've stopped recording.
9582000	9584000	No, it's still going. Thank God.
9584000	9594000	That is the first time in hundreds of episodes I've done that. I clicked on the recorder accidentally because I was trying to click to another window, and it stopped.
9594000	9601000	Usually I can see the little waveform as it's being created, but I accidentally clicked in the window and, yeah, screwed that up.
9601000	9605000	But I fixed it. So we're good. We're still recording. Sorry.
9605000	9609000	Oh, boy. This has been an interesting technical night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9609000	9611000	I'm going to see if we can squeeze in one more call.
9611000	9617000	So Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, if you want to give us a call and talk about what have you.
9617000	9624000	Is that accurate? Stop, he says in chat. What? Can't hear? Don't scare me like that.
9624000	9628000	Can you really not hear us? Or is everything okay? I'm over here. Everything's okay.
9628000	9632000	I see a waveform going, so I know it's recording fine, so I'm going to hope everything's fine. Okay.
9632000	9637000	Everything says it's all fine. Don't do that to me. Rude.
9637000	9639000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9639000	9640000	Hey, this is Hack Def.
9640000	9642000	Hey, Hack Def. What's on your mind, buddy?
9642000	9649000	Well, I wanted to talk about a recent announcement for my city that got me pretty excited.
9649000	9650000	What's that?
9650000	9652000	Well, Capcom Live.
9653000	9659000	Oh, Capcom Live. Is this going to be like a touring fighting thing, or what is this?
9659000	9663000	No, it's actually a video game concert.
9663000	9667000	Really? How did I miss this? I had not heard about this.
9667000	9678000	Yeah, it didn't get that much attention. It was featured on Shoryuken.com, but very briefly.
9679000	9686000	But, yeah, they made a local convention here named Gammacon.
9686000	9695000	It's a video game development and business convention, basically, but it's open to the public.
9695000	9705000	So, yeah, they're going to bring what is a Capcom Live concert on November 5th, if I remember correctly.
9706000	9710000	Interesting, because I'm looking at the website. You can check this out at CapcomLive.com.
9710000	9716000	I noticed Tommy Tallarico is involved with this, who of course is very big with Video Games Live as well.
9716000	9722000	So, I guess there's kind of that common thread there to Video Games Live, which is a great production.
9722000	9726000	So, you know, you're going to have some of that audio-visual stuff coming into play. That's pretty cool.
9726000	9729000	Yeah, again, I'm pretty excited about it.
9729000	9738000	Also, Shota Nakama also works on it, and he has worked on many Square Enix games as F of Light.
9738000	9746000	He's a pretty good composer. He actually, if I remember correctly, came last year to the same convention.
9746000	9754000	They made a smaller concert, but it was decent enough, but it wasn't that great.
9754000	9760000	So, hopefully, with this one, Capcom Live, it will be way, way better.
9760000	9764000	You know, and Act Deaf, I think part of the reason why this isn't getting a lot of traction on blogs and stuff
9764000	9769000	is that I'm looking at the site, and the only date that's on the list right now is this event in Mexico.
9769000	9774000	So, I think it's probably off the radar for folks in the U.S. and Canada and so forth, since it's in another country.
9774000	9781000	But maybe this is something where they're kind of, like, sometimes, especially when comedians, before they do a big tour,
9781000	9788000	they might do a test show in a smaller market, right, before they take things on tour in stadiums and stuff.
9788000	9791000	So, maybe this is kind of like a test run for Capcom Live?
9791000	9803000	Most probably. I am seeing on Capcom Live's page that they are having, I think, some shows on Japan.
9803000	9804000	Oh, cool.
9804000	9813000	Not there until, like, December. So, probably, yeah, they're probably testing some stuff here, which I don't care about,
9813000	9818000	since we are getting it, and I'm gonna enjoy it equally.
9818000	9822000	As you should. You know, sometimes, you guys in Mexico, you have to wait for things,
9822000	9827000	because you don't always have, you know, you don't have a lot of game companies that release stuff directly there.
9827000	9830000	Sometimes, you have to wait to get them from the States and what have you.
9830000	9835000	So, you know what? That's totally fine that you guys get something first for a change,
9835000	9839000	but I fully expect you to go and then call into the show and tell us all about it.
9839000	9842000	Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah.
9842000	9846000	Awesome. All right. Well, anything else on your mind, Act F?
9846000	9849000	No, that's pretty much it.
9849000	9850000	All right.
9850000	9855000	Yeah, again, I'm pretty excited about it, and yeah, hopefully, it will be really, really great.
9855000	9858000	I'm sure it'll be a good time. All right, take care, my friend. I'm gonna let you go.
9858000	9859000	Thanks.
9859000	9860000	All right. Bye-bye.
9861000	9863000	All right. So, I think that is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.
9863000	9866000	I'm sorry if you didn't get through, but please consider sending us an email.
9866000	9869000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9869000	9874000	Just wanna check in with Loki real quick and see if there's any other last-minute stories before we wrap things up here at OLR.
9874000	9880000	Yes, I do have something. Apparently, coming from Microsoft, they made a comment regarding Scorpio,
9881000	9890000	and basically with USA Today said that any games that we're making that we're launching in the Scorpio timeframe,
9890000	9893000	we're making sure that they can natively render at 4K.
9893000	9900000	So, any Xbox One games for Scorpio are gonna render at 4K, which is pretty impressive.
9900000	9901000	It is impressive.
9901000	9906000	Also begs the question, how fucking expensive is Scorpio? So, we'll have to see.
9906000	9910000	We'll see when they decide to give us some details on it, which I'm assuming is next E3,
9910000	9912000	but I suppose they could always do something sooner.
9912000	9913000	$599 USD.
9913000	9918000	$699 USD. We'll see. We'll see. It might be a very powerful system.
9918000	9921000	Anyhow, that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9921000	9924000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, please help us spread the word.
9924000	9928000	Tell a friend or five about the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9928000	9932000	but we can't get those voices out there if they're not here joining us.
9932000	9938000	So, a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or what have you
9938000	9942000	will go a long, long way in helping to spread the word.
9942000	9945000	But, you know, word of mouth is always really the best referral.
9945000	9948000	And I did just want to quickly footnote here somewhere in the show tonight,
9948000	9952000	talking about these places to hear podcasts just kind of reminded me.
9952000	9957000	I did make a post on our forums, which I also linked on social media earlier this week.
9957000	9961000	I did make a difficult decision to pull Orange Lounge Radio from Stitcher this week,
9961000	9965000	and so we're no longer on Stitcher Radio, and I'm fine with that,
9965000	9970000	because the show that was being presented on Stitcher Radio was out of date.
9970000	9973000	There were episodes missing, and I was getting tweets all the time about,
9973000	9976000	Where's your show? Did you stop doing your show? And all this stuff.
9976000	9979000	And I can't allow a network. I don't care how big it is.
9979000	9981000	You know, I know Stitcher's a very popular choice.
9981000	9984000	I can't allow a network to misrepresent our show like that.
9984000	9986000	So, I made that difficult decision.
9986000	9990000	Did you ever figure out, like, why is it that they can't update?
9990000	9995000	Well, I did. I'll tell you this. I did get an email probably about a week ago
9995000	9999000	that said something about file length or something was coming into play,
9999000	10002000	and they were having a hard time figuring out what was going on, I guess.
10002000	10006000	But the thing that actually really cheesed me, that really ticked me off
10006000	10010000	and actually kind of made me decide to pull the show is that they sent this, what, like a week ago?
10010000	10012000	They've known for months that this is happening,
10012000	10014000	and my understanding is that Stitcher has changed hands.
10014000	10017000	Like, they were owned by one company. They just recently got bought by another.
10017000	10020000	So, hopefully this will change for the better.
10020000	10023000	And I'm not going to rule out that we'll never go back to Stitcher.
10023000	10027000	I mean, if they'll have us at this point, because obviously I'm not doing them a favor here with this.
10027000	10031000	But I think most reasonable people will understand why I'm upset.
10031000	10038000	And for the sake of our listeners and accurately reflecting the regular show
10038000	10042000	we're working very hard to put out here, I made a difficult decision to pull the plug.
10042000	10046000	And it actually kind of irritated me more that they knew there was a problem for months
10046000	10049000	and didn't, like, I don't understand. No other sites have this problem.
10049000	10055000	It completely has to do with the fact that Stitcher pulls down the shows for their own, you know, network,
10055000	10057000	which is controversial in and of itself.
10057000	10060000	I know some podcast producers that really don't like that.
10060000	10066000	But I always was kind of like, well, you know, it's not really about, since we're not trying to sell ads or anything,
10066000	10069000	I'm okay not having those impressions or whatever.
10069000	10070000	I just want to get the show out there.
10070000	10073000	But I really hit my breaking point when things weren't being accurately reflected.
10073000	10081000	So, if you're hearing this, then that tells me you migrated from somewhere other than Stitcher to be here this week.
10081000	10083000	So, I just really want to thank you for making that.
10083000	10090000	And I'm sorry to have put you in that position from your preferred Internet player or what have you.
10090000	10093000	But I can't really stress this enough.
10093000	10101000	There was unfortunately a cost to being on that network that I was no longer willing to basically live with.
10101000	10104000	And that was the fact that you were missing shows.
10104000	10106000	And you weren't really getting the full OLR.
10106000	10108000	So, there it is.
10108000	10113000	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says, I switched to Google Play anyway for my podcasting listening.
10113000	10114000	I was on Stitcher.
10114000	10116000	You know, and I made a couple tweets about it.
10116000	10121000	And I got to say, I didn't intend for this to happen because this was the choice that I made for our show.
10121000	10128000	But I've heard from some other podcast producers that said, you know, I actually, I had a Stitcher widget on my site.
10128000	10133000	And I've actually looked into getting listed on TuneIn so I can get a widget from them instead.
10133000	10137000	Because, yeah, the concerns you're voicing are pretty valid.
10137000	10141000	So, I'm not out to ruin Stitcher or anything like that.
10141000	10143000	I want to make it very clear, you know.
10143000	10148000	But I just, they need to evaluate a lot of things over there.
10148000	10157000	And just run something that is not going to put the blame on us because their thing can't read the show accurately.
10157000	10159000	So, there you go.
10159000	10164000	Anyhow, that's really all I wanted to say on that.
10164000	10166000	But I'm glad I remembered there through the different plugs.
10166000	10170000	So, now let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10170000	10172000	I guess I pretty much just gave a big final thought.
10172000	10178000	But my other final thought I will give tonight is I can't wait for my Golden Girls pop figures to get here.
10178000	10181000	I don't know why, but Amazon isn't delivering them to me until October.
10181000	10186000	So, it's sad to see that they're out there in the wild and some of my friends are getting them.
10186000	10190000	But at least I know they're all on reserve and they're all coming.
10190000	10193000	And it's not like a pop figure is something I have to have right now.
10193000	10196000	But it would be nice.
10196000	10199000	And, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10199000	10208000	My final thought is I am going to work more on my game and hopefully I'll actually have some in the show for it now that I've gotten past that mental block.
10208000	10211000	Good plan. I like that plan.
10211000	10218000	Alright, next week live via Skype, Aethernaut will be here for a live interview.
10218000	10223000	I'm very excited to welcome him to the show and to welcome all of you back next week to talk about what happens in gaming then.
10223000	10226000	So, until then, have a great gaming week everybody.
