Was it enough to convince you you need one?

My name is Rob Roberts joining you here in Studio N7

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
and with me in studio, as he always is, say hello to Techmaster Loki

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hi

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm alright

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Happy birthday! Today is your birthday

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Thank you

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
I know there's other historical events weighing heavy on people's minds today for good reason

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
and you know, obviously our thoughts go out to those that are affected all these years later

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
but, you know, things go on and we still do our podcast

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
and you still celebrate birthdays

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
which is today

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
And what did you do to celebrate? How was your day?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Well, I...

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
This does not sound like a happy birthday

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I'd like to say I did something fun

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
but it really was just the wife was stressed out about the kids all day long

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
so she was in a really fantastic mood this morning

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
so I went out and got breakfast for her

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
and then we went grocery shopping

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
and the kids were just acting up like they usually do

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
and then we bought stuff to make food

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
she wanted me to make salmon wellingtons

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
so I made salmon wellingtons

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
and then she didn't want to buy, this week for some reason, the frozen macaroni

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
or not macaroni cheese, spaghetti and meat sauce for our kids

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
because it has MSG in it

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
so I also had to make spaghetti with a meat sauce

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
for two hours standing up, didn't eat lunch

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
felt like shit until I had some cereal

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
so I wouldn't pass out from stress

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
which we'll get into in a little bit

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
why I'm so fucking stressed

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
and then...

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Don't worry about this, alright

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I mean, I guess we could talk about it now, why not?

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Why not? Let's talk briefly about why are you so stressed out?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Do you need a hug?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes, so here's what happened

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yes, you need a hug?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
No

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
What happened?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
So, obviously it's my birthday today

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
and so I typically every year

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
because I'm weird like this

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I buy myself something for my birthday

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Why not?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Because everybody else is the excuse

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I don't know what they get you, you know, whatever

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
so that's fine

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I get myself awesome birthday presents

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I treat myself the way I deserve to be treated

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Exactly

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
My friends are very generous too

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
but I know I'm gonna buy myself something

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
And just on a whim

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
and I don't even know what prompted it

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
it was just like I was at work one day and I was on a whim

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
and I was like, you know

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
I haven't checked eBay in a while

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
because I used to go on eBay and I used to go look at DDR stuff

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
just for the hell of it

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Okay

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
And this is where it started

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
So in Rancho Cordova there was a guy selling a TechnoMotion machine

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
for $99 starting

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
and I was like, holy shit

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm never gonna be able to find something this perfect

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I feel like I already know the punchline that's coming

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
and I'm really worried

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Go ahead

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
No, it gets worse

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, it gets worse

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm already upset about it

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
So anyways, the whole week I'm stressing out

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm like, oh, I can't possibly do this

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
My wife would kill me if I got this

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
There's no way

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
So we were just at Best Buy yesterday

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
because we went out to dinner

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
because we have to kill time because the kids are there

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
and she's like, well, let's go get you something at Best Buy

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm like, okay, we'll go walk around, look at stuff

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
and I didn't know what I really wanted, so whatever

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
and so I brought up, I'm like, well, you know

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
it'd be cool if I could get this, this cabinet

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I mean, it's really huge

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
and she's constantly complaining, stressed out about how our house is a mess

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
because there's just clutter everywhere

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
which happens when you have kids, but yeah

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
and she wants to get rid of it

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
and I've already set up to throw away some of that

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
but I still wanted this cabinet and stuff

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
so earlier today I was talking with her about it

04:44.000 --> 04:54.000
and I'm like, at that point it was up to, I think, 102.50 or something like that

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
or no, 205 is what it was sitting at

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
and it was sitting at that for a few days

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
and so I was like, okay

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
so I gotta run this by the wife and see if I can get an okay

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
and if it's okay, maybe I'll try, you know, bidding on it

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
so reluctantly after, you know, she's very not happy with this idea

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
she's like, fine, whatever, just do whatever you want

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
and so, and then she finally kind of warmed up to it a little bit

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
after she was like, you know, once she got in the car and drove away with the kids

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
so I got basically the green light to go ahead and bid on this

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
and I was gonna basically cap it at about $300

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
I may have gone a little higher than that just to see if I could, you know, get it

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
so I'm getting everything ready

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
I've got my computer up on the eBay page, ready to go

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
and I'm putting away clothes and stuff

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and I'm watching the clock and the clock in our room's not right

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
so it's about three minutes before I need to get there

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
so I'm going to the living room

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
I notice the clock in the kitchen says it's one minute before, not three minutes before

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
I look at my computer, it's 30 seconds before the auction ends

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
so it's like, oh shit, put in my bid, highest bidder

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
but the problem was I put it in about 10 seconds too early

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I got outbid

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
so I had it for $250

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I had it for $250 for 10 seconds

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
and then I got outbid and if I only fucking waited a few more seconds

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
I would have had a fucking DDR machine

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
whatever

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
well sorry to hear it

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
it's so frustrating though

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I always thought eBay worked

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
like you're supposed to put in the most you're going to pay anyway

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
no, it's bid sniping, it's always bid sniping

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
you always got to bid snipe

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I decided to shop eBay

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
I remember doing eBay

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
but it was so perfect, like it was cheap

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I bought a copy of Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
it was cheap and it was fucking local

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
like cheap and local and it was a Technomotion machine

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
and the screen, the monitor didn't work on it

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
or it may have not worked, something didn't work

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
like the hardware for the Technomotion didn't work

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
but it's a fucking seller on PC

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
is basically what Technomotion is

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
it's a seller on PC with an old ass video card

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm like, that's fucking perfect

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
just rip it out, throw a new PC in there

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
step mania done

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
and then you know, fix up the pads

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
you know, possibly put metal over the other pads

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
or you know, we're golden

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
it just wasn't to be, unfortunately

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
and it would have been so fucking perfect

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
but I was so stressed out because I had to talk to my wife about it

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
and it's, you know, a big auction lady

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
and it's so stressed out

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
but now, okay, so you lost this one

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
okay, caeser-a-ser-a

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
but now, like, don't you kind of have like this pass

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
like, don't you get to put that card in your pocket

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
like, hey honey, remember when you said I could get the machine

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
no, it doesn't work that way

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
it doesn't work that way at all

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
but it's fine, you know, because like

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
you know, we're throwing away stuff in the garage

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
and I gotta move my arcade cabinet out there anyways

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
because, you know, the kids

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and originally I wanted to like set up

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
you know, dance pads with it

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
but it would have been so perfect not having to build

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
because it was the same price to build those pads

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
as it is to buy a whole fucking machine

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
so, it's like

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
you know, why not

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I mean, I wouldn't have picked Technomotion as my first choice

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
but

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
whatever, it's basically DDR machines

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
some folks in our chat

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
let me, of course, formally introduce the chat room

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
hello chatters, and you can chat along with our show live

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
we do tape live every Sunday night

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
and if you are listening live

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
participating with our show, you can join our chat

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
over at live.vognetwork.com

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
so, real quick

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
so I, here's what it actually went for

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
so I bid $350

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
even though we agreed on $300, I still wanted to have a margin

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
okay, because some folks wanted to know

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
what does a little higher mean, so

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
and I really should have counterbid

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
but who knows if I would even want it

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
it went for $366

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
it's still not that much

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
no, it's not

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
but whatever, I mean

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
it's techno motion though

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
it's a copy of a copy

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
but it doesn't matter, I wanted it for the hardware

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I don't give a shit about that

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
you deserve a prime DDR machine

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
you deserve something legit

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I didn't, I mean, it's basically

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
the pads are exactly the same, you just

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
cover up the other

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
the other buttons

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Tech 2030 in our chat wants to know a little more

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
if eBay automatically lets the highest bidder win

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
at the end of the auction

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
how do you still snipe people?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
because what it is, is you put in basically

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
say

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
say someone wants to pay

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
$250 for something

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
and yes, you could think, okay

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
$250 is all I can pay, you know, here's what I'm going to put in

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
but

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
you know,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I would have paid

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
a few extra, if I knew it was going to go for $366

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I would put $367 in

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I mean, obviously, that's what it would have done

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
and so, it would have stated that

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
because, see, the problem was he had

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
the person that had time to respond

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
to, he saw I got outbid, and he had

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
time to put in another bid

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
the trick, when an early bid on that stuff, is you wait

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
until like, there's 10 seconds left

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
and there's no time, you, if you're lucky

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
enough to be high enough, then you get it

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
and there's no time for them to react

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
it's all some damn psychological game

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
you guys turned it into something way sicker

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
but that's how you

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
get stuff for cheaper though, because

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
if you just put in, I want to pay $250

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
for it, then it's going to sit at $250

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
and someone's just going to pay $250

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
but it's all psychological, because you're like

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
$250 is the most I'm willing to pay

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
but then when you see somebody, some little fucker snipes you

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
and gets $251, then you're like

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
well shit, I'd pay $252

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
so, aha, $250 isn't the most

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
you'd pay, you're actually willing to pay more

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
that's the psychological game

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
is, how much are you

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
willing to pay for this shit

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
is, how much are you really willing to pay for this

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
it's a sick game

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
it is, but see, I'm out of practice

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
it's been several, it's been at least a couple

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
of years since I've actually bit sniped somebody

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
and I was panicked because

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I almost missed it, because I was putting away clothes

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
from the laundry

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
and I was like, shit, there's like 28 seconds

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
left, I'm like holy fuck, I'm glad

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I got you here in time, I just like

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I put stuff in and I was like, worried

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
because sometimes you put in a bid, they're like

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
oh, please sign back in again, you know, because

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
make sure that you're signed in

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
or some shit, and you know, if that

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
comes in there with 10 seconds left, it could fuck you

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
with, you know, not being able to actually place a bid

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I do want to introduce our guest

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
who's been sitting here very patiently listening

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
to the horrors of your

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
eBay day, but I do

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
want to quickly acknowledge some folks may have

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
forgot, where's DarkSakura?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Remember DarkSakura, this is her first

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
week of her hiatus from the show, she will

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
be gone from the show for a couple of months

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
due to an arrangement

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
with her day job, she's just unable to

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
make the show for a couple of months, however

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
we will be hearing her a little later on

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
during the Classic Game of the Week through the Magic Radio

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
she will still be joining us every week for that

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
and she did confirm to me this week

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
she got November 20th off

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
so she can be here for episode 666

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
so at least she's making sure that the important

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
stuff is covered, so

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
yeah, that's, literally, hell yeah

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
so, anyway

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
meanwhile, we

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
have a guest here in studio with us and it's

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
a friend of the show who's been here a couple of times before

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
but we're really excited to welcome him back, it's always

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
a good time to welcome to the show

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Gabe from Nascent Games

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
creators of Crumple

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Kinship and whatever

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
other projects this man takes on

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
because he does games like I do podcasts

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
and also

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
involved with Sacramento

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
IGDA, what's your role with

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
SACIGDA? I'm the founder and chair of

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
IGDA, you're the Grand Pooba

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
basically, you are

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
you are SACIGDA

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
so I put it like

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm the face of

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
IGDA Sacramento and then I have my

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
vice chair of Brianna who's the

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
voice of IGDA

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Sacramento because she's the vice chair

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
that's a very good way of putting it because I know Brianna works her little

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
fanny off for IGDA, she does

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
great work, and hello Brianna

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
if you're listening out there

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
so I definitely want to talk to you a little

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
bit about what's going on with Nascent Games and Crumple

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
and all that, we're going to get to our kickoff topic

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
first, I'm sure you have some things to say about this

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
as well, one or two

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Loki, let's talk about

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
what Sony unveiled this week in our kickoff topic

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
so Sony had their little

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
press conference if you will

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
they unveiled basically

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
hey, you know that Playstation Slim

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
that came out, or that got leaked out and had

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
reviewed and all that stuff, yeah it's real

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
basically going to be replacing

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
the Playstation 4 that's

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
available now

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and I want to say that it was

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
$2.99, and then

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
they've got the

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Playstation Pro

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
which is basically their

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Playstation Neo, it's what they're calling it now

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
it's sponsored by GameStop

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
well

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
is it?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
no, because that's just the first

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
thing I thought of when they announced that

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
would you like a Pro card instead?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
that's a page out of

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Microsoft's playbook right there

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
the Xbox Elite

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and the Xbox Pro system

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
everything is Pro

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I'm okay with the name

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I didn't think it was actually going to be called Neo

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
it's basically $3.99

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
it's more powerful

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
it will do

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
output to 4K

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
not natively

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
up res stuff, but it will be

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
better looking than

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
the other stuff is now

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and will supposedly

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
help enhance

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
VR

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and stuff like that

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
not even you can say it in a complete

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
sentence without just

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
foaming at the mouth

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
and that's precisely how Sony sounded

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
because not even they can be like

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
they just used a bunch of technobabble

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
no one gave a shit about it

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
it's just like

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
talking about

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
all this stuff and how they're gonna

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
maybe at the end of the day it's like

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
how much better are these games gonna look

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
and a lot of these games are gonna be supporting

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
these enhancements including

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
starting off with Call of Duty for third party

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Call of Duty

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and even Black Ops 3 that came out last year

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
will get a patch to support

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
the higher resolution

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
gameplay

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
but will they be free?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
yes

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I heard that some publishers

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
are gonna be free

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
there's a story out there somewhere

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
that Sony's saying

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
that publishers can essentially set

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
whatever price they want for it

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
no they retracted that

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
oh okay well that's good

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I think the first company to do it would have gotten

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
a lot of internet BS

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
yeah I can see them doing that

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
so it's gonna be something

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
that's gonna be available

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
coming out in October

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I'm not really interested in picking it up

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
because I have a system

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
already and I don't

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
have a 4K TV although I did look at 4K TVs

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
yesterday because I was at Best Buy

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
and there's some pretty nice 4K TVs that aren't too expensive

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
so

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
you know what caught my eye amongst that whole

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
press conference was the fact that they actually

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
showed the first Mass Effect Andromeda

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
like in-game footage and so

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
that definitely had me laying on the couch

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
going awwww

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I didn't know what any of it meant

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
it didn't look interesting at all

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I was living for it

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
every minute I was very happy

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
it's very pretty

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
oh my god and they're purposely obscuring

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
some of the characters and so forth

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
but I thought it looked great and so

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I'm certainly sitting there going okay

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
well if Andromeda

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
is gonna look better

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
on a pro

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
maybe I do need to get a PlayStation 4

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
pro but now

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
here's where I'm stuck now is because

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
okay yes

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
these games like Final Fantasy 15 even

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I think they showed in the sizzle footage

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
a lot of games coming up that people are

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
very hyped for that will supposedly look

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
better on the pro but then I worry

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
my television even though I bought it

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
last year as a 2014

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
model it doesn't do 4K

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
and I don't think it does this

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
other coloring stuff they were talking about

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
so am I gonna get any benefit

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
from the PlayStation Pro

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and I kind of feel like that message

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
was garbled like I

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
know they said oh yes conventional

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
TVs will also see a benefit

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
because down sampling

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I think is what they're talking about

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
basically it's gonna be a little bit clearer of a picture

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
but is that really

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
worth selling your system and buying another

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
system for $100 more?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
No it's not and honestly

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
cause it's not just the system it's the

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
TV too you gotta get a TV

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
and that's gonna

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
display that kind of content

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
and there just isn't sufficient content

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
right now period other than Netflix

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
but even the discs

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
it won't play 4K Blu-ray disc

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
which was the dumbest

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
thing ever because Sony came up with

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Blu-ray and they're the

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
ones and oh yeah we beat HD DVD

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
but now here you are coming out

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
with PlayStation 4.5

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
instead of waiting like you should

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
and they just

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
they put the limitation

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
on their own format

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
which is ridiculous

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
for them to have left

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
the door open for Microsoft

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
to be able to say hey our

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
entry level Xbox One S system

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
will do that that was a

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
real faux pas

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Microsoft jumped

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
on that like I mean they jumped on

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
that it was that was hilarious

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
yeah not this in particular

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
but there's other things that have really gotten me

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
like pro Microsoft camp now

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
mainly one thing

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and we'll get to that later but

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
there's one thing I'm like really

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
you can't do this like this bullshit

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
you can't fucking handle this

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Microsoft can do this no problem

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
but Sony oh poor Sony can't fucking

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
handle this shit and on top of

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
like all this other nonsense

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I'm like maybe I should get an Xbox One

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
then I can get this game on there instead

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
because I would be purchasing all my games

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
on Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
with their multi-platform you know we asked our

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
users on Facebook in our community

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
over at Facebook.com slash Orange

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Lounge Radio about the PlayStation 4 Pro

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
and here's some of the responses we got from our listeners

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
about what they feel about

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
this whole you know press

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
conference and if they want a PlayStation 4

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Pro or not our pal Critical Myth

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
said it's not clear to me what the benefit

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
of this console would be versus the

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
existing PlayStation 4 they have a

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
long way to go before I'm sold on the

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
need for it you know I'm kind of in a similar

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
spot with that because

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
what really got me was when

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I went back to go watch the

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Mass Effect footage on YouTube

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
or whatever it actually

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
the president of BioWare or whoever

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
it was sorry I forget who it was in the video actually

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
said if you're not on a 4K

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
TV to see this

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
go to one and

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
replay this or you know it's kind of like

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
stop now and go to a 4K TV and I'm

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
sitting here like oh okay

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
let me just run to Best Buy and get one

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
yeah let me just drop eight nine hundred

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
thousand dollars you know because that's you know

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
because you know you're the one percent

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
so thank you in a weird way

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
actually have them down about like four

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
dollars yeah I kind of feel like if you bought a TV

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
in the past maybe two years

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
that was one of the past two years model you

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
probably got I mean TVs are

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
getting more reasonable yeah I'm surprised how

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
cheap they were I mean they had those

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
all did HDR and all that stuff but even

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I'm not gonna go drop a grand on a new TV

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
just for this right and so

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
you know and honestly I think it was

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
that more than anything for

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
me that said

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
maybe I don't need this PlayStation

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Pro because I'm not gonna drop the money

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
on a 4K TV then this guy is

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
actually saying I'm gonna need one to

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
see the difference

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
so is Andromeda coming out whether

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
that was the message Sony wanted to convey

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
or not I'm sorry but that dude from BioWare

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
that's how he phrased it Andromeda coming out on

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
PC it is

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
and don't don't think

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I haven't thought that exactly I need to

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
go to that's like my thing right there

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
like I actually started thinking about like

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
why do I have a PlayStation 4

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
is it because of you know Sony

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
first party exclusives that were like I

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
was really interested in and I started thinking

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
what Sony first party exclusives do I have

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
that was really interested in oh no man

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
sky well that came out of fucking PC anyways

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
so

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
ah infamous

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
yeah that wasn't very good

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
um

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
nope don't have anything so

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I was like well

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
why I forgot a war

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
got a war is alright but

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
you don't buy a system for one game

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Zelda so

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I don't know we'll have to see

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
let me get through a couple other

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
comments on this from Facebook

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
some different perspectives here Tiger

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Claude said I currently own the regular

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
PlayStation 4 and don't have a 4K TV

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
so I don't need it however

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I heard that the PS4 Pro does not

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
support 4K Blu-ray media

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
so it's going to be a deal breaker for those who

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
want to watch their 4K Blu-ray disc

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
on the 4K TVs

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Degenerate Johnny had a very similar response

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
to that talking about that 4K

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
digital content from Netflix and Hulu but

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
not physical content from 4K

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Blu-ray you know

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
wasn't Microsoft placed in the hot seat years

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
ago for doing something similar favoring

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
digital content over physical content

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
digital content's all good and stuff if you

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
have the fucking bandwidth to do it

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
yeah and we've already hearing what

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
you know we hear what um

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
our home IPs you know the

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
ISPs are doing like Comcast and stuff

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
they're putting a cap

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
on bandwidth

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
you know on a monthly basis already too

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
so what's you know so now we

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
so now we run into this

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
conundrum of you know

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
this rapid fire advancement

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
in technology and

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
and clarity in gaming and

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
movies but now you've got you know

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
the ISP saying well

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
we're only going to let you enjoy it for a limited

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
amount of bandwidth before we kind of start capping

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
you so we're running

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
into a problem here so it's like

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
yeah it you know so

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
we've become so obsessed and dependent on

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
the streaming aspect of it you know

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
um yeah

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
but here we are you know

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
you know questioning are we

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
willing to drop another four hundred dollars

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
on essentially minuscule

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
upgrades well and then there's this thing

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
about one more one more response from Facebook

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
um Andy Ard said since I don't have

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
a 4K TV I don't see too much

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
of a reason to get one sure we'll have some

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
improvements for 1080 TVs but not

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
enough in my opinion plus I'd

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
rather get PlayStation VR this

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
fall and I don't have the funds to drop

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
on two four hundred dollar boxes

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
and that for me puts the nail

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
in the coffin of why I think this it's

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
this was not the right time well here's

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
the other thing too now it has been wondering

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
how well is this running on

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
how well is PlayStation VR running on the

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
regular PlayStation 4 I

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
don't know yet well like how

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
what they're demoing it and best buys

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
on a regular yes I know I got there a few

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
minutes too late yesterday so

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I was like oh hey oh

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
man yeah but I

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
mean I think for the most part I

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
feel like I actually feel okay

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
that the PlayStation 4 is going to be able to

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
support the VR stuff okay

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
but um you know I think that's a very

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
good point is that Sony's putting out

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
two new four hundred dollar products

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
this year and I'm not sure that's the

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
brightest thing to do especially

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
when it seems too early for this

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
4K thing exactly and Microsoft's

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
coming out with theirs probably I'd say next fall

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
so

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
already I mean technology is going

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
to be so much better like or at least

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
cheaper than what they've got there

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
and they can put out a system that's more

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
powerful same price

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
when actually more people have content

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
and like the devices actually

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
watch this stuff on I just don't

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I it's too damn early

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
it's like when they try to push that fucking 3D

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
TV shit they actually had hey look

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
it's the PlayStation TV and it's

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
you know got fucking 3D

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
you know TV and something it's a

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
shitty

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
small TV that did their 3D

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
stuff and then they're like ah

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
fuck 3D you know VR

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
but do you want to hear the hilarious part of this

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I pre-ordered one on

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Amazon anyway you can because

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
as you said

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
you can just go on there and click

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
pre-order I don't have to give them any money or commitment

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
or anything and I can go in and cancel

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
if I change my mind which I

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
kind of think I'm going to do but Sony

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
has 30 months to make

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
me change my or 30 months 30 days or so

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
to make me change my mind I just

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I still maybe change my mind on PlayStation

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
VR yeah because the more I think

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
about it I'm like what am I really getting

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
out of this and I'm kind of wondering

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
maybe if I should just wait and see

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
if

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
there's something if they're going to you know handle

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
this like they did 3D

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I was hoping to hear a little

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
more you know a lot of folks had said that this

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
PlayStation conference they did this week felt

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
very short and I was surprised

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
they didn't talk more about VR

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
considering that is coming out in a

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
month you know

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
obviously they talked about it in conjunction

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
with the pro but they didn't really

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
talk a lot about that kind of

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
surprised me how is it better though is it just

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
you know a higher frame rate and even still

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
it's like that's kind of

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
lame I think it's the same sort of

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
textures improved and you know

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
those sorts of like I don't

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
understand why I would drop that kind of

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
money for that I just

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I don't know it's just

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
that's all you've got

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
for me is that your games aren't

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
that innovative it's just it's slightly

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
prettier it's going to look much

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
brighter you're going to be able to see the details

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
but that's on any system though HDR

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
is going to be supported you know

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
on anything but

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
we'll get into that a little bit later but I'm just

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
saying what's the point in dropping money for

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
this pro thing because you're not going to

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I don't know I don't really think there's any

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
immediate

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
needs for that and look at the titles

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
that are going to support it yeah Call of Duty

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
is going to support it but is it everything out of the

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
gate I mean how many titles are going to be supporting

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
this right away and not everybody

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
has to support it

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I'm really curious what's going to happen

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
for those households that don't have

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
PlayStation 4s at all right now because

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I mean at first glance you would think oh

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
well if I didn't have a PlayStation 4

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
at all then great I'm just going to buy the pro

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
because it just makes sense but at the same

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
time does it because now these households

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
are faced with do I get

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
the PlayStation 4 pro or do I

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
save a hundred bucks and get a slim

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
is this worth a hundred dollars

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
that's going to be the question that these

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
holiday sales numbers are going to be very interesting

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
and for most families yes it is going to be a huge

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
huge difference because I mean

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
that's why Nintendo meanwhile

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Nintendo's in the background in the

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
in the darkness just laughing

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
maniacally like haha we're still going to be

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
cheaper than all of you

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
it does

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
really feel like Nintendo is just riding

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
off this well I shouldn't say they're riding off this holiday

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
they're riding off the Wii U

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
for this holiday but you're starting to see

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
all these other plans

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
like it's like okay well since

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
our mega beast won't be available

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
we're going to send all these other

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
little gremlins out you know between

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
the classic NES and the

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
the thing we'll get into with the iPhone later

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
on that I'm sure you all already know about

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
with that and

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
what else

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
the physical Pokemon Go thing

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
you know they're going to start attacking holiday

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
from all these other angles I think instead

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
and I think Wii U is just kind of like

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
you know well

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
come on down to your old

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
old Wii U saloon

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
not so much the Wii U just Nintendo in general

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
with their next announcement

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
and I mean because I think that's what

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
more I was referring to just because

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
you know they did pretty well last

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
year you know with them being

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
the cheapest at the time even though it didn't make

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
a huge difference

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
now but

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
you know but still

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I think that you know Sony shot themselves

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
in the foot majorly with this

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Microsoft's going to do

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
a lot better which is kind of sad

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
because the slim wasn't really necessary to begin

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
with anyway but

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
you know but yeah so we'll see

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
yeah we will definitely see especially

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
you know the games are going to be very

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
important I know the last month

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
of sales figures showed that

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Xbox One outsold PlayStation

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
4 now to be fair

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Xbox One put out that new S

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
and that figure is

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
the old one and the new one

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
combined

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
but still

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
you know that is not

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
a trend that Sony would want to see continue

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
and here's the thing what's really amazing about the Pro

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
is it's able to output

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
you know 4K images

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
you know upscaled but it's

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
you know higher than 1080p

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
greater detail

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
more fidelity in the picture

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
but

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
still can't fucking run PlayStation

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
1 games or can't run

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
PlayStation 2 games yet a

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
fucking PSP can

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
run a PlayStation 1 so what you're telling me

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
is that system is fucking weaker than a

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
PSP yeah the only thing yeah

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
what was that the emotion chip in the

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
PlayStation 2 that made all the difference with the

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
virus compatibility but they

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
still have now it's software emulated

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
stuff on the PlayStation 3 so don't tell me that

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
that fucking powerful ass fucking

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
system can't play PlayStation

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
2 games oh but PlayStation Now

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
has just no fuck you I am not buying

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
your fucking PlayStation now well it does play

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
select PlayStation 2 games available

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
for $9.99 I am not subscribing to PlayStation Now

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
ever fucking ever

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I am never ever subscribing to

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
that more like PlayStation I'm gonna save that clip

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
for when he subscribes a year from now I will never

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
subscribe to it more like PlayStation

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
never all right uh let's

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
see Dungeon Buster in chat says

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
it's been barely three years since the PlayStation

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
4 came out this still feels

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
like a knee-jerk reaction to a changing

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
market I just okay

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
here's the weird thing for me I've

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
been following video games for

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
even longer than this show has

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
existed 15 plus years at

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
this point right what what

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
is the what is the changing market

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I didn't understand that there

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
there isn't there isn't they believe

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
that there isn't there absolutely isn't

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
and and it's the cell phones are fucking everything

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
yeah I think I think it's the

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
advancements of the smartphones and

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
and you know the you know the the bigger

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
publishers are like uh we can't we need

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
to keep them at home we can't let them go

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
out people think because

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
people drop hundreds of dollars every other year

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
on a nominal cell phone upgrade they're gonna do

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
the same thing right they have the

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
apple mentality and they like they think that that's

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
okay but even we're seeing with Apple themselves

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
it's like it's Apple's losing sales

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
from the subs from the six because of

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
you know these sort of things and you know

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
it's gonna change it's it's gonna change

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
after a while people are gonna get tired

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
of spending five six hundred dollars

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
a year because it's gonna it's gonna happen to Xbox

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
as well that's that project Scorpio

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
that better be something crazy

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
good because because we're hyping

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
the slim but now we're gonna have

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
extra you know an

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
xxl version of the

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
one next year and it's like

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
well rumor is and take

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
this with a giant salt lick because

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
rumor doesn't mean much but

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
that Scorpio's like an expensive

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
motherfucker like it's gonna be a seven hundred dollar thing

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
like it is for gamers

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
that are dedicated and need the power

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
but you know we laugh but

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
check out how much steam boxes cost

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
you know like there's people willing to pay the

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
higher end power and you want to play Xbox games

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
buy a PC

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I mean seriously that they were

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
fucking pimping that shit

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
all fucking E3

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Windows 10 and Xbox One

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
exclusive then fuck you

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
don't need them if you want a more powerful

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
system why are you gonna drop money

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
on an Xbox that you can't fucking upgrade

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
unless you buy a brand new system

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
buy a PC that's probably that's the

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
thing is like that's why I was like oh I'll buy an Xbox

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
One no way actually no I will

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
buy a PC because why would

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I buy an Xbox One that you're gonna

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
try to sell me a new one later on and I don't understand

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
the point of this new PlayStation

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
system because

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
once again what is it

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
what are they meeting I mean are there people

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
out there going well that PlayStation 4 just

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
doesn't look good enough I'm not buying it

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
no one is saying that

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
nobody is doing that

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I mean people might be like oh yeah

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I wish it was 4K well

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
it fucking isn't and you know what it's still

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
not fucking 4K it just

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
outputs upscales to 4K

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
it's not 4K but there's just still not enough

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
content to justify you know 4K

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
like that again other than Netflix and such but

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
that's it like it's just it's like

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
we all said earlier it's just too soon

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
and you know who I pity the most and you know

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
of course this is gonna come from me

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
of course it's the developers

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
the developers who've been so focused on

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
even developing for the PlayStation

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
platform as it is and then

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
to hear now you're

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
getting two different hardware upgrades

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
or options and I remember hearing

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
some point earlier this year that

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I remember

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I don't know if it was Game of Sutra

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
or somewhere else were saying

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
that for any

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
new developers on Sony

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Sony

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
made the developer sign this like

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
exclusivity thing where it's like

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
your games have to be

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
4K ready as an option

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
like it can't just not

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
have 4K option and

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
you know or something along those lines

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
it was very concerning

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
because as a developer making

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
a game in even

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
1080 is tough

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
because you know because it's like you know there's so many

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
limitations you know whatever you know

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
as powerful as the consoles are you know

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
we as indie developers

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
only have such

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
a limited amount of budget you know

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
to make a game as pretty as possible

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I mean you know

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I mean for God's sake look at what happened to No Man's

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Sky as pretty as it was

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
you know what I'm saying and the approach that they made with it

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
they have a long way to go but they

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
but they fell big time because

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
of all the crap that they went through

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and they barely got by on the

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
PC version but look what happened

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
between PC and Playstation 4

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
all that stuff but my point is that

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
there's

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
there's a cost there's a huge

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
cost to creating

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
4K textures

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
1080p textures and of course

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
the people who are playing they're not thinking

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
about that but people like

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
myself that's a huge

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
that's a huge hit on our

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
budget because it's like we

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
budget our games you know

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
hopefully to get it right

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
we hope to get it right and

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
you know let's put our game in

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
1080p but now we're in 4K

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
and it's so difficult

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
to get 4K textures

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
you know 4K textures

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
implemented properly especially when

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
we've never made you know

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
huge games we don't have the support

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
we don't have the size of a

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
AAA studio and that's the other

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
big problem too like that's where I was concerned

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
with Sony announcing this

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
because it's like how many developers

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
are actually going to utilize

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
that 4K?

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Can I tinfoil hat something for a minute because

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
no just your line of thinking

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
here kind of made me think of something

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
is it possible that No Man's

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Sky you know because

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
obviously people have their issues with

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
some of the quality checks and things like that

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
is it possible that No Man's Sky

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
was rushed to market try not

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
to laugh because I realized the game was delayed like five

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
times but was it

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
possible that No Man's Sky had

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
to release now to

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
get around this 4K directive? I think

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
they did but I do

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
think

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I think where they failed the most

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
is that they

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
they tried to

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
they were trying to create an imagination

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
imaginary world this massive

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
not even world universe they were trying to create

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
this imaginary universe and

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
the procedural generation approach

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
in the on the development

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
side that's a really inexpensive

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
way to create a massive

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
to create a massive world a massive

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
universe because procedural generation

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
it's all in programming it's just all in programming

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
but the problem the problem with them

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
is I think partly you're right

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
about that you know on the on the back

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
end because they're like you know because even with

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
myself with my kinship game kinship

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
when I started kinship kinship was initially

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
going to be on the 360 and then

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
we hear about when they when Microsoft

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
moved to Xbox One and they weren't bringing

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
it wasn't supposed to be backward compatible

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
so anything coming out on Xbox

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Indie wasn't going to be able to be played

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
because they changed the whole architecture for

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Xbox One then the Nintendo opportunity

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
came up with you know for Wii U we were like

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
alright great you know you know this is our

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
second chance but now Wii U is dissolving

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
into the nether

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
and now here we are again like

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
well what's going to happen with NX

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
let's see what happens with NX so now we've

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I've just ultimately decided we're just going to make it for PC

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
and see what happens from that point

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
but you come to the you know

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
it is an extremely frustrating process

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
because you know yeah

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
at some point you know

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
they No Man's Sky was so

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
far in especially with the size

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
of their game if their game

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
was just a regular you know 10

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
level game you know couple worlds game maybe

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
a six eight hour game they

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
probably would have delayed it again but they were

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
they were in too deep with No Man's Sky

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
and they were like and they knew

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
they didn't want to become

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
and again this is

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I'm probably putting my tinfoil hat on myself

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
but they probably didn't want to be a star citizen

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Well I still like

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
No Man's Sky for what it is

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
and you know I stand by my early impressions and review

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
of that game but what I don't

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
like is all of a sudden there's like some

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
massive radio silence coming out of that company

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
like after they patched the PC thing

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
then like you check the Twitter

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
it's like dead like and I

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
realize okay you put out a game that you've been

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
working on for years maybe you need a little vacation

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
but you rotate

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
that vacation so somebody can

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
keep us in the loop of what the hell's going on

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Not for that kind and that's what I'm saying

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
not for that kind of game they

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
try to be and that's one you know even

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
even when I do my meetups

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
this is why I'm really

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
proud to be to have

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
founded the chapter because that's one of the

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
things we talk about in our different chapter

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
meetup sessions the one thing you

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
don't ever want to do

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
as your first game is

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
make an MMO

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
that's like game development

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
101 your first game should

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
never be a World of Warcraft

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
you just don't do that unless you're an

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
inheritance baby but even then

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
you still have to know what you're doing

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
It's too much to chew

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
It's huge and you don't have

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
it's not just the skill

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
set because one can have the skill set

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
to make that scale

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
of a game but you have to

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
the one thing you know nerds

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
a lot of nerds and especially

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
developers don't have

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
especially at the start of all this

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
is discipline you need

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
a mental discipline to make

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
that to make a game of that scale

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
and with everything those guys went

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
through with No Man's Sky yeah they

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
they should have

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
they should have brought it out and you know they should have

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
brought it on bits and pieces they would have been so much

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
better off I think they kind of did

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
well well

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I mean efficiently not just

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
not just sloppy but you know

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
okay well okay let's let's

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
shift a little bit to talking a little more about you and what

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
you're involved with and all this stuff so obviously you

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
are you know founder and such

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
as the Sakai GDA how are things going has

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
there been growth here locally with developers

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
absolutely yeah absolutely I mean

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
we you know the

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
the proof is always in

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
you know our indie arcade event

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
you know we we the I

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
founded the chapter three and a half years

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
ago and the whole point of the chapter

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
founding the chapter was

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
we needed

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I needed our game our

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Sacramento game developer group to be taken seriously

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I was tired of us getting laughed

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
at by by our neighbors

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
why would you laugh because we're Sacramento

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
because we're Sacramento we we

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
we are we are the red-headed

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
stepchild of of California because we're also

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
like if I'm not mistaken we are a

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
top 20 media market right top 25 media

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
market right but it's something something

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
like that but I mean again but she's still on

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
gigabit earn it though yeah but

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
like San Francisco is right next to us sorry

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
our houses are affordable right well

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
yeah they won't be for long no we won't be really because

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
all the Bay Area people are coming here no it's the

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
fucking arena's fault yeah it is the arena's

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
fault and and and you know and that's how

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
you talk like a Sacramento

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
playing everything on that goddamn arena well that's what I do

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
and I'm from New Jersey and I already know better

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
it's like no will the arena make them

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
play better no it won't and

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and my and and I'm only I'm

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
not going any further with the king's stuff other than

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
in the arena suffer than this statement and

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I've said it a few times and it's racing my

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
brows and I'm gonna do it again because I don't care my

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
opinion on it is that the Kings the

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
new arena should not have been a bit should not have

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
been built until the Kings won something

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
period so no arena should

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
have been built for an average team period

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
win a championship and then you get then you get a

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
great Christmas gift a newer well

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
to be fair counterpoint they've promised

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
to bring the Monarchs back yeah

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Monarchs were able to win a champ yeah

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and God promised me to be six three with

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
six pack sometimes that hasn't happened

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
sometimes you need a woman to get it done

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
well

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
anyway

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I just showed you

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
receipts

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
right so but

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
so nonetheless like

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
so one of the biggest things was making

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
sure that our game developer group was taken seriously

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
and more importantly we weren't losing

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
great talent you know

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
you know a lot of talent leaving Sacramento

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
to go to all the you know to go to all these

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
different locations and such which I again

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I respect that you know they want to work you know

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
they want to work for you know insert you know

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
triple big triple A studio here whatever

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
but if we had an opportunity to

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
to create a job

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
market here at SAC and

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
make them be like whoa I don't have

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
to leave home I can stay and

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
not have to worry about paying three thousand

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
dollars a month for a studio in San Francisco

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
if I get lucky and

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
excuse me so we'd like so that the idea was

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
was that you know we

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
have been nurturing and developing this chapter

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
and it has

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
expanded into wonderful proportions

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
I just put out a newsletter last

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
week and on our meetup group

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
we we are over

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
a thousand members now now it

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
is both and I said this in the newsletter

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
it is both a very interesting milestone

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
but it's also a concerning

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
one because we don't see a thousand

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
members at a time ever but

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
we have seen a lot more I will say

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
that in our newest indie arcade

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
oh yeah

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
yeah see the next event

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
that might change but for the moment

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
we'll see what happens but with our most

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
recent indie arcade back in April

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
in West Sacramento you know

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
we had about five hundred fifty attendees

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
which was more than double

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
the other two indie arcades

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I told you this

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
I told Bree this you guys are sitting on the next

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
big sack gaming con and it's

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
it I would say it's going to happen but it

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
is happening well I'm gonna

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I'm very proud

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
I'm very proud of this number one

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I'm very proud of the people that have helped

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
make this happen in the first place you you are

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
part of this you know what I'm saying you guys were a part of this

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
we just showed up and told you no you

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
did more than that thank you

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
so you did more than that

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
with this microphone cord I'm just telling you you've

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
done so much more than that because

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
no no seriously because and

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
because it's not just us our chapters defined

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
by everybody I just

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
host I just host and I try to

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
and I try to be the push for everybody

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
especially this man over here Loki

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
trying to get his shit done you know what I'm saying

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
that's what we do that's what that's that's what we try to

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
do you can find a way for me to get more than

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
four hours of sleep at night which is just

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I hear sedatives are pretty good

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
but anyway I digress so the idea

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
is is that have you

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
got just quickly have you guys had some games

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
that have that like people might

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
recognize like the downloaded that have come out

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
of Sac IG members oh my god

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
the one I think of I just

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
saw because Monsters and Monocles

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
that guy in Davis

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
that put that together in fact I need to invite him

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
on the show that

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
that just released on the

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
steam early access and I know he was at

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
the arcade event a couple years ago so

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
you're starting to see and they were at PAX

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
they went to PAX West while I was at Dragon Con

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
and I know they had a lot of success there

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
so I mean that's a really great success story

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
and I'm sure you've got more because based on

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
the games I saw at arcade

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
yeah Venture 4th almost

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Venture 4th is done

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Venture 4th is done Venture 4th was out and actually

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I'm actually glad you said that because we're actually doing

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
a meetup later this month in

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Elk Grove I believe it's in Elk Grove

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
at Elk Grove and Ed at the

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Innogrove co-working space where we're going to

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
do a Q&A for

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Skirmish Studios

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
as well as ArcLight for the Venture

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
4th game and because they did very

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
they both ran recently very successful

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Kickstarter campaigns and

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
we're going to be talking to them and

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
interviewing them to see why

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
what went right what went

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
wrong and what they could have done better so on and so forth

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
but yeah I mean Monsters and Monocles is

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
definitely one of those games

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
that's done so well and

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
yeah we've had a slew

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
more and in fact we had

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
we had a mystery

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
judge who she used to work at Xbox

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
I don't know if you were there for that

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
but she came through

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
and was like

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
you know I'm going to look around I want to see what's

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
going on but no one knew that someone from

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
that used to work for Xbox she works for

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
a subsidiary of Wargaming and

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
she came through and was like

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
here's you know I'm going to tap

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
you guys and I feel so horrible I cannot

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
remember the name of the game if Bree's in the chat

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I don't know if she's listening or in the chat right now

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Was that the one that was like a runner with polarity

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
type of thing like it was black and white?

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Yes absolutely and I feel

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
so bad we have the studios listening

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I'm so sorry guys because my mind

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
my mind is just upon the mess

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Which one? The one that won that prize

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
from the Microsoft developer that was

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
that was really good it was the

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
like you had like a

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
it was like a black and white type of game

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
and then like in the white spots would be the black

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
character that's running through and then the white

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
spots would be the white character

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I got the demo for that it was like the

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
rabbit and the owl

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
rabbit and the owl that's it

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
yeah they

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
they have been kicking butt

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
they've been doing great they got selected

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Bree's actually in our chat I just realized

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
she's the anonymous chatter in there

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
she's like screaming at the top of her lungs

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Thanks Bree

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Thank you Bree so

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
but again ultimately

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
there's been a ton of growth here and

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
we've started our most

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
recent progressive game jam

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
and a slew of new teams

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
a slew of new faces as well as

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
as well as the veterans that were there last year

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
and the year before that

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
it's been a tremendous

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
tremendous thing and

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
even now with myself I'm proud to say that now

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I can finally be a part of that with my crumple

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
game coming out within the next

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
month and a half-ish

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I'm so happy for you

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I was starting to

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
wonder if your game was kind of like one of Loki's games

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
we were going to see it come out

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I don't release stuff that's not fun

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
and I am so mentally working on

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
stuff so every day

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I think about my game and every day

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
you know jot stuff down

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
and I do research every day

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
well maybe that's the problem

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
every day I think about mowing the lawn

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
alright

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
no I don't actually

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
who really does that?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
that's alright I'm one step ahead of you

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I just don't water the lawn so it doesn't grow

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
well technically you're obeying the law

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
because we're in California

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
so fuck the lawn

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
so yeah with crumple

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
yeah

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I announced it

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
maybe even 3-4 weeks ago

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
that crumple's over

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
90% done now

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
we're working on

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
90% left now

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
we're working on

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
the actual ending for the first

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
episode since crumple for some

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
who've been keeping

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
close lock on our game

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
crumple's going to be released in episodes

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
and so the first episode is

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
like I mentioned a little over 90% done

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
we're working on the ending to how episode 1 will

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
end it's going to be really

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
pretty intense and

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
we're just putting the final touches of any

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
bugs squashing in the code but

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
yeah we're almost done

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
you wouldn't think a game starring an envelope would be intense

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
but

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
see one thing about me

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
and this is something that

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
this is another reason why I started this chapter

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
because I came in as the

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
idea guy I do not

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
have any art skill I do not have

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
any coding skill but I could tell a

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
story because I've done poetry and I

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
have a wacky imagination the thing

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
with me it's about what's on the inside

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and that's anthrax

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
let him finish

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
shut up

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
so what happens

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
is

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
you know what's on your inside? pepperoni

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
I don't eat pepperoni it's all

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
garlic and parmesan

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
so what happens is

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
that for me it was

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
you know even if you have the imagination

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
and the idea you can make something

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
beautiful you can make something very intense

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
and I mean I think we've seen

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I mean you know

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
a lot of games that seem

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
simple on the surface are actually very

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
very intense Limbo which was part

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
inspiration for Crumple comes to mind

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
like okay a 10 year old boy black and white

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
silhouette okay what's why

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
and that game turned out to be incredibly

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
intense and atmospheric so

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
to be able to achieve that on

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Crumple knowing we were making it on

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
a flash

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
it's like how are we going to pull this off but

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
we've been able to do it and I can't wait

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
when we show the little

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
progression reel of how Crumple

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
started how it looked when it first started

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
as compared to how it looks now with all

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
the sounds and you know the

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
attention to detail I'm excited to play it again

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I think the last time I played it was almost a year ago

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
at that Reno thing oh my goodness

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
yeah yeah you can

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
actually play the demo now

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
there's been a demo for probably

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
near a year now on Newgrounds

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
and well as a listener of this fine program

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
please tell me where I can get this demo

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
so oh man I

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
did you have something on good old games

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
though I thought or no

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I'm thinking of the other one Desura

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
so the demo started on Desura

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
went just dissipated into

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
had some problems yes dissipated

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
quietly so yes

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
we'll call it um but yeah we

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
so there's actually a demo on itch itch.io

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
as well but I don't really remember

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
but so it but on Newgrounds

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
and they've been super supportive Newgrounds have

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
actually been retweeting and liking my stuff

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
as well which is pretty cool but on new

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
but I don't have the exact link off the top of my

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
head because it's like numerical so just

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Newgrounds go on Newgrounds.com

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
on the search type Crumple

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
it'll be the first link you'll see it

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
you don't need to sign up for an account

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
on Newgrounds you can just play it and

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
yeah it's it's not the newest

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
newest version but it

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
it's pretty it's it's

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
generally pretty close to where we're at we've made

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
a number of upgrades and touch-ups

this sucks you're never gonna play this again

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
this game is so hard it's not gonna tell me anything it's like

want to make you want that feedback from the O.L.R. listeners

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
before the rest of the internet we're

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
very we're very fortunate here at O.L.R.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
that we have some pretty pretty decent minded

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
people in this program thank you decent

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
minded adults or children whichever

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
that's great glad to glad to

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
hear that well a lot of them did start off as children

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
and now we're adults

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
you have to have a little bit of a thick skin to put up a

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Loki's crap three hours three hours a week I have

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
four sisters man he does not need they

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
know he can do that hasn't already happened

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
uh tell us briefly about kinship what what is

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
kinship where's where's this at kinship

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
right now um it you know just

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
like any almost anything in the game development it has

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
suffered its setbacks um

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
you know both on a technological tech

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
uh tech standpoint you know as

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
well as um who

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
who's able to help and and and you

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
know so on and so forth and it's

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
kinship is um it's

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
funny because kinship initially started as

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
a the original idea with kinship was

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
that it was going to be a fan remake

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
of Gradius 3 and

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
I then I decided no fan remakes

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I can't be doing that I need to do

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
something original if I'm going to spend three years making

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
something might as well make something new and original

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
you can come up with something Gabriel do

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
something so I did so so here we

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
are now again you know as we

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
talked earlier kinship started as a 360

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
game you know was becoming

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
what's going to hopefully be a Wii U game

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
that's not going to happen now so now

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
we we look at just PC for the moment

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
and then console wise see what

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
what comes from that um

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
on the I've do you have

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
your 4k textures ready to go hell no

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
4k you know

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
can whatever so anyway so 4k

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
this so the idea is is that

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
um you know I've

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
involved myself more in the

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
development side I've actually learned

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
how to do environments

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
and build levels out so I'm not

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I was gonna I was gonna say and I just to back up

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
a little bit I was very blown away when you

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
just said now because I didn't even realize

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
this you said that you didn't code

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
crumple and I always had this

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
thing in my mind that oh you you coded

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
right in there with the best of them but you you're

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
more of like a project manager is kind of what you're

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
doing right you're making you see the plan

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
and you're making sure all the moving parts

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
are doing this but it sounds like you got your

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
hands a little dirtier with kinship you actually

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
got in there and and did some more

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
of the environments yeah I've been

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
developing more of the environments um if

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
you look at it's not it's not

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
a very very recent trailer but well

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
actually no I actually posted a gameplay

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
trailer back in March before the indie arcade

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
event I posted a game our first gameplay

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
trailer on our YouTube channel um

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
youtube.com slash nascent games

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
go there and and look up the

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
stage three for kinship

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
gameplay I actually created that

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
that that it was a space

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
you know just kind of the easiest thing to create

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
first but I did but yeah it was

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
a great place to start and you're gonna get to see

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
get an idea of what kinship

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
looks like how it feels so on and so forth

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
and I I saw Bree's comment about the soundtrack

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
yes uh we have

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
definitely check our soundtrack on Bandcamp

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
we have um a compilation soundtrack

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
um and I just released a demo track on

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
there now um yeah nascent games

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
dot com dot excuse me nascent games

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
dot bandcamp dot

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
com yes definitely thank you

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
so anyway so kinship um

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
kinship is gonna end up

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I'm working on the next trailer now for kinship

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
uh it's going to be

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
it's gonna become much more

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
personal for me because I've gone through

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
both the technical setbacks

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
as well as the personal setbacks

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
with with with the development of this game

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
when this game comes out

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
it's probably gonna piss off a couple

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
of people who know they were involved with

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
it and were no longer involved with it

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
and there's gonna be messages to them

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
in very subtle subtle ways

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
wait whoa whoa whoa whoa

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
what fucking dynasty unfolding

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
here dynasty in space unfolding here

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
so you're are you wearing dirty laundry

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
here on this project you did so you had

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
people that you were working on this game with

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
that are no longer a part of the project

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
for I'm assuming creative differences

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
is always politically correct yeah

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
those two words but you are you're flat out saying

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
listen listen all y'all

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
I've left I left I left you bitches

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
some messages in my game

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
yeah the idea here yeah

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
you're like the fucking Taylor Swift of

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
video games

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I I hopefully don't want to go

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
that way yeah snake

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
game some more like a solid snake

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
a sneaky snake fuck you

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
so any good

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
thank you good so here's

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
so here's my whole thing with with that I

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
don't I I I'm always

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
grateful for both the good and the bad

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
experiences whatever whatever we go through

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
the one thing I mean

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
we've seen it happen to so many game

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
developers you know especially those

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
who kind of

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
kind of had their hands you know

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
just by themselves and then they decide to sneak

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
one more person in you know

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
and I mean we won't you know I'm sure we can

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
all we can all think of immediately who

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
who we think of when I when I say that

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
um you know uh

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
anyway so nonetheless it's like we think

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
about what we think about what happened

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
you know what happened with

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
those challenges with me

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
it's not it with me

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
it was more you

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
it was a couple of things you had

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
you had those who

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
had the drive but

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
didn't you know they they had the drive

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
but their ego got in the way

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
but then you had those who

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
you know who were very humble

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
but not

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
not at all confident in their skill

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
set and it affects you during your

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
game development and after a while

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
you know you try to

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
you try to empower them

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
there's one thing I learned

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
very early on with this is that because

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I don't know anything about development

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
you know I had to make sure

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I came at this from a very

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
from you know from a very reasonable point

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
of view and very empowering point of view

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
and you know this

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
year you know

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
and I've run into the issue a few times

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I mean you know to the point where someone

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and this was very early on in development not

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
recently but to the point where

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
someone actually sat down with me

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
and asked me to make them

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
the producer of my game

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
they asked me to make them a producer of my game

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
and they hadn't actually made anything for me yet

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
and they hadn't even graduated school yet

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I said why would I make you that

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
why would I make you that at all

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
because they were like well I need to have that on my resume

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I'm like no you need to earn it

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
and we run into

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
those egos and that's part of the

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
biggest problem one of the biggest problems with

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
this is that

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
you know we

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
you know I run into those things and

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
I'm left speechless like what the hell do I

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
how do I even respond to this sort of thing

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
so for me you know it became

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
and it's very frustrating because

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
it's like again with the ton of other

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
setbacks that I already had

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
you know now that

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
becomes you don't want to take it personal

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
but it's like I don't share

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
my story with why I'm

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
making my games to just anybody

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
you know unless I'm selling

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
you the game and you want to understand

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
why but if I'm asking you to help me make this game

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
and I share my story it's for real

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
and to just kind of for those

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
things to happen is a big slap

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
in the face but I

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
don't vent about that sort of thing

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
online I'm not typing multiple messages online

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
or anything like that here

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
us as friends we talk

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
about that because and it's something I share

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
with the people in my chapter too when we talk about

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
that it's you know

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
it's a thing was you have to be ready for

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
that you're going to come across people like that

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and you have to know how to handle yourself

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
when something like that happens

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
that's part of life and also part of business is that

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
there's going to be people that you have unfortunate

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
you know run-ins with and circumstances

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
with and you you know you

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
learn from every experience

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
so what I'm understanding here is I'm going to be the executive producer

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
on this game that's fantastic

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
but what I

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
but what I do like about this and you know

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
well I mean not that this

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
story is unfortunate and everything but

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
what I do like about what you know you're talking

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
about with the story and how you

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
were not really coding for crumple but you got

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
in there a little more with kinship and I think this is a

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
very very very important point that we don't always

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
talk about but it does seem

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
to come up whenever you or Brie

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
are on the show and it's it's definitely

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
worth repeating is that you don't

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
necessarily have to be a and I'm gonna use

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
my quote-y fingers code monkey right

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
to get and no offense to the code monkeys

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
of the world we wouldn't have gaming

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
for y'all but here's

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
the and it's a great Jonathan Colton song it is

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
however

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
however you don't necessarily have to

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
already know

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
unity you don't know

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
uh

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
c++ you don't have to know

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
visual game makers on sale this week

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
you don't have to know one dollar in order

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
to make a game because sometimes the key

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
part to making a game is networking

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
with the right people that you want

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
to make a game with but then that turns

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
into a family and sometimes you get

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
family problems right game

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
development is all about

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
chemistry no matter no

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
no coding no coding skill

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
no art skill no

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
animation skill no 3d modeling skill

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
or two or you know 2d or 2d

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
our art assets go describing me right now

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
none of that is gonna matter

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
if you don't have the chemistry with

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
your people and you know

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
and that has to come from both ends and

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and and with that chemistry has to come

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
accountability and part of the issue

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
um with my with my past

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
uh with the past issues I've run into

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
has mainly been between

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
you know the the just filthy

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
arrogance and the and the filthy lack

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
of accountability because it's

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
you know you you know

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I myself start questioning

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
my own capabilities

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
on what what I can what

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I've been doing and the impact

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I've been leaving with both the community and my

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
own games and it took me long

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
it took me so long

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
to finally decide

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
what part of game development was I

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
gonna do because I tried to get into

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
animation back in the late 90s you know or

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
mid 90s when when Donkey Kong Country

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
came out on the Super Nintendo how

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
inspired I was to like oh my god

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I want to do this seeing what they did

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
to make that silicone graphics was my friend

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I wanted them I wanted to marry

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
them and but as I got

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
doesn't right well of course

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
indeed but the idea was is that

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I as I learned more and more about animation

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
what it took I like I can't

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
draw so for the next

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
15 years I gave

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
up on myself and just

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
went with a regular life and I was part of

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
the sheep and just worked and then

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
and put my dreams aside and now

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
here I am at this point where I'm so close

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
now and I've got crumple coming

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
out and and I

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
turned 40 at the end of November

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and November 28th

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
that crumple

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
is going to be out through

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
hell or high water before

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I turn 40 and

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
and I'm telling you with all these things that I've

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
gone through that you know

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
that's why it's like we learn from this

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
we chalk it up to the experience and

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
when we put the credits when the

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
when kinship finally is done

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
and we put those credits up and in

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
that special thanks section you know how you see

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
the special thanks and all these different

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
the special thanks are going to be to all those people

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
who didn't do an effing thing for me

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and I can't wait I can't wait but it's also

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
going to be mixed with the good people who were supportive

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
and all that stuff but it's going to be a great guessing game

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
because it's going to be like wow wow

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
which one of them really pissed him off and which one

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
actually supported him you'll never know

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
and it's a beautiful thing so

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
but anyway all that aside so

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I don't know how to follow that up

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
but I'm excited to play

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
that game

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
and kinship which will be out

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
so come hell or high water

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
before your 40th birthday

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
what's interesting in hearing you talk and say all that story

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
is it was so funny to me in a way

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
not funny haha but ironic

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
is you could just replace like everything you said

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
with radio and hey it's me

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
because that's what I went to college to do

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
was to do radio well originally

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
it started that originally

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
originally it started I was going to be a weatherman

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
so was when I was a little kid

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
when the weather channel came out oh my

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
god I was so obsessed with that so you're not alone

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
can you imagine Rob Roberts with the weather

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
so there was and then I actually

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I did broadcast journalism

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I actually interned at a television

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
station in the town where I went to school

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and I learned about how fucking miserable

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
everybody was there

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
and I started to realize like I don't know

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
if this is really for me and then you start to get into

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
radio and this was right

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
when the internet was starting to boom and all this other stuff

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
and there's this very like ho-hum

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
attitude in radio and it's like you know

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
you can work your way

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
you can work and work and work and work all these hours

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
but if you don't suck the right dick you're just not

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
going to get anywhere with radio and I'm just kind of like

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I don't know if this is

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I don't know if this is the life I son of

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
but here we are

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Bree who's big in radio

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
now in TV she could totally

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
tell you all you just got called out Rob Roberts

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Roker that's what he put

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
you know and I have

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
mad respect for people

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
like Bree who stayed in

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
that industry and have really

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
worked on that from the inside

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
for me I was like

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
eh I'm going to just

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
go work a temp job and see

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
what I can do with my life and figure this out

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
another way and started

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
radio as a fun little thing on the side

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
and shit here we are

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I'm going to be turning 40 in a couple years and

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
we got some podcasts

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
but I love it you know

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I've been able to do all this on my terms

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Absolutely and no one can

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
ever take that away from you and that

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
is the same thing with game development and that's the same

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
thing that I have to tell myself

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
everyday and that's the same thing I have to

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
tell other people like this is going to probably be

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
the one and only platform

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
that I'm going to share kind of the more

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
personal stuff that I kind of did here

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
no one's ever going to hear this again because I got to

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
keep going forward but I think this was healthy

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
for me because I haven't really been able to

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
share this because

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I'm glad we can be your psychological outlet

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
you like how we have a couch here in the studio?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I just, I'm not, should I put my feet up?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
If you want, make some home

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Put my feet up and lay back, that's just awesome

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Definitely, so thank you

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
for that by the way

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I just feel a little weird that you

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
talk about some of those difficulties and we

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
follow that up with, hey but you should all try

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
to get into game development

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
No they have to be ready for that

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
you have to be ready for the good and bad

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And that is life, you could be involved

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
in sports, you could be involved

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
in podcasting

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
you could be involved, and there's going to be

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
people that are

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
great, that you work with great like Loki and

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Dark Soccer and there's going to be people in your life

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
that you don't work with so well, greatly

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and that's just going to happen

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
although honestly, like I don't want to

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I've made it sound shady

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
like everybody's going to go try to figure out who does

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Rob Roberts not work well with, actually I've been

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
pretty fortunate in the podcasting thing that everybody's

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
been pretty decent, so I can't

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yeah and I've

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
had my, again I've had

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
dealing with my bad eggs and you know

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
it's good, the important thing is that

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I can complain about that and this is why I don't really

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
ever talk about it, this way today was kind of the

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
exception and I'm happy I was able to

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
but once it happens

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I chalk it up to the experience

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
and I just simply ask myself who

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
am I not going to, what type of personality

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
am I not going to deal with going ahead

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
because they're not going to stop me

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
from going forward in what I've got to do

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I've got a game to make and I've got games to release

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and I've got people waiting to play my game

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and no one is going to remove

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
that dream of mine because I

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I'm the only one in control of that whether I decide

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
to stop it or not and I'm not

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
because as I said I did that for 20 years and that's

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
not happening again so and I've got

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
a community rooting me on

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
waiting for me to get this

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
done so, like you guys

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
so hell yeah

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Well that's one of the most raw interviews we've probably had here on Orange

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Lawn Radio but I, no I appreciate it

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I love it, you know

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I appreciate it more, man

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
If people want to get involved with making

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
games, you know, again, and we just want to

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
emphasize, you know, even though

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Gabe's talking about some dramatic experiences

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
that he's had, you're going to get that

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
with anything and you have to be prepared for it

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
but there's a lot of great rewards

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I've gotten great rewards from podcasting

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
you've gotten great rewards from

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
making games and the best is yet to come

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
when these things actually release, so keep

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
an eye out at Nascent Games on

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Twitter and

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
websites, nascentgames.net, right?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
nascentgames.net, that's our new website

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
you can actually see the most

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
up-to-date crumple gameplay trailer

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
first thing on the video there, there's a lot

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
more I'm going to be doing to that website

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I had to revamp it from the ground up

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
but it's nice for what it is

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
right now at the time, for the time being

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
our YouTube, we're

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
going to be posting more on that soon

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
youtube.com slash nascentgames

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
our Bandcamp where

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
again, we have a compilation album right now

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
to hear the different

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
music tracks that we're making for the couple

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
different games we're working on

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
nascentgames.bandcamp.com

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I also posted a new demo track

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
for our Kinship game

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
it's free, so be sure to, I just posted

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I think a week or so ago, so be sure

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
to have a listen to that, it's a demo

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
track, but it's a good track, so be

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
able to, be sure to catch that

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
and then

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
we're on Twitch, and we're actually going to

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
be doing an extra

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
livestream on this Tuesday

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
at the Cafe Colonial

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
we're going to be doing a livestream for Extra Life

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
on Bioshock

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
the Bioshock collection which comes out on Tuesday

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I'll be jamming out to Bioshock 1

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
because I love the hell out of that game

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
and so that's how

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
we're going to be repping the community a bit

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
this Tuesday, I don't know

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
if I'll be able to beat the whole game

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
oh I will, I definitely will

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I don't know if I'm going to be able to beat all of Part 1

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
in one sitting on Tuesday, I'm going to try

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
but yeah

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
twitch.com slash nassongames

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
and the Extra Life

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Brie if you have, thank you

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Brie if you find

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
if you get the link for the

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
yeah, because we're part of the

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Sac Indie Arcade team, because we have a

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
team on Extra Life for Sac Indie Arcade

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and I'm one of the people for that

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I don't know if she'll be able to pull that up

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
but if you're in the chat

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
be sure to keep an eye on that

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
but otherwise, yeah, so

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
those are all my links

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
two other quick questions and I've really got to move on with the show

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
because we're running a little long, but that's okay

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
so one, I'm

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
sitting here, I'm passionate about

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
games, I want to get involved with games

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
hearing this has made me realize

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I don't necessarily have to know code to get

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
involved with games, I need to meet

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
people at my local IGDA

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
how do I find them? So our meetup

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
group, meetup.com

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
slash game developer

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
it is as easy as that, is that good anywhere

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
in the world? Yeah, yeah, anywhere in the world

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
but yeah, meetup.com slash game developer

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
that's our chapters meetup

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
group, be sure to check us out there

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
there's other links for

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
our Facebook, our Instagram and so on and so forth

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
but definitely go there

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and yes, you

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
the two things I ask

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
for if you're going to come talk to us

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
you need to be in this for the

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
love of the development

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I don't need you walking up in my group saying

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I've got this great money making idea

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
because I've had a few people do that

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I've happily showed them the door

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
like don't come back because this is not why

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
we're doing this, we hope to make money

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
but that's not why I need you here

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
we're trying to create a job market right now

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and if that's how you're going to be

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I can't have that right now

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I'm laughing because again

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
the parallels to my own world are just

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
uncanny. Yeah, it's crazy

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
it's crazy stuff but I mean

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
and yes, the extra life link

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
oh man, I can't even follow that

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
so yeah, sorry, if you're in the chat

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
yeah, so extralife.org

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
or .org. Does that game developer

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
meet up, is that, like, if I

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
remember our audience is all over the world

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
let's say I've got somebody in New York City

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
we have a few listeners there that wants to join

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
the New York City IGDA of which I'm sure there's

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
one in every borough, how could they find

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
the IGDA in their area?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Yeah, so IGDA.org

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and there's a section for chapters

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and there's a ton

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
of chapters

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
go there, check it out

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
and even the, I haven't been there in a while

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
but the chapters list the actual

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
chapter head for each location

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
and yeah, you'll be able

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
to reach out to them. She posted a more

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
friendly link

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
to the Extra Life, so it's

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
www.extra-life.org

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
slash team

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
slash sacindiarcade

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yes, thank you. Brie's like our living

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
breathing Rolodex. And thank you Brie

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
because yeah, I know. Bring her with you next time

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
where is she? I know she's home

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Yeah, she's home right now, but you know

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
with her work schedule

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
too, she works so much earlier

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
but yeah, Brie

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I saw what you said, I know even though you're not here

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
but yes, thank you, you're still helping me out

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
but yeah, that's ultimately it

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
just come with the drive

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
and come with

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
a genuine attitude that you're

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
ready to make a difference

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
and show others what you know because we're

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
all about sharing knowledge

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
if you come with

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
that arrogant attitude, I'm gonna

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
wipe the floor with you and I'm gonna

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I will ruin your day

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I will be the original

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
ending in Mass Effect 3

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
and destroy many people's lives

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
you're gonna wish for an alternative

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Let's focus on the positive

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Yeah, and unlike

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
We're gonna make a game

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I'm gonna put you in a fucking

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
special thanks

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
definitely come through with a great

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
attitude, you know, even if you're shy

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I prefer shyness over nasty

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
arrogant crap, we don't have time

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
for all that, so yeah, so definitely

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
come through and check us out and I have to say

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
someone says something really really quick

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
then god, I don't want to take up too much

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
time on this one, someone says, oh, Dungeon

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Buster, he made the quote, we're here to make games

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
not massage egos, thank you

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
that's it, that's precisely it

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
that's precisely it

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
That's precisely it

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
You want to be part of a team

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Yeah, or even

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
feel that if you still want to be

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
a solo act in your

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
game development, that

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
you want to be

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
empowered, we talked about the feedback thing

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
earlier, you have to be prepared

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
for all this sort of thing, so we have to

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
be supportive and give each other that

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
constructive criticism, but

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
we're here to

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
empower each other, not push

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
each other aside, so absolutely

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Alright, one last thing before

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
we move on with the rest of our show

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Any teases for next year's indie arcade

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
event?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
So, we will

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
99%

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
sure be

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
back at the West Sac Community Center

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
there is that 1%

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
opportunity

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I can't say yet because

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
it's still early in discussion

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
My brain says you're going to outgrow that place by

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
next year

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Some people have said we've already outgrown the West Sac

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
place, and it's like, wait, it's only our first time

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
They could have used the second floor, there's still more

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
room on the second floor they could have grown into

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
so I don't think you've quite filled that space

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
entirely, but I am worried

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
for you guys that you're growing

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
which is good, that's great

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It's a great problem to have, and yeah

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
it's going to be interesting what happens for the next

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
one, we already have our keynote

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
speaker, she was

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
so you remember Michelle

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Michelle the last speaker

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
she was on the team

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
that made Evolve, right?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Evolve and making Mafia 3

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Michelle Smith from 2K Games

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
she's going to be our keynote

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
she was phenomenal, and she's a Sacramento

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
native, and there's no other

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
person I would ask to be our keynote for this upcoming

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
thing, so she's going to be our keynote

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
we're planning a number of other things

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I will tease

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I think I'm okay to say this

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
because it might happen

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
but we incorporated

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
the board game aspect

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
which had a great response for the board game

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
board game developers, we are planning

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
to incorporate pinball

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
for our next one

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
so stay tuned

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Okay, I like that tease, that's good

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
by the way, if we want to talk about panels

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
maybe we want to get involved this year

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I would love, it would be an honor to have you guys as a panel

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
please, be awesome

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
no pressure

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I was going to ask y'all anyway

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
we'll be there with bells on no matter what

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
yes sir

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
let's move on, we've got plenty of news

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
we've got to cover, but of course we have to talk about

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
our gaming weeks, I was in

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
DragonCon last week, which is why we didn't have a show

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I've got to talk a little bit about that

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
let's get into our gaming weeks, we'll try to

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
quickly move through this, but we'll see

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I wish I played a lot of stuff, but I didn't

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I did stick with my I'm not playing

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Tatami Katamari because it erased my progress

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
so I didn't, instead

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I played Non-Stop Night

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
which is yet another mobile game

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
thankfully though, this is not a clicker game

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
because there's nothing you really click, except

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
for, you know, special abilities

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
every now and then, it's more of a

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
clicker game without the clicking, if that makes sense

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
and it's much more simplified, and it actually is

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
kind of fun, because it is

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
very easy to cheat in, so that

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
that's what I've

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
it's honestly though, the cheating

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
at this point, I'm like so high

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
level that it doesn't affect anything

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
but it's kind of neat

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
there's a little bit of strategy to it

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
so there's kind of that

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
but it's a good time waster

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
so I'm playing that, I played a

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
little bit of Ingress, not much

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Pokemon Go, and

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
more stories later, but

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I may not be playing much Pokemon Go

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
because I'm not too happy with Niantic right now

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Alright

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Hey Gabe, do you play

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
games besides just making them, what have you been playing?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Yeah, I've been

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I've been

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I've been dabbling more

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
again, and I seem to talk about

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
this every time I'm on this show

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
my Earth Defense 4 is 4.1 because they

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
just announced

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
unofficially part 5 is coming

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
out, which I expected to be a thing

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
and that's great, so I've been rocking

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
that on my PS4, I've

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
been playing Horizon 2

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Forza Horizon 2 again because

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
the Horizon 3 demo came out

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
today, so

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yes, the demo came out, and the only reason

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I know what you're going to be doing, Lee

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I thought it was still in that soon area

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Well, here's the thing, the only reason I knew is because

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Microsoft sent me a code for the

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Halo vehicle, the Warthog

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
They sent me a code that you could drive the Warthog

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
in Forza Horizon 3

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
It's insanity, so when I

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
redeemed the code, it took me to the page

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
that said, okay, you'll be able to use this here and here

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
but in the description

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
it said, this vehicle

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
will be applicable for

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Forza Horizon 3

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
and all these different versions that they mentioned

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and it said the different editions, and then at the bottom

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
it said a demo, I said, bullshit

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
what demo, so I clicked

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
further, and it said demo coming out

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
September 11th, I heard when it was coming

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
and I realized it was today, nice

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Yeah, this evening, so I've been playing

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
that, and then

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I've actually been, funny enough

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I started playing

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
again, DuckTales Remastered

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I was playing that again because I got stuck on the

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
very very last level, I just decided to start over

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and then I've been playing Chrono Trigger

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
on my Super Nintendo

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
and

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
it's probably one of the best decisions

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I've ever made, because God help me

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
that game, whoo, yeah

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
so that's what I've been rocking out

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Look at you, going from new stuff to old school

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
love it, my gaming week

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
speaking of new stuff, okay, so I spent

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
the weekend at Dragon Con, which is why I wasn't here

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
which, by the way, I just want to give a quick shout out

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
to Dragon Con and the people that I met

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
there, had a great time on the podcasting

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
track, we did end up doing a panel

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
after all, on Sunday

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
about social media

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
and had a really good time, and

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
yeah, it was just, we have

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
presented the Parsec Awards, which was

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
great, because yet again, they gave

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
us the spot right at the very end

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
next to last

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
so it's really something to be on

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
the stage right before Richard

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Garriott, aka Lord British

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
who like, made Ultima, which is a

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
series, you know, that I grew up with, it's just

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
an honor to be in his presence and so forth

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and you know, all the great talent

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
that goes with podcasting and all that

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
so just, you know, my hat's off to

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
everything involved there

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
and Dragon Con this year, you know

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
that is not usually an event that's

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
big on gaming, you know, Dragon

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Con has always been big on other types of

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
fandom, be it sci-fi

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Dungeons and Dragons

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
board gaming

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
you know, but I was always told

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
ever since the first year I went, don't expect a

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
big video gaming presence, but I gotta say

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
this year, they started to step it up

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
quite a bit, and I think this is because of a partnership

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
they have with MomoCon, which also happens

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
in Atlanta

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
there's some type of strategic partnership thing going on there

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
so this year, they had Tokyo Attack

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
there, who actually had a 24-7

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
arcade running of

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Japanese import video games

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
so I was playing Papa Music

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
over and over and over again, it was fun

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
they had Ubeat

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
like six machines, I finally got to play

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
a re-rave machine for the first time

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
so if Kyle's still out there somewhere, I finally

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
finally played a re-rave machine

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
for the first time, so yeah, that was just

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
that was an awesome addition to Dragon Con

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
did you meet dragons though?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
there were definitely cosplays of dragons

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
they call Dragon Con

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
the Super Bowl of cosplay, and for good reason

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
there was some really just elaborate

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
stuff that happens there

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
so yeah, I

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
had a great time, there was also a classic gaming

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
arcade that was set up in the dealer hall

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
that wasn't 24 hour, but it was still nice to see

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I got to play a

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Mortal Kombat 2 machine, which I have in a

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
long time, and I still

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
remember how to chop somebody's head off with

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Katana, and that felt really good

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
that's awesome, where you can remember and not have to

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
pull it up on your game FAQs, hell yeah

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I actually got to beat some rando

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
guy, we were playing

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Mortal Kombat, I think he was Johnny Cage

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
and I was Katana, and I remembered

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
block block block block block, high kick, and

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
bye bye, chopped off the head

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I still remember that for scorpion, so kudos

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
to you man, that was great

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
alright, and let's see

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
JD in chat says, what do you think of the

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
what did you think of the re-raves guy, they have one at

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Sunnyvale Golf Land by the way

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I mean, if you've played the iPhone game

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
which, if you're a fan of music games, you

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
really ought to have by now, if you haven't

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
friendly reminder to try it, because

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
yeah, it's a great little

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
touch game, and you know, it just felt like

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
that, but on a much larger

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
touch screen, because this thing is huge

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
it's the size of a large television

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
but it's a touch pad, and so for that

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
it makes it almost harder for your eyes

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
to get a sense of what all is on

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
the play field at once, but

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I'd like

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
to touch the big button, I like to

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
touch the big screen and touch it, it's fun

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
so yeah, I enjoyed it

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
let's see,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
okay, so also at DragonCon, so Bobby

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
you know, he does a lot with

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
VR and AR and all that development

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
so our pal Bobby Blackwolf was there

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
and we had for the first time this year

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
what we were calling the VoG Suite

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
because we actually had a suite at one

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
of the host hotels, and so Bobby brought

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
his toys

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
and we all got to try them

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
so for the first time ever I got to

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
try the Vive, the HTC Vive

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
and I got to see some demos and that

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
that was cool, I mean

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I was a fan of VR since I checked out

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Oculus Rift for the first time, so it was just cool to see

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
some of the stuff in that, I watched other

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
people play Job Simulator, which was

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
cracking me up, we were laughing

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
until three in the morning playing Job Simulator

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
and I really like the

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Angry Birds type thing they had, but it was

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
all Portal characters, which I think is a game

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
called The Lab that has, it's like

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Valve's, you know, kind of

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
VR playground game, a la

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Wii Sports sort of thing, so

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
that was cool to see, but I was really all about

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
because I got to try for the first time HoloLens

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
because he actually has a HoloLens dev kit

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
so for the first time I got to try HoloLens

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
and the game

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
that he had me play on HoloLens was called

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Fragments and

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
it's pretty fucking cool, like

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I'm smiling because one of our developers

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
actually has lent me

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
the HoloLens because he

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
got it, he got it as part of the pre-order

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
That's not a cheap blend by the way, I was told

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
how much those things cost and yes

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Your life

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
It cost you your life

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Well here's the thing, so the

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
HoloLens, you configure it

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
and it actually scans the room, so it knows

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
where couches are, it knows where tables are

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
it knows where things are, so this game

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Fragments is like a crime scene

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
type game, so it's like a frozen moment

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
in time of a crime scene of a

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
kidnapping basically, I'm not going to spoil too much

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
but it's like a kidnapping basically, and so

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
you look, what you're trying to do is determine

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
where are they, because you can

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
see the kid and the

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
kidnapper and you're trying to determine where do you send

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
the cops, so you're investigating

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
things in the room and suddenly you might look at the

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
wall and oh there's a brick sticking out of the wall

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
so you actually pick up the brick

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
and turn it around and you might see that

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
it's N-O something

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
so it's New Orleans is where you're

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
supposed to go, type of thing is N-O

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
or you might find that

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
lying on the couch is a ticket

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
for the ferry or something

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
so you actually kind of have to look around the room

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
looking for things, and you even look up at the

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
ceiling and you can see that it's raining

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
so you know that the scene is happening somewhere

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
in the US right now

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
or it's raining, so there's little clues

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
like that that you have to put together, so I thought that that was

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
really cool, that was like playing like a

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
90's adventure game, but instead

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
of clicking on things that are

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
in the scene, you're looking around you

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
at the scene and actually touching

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
them and interacting with them, and I just thought that was

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
such a neat, that was

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
such a cool use, and then when you're actually watching

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
the cutscenes, here's the crazy shit, so

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
since it scanned the room already

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
you'll be watching like the chief and her

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
two assistants or whatever, they're all talking and having

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
conversation, one of them will be sitting on your

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
couch and then suddenly stand up

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
as part of the scene and stuff, it's like, okay

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
so like it knew that you had a couch

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
because it put this character on the couch and

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
so I just thought that was so rad, how like it

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
actually used the room

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
so I would, now here's

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
the thing, the one drawback to Hololens is that

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
the field of vision

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
very very small, it's like

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
sitting right in front of a big screen TV

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
type of thing, and

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
so you, you know, it's very

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
obvious where the

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
holographic stuff begins and where it ends

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
so I don't think it's ready for primetime

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
so to speak? Oh definitely not,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
the plan with the Hololens was gonna be

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
that, and this is

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
why they released it now, and

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
the release is not because

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
the idea is that for the next

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
probably three years, three or

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
so years, we're gonna be, we're supposed to

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
us as developers are supposed to get completely

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
comfortable with the Hololens, and the

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
goal right now from what I've learned again,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
this will obviously change

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
it's to be earlier or later, but

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
2019 is supposed to be

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
the year that the first actual

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
full on

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
games for the commercial

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
or consumer version

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
of the Hololens is supposed to be for 2019

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
at some point, so

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I'm not totally, you know, the experience

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I played was neat, I don't know

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
what other types of games are gonna be

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
doable on this, I mean it's

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I already have one I'm gonna make for it, so yeah

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
it's, you have to think about

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
games differently, I think in order to

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
make for the Hololens, and you know, Bobby's

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
had this conversation about, well he sees it more as

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
something that's gonna benefit

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
in non-gaming types of areas

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
just like Kinect kinda had

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
some of its biggest successes

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
in hospitals and things like that, you know, things that had

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
nothing to do with games, and Hololens may end up

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
being very similar, and that may be true

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
but I think there's going to be some great gaming

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
experiences in this thing, and I think you're right, by them

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
getting it out so early at least, people

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
can really think about, you know, have plenty of time to

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
consider what's that game gonna look like, but I gotta say

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I kinda, like

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
everything I had heard about Hololens

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
was pretty tepid, because I think

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
they were showing things, like here's the Halo experience

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
and everybody's too focused on, well you

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
can't see, I mean the field of vision sucks

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
da da da da, but this concept

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
for this game that I saw was like

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
okay, this shows me

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
something that you can't, you can't

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
even do this in VR

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Right, no you can't, right, absolutely

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
and definitely sells the difference between

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
here's the difference between holographic gaming

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
and virtual reality, so I thought that was just,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I thought it was neat. Absolutely, and I saw the

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I see the Hololens as a great, just like

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
VR, I see the Hololens as a great

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
supplemental piece for

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
game development and gaming, not

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
so much primary, which I think

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
that's what a lot of people are

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
quick, so quickly impulsively jumping

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
to, it's like, oh this is going to be the next great gaming

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
experience, I know, I think it's going to be a good supplemental

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
gaming experience, as an

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
as an add-on, but it, you know

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Virtual Boy tried, and we

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
already saw what happened with that, so just don't

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
just don't do that. We've come a long way since then.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
We've come a long way since then, yeah.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Quickly, I want to talk about some other games I've played this week

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Overwatch is having a free weekend on

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
PlayStation 4, so I finally got to play

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
with some of my pals, like Exeter and Flaco Jones

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
on PlayStation

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Xbox also. It is so, yeah, it is

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
on Xbox One, it is so fucking

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
hard to play on a controller when you've been playing on keyboard

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
and mouse for so long, like

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
it's just, it feels weird, especially

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
playing something like Pharah, where I'm used to using

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
the right mouse button to levitate, like

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
now in this, it's like, okay, I have to use L1

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
to fly up, and then L2 to

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
levitate, it's just, it took me a long time

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
to get used to, and my aim still feels

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
ridiculous, but, you know

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
playing with friends has been

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
fun. Am I going to double dip the $50

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
to buy it again? No, I'm sorry to my

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
friends on console, which is, I can't justify that.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And I think it's just, it's a little ridiculous

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
that Blizzard knows it's me.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
No, because I tied my battle

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
tag to it a long time ago with

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Diablo or something, which I

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
guess I did kind of double dip on, but in my

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
defense, the PC version had been free with

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
World of Warcraft, so.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
So, but I'm not going to double dip on

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Overwatch. If they knock the price down to 20 bucks,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
maybe, but it's Blizzard, that's not going to happen

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
for a good long time.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
But it was still fun to check out.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Speaking of World of Warcraft, I've been playing Legion

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
now that I'm back from Dragon Con.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Hey, the new expansion, pretty darn

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
good, I gotta say. And it

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
brought back, I think, 3

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
million new people

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
because of that expansion. You know,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
it's very interesting how they've really

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
taken out a lot of the, you go

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
to this zone to do these levels,

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
and you go to this zone to do these levels,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and they've kind of taken more of an approach of, nah,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
everything scales. Everything scales

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
until you get to 110, so you do things

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
in the order that you want to do for the story.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And that alone is really,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I don't know, it's just really changed a lot of the feel

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
of the game, and it kind of gets you more into the quests

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
and, you know, the dungeons

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
really feel now more like an end piece

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
to a storyline in a zone.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
It's just, it's very, very interesting the way they've

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
done it. I'm into it. But isn't that,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
and maybe this is a dumb question,

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I apologize if this almost sounds ignorant,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
but isn't that the point? Isn't that,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
wasn't that what they should, what is, I don't,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
again, I don't know what, how it was initially,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
because I haven't touched, I've played,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I've played two hours of

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
WoW at the start, and that was, I couldn't do it anymore.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
No, because you would kind of feel

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
this pressure to just, you know,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
you know, fuck how you get there, you just need to

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
get to the max level as fast as you can.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
So once you're ready to go to a new zone, you just

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
kind of stop where you're at and you go to that next zone.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
That's been a lot of how you've

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
been playing MMOs in general

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
till today. This one kind of

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
stops, says, you know what, there's

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
no, you just do whatever you want

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
and everything's going to scale. And so

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
it's really kind of changed the game in that regard.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Interesting, that's nice. So I just, if you haven't played

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
WoW in a little while, Legion's kind of worth

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
checking out. I gotta say, I've been enjoying

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
it. I've enjoyed it more than Draenor

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
for sure.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Pandaria, I think

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
it's probably a better expansion than Pandaria,

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
probably a better expansion than Cataclysm.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
It's a little early to say for sure, because I need to play

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
more of it and see what the end game looks like, and more importantly

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
what the support looks like.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
But I'm very encouraged,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I'm very encouraged that they're already talking about

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
7.1. That's very

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
encouraging, that Blizzard may be remedying

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
what was their weakest point.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Still trying to play Final Fantasy 14

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
though, even with WoW, because Final Fantasy

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
14 had an anniversary event going on

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
and I had to check that out.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
So, I'm a little MMO'd

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
out almost, but never, never.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Okay, one more thing I gotta talk about.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Luminous is out

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
on iPhone.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
So, do you remember last week, or two weeks

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
ago we talked about Luminous and we were like, oh it's

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
new portrait mode, and we're like, no, that can't,

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
that's not the orientation. No, it is.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Portrait mode is the new orientation. You now play vertically

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
with Luminous, which was

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
kind of weird to see at first.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
It works, but

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
oh, and Luminous on mobile phones

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
has Shinen. They've got the

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
classic pack that has all the old school

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
songs, very, very cool.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Here's the biggest problem with Luminous,

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
it's on a touch phone. That's the

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
biggest problem with Luminous, because again,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
the direction,

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
the left-right movements and down

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
to move the piece down a touch, it's just not

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
responsive enough. And I need to remind

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
myself, any time that I think

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
a console experience is gonna make for

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
a good iPhone experience, it's

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
not. If it's just gonna be a port

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
or vice versa, which

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
y'all are gonna try to get me

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
in a few minutes here when we talk about one of the big stories

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
of the week from me just saying that, but

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
there's a big difference between porting

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
something that was originally on consoles

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and designing something with

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
the mobile space in mind.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
So, that

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
being said, I still think if you're a

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
fan of Luminous, it's what, three bucks?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It's worth checking out. It's far better than the one

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
they put out years ago

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
when I think the 4 was the iPhone that was

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
going around. It's far better and more responsive

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
than that, but from a

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
precision standpoint, I just think

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
if you're good at Luminous and you need the

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
precision that comes with being good, you're gonna get

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
really fucking frustrated that

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
it's touch controls. But

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Shinen, that song

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
rocks!

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
That's a good call. That's a good call on that.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
So yeah, good look on that.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So there you go. That was my gaming

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
week. Some quick announcements,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
then we gotta get into the news. I gotta plug

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
GamerX4. We're gonna be there. We're gonna be at

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
GamerX4 at a table

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
in like three weeks. I can't believe

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
it's coming up that soon, but VOG Network will be

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
there at a table. Myself, Dark

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Sakura, Shane now telling me he might go,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
so that's pretty cool. And

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
a panel

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Sunday, 2 o'clock,

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
the Indie Gamer Super Show with

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
myself, Dark Sakura, Captain Spike from

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Gameboi.org, and whoever

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
else we pull onto our thing at the last minute.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Oh, congrats, man. That's gonna be

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
fun. Wonderful. I'm very excited.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Are you going? Because I know IGDA has a presence

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
this year. I've

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
heard bits and pieces

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
a bit about it, but I don't know. I tried

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
to myself get a table for NASA games, but

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
budget-wise, it was out of my budget at the time.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
So I mean, I don't know

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
too much about that. I know there's been

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
a little more talk about the MagWest thing,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
because apparently MagWest is doing, they're

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
having a gathering

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
later this month in San Jose. I think

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
they're doing the arcade

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
portion of whatever's going on at GamerX

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
too, so I think the early scenes. Oh, that makes sense.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Yeah. Which, by the way, I

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
don't know, since I haven't seen you in a little while,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I already have my hotel and tickets for

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
MagFest 2017, just so you know.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Nice. I'm gonna be there. I don't know if you're going back, but

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I'm hoping they'll go back. I've reconnected with them

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
recently, so we're hoping.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Good. Good. Sounds good.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Alright, and then

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
the DragonCon Super Show. So we did

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
have a new show on VoG last

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
week. We actually taped in the VoG

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
suite. We did a special show

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
with hosts from this show,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Bobby Blackwolf, Pod Culture,

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
British Invaders, Critical Myth.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I'm leaving somebody out, and I'm gonna

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
hate myself for it later, but people came

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
together from all those shows, and

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
we did this Super Show

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
that's gonna be available.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Here's the thing, since it wasn't really something to

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
it's not gonna be on the podcast feed, it's gonna be on

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
YouTube. So Bobby's putting

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
that all together right now, putting on the B-roll

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
in. I don't know when, but it will be

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
on YouTube for you guys.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Yeah, I know, we're trying to get our

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
trying to warm up to that a little more. Do it!

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I've been only pushing you since the day I met

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
you. I thought I said British

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Invaders. Did I not say British Invaders? You said British Invaders.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I thought I did. That's what Brad from

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Pod Culture said. So anyway, hopefully I didn't

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
leave anybody out, but yeah, we

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
did a fun little show there.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And that's probably a tradition we'll

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
continue next year. We'll see.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Okay, we gotta get to some gamer news. We're only

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
what, an hour and a half into the show? Let's get to some news.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Loki. So

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Apple had their conference where they

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
talked about the new phone

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
and everything, but one of the announcements that they had

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
which was kind of odd was

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Nintendo was there. It was like,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
what the fuck? Why is Nintendo here?

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And so they had some game announcements. The first

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
one is Super Mario Run,

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
which is going to be coming to iOS first.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
It's a mobile game of Endless Runner,

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
if you will, where you're Mario

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
and you jump on platforms

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
and... Or you could just play

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii U

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
and have a better experience.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Anyway, I'm done. I don't know.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I'm not so

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
ready to write it off because one of

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Nintendo's biggest strengths, always has been,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
always will be, is level design.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And so even though we're calling this

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
an Endless Runner, it's

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
not really endless because it looks like there's

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
definitely these setup stages and so forth

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
and it just looks like the way things are set up

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
there's going to be a definite, you know,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
there's the obvious path and then there'll be

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
the path that includes all the red coins

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
and all that other fun stuff. And so I just

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
feel like there'll probably be more depth to this

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
than your typical quote-unquote

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Endless Runner. So I'm curious,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I want to know what the price is going to be.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
That's the big thing for me. Is this going to

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
be a $3 game? If so, fuck

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
yeah. It's going to have in-app purchases

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
though. Or is, no it's not. They've, they've

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
come, well, they wrote that off. It's a

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
free demo and the in-app purchase

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
is the game. That's it.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Yeah, they wrote off the in-app purchase

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
thing. They say we're not going to do that.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
That's what the description said. Yeah, no, the description

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
says that because the game will be the one

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
level demo and then the in-app purchase is the rest

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
of it. Which a lot of other games do.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Yeah. But here's, you know, could it be

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
a $20 game? Because honest,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
honestly, Nintendo could get away

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
with it. No. Square Enix

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
does. Yeah, and that's funny. You said

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
that I was going to actually, I was going to say they pulled it off

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
they did it with Final Fantasy. Yeah.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And everybody loves Square Enix for that. Be prepared.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I think they're going to charge $19.99

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
for it. I think they will. I think they're

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
going to be that bold. My hope is $9.99

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
but I fear you might be right

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
but I hope $9.99.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Yeah. Well that's good. They can charge rid of the

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
fuck they want for it. I'll still buy it. I will.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Part of the problem.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I will. I don't, I just, I know

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
it's going to be solid. Part of the problem, man. I know.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I know. However,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
other things that were kind of in little footnotes

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
there, they're going to have a Fire Emblem game

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
and Animal Crossing.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Animal Crossing.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Well that's going to do

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
pretty well. Well

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
actually those games though, even though they

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
talked about those games, those games are supposed

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
to be out I believe by this holiday.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Yeah. And they just, they suddenly

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
put in there that Fire Emblem and

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Animal Crossing are now going to be coming out before

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
the end of March 2017.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
So those games quietly

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
getting delayed in favor of Super Mario.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Will mobile games be for the NX?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Could be. Well, who knows?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I think there's going to be, I made

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I made a, I don't like, I hate

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
speculation but I had to have a little fun

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
with it anyway. I think there's going to be

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I think whatever the NX

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
is going to be is going to have a straight up

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
tie into why they're

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
releasing the games on the iPhone.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I think they're going to try to pull almost

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
and please forgive

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
me for those who, please forgive

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
me guys, but I almost smell

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
the same approach that Ouya did

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
where the next console

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
is going to be, yeah you can play it on our console

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
you know, but you'll also be able to download it here

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
and play it here and there will be some maybe crossplay

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
or something like that. Yeah, it kind of vomited in my mouth

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
a little bit when you said that. That's why I

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
apologize in advance but I'm just saying because

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
like just these announcements are really

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
really weird. I gotta say, the

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Mario thing, it did throw me

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
for a loop a little bit. I wasn't

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
yep, props to Apple, props to Nintendo.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I wasn't expecting that. Sorry Black Wolf

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I see you're here. It was courageous of them

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
to put it on the platform.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Yeah it was, yeah.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Well just so you know though, they

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
did say it's coming to Android as well.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
So you're not going to get left in the cold if you're on

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Android. Thank God. It's just

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
iPhone first or something like that, right?

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Who cares? But then

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
that raises the question about what happens

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
with the next DS.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
That's what I want to know. That's why this

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
surprised me because I was like well wait, hold

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
hold up, hold up. If

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
the NX is going to be

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
portable then why

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
is suddenly Nintendo going

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
third party on another platform

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
and all of a sudden all this

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
endless ocean of wank

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
that we have on Twitter about

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Nintendo should put Super Mario

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
on the PlayStation 4. It's like

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
shut up, that's never going to happen but it's like

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
it kind of just fucking did this week. If you

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
ever write a book you need to call it that.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
My endless ocean of wank.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I thought that's what I tell the boys

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
on Grindr.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
But we already had a similar title for that. Remember

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
it was like pissing in

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
an ocean of piss or something like that.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
That's right.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
That'll be the OLR documentary

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
or the Behind the

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Music on the Making of Kinship.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Anyway, no. If they

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
ever did a documentary on the making of kinship you know

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
it's going to be called Special Thanks.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Word up.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
You heard that fools.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Now here's the thing.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
They made it very clear

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
it's not a traditional

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Mario game because Mario is

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
obviously doing the endless running thing. You don't have to do

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
the left and right controls.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Having played Luminous let me tell you

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
it's not going to fucking work and I'm glad

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
they don't have Mario going left and right

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
and all that. This is how you make it work.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
You have one

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
button. This game is played with one

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
button. Touch. Touch.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Touch. Touch. That's how the game

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
works. That's it. So if you want

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
a more in-depth Mario experience you're

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
going to have to go to the NX.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
But at the same time

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
hasn't Nintendo told us that 2D Mario

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
is kind of like Mario Maker was

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
kind of the swong song for 2D Mario.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Here comes your encore during the week

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
we were off.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
They're doing new Super Mario Brothers games

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
which are basically 2D Mario games.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
They look dumb.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
They're not 2D.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Seriously.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Fucking get the Rayman team on

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
a 2D Mario game or any

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Zelda title.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Hand drawn, hand painted

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Mario game.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I'm sorry. They did that already.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
They had Wario Land shake.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Which was fantastic

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
looking. Just no one played it.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I put up a tweet

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
a couple days ago about

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I know we'll talk later about this

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
with Interplay and them selling their

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
assets. And all I said

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
was Earthworm Jim

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Ubisoft Rayman Origins

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Legends team. That's what I need

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
to see. So yeah. That's what I want to see.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
But I hope you're wrong

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
though. I hope the Mario

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Maker is not the swong song

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
because I really would love to see

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
you know

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
those type of graphics

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
again. But yeah.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Let me go to some chat comments

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
over at live.vognetwork.com

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Ranma in our chat says iPhone users

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
can lose their shit over Super Mario Run

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
but us Android users still have our

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
headphone jacks. Oh yes.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Here's the thing you Android users

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
get with your Note 7s. When you beat

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Super Mario Run and the fireworks go off

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
at the end of the stage, your phone also

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
blows up. That's what you get

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
as a Note 7 user.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Well that's alright you know because at least we don't have

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
one of those iPhones that you can bend in half

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
like a cracker.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I thought

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
that joke is so 2014. Come on.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
We're past the bendable

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
iPhone. Like those stupid

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
3.5mm

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
phone jacks or audio jacks.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Here's my thing. I'm actually

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
I have upgraded iPhone every time I'm

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
eligible. I'm not going to get an iPhone 7. It actually has

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
nothing to do with the headphone jack thing. It's just

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
okay. It's a new camera.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Yeah.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Yeah. My 6

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
My 6 is good enough for now.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
It takes a better picture.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
It takes a better selfie.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
JD in chat says hey maybe they should port

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Rhythm Tengoku Gold to touchscreen smartphones.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I'd be down with that. That would be a good franchise.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
You know we know that Nintendo

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
was working on several. Well now we know

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Mario was one of them apparently.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
For whatever reason they've bumped this to the front of the line.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I'm not sure

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
maybe this has to do with Pokemon

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
and the fact that their stock went way up with Pokemon.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Namco. I could use some

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Taiko no Tatujin.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
All right.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Let's move on.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Loki what do you have next? Speaking of Pokemon

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Go right? Yes.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Pokemon Go is getting an update.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
They're updating finally to

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
0.37

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
or something. And what it's going to add is

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
the ability for players to turn

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
one of their Pokemon into a buddy. So you can basically

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
when you're walking or driving

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
or whatever they

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
earn candy for

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
the distance that you walk. Also apparently there's

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
a nice little easter egg where if you walk with

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Pikachu for 10 kilometers he hops

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
on your shoulder. So that's kind of neat.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
The update will

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
also I guess make it

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
easier to

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
choose smaller Pokemon on the map.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Also prevent eggs hatching

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
without animations

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
or something like that. And I want

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
to say that there was something that was supposed to make

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
leveling up easier. Oh

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
and fuck you for if you have a jailbroken

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
or rooted phone like my son

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
does because their fucking app

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
is not supported on that phone

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
despite the fact that it runs just

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
perfectly fine so I had to fucking root it

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
to get it on there. Oh but fuck him

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
because he must be a cheater because that's what they're assuming

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
because they're Niantic and don't want to fucking

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
fix their problems. Instead they're just going to blame

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
everybody that has a rooted phone for fucking

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
cheating. There's already a

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
workaround for it but it's a pain in the fucking

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
ass. And why should I have to

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
you know

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
spend all this effort to play your fucking

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
game that I paid money

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
for as well to

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
you know purchase items because I thought I would kick

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
you some money before making this game.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
But then here's how you fucking repay

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
me by fucking me over.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Well what would you expect from a

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
studio that can't even

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
call its version version one?

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
It has to be 0.3 point

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
I mean what is this? I mean what

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
happened here? Because the game's not fucking

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
finished. It won't ever be done.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
It's going to be another No Man's Sky.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
So I mean it's like seriously.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
That's unfortunate.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
But you know what? You know what's good though?

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I'm so glad that they focused

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
their shit on instead of fixing

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
the problems. They've got Pokemon

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Go coming out for the new fucking

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
iWatch or

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Apple thing. And oh it looks so

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
fucking fantastic on that tiny little fucking

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
screen. I'm so glad that they

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
could focus their fucking efforts on that.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
But fuck all you guys. I guess fuck you

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
if you have your own stupid rooted phone.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
You better fucking buy an iWatch because at least

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
that shit will work. Hey you want to know something fucking

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
funny? You're releasing this stupid

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Pokemon Go Plus in what literally

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
days now that I'm going to fucking

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
hack the shit out of and there's not

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
a fucking thing you can do about it.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
But you know go ahead and punish everybody

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
that has a fucking rooted phone because

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
they're the fucking hackers. I don't have a

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
rooted phone and I'm going to hack the shit out of your shit.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
The following comments are not necessarily

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
of OLR and its affiliates.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Okay so here's the thing.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
They actually counted how many fucks were in that

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
segment in our chat room. 15.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
That's not enough.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
So okay I will say this.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
As cute as the Watch thing

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
looks and if I were into the Apple Watch

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I'd probably be into the

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
if Jamie were here she'd be raging so hard right now.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
But if I were into

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
the Apple Watch thing I'd probably be into

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
the Pokemon Go thing because it did look cute

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
you know for what the Watch does. That's awesome.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I can take both hands off the steering wheel when I play in the car.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Okay that's funny.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Okay but

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
it does seem a little bit reductive

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
to the

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
physical Pokemon Go

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
thing that Nintendo's trying to make money

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
off of that's coming out next week.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Like I don't fucking need that now

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
if I have an Apple Watch it sure seems like.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Well no you still do because you play the Apple Watch

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
one just like you do the actual game.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
So you actually I think you throw balls and stuff like that.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
No you still hatch eggs and all that stuff.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Yeah you still do all that.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Here's the thing is like I mean seriously like

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
like I've heard

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
rumors that one of the other reasons that they may have

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
you know blocked it for rooted people is

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
because they're going to like somehow abuse

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
the device. I'm like dude you don't even need a

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
rooted device. Hello look at

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
okay the way this device works is

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
it indicates any time that you have to

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
push the button. It flashes a light or

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
rumbles. There's electricity going

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
to that light there's electricity going to that rumble

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
motor. You fucking just

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
solder a goddamn wire from

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
that to the switch. Bada bing

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
eight fucking auto hacks your stupid

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
fucking pokey stops and auto catches

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
fucking Pokemon by one

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
fucking wire. He just went

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
sopranos on us. I'm with

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
William Murderface in our chat. Loki dropped out of

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
rant space. Someone vent the rant core

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
breach.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Good lord.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
It's fucking disappointing.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Now I gotta explain to my son who fucking

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
loves playing Pokemon Go. I'm sorry

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Niantic fucking hates you because you're a cheater

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
so you can't play anymore. You're not worthy

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
son. I mean

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
seriously he is fucking in the

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Pokemon like crazy now because of Pokemon

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Go and now sorry

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
fuck you. You don't get the play because

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
you're a fucking cheater. Thank you.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
He's almost at 20. JD with the obvious question

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
in chat that I have to ask as well

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
live.vognorant.com just don't update the app

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
on his phone. Oh

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I'm glad you thought of that except

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Niantic also fucking thinks about that because

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
see I have this other app called Ingress

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
and if you don't fucking update it it doesn't

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
fucking work.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
So that's what's gonna fucking happen is because

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
they'll check your version of it and I'm sorry

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
you need to update your fucking app to play this.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
26

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
This is great.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Wow. And the most important

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
about what he just said

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
for those new to counting

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
numbers you've

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
just received a great lesson

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
on how to count. I'll put it in the review

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
of the app.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Oh my god.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Alright. Let's talk about something that

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
God I just wish he'd won

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
the goddamn techno motion machine.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
It would have been half

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
the fucks. You'd be like I don't give

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
a fuck about it. I don't give a fuck but life

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
is great. I got a machine.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Alright. Let's talk about

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Interplay. Gabe mentioned this earlier.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
They are going to be selling their games

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
and intellectual property so

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
if you want to buy an intellectual

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
property such as Earthworm Jim

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
or MDK or Clay Fighter

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
fuck yeah. Oh my god.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Clay Fighter was awesome. Or Descent

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
or Battle Chess

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
get to it. You can

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
actually do that.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Let's see. Wedbush

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Securities is going to be assisting Interplay with

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
the sales of the IP so I'm

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
very curious to see what happens in a couple months with

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
who buys what.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
See it's moments like this

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
that I as a startup indie studio

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
wish I could afford to get something

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
like that because I know

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
that would be so beneficial for

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
my team. Especially for some of my team where

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
they're kind of the younger generation so they

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
don't know. They aren't familiar

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
with those older games back in the

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
early mid 90s

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
and so on and so forth. It'd be great to be like you have

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
no idea. Earthworm Jim

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
no idea. Clay Fighter

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I need you to write me a theme

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
song like the Clay Fighter song

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
which actually if you remember on the

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Super Nintendo I think had the vocal

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Yeah it did.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
It's like

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
everybody remembers that because like

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
when did the fucking new Super Nintendo talk

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
to you during Super Metroid and

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
during Clay Fighter. Well NBA Jam.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Ok one or two other times too.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Right.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Very true. Very true.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
To register participation for this week's episode

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
use the passphrase

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
wolf. Anyhow, Loki what do you have

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
next for us. Alright

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
so the next thing I have we're going to talk a little

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
bit about is

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Mario games

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
and Miyamoto basically saying

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
hey you know what

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Mario's just not going to really work

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
out for VR. Damn right. It's not

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
going to be a good fit and I kind of I could see

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
that because I mean think

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
about it. It's platforming. It's lots of

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
movement. That's going to make people sick.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Basically saying you know I agree

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
that adapting Mario to new platforms is key

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
to keeping him relevant but we want families

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
to play together and virtual reality

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
which requires players to be closed off

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
from the real world doesn't really

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
fit in there. We also like people

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
playing for a long time and it's hard to do

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
that with VR. You don't need

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
VR to be closed off from the real world.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
That's been happening since

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
the Atari days. That's an interesting statement.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I don't know if that's a good reason why not to do

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
it because if you think about it they can still

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
do like you know

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
like Sony's doing where they have you know

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
the multi-screenplay thing where it's

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
almost just like the Wii U where you add one person

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
on a gamepad. Everybody else is on the

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
TV. You know you could do that with VR.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Don't put Mario on VR. Yeah I was going to say but they're still

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
stationary and there

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
isn't the restriction other than

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
if you really want to vomit

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
fast you put Sonic in VR.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Like here's the thing.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
That's just punishment. Holy shit. And this

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
goes back to what I was saying about you know

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
fragments and the AR space and

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
everything is that you know it's going to change the way

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
the game developers think about

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
games. It's like telling

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
a painter that now instead of

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
oil paints they have to paint with watercolor.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
It's a whole new canvas so that doesn't mean

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
the same old ideas are going to necessarily work. I don't really

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
take a lot of this you know what he

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
says right now for

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I don't know like how much of it

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
is just kind of a thing that he's saying right now because

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
if you think about it like if VR

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
becomes like the Del facto thing

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
of course they're going to put fucking Mario in VR.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
I mean just like how they probably were saying oh

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
well we're not developing

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
mobile games because our games are too fucking awesome

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
for that and here they are developing a mobile

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
game so

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I don't know. Did you say

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Rob did you did I

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
maybe I was just

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
high but did you just say Mario

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Paint by any chance?

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
No but I was comparing this to

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
painting so I can see why somebody would actually

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
come at the conclusion of Mario Paint. So okay

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
cool. So I wasn't entirely losing my mind

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
because I just had this wild thought like God

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Mario Paint in VR which

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
that would be that would be freaking

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
awesome. By the way

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
perfect iOS Android

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
opportunity for Nintendo

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
just bring

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
back Mario Paint

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
and that most of all most

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
importantly that music generator thing they had

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
in Mario Paint. Oh my goodness yes.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
And use the magic of the interwebs that

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
we can send our little Mario Paint

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
creations as text messages

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
and those silly little songs that we do in the

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
music generator we can send those

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
to each other somehow. Just food for thought.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And that'll never happen because it's too brilliant of a night.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Alright.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Anyhow speaking of VR

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
experiences this one would be worthy

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
of VR by the way. Space

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Channel 5

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Sega announced that there is

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
a Space Channel 5

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
VR called Ooki Ooki

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Viewing Show and when I heard that Space Channel

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
5 was coming to

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
VR I about made an Ooki Ooki

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
in my pants because

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
I fucking love Space Channel 5

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
and so the thought of just getting

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
to you know strut along with

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
choo choo right along that

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
just I was so excited about that

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
um but

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
unfortunately it's actually not

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
the game the key word is

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
viewing show so you get to be

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
a program viewer of the report

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
show sadly it's not something

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
that lets you play the rhythm game. However

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
but see I still go

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
okay but it seems like they're testing

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
the waters if this does well

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
that's that right there though

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
see this type of thing is why I'm

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
hesitant with jumping

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
in on like Playstation VR because

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
all these games that come out are experiences

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
they're not a game

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
it's just like it's a thing

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
it's a small portion of what could be

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
a game it's basically like a

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
tech demo

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
that's just why

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
am I dropping $500

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
a platform for fucking tech demos

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
it's gonna be a Tokyo game show

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
so some folks will get to try that out

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
first hand and here's the interesting part

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I just assumed it was Playstation VR

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
right it's actually not it's a Vive

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
um title so that kind of

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
surprised me but then again Sega's been doing

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
stuff for Steam so I guess it's

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
not as surprising but uh yeah

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
so it's actually an experience that's gonna be on the Vive

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
so some folks that are going to Tokyo Game

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Show will get to check that out I don't know

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
if Akuma JP is going this year but if you are

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
you need to check that out for me please

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
alright

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
uh let's go to Loki

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
with another news story

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
so once again you know another reason like I'm

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I bought Fallout

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
on Playstation 4 it's like sweet

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
cause I can my laptop

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
doesn't run these games that great

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
and you know I can also

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
do mods it's gonna be fucking awesome because

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
they talked about it at E3 and everything

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
yeah

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
unfortunately that's not gonna happen on Playstation 4

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
they did get they ended up releasing

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
mod support on Xbox

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
um back I wanna say in May

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
um it was supposed to be coming later

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
for Playstation 4 but

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
it's just not gonna happen anymore basically

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
as Bethesda put it on their website

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
after months of discussion with Sony we regret

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
to say that while we have long been

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
ready to offer mod support

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
on Playstation 4

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Sony has informed us they will not approve

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
user mods the way they should work

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
where users can do anything they want

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
for either Fallout 4 or

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Skyrim Special Edition

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
like you we are disappointed by Sony's decision

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
to give uh given the considerable

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
amount of time and effort we put into

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
the project and the amount

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
of time our fans have waited for mod

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
support to arrive we consider this

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
important initiative and we hope to find

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
other ways um user mods can be

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
available for the Playstation audience

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
however until Sony will allow us to

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
offer proper mod support for Playstation 4

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
that content for Fallout 4 and Skyrim

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
on Playstation 4 will not be available

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
thank you Sony

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
I appreciate this is really making me

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
warm up to your Playstation

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
platform

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Sony's not having a good PR week

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
they kick so much ass

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
at E3 and god

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
help us with this

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
seriously though the ball is in their core for

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
a lot of shit that's just not fucking

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
working like Microsoft

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
saying hey you know what we would do

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
cross platform multiplayer

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
balls in your court Sony

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
fuck nothing

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
ok and then like

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
then this shit is just

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
oh I'm sorry we promised this

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
for our players you bought the game based

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
on this promise yeah

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
we're just not going to let you do that either

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
they're like so worried that their console is

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
going to get hacked or something or that this game would make

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
you know the game crash or something like that

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
who cares if it makes the game crash it's a mod

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
it may do that put a

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
fucking you know

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
someone might put

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
titties in the game

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
and then there would be titties

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
on your Playstation

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
and then somebody calls

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
channel 10 news because the

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
kindergartner at home saw titties

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
oh no they

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
saw titties what

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
god of war is fucking around the corner anyways

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
there's always titties in god of war I mean who cares

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
or there's titties in grand theft auto 4

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
right now or 5 I mean

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
so you know

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
what's the big deal there's titties already on there

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
it's a mature rated game

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
well we're not a mature rated

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
society that's the problem

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
so that's a good retort

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I already have most of my people

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
in my you know settlements

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
without clothing anyways because

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
you can glitch it to do that

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
it's just a thing you do

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
so who cares I just think it's

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
stupid and this right here I'm not

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
buying Skyrim for Playstation 4

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
and if I do get an Xbox 1 I will be

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
buying multi platform games on

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Xbox 1 because apparently they have their shit together

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
where Sony can't fucking

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
even emulate god damn Playstation 1 games

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
yet on their powerful fucking hardware

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
backwards compatibility folks remember that

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
it's stupid it's Playstation now

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
oh we got Playstation now no fuck

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
you I don't want Playstation now

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I want this shit to fucking work because I bought it already

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
well Sony screwed themselves up anyway

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
because they built that Playstation 4 so

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
advanced thinking oh Xbox 1

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
they changed their architecture and they

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
essentially fell for the bluff

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
if you will saying oh well

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Xbox 1 is not going to be able to play backwards compatibility

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
that means we're in the clear now because

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Xbox because Microsoft said no

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
our next system is not going to be able to play 360 games

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
and then Microsoft went on Ninja

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
on Sony and said

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
hey surprise

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
through a nice software update and

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Windows 10 we've just

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
not made a couple hundred games and that just screwed

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Sony up it's sad they're doing backwards compatibility

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
better they're doing multiplayer

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
support better they're

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
supporting you know innovative

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
things on their platform it's just

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
weird that that's happening

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
it's also directly correlated

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
to when they threw one president out and got

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
another one yeah so

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
that's right knock down the 1%

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
fools all right DungeonBuster

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
in chat

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
saying Bethesda

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
pretty much threw Sony under the bus

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
yeah they did hell yeah that was

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
that was air that Bethesda put

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Sony in the special thanks yes

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
they did there

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
were so because they put the

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
effort into it and Sony's like yeah

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
we're not doing it there were a bunch of issues

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
such as mods not having any sound because the

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
PlayStation 4 uses a proprietary sound format

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
that they needed to work around so

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
all

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
right anyhow uh

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
how would you like speaking of Microsoft

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I mean how crazy would it be if suddenly

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
a Nintendo emulator came out

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
for the Xbox one then

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
boy Nintendo or excuse me

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Microsoft even more fans if

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
they were to do that and it looked like

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
for a little bit this week that it might be happening

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
through the emulator

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
nest box actually

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
said on Twitter that their application

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
had passed Microsoft certification

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
process for the

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Xbox and so it looked like

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
the nest box was going to be coming

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
out on the Xbox

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
one but a mere two days later

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
and I can't possibly imagine what happened

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
but a mere two days later all of a

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
sudden not only did this emulator get

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
yanked from

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
even potentially coming to the Xbox one

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
it got yanked from the mobile

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
phone and I think it's on the windows 10 store

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
or it's on one of the windows stores

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
fronts as well which

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
is interesting that okay

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
well we'll put emulators on those storefronts

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
you know nobody's paying

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
attention to windows phone anyway so

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
what the fuck we'll just let emulators on this platform

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
cause literally nobody's watching

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
so

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
but oh no the minute you say

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
you're going to put it on the Xbox now we're

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
going to have a problem that's what actually

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
happened here is that and the

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
reason was apps that are targeted

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
to Xbox one are primarily gaming

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
experiences must be approved

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
through the ID at Xbox program

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
and that was the excuse they used to yank it

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
all which makes sense because the ID at

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Xbox one they only care about

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
the Xbox because do you know how many emulators

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
and roms are on the windows

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
mobile platform I had a windows phone I had no

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
idea do you know I oh my god it was so

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
easy to find super

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
mario world just a super mario world

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
and just play on my windows phone how is that legal

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
no one cared because

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
what because of the because what windows phone

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
it was a windows phone that you know two people none

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
of the seven people were that that were

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
playing it you know that have the phone

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
we're going to be like oh my god microsoft look what's happening

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
oh no so yeah no absolutely

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
not so I'm not yeah so that's the only reason they got

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
called out was because of exactly that

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
it you know they added it to Xbox if it was

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
on the windows 10 the UWP

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
the universal windows platform

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
wouldn't none would have happened none would have

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
happened at all that's just hilarious

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
all right well all this talk of emulators

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
and things in the past makes

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
me think it's time to open

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
the gaming vault with the classic

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
game of the week

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
every week of course dark

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
sakura steps into the gaming vault and

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
finds a game that she thinks hey

warcraft is just bring back old stuff because it

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000

a bad guy that could be the next

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
expansion space goats

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000

is an elder in video gaming

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
it's older than a lot of you it

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
actually it could have birthed some of you that is a

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
sad sad truth yes

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
what is the classic game of the week dark sakura I was

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
five I was two

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
okay you were five too

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
no I was two

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
the classic game of the week is tempest

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
not tempest 2000

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
which we've done before

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
not txk which is

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
fucking awesome and everyone needs to play it

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
get a vita right now it's the reason to have a vita

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
it's tempest

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
it came out in 1981

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
babies

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
oh then I was three just kidding okay whatever

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
let me feel old

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
it came out by atari

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
and it was designed by

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
some guy named dave

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
and my husband is texting me while

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
I am doing the classic game

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
um

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
dave thorough

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
it takes place on this kind

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
of tube thing

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
it is a three dimensional game but it

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
was done in vector

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
the original was

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
and so this surface

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
is sometimes a tube sometimes

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
it's planar

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
but you can basically move

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
this little claw shaped spaceship

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
named blaster

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
um around the play field

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
from segment to segment

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
um it was also

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
one of the first games that used atari's

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
color quadra scan vector

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
display and

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
you also got to choose your starting

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
level and it was called the skill step

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
that atari called it

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
um you also uh

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
could increase your maximum starting level

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
depending on your performance

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
in the previous game so you could keep

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
continuing from there and it was

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
so it was one of the first video games

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
that had progressive level design

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
um as far as the

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
way that the game the object of the game

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
you just basically have to survive as long as

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
possible and score as many points as

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
possible by cleaning off the screen

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
which is harder than it sounds oh my

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
god tempest is a whore

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
because you pay for it

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
you fucking pay for it

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
okay

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
anyway you get

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
who's tempest why are you calling her

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
such horrible things on this program dark

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
sagra tempest is a 50 year old drag

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
queen

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
sorry not sorry

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
um anyway um the players

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
ship uh gets to shoot

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
rapid fire shots down the screen

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
and little enemies are trying to come

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
up that segment that you happen to be

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
on you also get a thing called a

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
super zapper and

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
it destroys all the enemies on the field

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
um enemies will also

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
um have different

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
kinds of behaviors like one of them will leave

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
a spike as they travel up the

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
the little section um

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
and so when you're moving on to the next

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
play field the spike can impale you

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
impale

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
they also can go up to

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
the top of the screen and try to

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
capture your

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
little blaster ship

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
um and then when you

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
destroy all the enemies on the play field

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
you get warped to the next level

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
and so that's pretty much

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
tempest it has 16 screens

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
with different shapes on them

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
some like I said are closed

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
um and some of them are open fields

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
that have you know real end points

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
um

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
and each of them has a different color scheme

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
based on difficulty level

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
including invisible

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
which are for level 65

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
to 80 okay people actually

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
saw level 65 cause I never

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
I knew that there were like red

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
fields but like I never

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
saw anything but blue

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
stage wait I think maybe like one

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
time on a port of this game

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
maybe for like Commodore 64

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I think I saw red which is

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
like the next highest up you see red when I play that

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
game

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
I just like playing this in the arcade

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
cause you have the little nub that you

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
would turn back and forth and you could just spin it

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
it felt like you liked playing

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
with the nub yeah I like playing with the nub

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
once in a while okay the nub like you played with

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
once in a while okay

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
anyway um

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
the game was supposed to be

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
in concept

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
a 3D remake of Space Invaders

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
but it had different

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
problems so

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
really cause it looks nothing like it

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
yeah so the um

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
the creator though said that

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
he got the design from a dream

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
where monsters were crawling out of a hole in the ground

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
so the game started off as

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
aliens to vortex and finally

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
it was Tempest and

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
there were different um

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
uh cases different

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
um cabinets for it

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
um there was the upright one

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
um there was also

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
uh a shorter

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
cabaret style cabinet

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
that um

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
it was a little

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I don't think that they made as many of them

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
and then there was a cocktail style

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
that allowed uh two players

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
to play at opposite ends

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
um but the screen would

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
flip of course vertically for each of

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
the players not that it really mattered in this game

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
yeah

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
if the screen didn't flip oh well

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
except maybe left and right would kinda be

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
screwed up and that that would make your nub

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
turning a lot less fun

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
well Jeff Minter

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
um came later and created two

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
authorized sequels one of them was

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Tempest 2000 which I have done his classic

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
game because it's awesome years ago

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
it was like one of the first classic games like years

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
ago yeah and um it

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
came out for the Atari Jaguar and

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
um the Playstation version was called

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Tempest X3 was there anything else worth

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
owning on the Jaguar

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
what was it

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
besides Tempest 2000 wasn't it

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
like an Astol game no it was like an aliens

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
and predator game or something no I thought that there was

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
another like little 2D platformer that came

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
out on it was it it wasn't Astol

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
it was okay but seriously Tempest 2000

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
was the game was it Ristar maybe maybe

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I don't know okay um

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
and then um there was Tempest 3000

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
uh for the new on DVD players

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
and then um Minter

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
did two more games that were inspired

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
by Tempest Space

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Giraffe in 2007

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
and TXK which came out on the

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Playstation Vita which

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
has been getting a lot of play in my house

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
now that I have a Playstation TV

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
that and Ultra Despair Girls

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
so um

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
it's had different ports it was the Atari

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
2600 and 5200 versions

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
um well

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
those were prototypes I actually do have

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
the 5200 prototype

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
and it's pretty pretty awesome

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
we play it with the trackball

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
um and then

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
um there was an Atari

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Greatest Hits version

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
um there was also

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Superior Software for the BBC Micro

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
and Acorn Electron

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
and one by

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Electric Dreams for the ZX Spectrum

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
and Amstrad CPC

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
there's also been Windows versions

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
and different versions of the Playstation

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Saturn, Super Nintendo

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
all kinds of different versions on it

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
so basically you can find

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Tempest anywhere but play TXK

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
because it's really good and

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Sony was kind of being dickish about

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
um wanting to sue the guy

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
I don't think that was Sony dear

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Not Sony Atari

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
yeah whatever and Tempest

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
was actually featured in a Rush video

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
subdivisions

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
get out that's awesome

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
and as we know Rush is Canada's best export

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
that just made like an awesome game like

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
1.5 times as awesome

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
right? so that's your game

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Tempest play it

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
right now play TXK

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
on all the things TXK

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
there it is your classic game of the week

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Tempest originally in the arcade

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
but ported to

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
everything in the 1980's

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
everything

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
it's very great to have

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Jamie on the show thanks to Radio Magic

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
so we'll see her back next week

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
for whatever next week's classic

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
game of the week might be meanwhile

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
we had a birthday this past week

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
actually just a couple

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
days ago which we just passed

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Nine and Nine which not

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
only was the day for what

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
a new Lady Gaga single

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
and a Bastille album I think came out on that day

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
no way!

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
but it was also Dreamcast day

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Nine Nine 99

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
was the big day the Dreamcast came out

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
in the US anyway

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
so a happy belated birthday to the Dreamcast

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
that would be 17 years ago

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
any Dreamcast memories from you Gabe?

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
I feel like we get into

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Dreamcast memories every year around this time

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
but what about you Gabe?

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
I'll be honest I only

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
play the Dreamcast a little bit

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
this is probably

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
not the game people would expect

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
but Soul Calibur

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
when I played Soul Calibur the first time

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
and I heard the orchestrated music

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
I fell in love with that I was like oh my god

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
how is this playing such gorgeous

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
because that was N64 I was playing

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Nintendo 64 and I was still so

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
used to music made in MIDI

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
and then to hear

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
fight music being played with

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
actual full CD orchestrated sound

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
I was like what is this?

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I lost my mind

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
and then Virtua Fighter 2

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
or even 3

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
between those two games

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
there was an import game on the Dreamcast

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
that was partially inspired for Kinship

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
but I...

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Border Down is what it's called but it never came to the states

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
it was for the Dreamcast called Border Down

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
thank god if someone has that game

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
for me the big one is going to forever and always be

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Phantasy Star Online that just

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
blew my mind to have that type of experience

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
on consoles

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
we were kind of introduced to

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
the MMO experience a little bit

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
on PC with Ultima Online and so forth

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
but just to have that on

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
which some argue if

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
PSO was really an MMO or not

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
but at the end of the day the point is

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
that it was definitely something

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
a game that you could just

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
drop in at any time with other people

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
and experience together

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
it was so different for the time

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
that's why I had to have a Dreamcast

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
big social experiment and then

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
that game I cannot believe I forgot about

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
that game so yeah

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
my back to the PSO fans but yeah

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
that was a wonderful game

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
for it's time absolutely

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
you know we mentioned the Dreamcast

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
anniversary on our social media pages earlier

Google Plus Act Def did mention this week

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
I still own one but I don't know if it

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
still works but I do have fond memories

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
of it and the games it has I

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
remember completing Crazy Taxi

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
haha yeah

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
of course like just a mainstay

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
game the first game I got for it

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
it took me a lot to do it but I managed

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
to I also remember playing

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
lots of fighting games with friends

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
lots of fun yeah wasn't

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Capcom SNK 2 on Dreamcast

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
yes it was so fucking good god what a

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
great game seriously

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
wonderful over on

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Facebook Ragenator

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
I think this says that I never bought a

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Dreamcast something that I regret

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
to this day I do however have the

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Dreamcast collection Nights into

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Dreams Jet Set Radio all that stuff

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
on Steam I wish there

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
was more retro Sega stuff on

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Steam like Mr. Bones and the Panzer

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Dragoon games I've always wanted to play

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
those Hunter R

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
said I went through two different Dreamcast

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
consoles after dropping my original

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Ray console thereby ruining the DVD

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
drive on the console I got the black

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Sega Sports edition of the Dreamcast

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
remember they used to make

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
there was a Hello Kitty Dreamcast at one point

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
oh don't tell that to Brianna

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Bri there's a Hello Kitty Dreamcast

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
out there it's probably on eBay

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
go quick

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
oh she's all about that

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
no it was awesome I remember I saw that

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
in like Japantown in LA once or something

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
and I was like it's cute

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
did that whole thing

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
it was awesome

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
long nights playing

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Power Stone that was Loki's game right

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Power Stone yeah Power Stone is pretty awesome

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
man I wish that's something that would come back

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
of course

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
good memories it's just

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
it's hard to kind of pinpoint

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
like you know we have all these fond

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
memories of the Dreamcast yet it sure doesn't seem like

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
it lasted very long you know it did not and it's

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
unfortunate because I think that was a

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
console way ahead of itself yeah and

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
and what I think it fell

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
it just it fell during this

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
massive transition because it came

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
out

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
because it was in between like the N64 and the

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
PS2 at that point I think

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
when the PS2 was coming out and

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
and yeah and because of the

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
impact the first Playstation

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
made on everybody yeah I think it was

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
too little too late for Sega which is very very

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
unfortunate Bob C in our chat

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
says Tekken was never on Dreamcast

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
but didn't they have that tricky like was it

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
okay speaking of like software yeah there's Blingcast

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
right where you could you actually

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
did put Tekken it was this weird thing and

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
like you know we were joking about the Windows phone and the emulators

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
earlier but it's like a lot of that stuff was going on

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
on Dreamcast with the Blingcast

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
and then like one reason I got a Dreamcast

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
when it was only like 40 bucks I mean obviously

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
there was PSO and all that stuff you could just like

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
burn a disc with a Nintendo emulator on Dreamcast

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
and it worked for the most part

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
that's so weird that a Dreamcast

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
is capable of playing Playstation

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
1 games oh but a Playstation

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
4 alright I'm sorry here we go

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
simmer down

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
yeah you right about

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
yeah you mentioned yeah not Tekken

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
but yeah that's why I said Soul Calibur nevermind

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
alright nevermind I'm just drifting away

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000

Igarashi game it's been

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
delayed

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
you're gonna have to wait until 2018

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
to play it what a fucking shock

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
I'm gonna die from that surprise

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
and I backed the game I did I did too

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
I backed a huge I was a huge backer

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
well it looks like it would be Mighty No. 10

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
alright you know what you know what

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I've demo already plays

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
better than Mighty No. 9 I'm just half kidding

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
if it's good

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
let it simmer oh definitely

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
let it cook take your time

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
make sure there's an internal temperature of 160

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
degrees or higher

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
it's safe to consume based it well

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I'm fine we're waiting a little longer

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
it's fine definitely

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Oculus had this

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
animated 3D like viewing

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
experience called Henry

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
and they won

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
they won an Emmy for it

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
no kidding

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
so that's pretty awesome

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
best original interactive

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
program

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
nice congratulations

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
breaking news do you know who else won an Emmy today

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
RuPaul won the

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Emmy for best reality TV show

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
host that's fantastic work

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
so excited

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
cover girl

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
now the question is did Stranger Things

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
win any Emmys

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I don't think it was nominated because I think it's too

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
early I think it came out too

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
after the like cut off or whatever

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
I think it'll be next year when it's eligible

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
yeah so how about

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
it could get Globes though I suppose

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
how about Kimmy Schmidt

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
I don't know if it was nominated I feel like Titus

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
had to get nominated again I think so yeah

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
but I don't know

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I don't follow the Emmys that closely you know why

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
cause I do a show on Sunday nights

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
that keeps me from watching all that other crap

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
rock on fight the machine

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
alright moving on

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
to other rapid fire stories

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Brie pay attention it's Hello Kitty

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Hello Kitty is coming to

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Animal Crossing New Leaf what

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
yeah that's right

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Hello Kitty well

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
simmer your expectations

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
in Japan anyway

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
so the Hello Kitty characters will

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
be on themed items that are coming to the game

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
there's furniture that's gonna be

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
unlocked using Sanrio amiibo

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
cards going on sale

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
in Japan November 3rd

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
I kinda have to fucking have them like I just do

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
yeah she doesn't need a reason not

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
she doesn't need a reason to go to Japan

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I just that's gonna be a reason for her to go back to Japan

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
okay now she's gonna go to Japan to get some

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
fucking cards that's pretty that's hard

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
more hardcore than me that's her homeland anyway

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I just bat my

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
eyelashes if my dear friend Akuma

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
will help me out or I think I think Amazon Japan

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
did that thing a while ago where now they will

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
ship over here directly

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Japan and China

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
you know you don't have to worry about that as much

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
anymore

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
anyway there was a

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
I guess Animal Crossing Nintendo

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Direct that has a little bit more on this so that's

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
pretty cool

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
also

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
PlayStation 4 Arcade

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Archives is growing you know these games

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
don't get featured a lot but essentially

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
arcade ports of classic

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
games such as Gradius 2

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
I think was one I did a live stream of not that

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
long ago you know there's actually a

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
growing library of really kinda like

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
under the I mean cause none

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
of the games out I can think of off the top of my head

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
anywhere like huge releases but

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
a lot of like really kinda like under the radar

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
stuff well some of these

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
releases are gonna get pretty big because

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
one of the games that's actually coming out for

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
PlayStation 4 very soon I guess

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Bubble Bobble's coming out soon if it's not already

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
oh I used to love that game

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
yes that's that's

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
that might already be out

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
and I missed it I have to go back and look

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
The Legend of Kage was

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
in that list as well but this is huge

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Haunted Castle

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
is coming now you

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
might not know that from the name

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
that is the arcade version of Castlevania

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
so

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
when you see Haunted Castle on

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
PlayStation 4 that's fucking Castlevania

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
on the PlayStation 4

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
that's gonna be pretty awesome that's also

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
gonna join some other releases

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Thunder Cross, Terra Force,

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Ark Area, Mutant Knight

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
you know again not a bunch of like

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
you know huge titles in name

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
so could we possibly get

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
like a Silent Hill game called like

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Misty Spooky Town or something like that

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
you know it's

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
basically like the arcade version of

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Silent Hill

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com asks

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I love Bubble Bobble but do we really

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
spawn on PlayStation 4? As long

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
as the boss will spawn on level 30?

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Yes. Oh snap

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
That was a long time ago on the end

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I feel like I need one of those flowcharts

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Do we need

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Do we need Bubble Bobble on this

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
console? Next thing

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Does the boss spawn on level 30?

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
No. If the answer is no

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
No we don't. Yes

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Of course we do

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
I need a Lego one of those levels

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Alright let's

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
travel around the world and check out some

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
release dates of some games coming out in a country

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
near you starting with the US

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Alright so we're getting a little bit busier

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
So we've got Bioshock Collection coming out this week

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Remember PC? You don't have to really buy it

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
if you already own it so it's all good

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
free upgrade

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Dead Rising coming out on

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
that's the remastered version of that

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
also coming out as well, PlayStation 4

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
and Xbox One and the Dead Rising

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Triple Pack coming out on PlayStation 4

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
and Xbox One which makes me wonder why

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
isn't the

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Dead Rising off the record

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
not by itself?

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I thought that was the second one that was in there

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
No, off the record was the

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
it was the expansion of 2

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Right, that's what

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
It wasn't a standalone though

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Off the record was the alternate

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Dead Rising 2 where you play

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
instead of

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
It was an alternate? I thought it was an expansion

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
No, it was an alternate because Dead Rising 2

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
you played a different dude

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Right, but off the record

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
showed what happened to Frank

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
after part one

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
No, because the whole premise was like, here's how I would have done it

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
and that's basically the game

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Interesting, okay

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
But yeah, those will be coming out this week

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000

mandatory happiness

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
mandatory happiness

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
that's what I want on this show

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
that's what I want from Loki

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
mandatory happiness

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
I feel like there should be an episode of OLR

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
where Loki has to

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
it's mandatory happiness for Loki

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
and we're just gonna throw fuckin' everything at him

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
every Apple story I've got, every Nintendo story I've got

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
and he has to be positive

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
we have to call it Happy Loki

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
he has to say something nice

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
for 15 minutes

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I'm gonna do it when his kid's here

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I can do it for the whole show

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
yeah, we can speak to him

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
we need to do that

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
okay, anyways

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
they're all yelling at me in chat to do it on episode 666

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
that would be evil

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
and then, let's see

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
we've got ReCore coming out this week

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000

just a small little game

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
just a small little underground title

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
this is kind of a cool title

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
I'm wondering if that's like that Visceral Cleanup

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
game or whatever

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
that's gonna be coming out on PC

Christ, this is a big week

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
and finally, that's it

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
I want that fucking Dragon Quest game too

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
and I kinda want Persona

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
oh my god, it's a busy week

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
alright, let's go over to Japan

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
it's a busy week there too in Japan

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
the Bioshock Collection makes its way to Japan

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
the new PlayStation 4

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
little Slim version is out in Japan

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
this week on the 15th as well

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
and Persona 5 in a regular

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
20th anniversary edition and accessories set

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
all of that hits Japan as well on the 15th

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
so yeah, very busy

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
week in Japan, World Soccer winning 11

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
as well in Japan this week

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
so it looks like Japan kinda mirrors us a little bit this week

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
on the PlayStation 4

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
sadly, the only release on the Wii U this week

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
is Terraria, but you know things on the Wii U

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
are kinda dying down a little bit

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
on the PlayStation Vita

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
which basic question, they haven't gotten Terraria yet?

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
not in a retail release

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
that whole thing, yeah

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
PlayStation Vita

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
taken over there with Hightaka no Psychedelica

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
comes out in a limited edition in Japan this week

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
and Yunohana Spring, Cherishing Time

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
also out in Japan this week

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
lastly on the 3DS this week

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
there's a brand new 2DS

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
in both Lavender and Pink

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
and Red and Blue

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
there's lots of new 2DS colors out this week

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
but you can also get a price reduction

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
on Zelda no Densetsu

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Toki no Ocarina 3D

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
which of course is the Ocarina of Time 3D

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
in Japan with a price reduction there

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
and

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Cho Sentochu Kyokyu no Shinobu

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
to battle player Choju Kesenn

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
comes out this week

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Battle for Money

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
is what that translates to

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
loosely there

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
so that is out on the 3DS this week

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
so that's what's in Japan

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
with Dark Soccer being absent

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
from the show for a little while

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Loki's gonna step in and

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
take a trip over to Europe for us

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
with the UK dates

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
I guess I will

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I guess I will if you're making me

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
so in the UK

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
let's see what we got coming out

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
XCOM 2

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
on Playstation 4 and

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
on PC

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
and let's see

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
that was the 7th so that was last week

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
this week ReCore on

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
PC and Xbox One

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Pro Evolution also coming out over there

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
as well on Xbox 360

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Playstation 3, Playstation 4

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Xbox One and PC

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Bioshock the collection

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
on PC, Playstation 4

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
and Xbox One

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
and that's it

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Now the chatters

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
are actually saying, there's a couple of people in chat saying this

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
that Persona 5 is actually not

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
out here in the

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
states this week Loki, your list may be wrong

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
because apparently it's out in Japan

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
this week, that part was correct but it was actually

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
delayed for the rest of the world until

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
February, several people saying that in chat

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
are you telling me that Wikipedia is incorrect?

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
I don't believe you

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
because even I'm looking at another Wikipedia

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
page that says that it's

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
out worldwide on Valentine's Day

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
it will be out multiple weeks if it has to

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
ok?

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
and listen, I am like a weatherman

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
I'm telling you what the weather is going to be like

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
and then it will be like something it decides

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
you know what, it probably still made your list

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
because there's that many people that are planning on

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
recording it this week over on this side

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
honestly, but

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
just want to clarify that

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
it will be out in a secret location that you have no access to

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
it's still coming out though

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
that list is 100%

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
accurate

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
let's get to our emails

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
every week you guys email us

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
and we read some of our favorite

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
emails here on the show and respond

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
to them if appropriate

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
is this appropriate?

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
for these emails?

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
or do you not know yet?

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
yes, well I've just given them the

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
once over

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
meaning I open them up to make sure they didn't say

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
fuck you, you fucking fuck

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
but that could have been from Loki though

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
or I had to make sure

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
it wasn't something that said buy Viagra

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
cheap

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
we need to talk about that

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Viagra has a sponsor, FOLR

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
no!

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
hi

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
but we do have some fabulous emails from listeners

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
this week starting with Andy R

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
who starts us off this week saying

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I'm sure you're already sick of talking about it this

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
late in the podcast but after replying to the

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Facebook post I was musing more about the

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
PlayStation 4 Pro and felt like

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
emailing with some more thoughts

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
mainly because I was watching a video gamer

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Eurogamer put up

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
a video that Eurogamer put up about the event

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
one guy talking had been to the event and the

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
other, like most of us, only saw what was streamed

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
the guy who only saw the stream was very much

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
in line with the internet consensus, namely

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
the I don't see the point or I don't see a huge

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
change sentiment that is going around

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
interestingly though, the guy

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
who had been at the event seemed fairly impressed

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
with what Sony had managed to coax out of a

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
$400 box

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
which got me to thinking, this reminds me a lot

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
of VR, in general it seems like the

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
people I talk to about VR tend to fall into

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
two camps, ones who have tried it and

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
think it is cool or ones that haven't tried it

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
and don't see what the hubble is about

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
in the case of PS4 Pro, watching

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
footage of a 4K HDR game on

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
a stream probably doesn't do

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
justice, much like not having

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
actually tried a VR headset

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
I know I personally streamed the PS4

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
P meeting to on my phone

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
over a cell signal which clearly

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
wouldn't hold a candle to the kind of TVs the

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Pro is designed for, like VR

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Sony has probably got an uphill

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
battle convincing people that this is the thing

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
they need, especially since this one

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
requires not only the box itself

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
but a TV capable of really taking

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
advantage of the box, maybe they're banking

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
on people who don't have the TV yet

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
future proofing and just going for the Pro

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
anyway, at least we've seen the

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
PlayStation 4's will fly off the shelves at

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
$399 in the past, so getting it to that price

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
point was a smart move, anyway

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
just a few thoughts for the conversation, this

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
holiday is going to be pretty interesting I imagine

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
that email again from Andiar

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
that is a very good point

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I really like the comparison

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
about that VR

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
can be a hard sell until you've tried it

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
so considering that very few

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
of us probably watched the PlayStation

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Pro thing on a

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
4K TV, maybe

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
we are not really seeing the message

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
whereas the people that were there

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
well I'm sure Sony had 4K projection

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
in that room taken care of, so people

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
were very happy with what they saw I'm sure

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
so very interesting perspective

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
although that being said

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
that fantastic

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
demo that they had of

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Horizon Zero Dawn

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
or whatever that is

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
looked awesome

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Shadow of the Colossus

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
awesome, it did look awesome

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
so this tells me that Sony now needs to

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
get PlayStation 4 Pros

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
running on 4K TVs in every Best Buy

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
around the nation, because that's really the best way

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
all I need to hear is, hey Grand Theft Auto 5

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
is going to be one of those supported

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
higher resolution games

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
would that really do it for you?

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
what about The Last of Us

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
I haven't played The Last of Us

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
because they're doing it with The Last of Us, they're adding

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
4K textures for The Last of Us

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
because why not

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
see for me, but Mass Effect, you know

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
that's kind of my version of Loki's Grand Theft Auto

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
you know, that, seeing that

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
as part of it does kind of make me go

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
maybe I do need a Pro, maybe I do need

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
to future proof, but maybe I am

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
a little worried that by the time I get a 4K TV

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Sony will have another console

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
in three years, that's where I'm starting

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
to worry, that sounds like it, because if

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
it's a ten year cycle is what it's supposed to be

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
you've already, we're not even

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
halfway there and you're giving me a new console

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
you're giving me an upgraded console, so

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
uh huh

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
so how much Grand Theft Auto 5 have you?

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
to be fair, not a lot, it's one of those

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
things that I think about playing it and then

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
ooh, shiny, I get distracted by something else

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
you know how it goes, I do

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
alright, one more email this week

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
from Dark Tetsuya, who says

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
hey OLR, I thought I'd write you guys about a neat

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
new indie film that came out while you guys

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
were on break, it's called The Outrunners

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
so basically the plot is our hero

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Eli was visiting the arcade with his friend

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
one day and got to talking to a girl

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
but the resident bully and his gang caught wind of it

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
and challenged him to a high stakes race in

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Sega's The Outrunners, winner stays

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
loser leaves the arcade for good

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
it's a pretty neat film if you enjoy

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
classic arcades and the racing games

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
they had back in the 90's, because this sounds

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
like a plot out of the 90's to be quite honest

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
but um, there's

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
even some subtle nods to anime like

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Initial D, like they actually

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
used some of the music in the end racing scenes

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
and Eli's car is the same car that

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
the star of the Initial D drives

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
the director told me on Facebook that

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Initial D was one of his favorite anime

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
the film is available for free on YouTube

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
and be sure to check them out on Facebook as well

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
the gaming blogs haven't really said

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
a lot about this, but I thought if I sent you guys

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
an email, I could get more people to check

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
this out, uh, you're right

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
the dozens and dozens of people that listen to OLR

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
will hopefully check this out

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
so thank you for the heads up there

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
that is again called The Outrunners

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
well hey, I like old Sega 90 game

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
let me ask this, since it is an ode to

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
90's racing game classics

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
will we get to hear in this movie the

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
like is that what plays

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
as the 20th Century Fox logo

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
comes, well I guess not, because it's not a 20th Century Fox movie

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
but you know, that's what you expect

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
right?

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Daytona

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
hell yeah, heck yeah

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
anyway, that would be a fantastic

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
game for the remake

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
seriously

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
hell yeah

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
alright, there it is, your emails

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
if you want to send us an email

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
for consideration in a future week

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
alright, remake Daytona

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
they did on the 360

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
and it was gorgeous

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
it wasn't remade

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
because 4k is where it's at

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
720p

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
special thanks

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
it was no, those are just the HD versions

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
of like the Dreamcast games

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
or whatever they had, or Saturn games

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
no, but they like redid that from the ground up

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
and they added a couple new things too

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
it was great game, if you want the HD

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
remake, play the 360 version

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
it was good, that's the best I can give you

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
I can't give you much else, so can't please you

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
clearly, so it's all good

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
alright, s2100matt posting a link there

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
in our chatroom by the way

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
some folks I'm sure will be watching that

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
after the show

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
or is Loki trying to watch it during the show

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I thought that's what Gabe was

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
peering over and looking out of there

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
no, I'm looking in the chatroom, someone said

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
would a new EDF in 4k

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
there would be no frame rate

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
those games are so horribly optimized

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
it would just be like

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
it's just like nothing, in fact

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
at the very least, Playstation 4 Pro

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
would maybe bring it up to like

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
20 frames per second, I mean

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
the 4.1

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
it was way better than

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
the PS3 version

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
because the PS3 version in 2025

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
was terrible, so that had frame

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
rate issues from the 20

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I like 2025 part

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
of the way, it's just

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
I don't know, it's not

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
the same

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
it was its own thing I guess

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
but it was nice to have the co-op

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
and stuff, I just haven't played co-op

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
alright, let's get back into some other

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
gaming news, Loki, that's fine

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
we're such nerds

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
anyways, so

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
speaking of

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
every

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Playstation 4, this is kind of

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
a neat little thing to throw in there

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
you don't have to buy a new system to get

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
that wonderful HDR, so be able

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
to support the wider range

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
of color and everything

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
the pictures will kind of pop more

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
that's coming in a free update

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
if you already have a Playstation 4, you can enjoy

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
that right away, assuming

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
they have a TV new enough to actually take advantage

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
of that, which I don't

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
again, we face

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
this technical

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
issue, and I almost begin to

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
wonder if

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
that's the mentality

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
with these bigger game companies

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
honestly though, it's been a long time since I had a

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
TV, I got this TV, actually thankfully

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
it was a promo thing from Sony

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
ironically enough, it's a Sony

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
HDTV, but they gave that

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
to all of the employees

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
of the company I worked for, and so I had a nice

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
new HDTV from that, and at the time it was

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
cutting edge, but

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
now it's pretty old

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
so I mean, I could use a new

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
TV, it's just

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
you're justifying buying a new one

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
my concern is again,

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
is a

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
new console no longer enough

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
do we have to have

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
you gotta have a very powerful TV

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
and here's what we can provide too, because

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
now you're costing me

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
not just four or five hundred dollars

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
to enjoy a new gaming experience

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
now I gotta pay a grand

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
essentially, you know

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
and on top of that, like why should I be dropping

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
money on a new TV and a new

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
system and VR and all this stuff

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
for Sony, when

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
you know, they can't even get

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
like mod support working and stuff

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
something that was promised to people like a long time ago

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
well that's ultimately my point, because

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
invest in a PC instead, I mean

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
well even the original PS4 was supposed to do

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
4K, and

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
that just

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
disappeared into the

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
nothing. The menus are 4K

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
That's it. Right?

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
And again, that's a whole other thing

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
I appreciate the fact that these newer consoles

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
and I said this earlier, okay fine

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
you're gonna be able to display

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
show off 4K and things like that

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
but I can't wait to see how few

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
developers actually utilize that

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
that's gonna be the best part, so anyway

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
I digress

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
So, I mean

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
if my TV doesn't really support

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
this thing, then this patch does nothing for me

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
or will I get to see some subtle differences

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
or what? No. Brighter blues

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
brighter blues and reds

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
that's about it. Because I bought my, like my TV

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
is pretty fucking nice I think, it's a

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
2014 model apparently

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
and so it doesn't have this. Maybe it supports it.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
I looked on the Amazon thing, because I actually went back

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
and looked at the TV I bought on Amazon

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
which, just an interesting

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
side story, I was gonna buy the TV

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
at Sears, and it was on the display

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
for it and everything, and then they told me, like, we don't have it

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
like, they didn't

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
they wanted me to go to another Sears

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
on the other end of town, and I was like

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
okay, I'll head over there now. I'm sorry, but the TV you're looking for

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
is at another Sears. Yeah, it's in another castle

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
right? So I just

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
I came home and I bought it on Amazon, like

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
anybody else would have done it

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Why are department stores dying?

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Or just go to Best Buy and have them

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
price match Amazon. Uh, yeah

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
I guess I could have done it, but anyway, it doesn't matter, because I got a fucking TV

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
like two years ago, no, last year

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
and it's a two year old model, but apparently, yeah, it doesn't do

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
but it does do 3D

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Blu-rays and all that stuff

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Oh, goody goody. I have, like, two movies

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
I can watch in 3D

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Tron's one of them, so

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Do you have the glasses for it? I do, but

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
fuck if they ever seem to work

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
I tried to use them on the ongoing, I was like

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
these don't even really work

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
And that's what I mean right there

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
like, that's what I mean, you know, the other thing

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
that made me push so hard on 3D

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Yeah, right? Look how well that worked out

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Boy oh boy

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Anyhow, um, well I still

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
you know, I'm excited for the update to see if

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
it'll do anything for me, but

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
God, again, my TV is not that old

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
and it doesn't support any of this

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Well, the 4K support ends are pretty nice, I mean, just even watching the little demos

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
walking through Best Buy and stuff like that, it's like

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
damn, that's a nice clear picture

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
but it's just like, damn, is that gonna be the

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
same nice clear picture when I stream it through Netflix

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
on this crappy boxy they have? Nope

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
I'm gonna need like, you know, a nicer

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
new platform to be able to stream in 4K

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
and a nicer new internet provider

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
that's gonna be able to handle that

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
bandwidth, but not Comcast

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Alright, well another big birthday

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
that happened this week was the 50th anniversary

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
of Star Trek

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
and how appropriate that just this past week

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Star Trek Online

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
has come out for consoles

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Star Trek Online

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
what, came out, what is it

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
like January 2012

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
when free to play, I think it had actually been out

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
as a pay game maybe a year or two before that

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
and then it was free to play in 2012

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
well now it is out on PlayStation 4

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
and Xbox One

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
so it took a little while for it to come out

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
but what a good way to get an older

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
MMO some new attention

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
than by being right there for download

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
on the consoles

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
DC Universe Online

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
kind of did this same type of thing a while ago

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
as well, so anyhow

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
Star Trek Online is now available

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
and I think the audience over there

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
seems to be growing a little bit, probably

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
these console releases are helping

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
so now might be a good time to check that out

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
so, what's cool is that they actually have some of the

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
cast from the movies, it's like voice over

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
oh really, oh that's awesome

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
that's pretty cool, I wanna say

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
I may be wrong, I don't wanna step out of line

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
but I wanna say they were able to get Leonard Nimoy

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
in the game before he had passed

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
well cause again this game's been out

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
since 2010, so I wanna say

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
he was in it, and they had at one point

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Zachary Kinto was in it too

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
because he was Spock

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
in the new movies, I think he was in the game when it

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
first came out as well, so

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
uh yeah, Kaijuto in chat says did they

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
make the game better cause on PC

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
it blows, and Fifth Dream confirms yes

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Nimoy is in the intro in the first five

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
minutes, so that's pretty cool

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
it might be worth checking out all on its own

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
I'm curious if uh

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
any of our friends from Starboard Power Coupling

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
uh check that out on consoles cause I know some

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
of them play Star Trek Online, I don't know if they

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
went and checked it out on consoles though

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
so uh let's move on, Loki

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
so uh this is kinda cool

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
there was a slight tease or a positive

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
leaked tease that Earth Defense

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Force 5 might be a thing

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
um apparently this was coming

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
from um a count, they had a countdown

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
teaser actually on

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
the D3 publisher site, and I wanna say that this

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
also leaked out from like another publication

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
that it was out there

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
um so

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
yeah, it'd be

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
interesting to check it out

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
the moon

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
hell yeah, EDF 5 baby

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
oh boy

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
you gonna pick this one up when it comes to Earth?

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
of course you are

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
alright it sounds like you and Gabe will have

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
something to play together cause Gabe's definitely

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
a fan as well

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
nothing, that game

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
just warms my soul

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
so much destruction

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
so goddamn hard

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
alright we are gonna open up the

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
pipeline to you guys, Orange Lounge Radio

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
all one word on Skype, if you wanna give us a call

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
and talk about anything that we've talked about

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
tonight, maybe you wanna ask Gabe a question

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
or uh anything else that might

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
be on your mind, you can go ahead and give us a call

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
um while we wait for some calls to come in

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
um Gabe let me ask you about this

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
uh locally with Sacramento

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
and development and all that, I know we had talked about

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
earlier in the show, we mentioned that Sacramento

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
can be seen by those in other areas

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
it's kinda like, you know

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
not as lucrative of an area

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
or whatever, which seems a little silly to me

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
cause it seems like, you know, we're growing a little bit

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
with our, even our triple A game development

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
right, which um, you know

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
I forget what they were called back in the day, what, Click Play

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
or Click and Play or something, Click Nation

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
that's it, they grew into now Capital Games

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
EA Capital Games, which

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
uh I believe based on one of the trailers

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
they showed recently, they're doing work with the

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Star Wars mobile development, right, yes they are

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
yes they are, so that's pretty cool, do we know of any

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
other like big big studios that are establishing

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
a presence here locally? Um, I know

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
so on the indie side

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
um, on the indie side you've got Skirmish

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
who just recently got a little office

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
uh, so I think somewhere

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
in Rancho or Sacramento, something like that

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
I wanna, yeah, somewhere nearby for here

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
I think, um, I know the other big one

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Fifth Planet Games, they're up in Rockland

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
they were in Roseville, they moved up

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
to Rockland, um, they've uh

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
they've trimmed down a little bit on the size

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
of their studio, but they're

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
still a pretty significant size studio, Fifth Planet

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Games, and big shout out to

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Rob, um, you know, Rob Winkler

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
he was one of our speakers for the

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
first indie arcade, um, but yeah

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Fifth Planet is definitely one of the other

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
well known studios

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
so with their, um, oh my goodness

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
I can't even think of their freaking game name right now

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
but yeah, you can find them on Newgrounds and so on and so forth

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
but, yeah, so there's a few

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
but we definitely need

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
more, I wish we connected with EA

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
because, you know,

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
that would have been great to establish

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
something with them more, but we'll see

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
alright, we'll see, well in the meantime let's get

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
to the phones because they are ringing, hi you're on Orange

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Launch Radio, who's this?

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Hey what's up guys, this is Kaijuto

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Hey Kaijuto, what's on your mind buddy?

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
I got some game recommendations for you

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
First off, I just want to say that

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
I've been playing the

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Rumble, what is it, Rumble in

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
the Rocket League

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
that thing is great, I don't know if you guys tried that

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
I haven't, I've heard about, God, the

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Rocket League, they have really done a great job

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Just continuing moving that game forward

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
ever since its original release, I need to check

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
that out

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
There is some trouble in paradise with that game

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
because now the fans

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
are pissed off because they decided to go

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
with the whole

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
you got unlockables, but you have a

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
crate that you have to open and you have to buy

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
keys to open that crate

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Oh, pissed off

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
because they're claiming that they need the money

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
because they want to make it into an esport

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
but fans are not buying that

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
They're like pissed off

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
There's some real Rocket League hate going on right now

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
A lot of fans got that free

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
from Playstation Plus

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
but then again, Playstation Plus not really free

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
so, alright

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Nothing ever is

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
My game recommendations

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
going to the Star Trek, the 50th

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
anniversary thing

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
I found this game, I think it just came out a couple

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
of days ago, it's called

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Halcyon 6

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
and that game

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
is so much fun, it's fantastic

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
You got to think of

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
that game that came out for the

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
tablet, Trexels

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
remember that game?

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
It was like a

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
remake of some other game, Pixels

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
or some crap

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Think of that game as

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Trexels, but a lot better, it has a story

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
there's humor in there

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
there's base building, if you're the type of person

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
you're all into that base building that they did

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
with XCOM and that type of stuff

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
they have that in there, they have away missions

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
you can send your away team out there to have

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
battles, for all you Final Fantasy

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
fans, it has the whole

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
type of turn-based system that

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Final Fantasy kind of invented

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
where you have your three party

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
members and then you fight either

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
three monsters or two monsters

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
they have that in there, it's all turn-based

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
it's a lot of fun, it's 2D, it's not

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
3D, but

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
there aren't any type of platforming

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
that type of crap, you don't have to run and jump on

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
stuff, you're basically

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
trying to battle

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Is it space sci-fi, which is why you're tying this to

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Star Trek?

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
No, it's basically a Star Trek, because you have

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
your science officer, you have your captain

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
your communications officer, they have the

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
different colored suits

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
you have spaceships that you're flying

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
it's Star Trek

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Alright, I gotcha

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
that's a good recommendation

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
This is on Steam by the way

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
and the second game is a matter of murder

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
which I think is like

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
$2.99, really affordable game

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
and if you love the game Clue

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
you're gonna love this game because

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
it's basically Clue

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
it has endless replayability because

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
every time you play you can generate a new

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
mystery, and it plays

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
just like Clue, they have the mansion

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
you gotta investigate, you gotta find

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
the weapon, find the suspect, find the motive

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
and then when you think you have

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
all that together

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
then you go into the accusation phase and then you have

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
all the characters, they all come together in one room

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
and then you have to

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
retell what happened, like who committed

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
the murder and why and all that stuff and if you got it

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
right, then you get rewarded for it

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
it's a really fun game, it has some

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
really shitty art

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
but it makes it funny

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
it looks like a three year old

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
kid drew the game, but that's part of the trauma

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
I love it

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
and the thing with the body

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
it's hilarious because they don't show

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
the entire body, you just see

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
the feet

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
the tasteful dead person

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
just the legs sticking out from under the carpet

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
yeah, yeah

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
and the game makes fun of itself because when you do the

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
tutorial

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
I guess it's the maid or something

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
she's like, what are you freaking out about?

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
it's just a body, that seems to happen a lot in this place

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
right away

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
you're gonna be solving multiple murders

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
just people being killed in that house

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
so it doesn't have the board game element still

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
where you roll a die to move around

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
there's no dice

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
it's almost like a point and click

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
you're clicking the characters

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
you're talking to them

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
but the writing is done so well

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
that you actually get involved

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
they'll tell you stuff

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
if you ask a guy a question

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
he's nervously stroking his moustache

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
to give you little hints that he may be lying

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
it's a really cool deductive game

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
because what I found out is when I played the game

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
I was doing the tutorial

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
and the guy was like

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
I was in the pool room with so and so

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
we were playing pool, so I went to the pool room

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
and there was a guy in there and he confirmed

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
his story that his alibi was legit

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
because they were both playing pool

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
but then you speak to another guy

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
and that person's like, yeah, I was playing pool too

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
and I'm like, no, you weren't playing

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
it was just these two guys in there

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
so that's how I knew that they were the murderer

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
just cool stuff like that

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
alright, so Matter of Murder

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
I gotta check that out on Steam, so three bucks

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
alright, very cool

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
thanks, the one thing I'm ready to buy

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
alright, Kaishudo, thanks for the call

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
alright, later

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
have a good one, bye

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
alright

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
we have the phones ringing, so let's get to another call

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio, who's this?

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
hey guys, it's Jason

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
what up?

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
I am currently barreling down the east side of the Rockies

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
which is why your voice was missed

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
from the intro this evening

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
as you're in your car, zooming down a mountain

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
that is responsibly

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
responsibly, I am answering both hands around the wheel

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
I promise, alright, fair enough, fair enough

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
what's on your mind?

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
even if my car is magical enough that I technically don't have to

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
I still do have both hands on the wheel

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
you guys have brought up a couple of cons

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
con things and VR things

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
and so I just kind of wanted to chime in with my two cents

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
of the last couple of weeks

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
while you were down at Dragon Con

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
I was quite literally in the opposite end of the US

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
at PAX West

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
oh yes, the other thing that happened over Labor Day

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
how was it?

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
the other four days of madness

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
this was my first West

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
as many of you know, it's been called Prime

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
up until this year and now they're calling it West

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
for consistency

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
between East, West and South

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
my first West, my second PAX

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
I went to PAX South at the start of this year

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
it was definitely a lot more hectic

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
but at the same time

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
a lot bigger

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
a lot more events

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
still very social

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
largely to do with the fact of the

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
more and more people I'm meeting

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
in various communities

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Twitch spearheaded or not, but a number of those people

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
are also involved with the games

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
with the larger gaming community

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
business wise

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
so it just kind of steamrolls from there

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
the show floor

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
itself was nice and big

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
very tiring

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
everybody had their space

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
you see all the

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Twitch and their mammoth

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
streaming center and partner center

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Intel, Blizzard

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
even

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
Tiny Build had a

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
shockingly good presence

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
considering their up and up over the last couple of years

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
but a lot of familiar faces

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
but still a bunch of hidden gems

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
and the Indie Mega Booth

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
Mega Box I think it technically is

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
and then various other locations

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
tying specifically to the show

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
there were two things that you guys have touched on

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
that I wanted to bring up

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
I don't know exactly who

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
the individuals are, but with the story

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
about Interplay going under

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
and selling off IPs

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
the founding members

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
the founding creators

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
of Descent have already moved on

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
from Interplay and they were

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
exhibiting their own game called

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Overload in VR

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
at PAX West

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
I don't think it was ever really covered on the show

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
before, but they had a Kickstarter as

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
one does, they're still offering pre-orders

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
that count towards stretch goals

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
but they have very

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
significant plans

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
a very great Vive

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
backed demonstration of

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
what Overload is

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
going to do and it is

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
six degrees of freedom

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
multiplayer, robot

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
zero gravity

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
dogfighting

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
I unfortunately didn't really feel like queuing up

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
in the line, but watching it was

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
absolutely spectacular

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
and I absolutely am looking forward to another

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Descent game as well

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
yeah, you're not the first one to say that logically

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
those guys should be the ones that

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
try to bid for that Descent

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
IP, whether they have the money to do so or not

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
we'll see, but

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
yeah, it would make a lot of sense

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
that they should probably try to make a play for it

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
that would be quite a stretch goal

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
fund our

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
IP acquisition attempt

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
well, you never know

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
there might be a magical publisher out there

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
who's willing to marry the two together

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
like will front the money

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
for this if

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
that would be

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
one of the better

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
stories, like one of the most

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
monumental stories that I've heard in the last

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
jeez, decade I guess, I don't know

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
if you guys

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
want to look up more information, media

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
and all that stuff, playoverload.com

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
plenty

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
plenty of media there to go up, screenshots

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
screenshots, a little bit of gameplay video

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
demonstration of what it does in and out

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
of VR and then the common

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
game's gonna have multiplayer and

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
epic robot battles

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
and huge boss battles, etc.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
VR

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
more generally

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
I, prior to PAX West

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
I had only ever used

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Oculus Dead Kit 1

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
I never, I didn't queue up at

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
E3 for

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
VR, I haven't seen HoloLens

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
and I haven't

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
bumped anybody nearby to see

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
their Vive or anything of the sort

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
up on the sixth floor, which is

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
where a lot of

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
indie, both publishers

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
and developers were exhibiting

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
there was a little corner for

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
University of Washington, UW I think

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
it was, their game development

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
program, I got

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
talking to a couple of people because they just had

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
a free throw

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
a three point shootout simulator game

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
and that was my first experience

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
using the Vive and it was

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
it was

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Loki was talking earlier about how

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
everything with a big name attached to

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
is an experience and so it's

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
kind of less interesting

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
but this game, like I said

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
free throw or three point shootout

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
I'm not quite sure where on the line it was

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
but it was a basketball simulator running

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Vive called Nothing But Net

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
or Nothing But Net

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
and

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
it was, I

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
hadn't actually really paid attention to the

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
controllers yet, but to extend those

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
as your hands and use it for

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
just simple

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
ball grabbing, basketball

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
grabbing, not that other

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
kind, basketball grabbing

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
oh my

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
basketball

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
grabbing, flick and release and

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
the world that they created

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
which was just like a high school

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
gym, fairly nondescript

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
but it still felt very good to be in it

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
it was a very limited

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
demo, you just had

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
60 or 90 seconds to

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
shoot

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
to make shots

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
and

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
but it was fun, it was cute

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
it reminded me

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
both of you

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
possibly all three of you have talked about

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
video game renaissance and

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
I have played basketball in real life

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
I played for a season in elementary

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
school

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
basketball has obviously

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
been a part of American media forever

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
and I played some basketball

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
games on and off, it's never been my primary sport

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
but it was still fun

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
when talking

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
to the developers of this Nothing But Net game

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
I was talking to them about

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
this very, very basic

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
arcadey

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
three point shootout game for DOS

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
called Three Point Shootout

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
and to see

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
the progression of gaming all

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
over again to take

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
basic concepts to introduce

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
developers, players and everybody else

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
to how these

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
things actually work out in 3D and finally

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
being able to put

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
full body motion

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
into this kind of thing

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
it really tickled me in a really

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
really happy way and that was

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
definitely one of my

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
underrated gems of the show

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
that I just enjoyed

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
I just kind of hovered around listening to

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
conversations, I had a great conversation with

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
the husband and wife

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
development pair

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
talked about some of their plans

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
what they could do, gave them reference

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
to prior art and plenty of things

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
the demo was

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
just a single round of shots, they talked about

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
a lot of other things like horse

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
and multiplayer and

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
MMO-esque simulation

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
because it is a gem with multiple hoops and maybe

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
maybe even going on into

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
like a two on two NBA Jam style

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
thing maybe

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
but it was fun, it was simple

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
it was conventional and it hit all of

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
the spots to be able to take

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
a basic

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
concept and apply it into the VR

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
world in such a

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
simple but

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
excellent way

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
so it sounds like you had a pretty

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
successful PAX West

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
it's no longer PAX Prime

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
I heard that's

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
because PAX East is the real PAX Prime at

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
this point but I won't go there

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
how were the panels, did you go any panels

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
any of that stuff? I did zero

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
panels, I was

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
incredibly line averse so

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
the guide book was

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
a map reference for me and I

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
just didn't pay attention to any of the panels

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
which is a little weird

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
for me I guess, sort of, but I don't know

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
I was there for the people

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
I was there for the people and friends first

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
that I don't get to see in person nearly enough

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
and in between

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
that I made my own adventure across

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
the show floor

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
very quickly I guess one of my

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
other underrated ones that I haven't even

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
been thinking about, talking about

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
for some stupid reason

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
if anybody knows the

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
old Neo Geo game

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
Windjammers, one of the

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
multi game, multi game arcade machines

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
we saw in

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
mini golf and bowling alleys and all those

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
kinds of things, that game is

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
coming back to PC and

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
PS4 in the form

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
of a disc jam by people who

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
also grew up with the game and loved it

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
and are turning it into

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
a little

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
steep down

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
pong that I break up a little bit

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
yeah you're breaking up a little bit but you're back now

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
that sounds

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
disc jam

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
already in some gamers hands

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
PC and PS4

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
Windjammers-esque with an updated

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
look and feel and

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
that was quite a treat to be able

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
to talk to other fans that

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
finally did something with the game and moved into it

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
and yeah

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
alright, very cool, alright well sounds like you had a

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
good time, TwitchCon are you doing that

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
in a few weeks, isn't that the same weekend

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
as GamerX right I heard?

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
it is the last, it's like September 30th

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
into the start of October

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
same weekend as

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
GamerX, that's some unfortunate timing

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
I

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
am

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
I should be doing TwitchCon, I am

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
tentatively doing it, I'm

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
actually, I wasn't supposed to be heading home

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
I was supposed to still be along

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
the Pacific Coast, quite possibly in the

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
studio

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
next weekend, but I had

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
a little home incident occur

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
so that's why I am currently barreling down

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
the east side of the Rockies

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
I hope everything's okay, so

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
alright, well I'm gonna go ahead and let you go, okay?

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
Sounds good, have a good night!

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
Alright, thanks for calling, take care

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
Alright,

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
Looking quickly, some chat comments

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
Kajuda says, OMG, Twitch has a con too?

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
What do they all do, meet up on

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
Skype and stream? No, I

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
went last year, actually because of Jason

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
Jason was like, I have an extra ticket, are you

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
sure you don't want to go? Because in San Francisco

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
it would be very easy for you to go, so I was like

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
sure I'll go, I thought it was interesting

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
I actually, I left a little

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
more motivated to do more streaming, which

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
has been hit and miss, some weeks

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
I'm able to do a bunch, I probably haven't done

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
one in a month, just because, you know, I

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
am doing four podcasts on

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
and off, so it's kind of like a lot of my creative energy

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
time goes into that, so

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
alright, let's try to sneak in at least one more quick call here

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
before we call it a night, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
Hey, this is Akdeft

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
Hi Akdeft, how are you?

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
Really great, really great

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
What's on your mind?

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
Well, anyways, I want to talk about

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
the Super Mario

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
Run announcement

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
What do you think?

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
Well, basically, it's

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
not something that

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
necessarily

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
is

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
well, I had the idea

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
in my head, and

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
I kind of

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
missed my train of thought

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
but basically

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
what they're trying to do, or I think

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
what they're trying to do is basically

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
like, cross-promotion

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
of some sort

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
because they're not

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
and this is something I was talking

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
with other friends

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
they're not offering the full game

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
right now, it's

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
even if you see like

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
Super Mario Run as a full game

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
it kind of isn't because

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
it isn't like the full Super Mario

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
experience

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
and we can see it like

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
in stuff like Super Mario Maker or

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
New Super Mario Bros

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
and all that stuff

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
but something that was curious

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
and this relates also to

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Pokémon GO

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
that the 3DS sales

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
went up

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
I think for July, and I don't think

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
for August, I don't know

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
but many people

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
pre-ordered in expectation

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
of Pokémon Sun and Moon

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
so I'm

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
trying to guess

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
here that basically they

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
did this

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
maybe because they want part of the

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
mobile market, maybe that's something

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
like

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
secondary

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
but I think

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
they're trying to like

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
promote their own stuff through

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
other media

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
I don't know if that makes sense

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
You know, that's something that I

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
this is Gabriel, good to meet you man

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
this is

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
something that I was mentioning

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
earlier with my little

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
speculation

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
about the NX

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
and me getting the

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
impression that

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
that's what I think Nintendo's trying to do

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
I think them releasing

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
this Mario game

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
on iOS is a hint

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
of what's coming for NX

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
to an extent, that's just my impression

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
of it, so I

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
I really just need them to fucking reveal the

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
NX already, get this fucking time

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
Tokyo Game Show is in two

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
weeks, I'm sick of the speculation

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
all this wank

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
you know I love that word

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
all this Twitter wank

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
granted, we've been no help either

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
we have the wank and the tinfoil hats on this show

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
as well, I'm fucking sick of it

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
it's after labor day

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
no more white shoes

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
and a goddamn NX announcement

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
let's do it

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
Hey Act, can I ask

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
that's just

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
by the word of Rob

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
can I ask you something really quick because you mentioned

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
something that I found

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
very intriguing

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000
as a

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
mobile, you play games on mobile

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
I take it

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
right? Yeah. Okay. Do you

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
feel that

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
as a mobile gamer

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
the price

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
that you pay

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
do you feel it's fair to say that

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
one should still expect

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000
the full game experience

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
on mobile

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
or should it really just be

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
are you really just paying for something

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
that's going to be a quick

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
time consuming thing and then we move on

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
I mean do you fully expect

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
do you fully expect the full

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
video game experience on a mobile, should you

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
expect that on a mobile phone?

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
I think we

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
should expect something like that

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
it's not

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
it's not necessarily like

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
exclusive to a console

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
or in this case to a mobile game

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
but I think

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
my point is

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
because we have seen runners

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
in consoles

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
we have the bit trip

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
runner series

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
like for example

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
maybe even Rayman

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
I don't consider it a runner

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
but they do have mobile

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
versions that pretty much are runners

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
right

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
but my point was

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
you don't get the full

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
experience

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
as in you only go

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
right instead of going

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
left to

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
you don't have full control over Mario

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
in this case

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
where in a console

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
in even a portable version

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
of Mario you have full control

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
of what you can

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
what Mario does

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
in the game

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
so I

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
I don't see like

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
Super Mario Run like a bad thing

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
at all

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
it seems interesting enough

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
but yeah

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
I don't think Nintendo is

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
putting all the

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
all their money into the mobile market

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
at least just yet

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000
and at one point it's exactly

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
the next part

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
or point of this

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
yeah there's got to be a correlation

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
somehow and there was a comment in the chat

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000
that I just seen when they

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
I didn't see who it was that mentioned

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
was the NX going to be running Android

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
hardware they were going to be using

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
a processor

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
chip that

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
can that fuels Android

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
but not necessarily

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
that doesn't necessarily mean you know it's going to be

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
an Android based thing it's just a processor

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
I can't remember what it was called

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
similar parts but not necessarily how they function

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
right like a Tegra or something like that

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
it's like a Tegra processor

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
but for me I think

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
this is a way for Nintendo to be making money

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
this holiday season when

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
the Wii U is not going to be expected to

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000
really do anything I think this is something

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
Nintendo is under a lot of pressure to do

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
and I think again that's why you see them

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
coming up with all these other creative ways to make money

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000
this holiday to keep their investors

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000
happy is oh we have the classic NES

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
which we know stands to do well oh we have the

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000
Pokemon Go bracelet oh we have

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000
you know the mobile venture

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
you know we're going to put our biggest thing

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000
on mobile so maybe this is why

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000
they bumped Mario up to this year

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000
was to kind of show that they're

03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000
going to still be productive through this holiday

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
so maybe even if the

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000
NX tanks which you know

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000
I don't want to see that happen I don't think

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
any gaming fan would want that

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000
although I just want to know what the fuck it is already

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000
I think

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
you know Nintendo can show that they as a company

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000
could still stay afloat no matter what

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000
definitely so anyway

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000
I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000
but thanks for the call and for the insight

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000
hey thanks for having me

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000
alright that's going to do it for the

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000
skype line tonight but if you didn't get through tonight

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000
do consider sending us an email for a future week

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
alright

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000
now before we wrap up the show

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000
and say our good nights we have to make sure

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000
that we get any residual angst

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
out of our system so that we can successfully

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
start a new week

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000
nice and fresh and on a clean

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
slate so we empty

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000
and reset our pallets with a segment we call

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000
here the FUs of the week

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000
music

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000
music

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000
music

low key your FUs of the week

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000
I don't know I just have to be

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000
myself for being 10 seconds

03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000
too early

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000
music

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000
there's so many jokes

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000
I can make with that but I'm

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000
going to be a nice person

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000
and not make them

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000
alright

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000
10 seconds too early is not a bad thing

03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000
well

03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000
depends on the end goal

03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000
but yes

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000
Gabe do you have any FUs you need to get out of your system

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
a special thanks you need to give tonight

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000
ah

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000
no not necessarily I let it out

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000
I pretty much let it out earlier

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
yeah enough I can't really

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
think of anything right now so just you know

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000
thanks for everything though guys

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000
my FUs of the week goes to

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000
fucking food poisoning

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000
here's the fucking week I had

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000
you ready for this? alright so I get back from

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000
Dragon Con which was awesome no complaints

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000
there so I get back and of course

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
I get sick from the plane or something

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000
cause Bobby's like I'm not sick and nobody else I know

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000
at Dragon Con was sick so I got something on the plane

03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000
at the airport or something so I'm sick

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000
and I'm like out of work

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000
Tuesday and Wednesday I usually take the day after

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
anyway just as like a

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000

luckily my boss is pretty understanding she's great

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
like an asshole doing it you know like

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000
like stomach sick

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000
I'll spare you the horror story

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000
but it was not a pretty 24 hours

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000

food poisoning that's how it's gonna be

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000
here on out

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000
alright well that brings us

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
to the end of another episode of Orange on Trader

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000
actually quickly I should check in with Loki for any

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
last minute stories I forgot to do that earlier

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000
there's a remastering

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000
of Duke Nukem 3D it's coming out

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000
Duke Nukem World Tour it's gonna have also new levels

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000
awesome

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
Duke Nukem

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
I mean it would be what

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000
the fourth time I bought a reimagining

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000
of Duke Nukem but oh well

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000
you can't really remaster the game too much

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
I mean it's

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
clearly they can't make a new one so

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000
might as well keep doing what works

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000
alright

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000
well that is going to

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
bring us to the end of another episode of Orange

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000

awesome I try to get more involved with panels and stuff

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000

other things you gotta do but you definitely

03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.000

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000
most welcome

03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:13.000
Loki my friend that's it we made it

03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000
to the end of an episode here it's not

03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:17.000
longer episode but a good one uh any

03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000
final thoughts for our listeners tonight I'm just tired

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000
now yeah I'm depressed

03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:23.000
tired of eBay it'll be okay

03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:25.000
well happy birthday though you know what we have some

03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000
awesome some listeners were saying we should you know what we

03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:29.000
should all put 25 bucks in and help

03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000
Loki get the damn DDR machine that's

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000
not the thing that's why it was such a disappointment

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.000
because those those cabinets and granted

03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.000
it was slightly broken I would have needed to

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.000
you know fix up some stuff but that's

03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:41.000
fine I mean like a new cabinet

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000
goes for over a thousand dollars it's

03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:45.000
like yeah that's why it stings so bad

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:47.000
because it's it's like that's

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000
actually more cost effective to do it that way

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:51.000
than it would have been to build pads

03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:53.000
I got build pads but now you're reminding

03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:55.000
me like oh you know if I you know now

03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:57.000
that I'm not upgrading my phone this year

03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000
now that it looks like I'm probably not going to get the PlayStation

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000
4 Pro and I may not even get the VR

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000
at this point we'll see I'm kind of on the fence with that

03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:05.000
maybe this is the year Rob's finally

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:07.000
going to get his cocktail cabinet because I really I really

03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:09.000
kind of want one I was gonna say you practically have the

03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:11.000
money for that for a cocktail cabinet now

03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000
if you don't get those two things yeah I know you've got the

03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:15.000
money for that now only only if

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000
get it on Amazon you can pre-order it and then

03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000
part of me is like you should save that money to

03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000
do responsible things like home buying

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000
oh come on who needs adulthood we need

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000
cocktail tables come on man

03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:27.000
priorities exactly what future you got

03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000
a bar top that I built oh

03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:31.000
well there you go you're halfway there man I know I

03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:33.000
know all right

03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:35.000
my final thought tonight I

03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000
I can't think of an awful lot I'm just gonna say

03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:39.000
I'm gonna I'm gonna try to play

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000
more Overwatch which will make Alan very

03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:43.000
happy because Alan plays a fucking ton of

03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000
Overwatch I think it's like all he

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:47.000
ever he plays that and then I'll see him play No Man's

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:49.000
Sky a little bit and he's back to playing Overwatch

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000
he plays a lot of fucking Overwatch and he has like

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:53.000
like bro friends he made playing

03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.000
Overwatch and everything that he

03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.000
gets on there and he bro chats

03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.000
about how you know there's a reaper back

03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.000
behind the thing I just I'm like wow he's

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:03.000
like really really good and when I

03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.000
play with him I'm fucking terrible so

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.000
I need to up a game

03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:09.000
on Overwatch so I might be working on

03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:11.000
that this week or I might play

03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:13.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 to keep Loki happy

03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:15.000
and after all it is his birthday

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:17.000
yes I hope you

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:19.000
had a good birthday all things considered

03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.000
Loki indeed if not maybe maybe

03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000
this week will be good too

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.000
I have to go back to the call center

03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:27.000
in a few weeks so that's not making me too happy

03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:29.000
well enjoy the few weeks that you know you don't have to

03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:31.000
be there so it's like here's how

03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:33.000
frustrating it is yes we would love

03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:35.000
to hire you for this department

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000
but because of some corporate

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.000
tree bullshit we've got

03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000
to not hire people even though

03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000
up person thinks it's a good

03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000
idea not to spend money of course

03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:49.000
unlike corporate

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:51.000
America which is also what your wife

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:53.000
says it's a good idea not to spend money right

03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:55.000
and she says that about everything

03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.000
we can have like billions of dollars

03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:59.000
like don't spend any of it it's like

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.000
