[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

01:12.182 --> 01:14.984
[SPEAKER_00]: My kind of people and assholes.

01:15.744 --> 01:16.084
[SPEAKER_00]: One.

[SPEAKER_00]: One.

[SPEAKER_01]: That's Dr. Evil's cat.

01:24.510 --> 01:25.131
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you tell?

01:25.471 --> 01:26.592
[SPEAKER_03]: I never forget a pussy.

01:27.907 --> 01:30.229
[SPEAKER_03]: 37.

01:28.408 --> 01:30.229
[SPEAKER_03]: My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks.

01:30.529 --> 01:31.029
[SPEAKER_03]: In a row?

01:31.830 --> 01:33.451
[SPEAKER_02]: And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:33.591 --> 01:35.232
[SPEAKER_03]: You are the weakest link to fight.

01:35.372 --> 01:37.193
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get nothing.

01:37.733 --> 01:38.454
[SPEAKER_03]: You lose.

01:39.234 --> 01:40.275
[SPEAKER_03]: Good day, sir.

01:40.455 --> 01:45.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

01:45.618 --> 01:52.502

[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.173
[SPEAKER_09]: 10.5 was the one at Golfland.

02:29.333 --> 02:29.813
[SPEAKER_09]: That wasn't really 11.

02:31.814 --> 02:37.819
[SPEAKER_09]: And then 11 was the week that Jamie came back and 12 was... Well, then we're not going to have an episode 13.

02:38.419 --> 02:39.640
[SPEAKER_12]: We're skipping it like hotels do.

02:40.801 --> 02:41.601

[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, don't forget about Harvey.

03:05.649 --> 03:08.871
[SPEAKER_12]: He used to know... Your imaginary friend?

03:09.471 --> 03:11.032
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't you see that movie with Harvey?

03:11.352 --> 03:11.613
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

03:12.573 --> 03:16.135
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I have to give a proper hi.

03:16.215 --> 03:18.216
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, give me caffeine and money.

03:18.997 --> 03:19.137

[SPEAKER_09]: You are tuned into the Vamani Scene's most stupendous radio station of all things Vamani.

03:25.118 --> 03:28.000
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a small, intimate house tonight, but we're going to have fun with this anyway.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.722
[SPEAKER_09]: We are joined by a very large panel tonight.

03:31.882 --> 03:32.763
[SPEAKER_09]: A panel of one.

03:32.903 --> 03:33.463
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello.

03:33.564 --> 03:34.564
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

03:34.664 --> 03:35.505
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate nature!

03:35.965 --> 03:38.027
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's just a technical mess-up show.

03:38.047 --> 03:38.507
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate nature!

03:38.927 --> 03:39.848
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish the world would explode!

03:40.088 --> 03:41.149
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I could take over hell!

03:41.929 --> 03:44.391
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really out of it going into tonight's show, by the way.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.493
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello, everybody, to Loki.

03:48.594 --> 03:49.335
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, everybody.

03:51.673 --> 03:52.414
[SPEAKER_12]: Say hi again.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.274
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello again.

03:54.595 --> 03:55.396
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's again?

03:55.496 --> 03:56.457
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we have a doorbell.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.277
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody else is here.

03:57.998 --> 03:58.898
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we'll see who that is.

04:00.059 --> 04:01.000
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be talking to everybody.

04:01.020 --> 04:01.860
[SPEAKER_12]: They better have money.

04:02.781 --> 04:04.462
[SPEAKER_12]: We will take bribes to be on the show.

04:05.623 --> 04:06.424
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

04:06.444 --> 04:08.105
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we just say the hell with Orange Lounge?

04:08.125 --> 04:11.688
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just be two hours of just us just kind of ranting about everything crappy.

04:13.669 --> 04:14.349
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's Dave.

04:14.450 --> 04:18.572
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello everybody to the hell victory of...

04:21.525 --> 04:23.407
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

04:23.427 --> 04:26.390
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be talking to everybody a little more a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

04:27.131 --> 04:28.252
[SPEAKER_12]: So that people can go pee.

04:29.494 --> 04:30.955
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?

04:32.437 --> 04:33.158
[SPEAKER_12]: What garbage deal.

04:33.658 --> 04:34.079
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.121
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to those FUs of the week.

04:36.161 --> 04:39.264
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to send me your FUs of the week, just join our chat room.

04:39.284 --> 04:42.468
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just going to join any Other Side IRC chat.

04:43.559 --> 04:50.442
[SPEAKER_09]: server, like irc.egheads.org, and you're going to join panel, channel, panel?

04:51.083 --> 04:52.944
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it, I can't do this tonight.

04:53.244 --> 04:53.824
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm faking it.

04:53.864 --> 04:57.706
[SPEAKER_12]: You will join channel, ddr, oh wait, wrong one.

04:58.746 --> 05:00.627
[SPEAKER_09]: See, you can't even do it either.

05:01.568 --> 05:04.069
[SPEAKER_12]: There's somebody else on the hostess show tonight, alright.

05:04.169 --> 05:10.132
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge, O-R-Q-G-I Lounge, there.

05:10.732 --> 05:11.913
[SPEAKER_11]: I get to host the show now.

05:12.414 --> 05:14.175
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you don't do that.

05:14.195 --> 05:16.457
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Channel Pound Orange Lounge, and you can chat to us.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.319

05:19.379 --> 05:19.760
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm there.

05:19.860 --> 05:20.340
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Sky.

05:20.380 --> 05:21.241
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, how are you doing?

05:21.581 --> 05:24.764
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't say much, though, because I'm too busy trying to fuck up this show.

05:25.344 --> 05:27.666
[SPEAKER_09]: So, any other thoughts from anybody else?

05:27.946 --> 05:28.267
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

05:28.947 --> 05:31.189
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody here has a single solitary thought in their head.

05:31.209 --> 05:32.110
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike, big rules.

05:32.770 --> 05:33.431
[SPEAKER_10]: Bangles suck.

05:34.292 --> 05:34.632
[SPEAKER_10]: Football.

05:37.116 --> 05:39.838
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start with some Sana, shall we?

05:40.238 --> 05:40.419
[SPEAKER_04]: Wee!

06:17.133 --> 06:22.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Casting by No one cares to start Can you see me fall apart?

06:22.514 --> 06:26.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you share my frozen memories?

06:26.355 --> 06:28.435
[SPEAKER_04]: Setting down Leaving me alone

07:02.057 --> 07:02.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

09:11.929 --> 09:13.089
[SPEAKER_09]: That was rather abstract.

09:13.129 --> 09:15.190
[SPEAKER_09]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

09:15.490 --> 09:17.070
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even remember if that was the promo.

09:17.090 --> 09:22.171
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody requested a promo that they sent, and I wasn't sure if it was that one or the other one in the directory, so I just played that one.

09:25.212 --> 09:26.852
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of like an abstraction of your voice.

09:26.912 --> 09:27.452
[SPEAKER_09]: It was paint.

09:27.572 --> 09:28.352
[SPEAKER_09]: It was modern art.

09:28.812 --> 09:29.473
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

09:30.173 --> 09:30.713
[SPEAKER_09]: Anywho.

09:31.313 --> 09:32.353
[SPEAKER_12]: I sound cooler than that.

09:33.293 --> 09:33.994
[SPEAKER_09]: That was cool, though.

09:34.014 --> 09:37.434
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like you were swallowing a butterfly.

09:37.634 --> 09:38.434
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge.

09:44.287 --> 09:46.729
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

09:57.731 --> 10:06.813
[SPEAKER_09]: The obvious news about the new mix, the Max USA, is that one of the new licensed songs has been confirmed.

10:07.033 --> 10:12.474
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do know that there will be a song, and I'm trying to pull up the full name of the song here.

10:12.514 --> 10:13.834
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot it off the top of my head.

10:13.894 --> 10:14.274
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

10:14.994 --> 10:15.295
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

10:15.335 --> 10:18.615
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Dark Black Forest Short Trip, and it's by Steve Reiner.

10:19.195 --> 10:21.396
[SPEAKER_09]: And this news was confirmed through his site.

10:21.496 --> 10:25.437
[SPEAKER_09]: He said on his official site, hey, I've got this song going on DDR Max soon.

10:25.497 --> 10:27.397
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it was like a Dutch site, though, so it was more like...

10:28.035 --> 10:35.491
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, oh, oh, it was German, so I was like, ah, we've got, DJ Ranma S, I know, for Winnership, no.

10:38.712 --> 10:41.114
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, that's so, I think it's pretty cool.

10:41.314 --> 10:43.916
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard a little bit of it and the song is really cool.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.879
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to play a demo version of that song for you in a little bit.

10:46.899 --> 10:49.521
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got like a two minute demo mix of that song we're going to play for you.

10:49.841 --> 10:55.485
[SPEAKER_09]: This probably isn't the four minute real media file you've seen floating out the internet elsewhere.

10:55.826 --> 10:58.248
[SPEAKER_09]: This is another take on the song.

10:58.288 --> 11:01.690
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't know which version exactly is going to be in DDR, but we'll see.

11:02.091 --> 11:04.953
[SPEAKER_09]: We do know that this song in one way or another is going to show up in DDR Max.

11:06.795 --> 11:11.260
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry for asking, but when exactly does Max USA get released?

11:11.340 --> 11:24.735
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know I believe the release date tentatively right now is November 5th I had been hearing that it was supposed to be right after Thanksgiving for the first day of the Christmas shopping season

11:25.263 --> 11:27.664
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've heard everything in November.

11:27.724 --> 11:29.564
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I actually pulled up an article here.

11:29.604 --> 11:33.485
[SPEAKER_09]: This comes from SoCalKicks' site, available at SoCalKicks.com.

11:33.825 --> 11:42.207
[SPEAKER_09]: And he actually had a chance to talk with Jason Enos, who is the, if you're online on any of the forums, I'm sure you know him as the Konami of America representative.

11:42.767 --> 11:46.728
[SPEAKER_09]: And they talked about a few couple things about DDR Max USA, including...

11:47.308 --> 11:49.711
[SPEAKER_09]: Foot Ratings will be in DDR Max USA.

11:50.072 --> 11:56.959
[SPEAKER_09]: If you remember one big bitch about DDR Max, the Japanese version when it first came out and hit arcades, that they replaced it with that Groove Radar.

11:57.340 --> 12:04.308
[SPEAKER_09]: And while that radar is cool, it doesn't really tell you how hard a song is on a scale, you know, of the katas and everything, so...

12:06.894 --> 12:20.584
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, the one good thing about the Groove Radar is that it does show you what type of song you're going to play, if you're stronger at doing lots of jumps or if you're stronger at doing running moves.

12:21.325 --> 12:22.626
[SPEAKER_12]: That is one good thing about the Groove Radar.

12:23.006 --> 12:29.351
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can still say, oh, these are the nine-footers, these are the katas I have to pass.

12:29.371 --> 12:31.052
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to make you run all over the place.

12:31.232 --> 12:32.753
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

12:33.414 --> 12:36.276
[SPEAKER_09]: Next thing, it will append with DDRconomics.

12:37.817 --> 12:39.257
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure how this is going to work.

12:39.677 --> 12:50.219
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a hard time fathoming this as being a disc change, just like the kind of disc change you would see when third mix, the Japanese third mix, you could put in second and first mix and play things on the new interface.

12:50.239 --> 12:51.499
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually is possible.

12:51.599 --> 13:05.242
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that is what they're going to do, but it seems kind of... If you think about it... Between a PlayStation 2 game and a PlayStation 1 game, it seems a little... Well, if you think about it this way, all they have to do is actually load the game engine itself into memory and then have it run songs off of the disc.

13:07.569 --> 13:08.730
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, maybe that's what they're going to do.

13:08.750 --> 13:09.490
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be very cool.

13:09.690 --> 13:10.711
[SPEAKER_09]: That was actually something I said.

13:10.751 --> 13:14.672
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember getting on a forum saying, hey, that would be awesome if they could do something like that at Append.

13:14.712 --> 13:20.515
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially, I would have liked to have seen it, not only that, but Konomics append the USA mix, but I guess we'll see.

13:20.715 --> 13:21.435
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a smart move.

13:21.495 --> 13:23.156
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll help them make more money for people who don't have it.

13:23.376 --> 13:29.919
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, they're still keeping some of the same songs on DDR Max USA that they had on Konomics and on DDR USA.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.230
[SPEAKER_09]: Will there be freezeros and edits?

13:35.250 --> 13:35.650
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think so.

13:35.670 --> 13:42.514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if it's based off the Max Japanese, you can do freezes and the Max Japanese editing, so I don't see why I wouldn't be able to do it in the U.S.,

14:01.626 --> 14:08.503
[SPEAKER_10]: And one more thing, it probably won't be like Konomics, but will the edits be able to be played on the machines in the arcade?

14:09.272 --> 14:11.454
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because they're region coded, so it ain't going to work.

14:11.794 --> 14:12.234
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn it.

14:13.095 --> 14:13.936
[SPEAKER_09]: There is one thing, though.

14:13.956 --> 14:16.478
[SPEAKER_09]: Couldn't you take Konomics edits and play them on a Forth Mix machine?

14:16.538 --> 14:17.018
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you couldn't.

14:17.438 --> 14:17.859
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

14:17.879 --> 14:18.139
[SPEAKER_09]: I never tried.

14:18.159 --> 14:25.565
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing that I would think might even be possible, and this is what I'm wondering if anyone's tried with Konomics, there's a little program for people who have a Dex drive.

14:26.465 --> 14:30.448
[SPEAKER_12]: There's basically a Dex editor where you can change the region coding on your memory file.

14:30.529 --> 14:30.969
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't work.

14:31.977 --> 14:34.278
[SPEAKER_11]: Because here's why it doesn't work.

14:35.039 --> 14:40.782
[SPEAKER_11]: You can change, there's two things for edits that, you know, kind of set them out to work in a machine or not.

14:40.842 --> 14:46.865
[SPEAKER_11]: You have region coding, and then you also have, it keeps track of what mix the actual thing was on.

14:46.905 --> 14:55.689
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I took a economics edit and changed it to a Japanese, you know, so it would play, but it didn't work because it still detected that it was made from economics, so it's not going to work.

14:56.490 --> 14:57.830
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm getting close though.

14:57.930 --> 14:58.931
[SPEAKER_11]: I can almost fix it.

14:59.671 --> 15:03.633
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, but if you make edits for 4th Mix, you can play them on Max 2 like that?

15:03.853 --> 15:10.856
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see what's the... Because the Max 2 machine is set up to read files from other versions.

15:11.736 --> 15:18.219
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the same reason like on 5th Mix, when you put in your memory card for data, it'll read it as Max 2 data too.

15:20.259 --> 15:21.620
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll have the new version set up.

15:22.503 --> 15:23.484
[SPEAKER_09]: SoCalKicks wants to make it a point that

15:46.578 --> 15:49.820
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know if a new USA mix is going to come out or not yet.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.280
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still a possibility.

15:52.340 --> 15:56.682
[SPEAKER_09]: There may be a new US mix still, and who knows what's going to happen with the arcade.

15:57.742 --> 15:58.262
[SPEAKER_11]: Way better.

15:58.302 --> 16:03.464
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, freaking Europe is starting to get a lead on us, so we can't have the Europeans beating us.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.004
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

16:05.705 --> 16:08.386
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand a bunch of them aren't really that pleased with your mix, too.

16:10.749 --> 16:14.730
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, they are going to be releasing another mix for Euromix.

16:14.790 --> 16:20.932
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be kind of fixing everything that they don't like about... I wonder if that's going to be really going to happen or not.

16:21.092 --> 16:26.714
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's like, okay, Euromix 2 versus DDR USA.

16:28.575 --> 16:28.995
[SPEAKER_10]: True, true.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.095
[SPEAKER_10]: Real contest there.

16:31.536 --> 16:35.997
[SPEAKER_09]: One more thing we should point out that arise from this interview between SoCalKicks and Jason Enos.

16:36.761 --> 16:43.991
[SPEAKER_09]: It will have licensed tracks from already released Japanese DDR mixes, so there will be some Dance Mania licensed tracks.

16:44.752 --> 16:45.433
[SPEAKER_09]: Which ones?

16:45.993 --> 16:46.354
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know.

16:46.935 --> 16:47.636
[SPEAKER_09]: And which games?

16:47.676 --> 16:47.936
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.861
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would imagine they would be kinds of things you would expect to see in the U.S.

16:52.981 --> 16:57.043
[SPEAKER_09]: Like one that comes to my mind would be Ordinary World.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.883
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not be surprised one bit if that's one of the songs that's going to be in there.

16:59.903 --> 17:02.544
[SPEAKER_12]: I would be perfectly happy if that song didn't make it in because that remix is a travesty.

17:02.684 --> 17:03.004
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

17:03.044 --> 17:07.386
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's a travesty of the original, but it is a kind of popular techno hit here in America.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.506
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not be surprised at all if it turned up.

17:09.766 --> 17:13.468
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of number one on my list for expected Dance Mania licensed songs.

17:13.528 --> 17:14.168
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you that'll be one.

17:14.188 --> 17:17.629
[SPEAKER_09]: Twilight Zone and... Twilight Zone's probably... I bet you that'll happen too.

17:17.649 --> 17:17.709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

17:18.356 --> 17:18.656
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

17:37.925 --> 17:38.807
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sitting here.

17:39.407 --> 17:42.031
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's play this little demo.

17:42.451 --> 17:45.856
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, would you mind giving us a little background on where you found this little clip here?

17:45.916 --> 17:46.557
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only a minute 30.

17:46.717 --> 17:47.899
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard this yet, even.

17:47.939 --> 17:49.901
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, here's what it is.

17:50.061 --> 17:54.888
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically, I found it off of a site that was selling the vinyl version of Dark Black Forest.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.790
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of, it really kind of splits it up a little bit.

17:58.870 --> 18:03.513
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of giving you an idea of what the whole song sounds like because it's like six or seven minutes long.

18:03.933 --> 18:04.993
[SPEAKER_11]: So it cuts it up a little bit.

18:05.013 --> 18:07.895
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are a little bit of spaces where it kind of comes off beat.

18:07.995 --> 18:11.077
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, you kind of get the idea of what it's going to sound like.

18:11.337 --> 18:17.340
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried getting the original version of the MP3, but the stupid site, their shop was down.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.661
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it wouldn't let me buy it.

18:19.081 --> 18:21.422
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would have had it, but it's all their fault.

18:21.522 --> 18:22.143
[SPEAKER_11]: Stupid site.

18:23.572 --> 18:23.892
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

18:23.932 --> 18:24.774
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the demo here.

18:24.814 --> 18:28.964
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Dark Forest on Orange Lounge Radio.

19:09.707 --> 19:11.448
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a long way to go, honey.

19:12.348 --> 19:12.728
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

19:13.709 --> 19:14.489
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm afraid.

19:15.089 --> 19:15.930
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going?

19:18.311 --> 19:20.712
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the dark, black forest.

20:00.481 --> 20:01.062
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that was it.

20:02.163 --> 20:08.388
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of chopped up there, definitely, but somebody in the chat room offered us to send us a longer one, so we'll see if we can get that by the end of the show.

20:08.448 --> 20:10.290
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll play the full five-minute version.

20:10.330 --> 20:13.793
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're desperate for things to do by the end of the show, we'll play that for you at the end.

20:13.833 --> 20:14.314
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that sound?

20:14.793 --> 20:15.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

20:34.897 --> 20:35.957
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god, I hope not either.

20:36.057 --> 20:37.238
[SPEAKER_09]: That interface is ugly.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.581
[SPEAKER_09]: DDRPC's alright and all, I just kind of wish it had better songs.

20:42.621 --> 20:46.384
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be much cooler with it if they'd license some stuff, but, you know, it happens.

20:47.164 --> 20:59.732
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that, you know, it'll really be a good mix compared to most of the other stuff, because, well, first of all, it'll have all the modifiers, like Max and Max 2, and plus, I guess, .5 speed, which'll be fun, new challenging mode.

21:00.212 --> 21:03.194
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wish that they'd put challenge mode back on there, that was the coolest thing.

21:03.959 --> 21:04.399
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, darn.

21:04.460 --> 21:05.461
[SPEAKER_09]: They should put 64 speed.

21:27.765 --> 21:28.145
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be cool.

21:28.165 --> 21:29.086
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, pointless shit like that.

21:29.606 --> 21:37.509
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but, um, I just, I think it'll be pretty good, because DDR KonamiX, as far as actual, that was just as good as Sport Mix, I think.

21:37.529 --> 21:41.051
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, besides not having challenge mode, which I really love.

21:41.411 --> 21:45.793
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I have to ask KonamiUSA, I want my databank.

21:46.954 --> 21:47.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Databank?

21:47.854 --> 21:48.014
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

21:48.354 --> 21:52.736
[SPEAKER_10]: That was cool, but, I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't use it at all.

21:52.916 --> 21:54.357
[SPEAKER_10]: For people like, you know, Loki...

21:55.003 --> 22:03.910
[SPEAKER_10]: Not Oki, Loki, who use lots of edits and stuff, and go to Golfland with their little laptop, Pentium One, and change it all around.

22:04.150 --> 22:07.653
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that'd be cool, but I never look at the databank.

22:07.753 --> 22:11.356
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, maybe once, if I need a little bit of a challenge or something, but no.

22:12.737 --> 22:15.259
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

22:15.520 --> 22:20.203
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, JB says, he wants to point out, My Summer Love is on Disney Mix, and Disney has .5 speed.

22:21.491 --> 22:22.271
[SPEAKER_09]: So something's different.

22:22.291 --> 22:24.572
[SPEAKER_09]: But you notice that Disney Mix looks a lot different also.

22:24.632 --> 22:36.476
[SPEAKER_09]: But Disney Mix already is running at 1.5 speed anyway, so... SoCalKick says he asked Enos about the databank in DDR Max USA, and because of technical difficulties, it ain't gonna happen.

22:38.396 --> 22:39.076
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is a bummer.

22:39.136 --> 22:41.257
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have made a fine addition to economics, for sure.

22:41.697 --> 22:42.957
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would have had my stuff on there.

22:43.618 --> 22:44.018
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.

22:45.225 --> 22:45.986
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the next time.

22:46.627 --> 22:49.150
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Max USA will sell really good and then they'll make another one.

22:49.350 --> 22:50.151
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they can ask me.

22:51.112 --> 22:53.034
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they'll come to you and get a bunch of edits.

22:53.054 --> 22:53.395
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.

22:55.032 --> 23:00.417
[SPEAKER_09]: I would honestly like them to put in a 2DX style expert course.

23:00.437 --> 23:02.419
[SPEAKER_10]: Not do like an Oni, but like an actual expert course.

23:23.556 --> 23:26.538
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a depreciating score bar.

23:27.299 --> 23:30.522
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think they're going to have internet ranking for USA?

23:30.542 --> 23:32.144
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see why they wouldn't.

23:32.184 --> 23:33.485
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be a good move on their part.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.407
[SPEAKER_12]: It would also be advertising for their site, too.

23:35.527 --> 23:35.847
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, yep.

23:37.629 --> 23:39.151
[SPEAKER_09]: The Let Them Move Oni course.

23:40.972 --> 23:45.177
[SPEAKER_12]: If Let Them Move is in that game, then I will commit Strapagoo or something.

23:45.657 --> 23:46.718
[SPEAKER_10]: The Nearly 100 Oni course.

23:48.692 --> 23:49.713
[SPEAKER_10]: All the bad songs.

23:50.073 --> 23:53.154
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, I mean, it could still be good.

23:53.194 --> 23:58.956
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if they actually, you know, surprise us with a good Let Them Move, which, you know, Instant Love would be awesome.

23:59.176 --> 24:02.558
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I don't know if we'll ever, ever see that.

24:02.578 --> 24:04.639
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope we don't see any Let Them Move mixes.

24:05.599 --> 24:07.040
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm DJ Konami.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.181
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have DJ Konami in the chat room right now.

24:11.369 --> 24:12.390
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh.

24:12.550 --> 24:13.551
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll teach you how to play.

24:13.811 --> 24:16.713
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think that we should play that song again sometime during the show.

24:16.733 --> 24:17.214
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we will.

24:17.254 --> 24:18.995
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe before, right before the end of the show.

24:20.957 --> 24:21.578
[SPEAKER_09]: The instant love.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.302
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with ElectroTal in the chat room.

24:26.602 --> 24:32.848
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, I think the non-stops will make it before the Oni courses will, a la Euromix 2, kind of the way they do it.

24:33.308 --> 24:35.871
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can think of it like back to fourth mix type thing.

24:36.131 --> 24:37.212
[SPEAKER_12]: Non-stops were a great idea.

24:37.802 --> 24:42.786
[SPEAKER_11]: It all depends on what interface you're using, because if they're using a Max 2 interface, it's going to be easy to do on eCourses.

24:42.967 --> 24:47.851
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, it'll be harder to program something like just non-stops, you know, into a Max 2 interface.

24:49.394 --> 24:55.055
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it sounds like they're taking a little bit of liberties by changing some things around, especially with this whole foot ranking being in it for sure thing.

24:55.075 --> 24:57.556
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing some changes to a max interface.

24:57.816 --> 24:59.416
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we'll know more once we see screenshots.

24:59.676 --> 25:06.498
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the rumor is that PlayStation Magazine is supposed to have a playable demo this October 8th, I believe, when their new issue comes out.

25:06.558 --> 25:10.859
[SPEAKER_09]: So, very soon now, we're going to be able to see what it looks like.

25:11.079 --> 25:12.219
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be able to see the interface.

25:12.699 --> 25:13.139
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll buy it.

25:13.939 --> 25:14.399
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay!

25:16.320 --> 25:16.480
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

25:18.820 --> 25:24.428
[SPEAKER_12]: Well maybe I can make arrangements to get that magazine when that particular store gets a particular shipment of it.

25:33.863 --> 25:36.144
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's get into the fun part of the show, shall we?

25:36.164 --> 25:39.125
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about our FUs of the week.

25:39.465 --> 25:40.766
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, do I have one or not?

25:40.786 --> 25:41.406
[SPEAKER_12]: Or what?

25:41.446 --> 25:53.550
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've been getting a lot of them from the chat room here, so if you want to submit your FU of the week, just join Channel Pound Orange Lounge on any other site IRC server, like irc.egheads.org.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.951
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the meantime, we're going to start with...

25:56.511 --> 25:57.632
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's FU of the Week.

25:57.672 --> 25:58.773
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to cue her music.

25:58.813 --> 25:59.814
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of slow tonight.

26:00.495 --> 26:02.597
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long day.

26:02.737 --> 26:03.538
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need a nap.

26:03.678 --> 26:04.899
[SPEAKER_09]: I just need a vacation.

26:07.321 --> 26:11.105
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, my FU of the Week goes for tonight.

26:11.185 --> 26:12.206
[SPEAKER_12]: Halfway hate to say it.

26:12.796 --> 26:15.377
[SPEAKER_12]: Roseville, Gothland.

26:15.897 --> 26:17.778
[SPEAKER_12]: And this isn't because of the machines.

26:17.798 --> 26:19.679
[SPEAKER_12]: This has to do with unprofessionalism.

26:20.359 --> 26:21.819
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to know about unprofessionalism?

26:21.899 --> 26:23.500
[SPEAKER_12]: I will tell about unprofessionalism.

26:24.160 --> 26:29.362
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're sending, I've sent close to nine emails and have had replies.

26:31.203 --> 26:41.287
[SPEAKER_12]: When you try to set up a meeting with somebody to arrange, you're running a tournament that's going to be bringing in money for them and they don't even care enough about it to reply to you.

26:42.592 --> 26:51.119
[SPEAKER_12]: or, when you request a Saturday, in the interest of having a large crowd, and they go, no, we won't have a Saturday, good luck with Scandia.

26:52.100 --> 26:57.124
[SPEAKER_12]: Little do they know, we've already got approval with Scandia, so they can just go, you know, fall into the creek for all I care.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.426
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they actually say that to you?

26:58.566 --> 26:59.366
[SPEAKER_12]: Good luck with Scandia?

26:59.406 --> 27:00.567
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the email I got.

27:00.587 --> 27:01.889
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, I didn't know that.

27:01.949 --> 27:05.732
[SPEAKER_12]: It said, I refuse to rent Saturday, good luck with Scandia.

27:07.404 --> 27:09.445
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's business we'll be taking from them that day.

27:09.745 --> 27:13.346
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, do you want to say anything about the new tournament?

27:13.366 --> 27:17.248
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the tournament's details haven't been finalized, but we'll say that for a future show.

27:17.488 --> 27:19.008
[SPEAKER_12]: Not for a future show, but I'll say something about it later.

27:19.028 --> 27:21.069
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not part of my fuck you of the week because it's a pleasant thing.

27:21.169 --> 27:21.809
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, that's pleasant.

27:21.829 --> 27:22.129
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

27:22.589 --> 27:23.890
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, this is all about fuck you's right now.

27:24.710 --> 27:28.791
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of size, Scandia's not as good, but Roseville Golf Land...

27:31.058 --> 27:37.815
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, last time I went there, both Drum Mania and Keyboard Mania were broken, and it's always crowded with tons of little kids, and it's dark.

27:38.519 --> 27:40.000
[SPEAKER_10]: and, you know, bad stuff.

27:40.020 --> 27:44.244
[SPEAKER_10]: Scandia, very nice people, good tech, and everything is cool.

27:45.045 --> 27:48.387
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to try and keep this somewhat appealing to everybody out there, by the way.

27:48.407 --> 27:56.814
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want to talk about Sacramento politics all day, but... Well, where Roosevelt often does have more machines, the better quality arcade is Scandia.

27:57.555 --> 28:03.900
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm honestly even thinking about putting up the suggestion to everybody to change the Wednesday night location for the local meetings, too.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.461
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting idea.

28:05.601 --> 28:05.962
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

28:08.523 --> 28:09.743
[SPEAKER_09]: You have your own Fuck You of the Week.

28:10.524 --> 28:12.924
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, hold on, I gotta load your song.

28:13.865 --> 28:14.965
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so out of it this week.

28:16.225 --> 28:17.666
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go ahead and start with your Fuck You of the Week.

28:17.706 --> 28:18.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Your song will kick in pretty soon.

28:18.886 --> 28:21.547
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like I said, it's better to be out of it than to have your foot stuck in it.

28:23.807 --> 28:29.589
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so my Fuck You of the Week goes to these really crappy winter movies that they're releasing right now.

28:30.609 --> 28:33.210
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell are they thinking with, like, Fear.com.com?

28:34.898 --> 28:37.599
[SPEAKER_11]: and all these other stupid movies.

28:37.619 --> 28:39.840
[SPEAKER_11]: Like today I saw Ballistic, X vs. Sever.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.861
[SPEAKER_11]: That has to be one of the most pointless movies I've seen in a long time.

28:43.542 --> 28:51.025
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it had probably one of the slowest motorcycle chasings I've ever seen going a whopping 30 miles an hour through city streets.

28:51.745 --> 28:55.286
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just completely pointless and I lost interest about halfway through it.

28:55.326 --> 28:57.447
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was a free movie, so yay.

28:57.587 --> 28:58.468
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to... Wait.

29:06.052 --> 29:08.534
[SPEAKER_10]: Just start with your FU, I'll give you a background song as soon as I can get through it.

29:08.554 --> 29:16.240
[SPEAKER_10]: My fuck you is towards the 49ers, because they suck, and they beat Shane Matthews and the Redskins, and they are the best.

29:16.660 --> 29:17.481
[SPEAKER_10]: Go Redskins!

29:17.821 --> 29:19.862
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

29:20.003 --> 29:20.583
[SPEAKER_10]: 49ers suck.

29:21.203 --> 29:22.504
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you, Jeff Garcia.

29:22.805 --> 29:23.585
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're listening.

29:25.146 --> 29:28.089
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's my fuck you, football related.

29:30.740 --> 29:31.541
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't fuck you.

29:31.801 --> 29:32.141
[SPEAKER_10]: You do?

29:32.301 --> 29:32.641
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

29:33.342 --> 29:35.963
[SPEAKER_12]: You can leave Dave's music because it's happy.

29:36.223 --> 29:40.005
[SPEAKER_12]: My fuck you is not really directed toward anybody, it's toward the situation.

29:40.646 --> 29:46.609
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel sorry for everybody with long distance relationships because I was away from my Dan for a whole five days and it sucked.

29:47.470 --> 29:49.451
[SPEAKER_12]: It sucked, it sucked, it sucked, it sucked.

29:49.551 --> 29:51.812
[SPEAKER_12]: So fuck whatever he went to.

29:52.052 --> 29:53.213
[SPEAKER_12]: Except that I got free stuff on there.

29:54.192 --> 29:55.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Free Xbox out of it.

29:56.096 --> 29:57.659
[SPEAKER_12]: And free games.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.024
[SPEAKER_12]: Tons of t-shirts and a Capcom backpack.

30:01.788 --> 30:03.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my FU's... I have an FU of the week.

30:05.069 --> 30:06.750
[SPEAKER_09]: F Microsoft, where's my free Xbox?

30:07.190 --> 30:07.890
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, I'm done.

30:09.611 --> 30:11.611
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have an F you, but this is something else.

30:11.972 --> 30:15.433
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to congratulate the makers of Duck Tape.

30:15.693 --> 30:18.754
[SPEAKER_11]: They've saved my life on numerous occasions, and it rocks.

30:18.834 --> 30:24.996
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they fixed my car with Duck Tape, and they fixed my pads with Duck Tape, so hooray for Duck Tape.

30:25.737 --> 30:26.317
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

30:26.877 --> 30:27.817
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray for Duck Tape.

30:27.837 --> 30:29.258
[SPEAKER_12]: Duck Tape has multiple uses.

30:29.918 --> 30:31.779
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you know, taping small children in the fun.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.161
[SPEAKER_12]: and holding together computers.

30:34.241 --> 30:35.723
[SPEAKER_12]: Or taping two people's buns together.

30:44.803 --> 30:48.665
[SPEAKER_04]: How appropriate I'm playing Drop the Bomb.

30:49.305 --> 31:02.090
[SPEAKER_12]: On behalf of one of my friends who may or may not be listening, she would regale us with a tale of how at the Mississippi School of Math and Science they would hold together the school computer with duct tape and chicken wire.

31:02.770 --> 31:05.111
[SPEAKER_12]: And it worked until the duct tape fell off.

31:05.211 --> 31:08.553
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, the duct tape didn't fall off, but I understand it was removed and the whole thing fell apart.

31:10.864 --> 31:11.765
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have another bitch.

31:12.045 --> 31:17.229
[SPEAKER_09]: Now JB in the chatroom, he's bragging that he got a free Xbox as well through some other means.

31:17.489 --> 31:19.750
[SPEAKER_09]: Did anybody around here not get a free Xbox?

31:20.091 --> 31:27.536
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I realize they're going to have to give that system away to get people to play it, but, I mean, honestly, where's my free Xbox?

31:27.696 --> 31:29.137
[SPEAKER_09]: I know none of this free Xbox.

31:30.229 --> 31:33.451
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some secret I'm not being told about.

31:33.511 --> 31:34.352
[SPEAKER_09]: Some secret cult.

31:35.012 --> 31:36.193
[SPEAKER_09]: Some Xbox.

31:36.753 --> 31:40.375
[SPEAKER_12]: I found a game that kicks just about any other racing game's butt.

31:41.296 --> 31:44.358
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, um, oh god, it starts with an O. It's something Redshift.

31:47.207 --> 31:50.088
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's not Orgasm Redshift, Dave.

31:50.208 --> 31:54.110
[SPEAKER_12]: It's done by Microsoft's programmers group.

31:54.550 --> 31:56.991
[SPEAKER_12]: That game is absolutely awesome.

31:57.071 --> 32:00.673
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like Wipeout meets Hydro Thunder.

32:01.293 --> 32:02.233
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of interesting.

32:03.314 --> 32:04.274
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got to do one of those, too.

32:04.314 --> 32:05.955
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to our chat rooms, bitches, shall we?

32:06.115 --> 32:09.096
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to get an Xbox.

32:09.176 --> 32:09.997
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to add it.

32:10.217 --> 32:10.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

32:11.790 --> 32:14.312
[SPEAKER_09]: 23rd Magus says, a big fuck you to Skrull.

32:14.492 --> 32:16.513
[SPEAKER_09]: One Skrull in particular, Johnson Main.

32:16.533 --> 32:17.074
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck?

32:17.114 --> 32:18.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Trainwreck High.

32:18.655 --> 32:20.796
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked for web author training, I get choir.

32:22.318 --> 32:27.782
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck is wrong with these fucking idiots?

32:30.024 --> 32:32.806
[SPEAKER_09]: You asked for web author training and you get choir?

32:33.726 --> 32:34.767
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is that?

32:34.787 --> 32:35.248
[SPEAKER_03]: That's retarded.

32:38.703 --> 32:41.724
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like making one of the Gauntlet Legends people get up and play DDR.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.006
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some scary people that play Gauntlet Legends.

32:48.247 --> 32:49.187
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you talking about?

32:49.207 --> 32:49.928
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't play it.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.648
[SPEAKER_11]: They are Gauntlet Legends.

32:52.869 --> 32:54.469
[SPEAKER_09]: B1 with the Gauntlet Legends.

32:54.649 --> 33:01.452
[SPEAKER_12]: Watch out for the girl with the big metal bra playing that game, you know.

33:01.512 --> 33:05.074
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pathetic when we have to sit here and make fun of addicts to other games.

33:06.874 --> 33:07.395
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Pod.

33:07.435 --> 33:08.295
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Kettle Calling.

33:09.417 --> 33:10.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Pot, you're black.

33:43.371 --> 33:50.663
[SPEAKER_09]: JB featuring Jenny Rom says, My FU is also to RVGL for not having the keys available to any games after the morning is over.

33:51.023 --> 33:53.407
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even the guys in the jean colored shirts have access to them.

33:53.808 --> 33:55.471
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Jamie can't rape the crane game.

33:57.196 --> 33:58.136
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the crane game break?

33:58.696 --> 34:02.698
[SPEAKER_12]: If the crane game broke before I got a chance to play it, don't hug our children.

34:03.118 --> 34:07.159
[SPEAKER_12]: Except for them leaving Drum Mania on free play for three weeks or something.

34:07.499 --> 34:08.119
[SPEAKER_12]: That was cool.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.921
[SPEAKER_11]: We are smart geniuses there.

34:12.941 --> 34:15.141
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, it's getterific.

34:15.942 --> 34:21.443
[SPEAKER_09]: And JV featuring Jenny Rom would also like to say, F you if you hate Jenny Rom or The Zippers.

34:22.303 --> 34:23.864
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about Jenny Rom a little later.

34:24.991 --> 34:26.392
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about Jenny Rom after the next break.

34:27.493 --> 34:36.098
[SPEAKER_09]: Twen says, F you to sharing a phone line with every friggin' person in the house, making me stay online till 4am at least every night because I can't use it any time during the day.

34:36.719 --> 34:41.121
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to me, Sky, for not putting up the new site or forum.

34:41.802 --> 34:44.684
[SPEAKER_09]: And he also says F you to individuals I'm not going to name.

34:45.384 --> 34:46.785
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're not worth naming.

34:46.825 --> 34:48.026
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not cool.

34:50.948 --> 34:54.370
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, 23rmagus would like to point out he is a fine baritone, but he hates choir.

34:55.567 --> 34:56.368
[SPEAKER_09]: But he is a mindbearer.

34:56.528 --> 34:59.891
[SPEAKER_12]: I was in band for a reason.

35:02.032 --> 35:04.234
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in band because we're going to Hawaii.

35:05.015 --> 35:05.976
[SPEAKER_10]: How cool is that?

35:06.656 --> 35:09.639
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the only reason you joined band to go to Hawaii?

35:09.879 --> 35:11.640
[SPEAKER_10]: No, see, last year it was Disneyland.

35:11.881 --> 35:12.601
[SPEAKER_10]: That was crap.

35:13.122 --> 35:13.922
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw some tits.

35:14.303 --> 35:14.703
[SPEAKER_10]: That was it.

35:15.023 --> 35:15.824
[SPEAKER_10]: This year it's Hawaii.

35:15.844 --> 35:17.485
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

35:17.525 --> 35:18.926
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw tits on a band trip?

35:20.328 --> 35:20.648
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

35:21.565 --> 35:23.207
[SPEAKER_09]: One time at Bandcamp!

35:23.767 --> 35:25.589
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, who didn't see that joke coming a mile away?

35:25.609 --> 35:30.853
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to be sending you money to buy me manga then when you're over there.

35:30.913 --> 35:32.214
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you go to Toys and Joys for me?

35:34.396 --> 35:34.636
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

35:34.937 --> 35:35.437
[SPEAKER_12]: Toys and Joys.

35:38.987 --> 35:40.008
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple more, two more.

35:40.548 --> 35:45.751
[SPEAKER_09]: SoCalKick says, fuck you to every gaming store for delaying Kingdom Hearts' release, but yay, Kingdom Hearts owns.

35:46.131 --> 35:49.373
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, actually, my fiance's store had Kingdom Hearts the day of release.

35:49.794 --> 35:51.234
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, oh, oh.

35:51.655 --> 35:52.415
[SPEAKER_12]: So, ha ha.

35:54.957 --> 35:58.699
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm getting mine tomorrow, so I'm very happy about that.

35:59.426 --> 36:00.447
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, how did this happen?

36:00.547 --> 36:07.092
[SPEAKER_09]: TakeOutKid says, fuck you to his... And by the way, TakeOutKid is joining us from Berkeley.edu.

36:07.253 --> 36:15.700
[SPEAKER_09]: So, fuck you to his college writing teacher for thinking he was an ESL student when he's not even really ESL.

36:17.421 --> 36:20.323
[SPEAKER_09]: How can... How the hell... You've got to elaborate on that.

36:20.363 --> 36:21.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Please elaborate on that.

36:21.364 --> 36:23.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Send me more about how the hell that happens to somebody.

36:23.906 --> 36:24.487
[SPEAKER_09]: That sucks.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.562
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, JB, please send me that file.

36:29.602 --> 36:33.084
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to respond too lazy a type right now.

36:33.204 --> 36:41.209
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to Dan for getting me this really neat 007 watch that clips on my belt and is upside down so I can look at it and has a compass.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.330
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been playing with this thing all night.

36:43.710 --> 36:44.591
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the coolest thing ever.

36:45.991 --> 36:48.813
[SPEAKER_11]: And F you to this upcoming movie I heard about called The Core.

36:49.585 --> 36:51.606
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the dumbest idea I've ever heard of.

36:52.346 --> 36:59.249
[SPEAKER_11]: The Earth's core stops, and then these people have to go drill down to the core and detonate a nuke, and that'll fix everything.

37:00.370 --> 37:01.510
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the dumbest idea.

37:02.170 --> 37:05.372
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Austin Powers, except that the goal is to let it work.

37:06.752 --> 37:10.814
[SPEAKER_12]: And here is us suspending our disbelief with one confession.

37:11.654 --> 37:12.694
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

37:12.814 --> 37:19.176
[SPEAKER_12]: Movies today are getting retarded as are most TV shows, which is why Jamie doesn't want TV anymore.

37:19.977 --> 37:22.377
[SPEAKER_12]: But, and Dave's head hurts.

37:23.578 --> 37:25.518
[SPEAKER_11]: But, The Transporter's gonna kick ass.

37:25.818 --> 37:26.939
[SPEAKER_11]: Go see The Transporter.

37:27.719 --> 37:28.279
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome movie.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.239
[SPEAKER_11]: On Asian Girl.

37:29.279 --> 37:29.719
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

37:31.020 --> 37:33.560
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yeah.

37:33.680 --> 37:37.682
[SPEAKER_09]: A special hello, by the way, out there to the Rice Princess, who's joining us in the chat room.

37:37.942 --> 37:38.082
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi!

37:38.102 --> 37:38.442
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi!

37:39.250 --> 37:42.774
[SPEAKER_09]: And one more, one more FU, one more, this last one, no more, don't send me any more.

37:44.116 --> 37:48.701
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says, FU to his busted Knights controller.

37:50.122 --> 37:50.963
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like Sonic Knights?

37:51.003 --> 37:52.145
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Sega Analog Controller.

37:52.385 --> 37:52.765
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

37:53.146 --> 37:56.029
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is the best controller ever invented.

37:56.890 --> 37:59.433
[SPEAKER_12]: And you cannot really get them anymore unless you know where to look.

38:00.422 --> 38:02.924
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, TakeOutKid is elaborating on the ESL story.

38:02.964 --> 38:08.928
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, she read my subject and she thought my writing was so bad that she thought I was ESL.

38:09.669 --> 38:17.014
[SPEAKER_09]: And the readers of his subject had evidence of ESL attributes, so that's why she thought he was ESL.

38:18.436 --> 38:18.816
[SPEAKER_09]: Go figure.

38:21.098 --> 38:22.759
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, why don't we take a quick break?

38:22.779 --> 38:23.540
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys want to take a quick break?

38:23.560 --> 38:26.041
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to come back and we're going to talk about Jenny Rong.

38:26.442 --> 38:26.982
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that sound?

38:27.342 --> 38:27.783
[SPEAKER_09]: Whee!

38:28.043 --> 38:32.326
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to start this off with... Actually, I can't find that right now.

38:32.446 --> 38:35.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll hear something from Fantasia 3 in the next break.

38:35.108 --> 38:38.130
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play you guys something from Fantasia 3, brand new, just came out.

38:38.150 --> 38:44.234
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to start this set off with... How about something from... You want to hear Papaya?

38:44.254 --> 38:45.855
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to hear Supergirl?

38:47.189 --> 38:51.692
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy papaya song.

38:53.093 --> 38:53.554
[SPEAKER_09]: Where was it?

38:53.834 --> 38:54.254
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there it is.

38:54.294 --> 38:54.575
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

38:54.875 --> 38:55.215
[SPEAKER_09]: Found it.

38:55.295 --> 38:56.616
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even tell how I have my own songs.

38:56.656 --> 39:00.839
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone be prepared to be overloaded with sugar and brush your teeth when the song's over.

39:01.119 --> 39:03.281
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and we'll get something from Fantasia 3 in here too.

39:35.137 --> 39:36.739
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

44:02.361 --> 44:03.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell it to my heart

44:55.123 --> 44:57.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

46:04.252 --> 46:08.674
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Random Person on the street, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music and more show?

46:09.655 --> 46:11.976
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful night, isn't it?

46:12.697 --> 46:24.783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a bloodsucker.

46:25.804 --> 46:29.026
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

46:30.006 --> 46:30.827
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell was that?

46:31.147 --> 46:32.468
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the look on her face when she...

46:44.084 --> 46:53.609
[SPEAKER_09]: I promised when we came back to the show we would talk about Jenny Rom and this is very interesting because JB in the chatroom, huge Jenny Rom fan, sent me some pictures of Jenny Rom.

46:54.429 --> 46:55.210
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, she's ugly.

46:55.390 --> 46:57.371
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is the interesting thing.

46:58.411 --> 47:02.835
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, Jenny Rom is not a real person, from what I'm reading.

47:03.115 --> 47:03.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Gasp!

47:03.796 --> 47:04.176
[SPEAKER_09]: Gasp!

47:04.236 --> 47:14.185
[SPEAKER_11]: From what was posted on the... Well, you know, with cosmic surgery, one does become... Cosmetic surgery!

47:14.746 --> 47:18.369
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, shit, to make her look good, it's gonna take some cosmic surgery there.

47:18.810 --> 47:19.750
[SPEAKER_11]: Cosmic power's working.

47:20.031 --> 47:24.675
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, at a certain point, someone becomes, you know, not exactly human anymore.

47:26.215 --> 47:26.936
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

47:45.198 --> 47:47.701
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's a member of Jenny Rom's team.

47:48.101 --> 47:51.645
[SPEAKER_09]: He produced the first single, www.blondegirl.com for SyFam.

47:52.246 --> 47:55.329
[SPEAKER_09]: And he saw that somebody was looking for the lyrics of Do You Wanna Flirt?

47:55.409 --> 47:58.232
[SPEAKER_09]: And he posts them on this site.

47:59.693 --> 48:01.595
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

48:02.036 --> 48:04.798
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's read some of these earth-shattering lyrics from Jenny Rom, shall we?

48:05.439 --> 48:05.819
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

48:08.401 --> 48:16.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom Boom, Don't Stop, Love Me Babe, Boom Boom, Don't Stop, Kiss Me Babe, Boom Boom, Don't Stop, Love Me Babe, Tonight With Me So High.

48:19.585 --> 48:21.426
[SPEAKER_09]: What is up with the Japanese and Boom Boom?

48:21.606 --> 48:23.106
[SPEAKER_09]: They put Boom Boom in everything.

48:24.307 --> 48:28.148
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you know what?

48:29.208 --> 48:31.009
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's who Ginny Rum really is.

48:32.449 --> 48:34.430
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I've heard this a long time ago.

48:35.336 --> 48:36.096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's politary.

48:38.297 --> 48:39.758
[SPEAKER_12]: You think Jenny Rum's really politary?

48:39.798 --> 48:40.418
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a difference.

48:40.798 --> 48:42.059
[SPEAKER_12]: Jenny Rum can hold a tune.

48:45.820 --> 48:47.001
[SPEAKER_11]: Jenny Rum's just Naoki.

48:47.941 --> 48:48.601
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all it is.

48:48.982 --> 48:49.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Naoki's everyone.

48:50.302 --> 48:51.042
[SPEAKER_11]: That's your drag.

48:51.163 --> 48:55.164
[SPEAKER_09]: So really what this is, is that Jenny Rum is actually an Italian singer.

48:56.645 --> 48:59.366
[SPEAKER_09]: The lady who does the voice, and also an Italian male singer.

48:59.386 --> 49:04.208
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm guessing this picture that got sent to me was actually that Italian singer who poses as Jenny Rum.

49:04.628 --> 49:05.529
[SPEAKER_09]: Danny Ross is male?

49:06.309 --> 49:13.272
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, but you know that guy who does the voice, like, you know, come on Barbie, let's go party, or, you know, I know, I know what you do.

49:13.432 --> 49:15.093
[SPEAKER_09]: That guy, he's an Italian guy.

49:16.124 --> 49:16.824
[SPEAKER_11]: God, you know what?

49:16.844 --> 49:18.045
[SPEAKER_11]: They all sound alike.

49:18.285 --> 49:23.969
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to God, Aqua, you know, Captain... I seriously thought that guy was the guy from Aqua.

49:24.009 --> 49:25.830
[SPEAKER_09]: He sounds just like him.

49:26.050 --> 49:29.272
[SPEAKER_09]: The girl doesn't sound the same, but that guy sounds just like the guy from Aqua.

49:29.392 --> 49:31.113
[SPEAKER_09]: Aqua broke up a couple years ago from what I heard.

49:31.153 --> 49:34.075
[SPEAKER_11]: What's funny is they also have, what was it, I think King Kong and the Jungle Girls.

49:35.536 --> 49:36.117
[SPEAKER_11]: And the world is square.

49:58.883 --> 50:00.524
[SPEAKER_12]: All bands are aqua and the world is square.

50:01.104 --> 50:03.505
[SPEAKER_09]: Some more things that Alex says on this forum.

50:04.106 --> 50:06.647
[SPEAKER_09]: He's proud to see that so many people love his virtual daughter.

50:07.187 --> 50:10.449
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's got photos and a promotional video about Jenny Rom.

50:11.850 --> 50:15.652
[SPEAKER_09]: Jenny's not a real girl, but a virtual woman that lives in the fantasy and into the computer world.

50:15.672 --> 50:17.172
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the original concept about her.

50:17.913 --> 50:20.714
[SPEAKER_09]: And he says, Do You Want to Flirt is his favorite song.

50:20.734 --> 50:22.815
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't been released on Dance Media Compilation.

50:23.275 --> 50:27.578
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know somebody that's got a copy of that, and maybe they'll send it to me so we can play it by the end of the show.

50:27.618 --> 50:28.298
[SPEAKER_09]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

50:28.878 --> 50:29.679
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't say any more.

50:31.220 --> 50:36.185
[SPEAKER_09]: And he says, we chose the name Jenny Rom because they were looking for a perfect name for a digital woman.

50:36.845 --> 50:38.607
[SPEAKER_09]: And when Joe said, what do you think of Jenny Rom?

50:38.647 --> 50:39.548
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, I love it.

50:40.229 --> 50:43.131
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of like when Jamie and I came up with Orange Lounge.

50:43.151 --> 50:44.192
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's call this show Orange Lounge.

50:44.212 --> 50:45.053
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I love it.

50:45.774 --> 50:46.114
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing.

50:46.767 --> 50:47.948
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll buy that for a dollar.

50:48.168 --> 50:49.569
[SPEAKER_09]: Except I don't think we were that excited.

50:49.609 --> 50:51.411
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, oh yay, finally, we thought of a title.

50:51.491 --> 50:53.132
[SPEAKER_12]: We're like, tired and on the Bart.

50:54.093 --> 50:54.934
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that, I remember that.

50:54.974 --> 50:57.035
[SPEAKER_09]: We were on Bart when we decided to call it that.

50:57.095 --> 50:57.696
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured it out.

50:58.377 --> 51:01.839
[SPEAKER_11]: Politary is Naoki's evil second head.

51:03.961 --> 51:04.922
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

51:06.263 --> 51:07.404
[SPEAKER_12]: You mean they have a hard levitate?

51:11.867 --> 51:13.028
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, uh, what else?

51:13.529 --> 51:14.570
[SPEAKER_12]: Naoki has many people.

51:15.310 --> 51:15.430
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

51:17.566 --> 51:18.827
[SPEAKER_09]: But male is none of those.

51:18.847 --> 51:19.187
[SPEAKER_04]: A lovely story.

51:41.385 --> 51:47.690
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be noted the reason he's not with their production team anymore is because he made some explicit photos of Jenny Rom.

51:50.833 --> 51:52.294
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, anyway.

51:52.794 --> 51:54.535
[SPEAKER_12]: See if she was a natural blondie girl.

51:55.416 --> 51:59.259
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were all shocked to find out she wasn't a blonde girl all over.

52:02.222 --> 52:03.482
[SPEAKER_12]: They just forgot to render that part.

52:09.564 --> 52:16.553
[SPEAKER_09]: For all we know, it's www.shavedgirl.com Next in Bimani News.

52:17.474 --> 52:18.435
[SPEAKER_09]: Also in Bimani News.

52:23.281 --> 52:24.602
[SPEAKER_12]: Meanwhile, back at the ranch.

52:28.891 --> 52:30.972
[SPEAKER_11]: The curtains do not match the carpet.

52:31.773 --> 52:33.033
[SPEAKER_11]: We're so mature here.

52:33.714 --> 52:37.196
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking about pussies.

52:40.017 --> 52:42.078
[SPEAKER_09]: I never thought I'd hear this on a Bomani show.

52:42.618 --> 52:43.999
[SPEAKER_09]: You think I'd get laid playing this game?

52:45.920 --> 52:48.602
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but certain people would be guaranteed not to.

52:49.702 --> 52:50.343
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Politary.

52:53.344 --> 52:53.664
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

52:54.705 --> 52:56.266
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to know if Jenny Rom has three tits.

52:57.627 --> 52:58.447
[SPEAKER_12]: That can be programmed.

53:00.310 --> 53:08.175
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like, um, I don't know how best to describe it.

53:08.495 --> 53:10.276
[SPEAKER_11]: She's like a vacuum cleaner.

53:10.476 --> 53:12.157
[SPEAKER_11]: She's got different attachments, you know.

53:12.417 --> 53:13.878
[SPEAKER_11]: For different functions.

53:14.918 --> 53:16.539
[SPEAKER_04]: She's gone from suck to blow!

53:19.421 --> 53:19.861
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

53:20.582 --> 53:22.343
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's move on to something else, shall we?

53:22.363 --> 53:22.863
[SPEAKER_11]: Something else.

53:23.493 --> 53:25.695
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know that they confirmed DDR Max 3?

53:25.795 --> 53:31.158
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I should say, not DDR Max 3 necessarily, but a new DDR is in production.

53:32.699 --> 53:35.521
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is definitely going to be a new DDR coming out.

53:36.021 --> 53:45.988
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're taking a poll over on the official website for this, which is over on Konami's Bomani portal.

53:46.008 --> 53:47.028
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find it, no problem.

53:47.308 --> 53:52.512
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to know what kind of Konami original songs you want to see in this new DDR that haven't been there yet, but from any...

53:53.212 --> 54:22.685
[SPEAKER_09]: the money game so like if there's a keyboard mania song you think should be in there now I was an idiot when I first submitted it and I said I want to see flotation in DDR except that's not a that's not a Konami original so I already fucked it up so they're looking for Konami originals speaking of the for home versions though this is this is somewhat unconfirmed although I'm not doubting the reliability of my source dude are those sirens picking up over the microphones it's just hella loud there's sirens going right by my house right now they found Loki anyway

54:23.616 --> 54:39.260
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, there's been information given to me, again, this has not been officially confirmed by me with any member of Konami, but that they were going to stop production of the peripherals, like the dance pads.

54:39.300 --> 54:40.521
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're talking Konami in the U.S.

54:40.561 --> 54:40.801
[SPEAKER_09]: again?

54:40.941 --> 54:42.221
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami USA.

54:42.501 --> 54:49.563
[SPEAKER_12]: And that though they did mention Red Octane by name, that they were supporting whatever product that they would release.

54:50.463 --> 54:56.487
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll try to get that confirmed, but in the meantime, this is what my sources told me.

54:56.847 --> 54:59.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so your... Inside sources.

55:02.370 --> 55:05.172
[SPEAKER_12]: Start buying those dance pads while you can get them.

55:05.672 --> 55:08.454
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so they're not going to make any... Maybe...

55:09.355 --> 55:15.179
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to be making those official Konami pads anymore and Red Octane is going to be the official Konami DDR pad dealer, basically.

55:15.619 --> 55:15.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

55:16.620 --> 55:18.601
[SPEAKER_09]: If these sources are correct, that's what's happening.

55:19.142 --> 55:19.742
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

55:20.423 --> 55:20.743
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

55:20.823 --> 55:22.604
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Octane seems to own everything DDR online.

55:22.864 --> 55:26.427
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that they said it was going to be necessarily official.

55:26.467 --> 55:32.731
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just that they were going to, I guess, vouch for the production of the Red Octane pads.

55:33.312 --> 55:36.634
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Ignition pad was also mentioned by name.

55:37.927 --> 55:38.771
[SPEAKER_09]: Now this is interesting.

55:39.413 --> 55:42.384
[SPEAKER_09]: Over on BimaniStyle.com, a fine little site,

55:43.010 --> 55:52.797
[SPEAKER_09]: They are making suggestions for what kinds of things you should submit as songs to Konami for DDR Max 3 or whatever it is.

55:53.057 --> 55:55.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever it is in whatever shape or form they're going to call it.

55:55.198 --> 55:56.519
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically DDR 8th Mix.

55:57.019 --> 56:02.243
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically these are all the Konami original songs that would pretty much be impossible to dance to.

56:02.323 --> 56:05.605
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to read off this list here of possible submissions.

56:05.645 --> 56:11.469
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't think of anything you want to submit as a song that you think should be in 8th Mix, here's some suggestions.

56:12.011 --> 56:13.906
[SPEAKER_09]: From Beatmania, The DJ Battle

56:15.347 --> 56:17.028
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine dancing to the DJ Battle?

56:17.129 --> 56:17.949
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I got one.

56:17.969 --> 56:19.230
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one up on that.

56:19.451 --> 56:19.831
[SPEAKER_11]: How about this?

56:20.111 --> 56:22.053
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Battle, the Yoler Mix.

56:23.434 --> 56:27.137
[SPEAKER_11]: From Beatmania... I forget which one.

56:27.457 --> 56:28.458
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Yoler Mix.

56:29.479 --> 56:31.100
[SPEAKER_09]: The Cat Song from Beatmania.

56:31.681 --> 56:33.122
[SPEAKER_09]: That's possible.

56:33.442 --> 56:37.265
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be so lame to dance to.

56:37.546 --> 56:38.326
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would be fun.

56:38.426 --> 56:40.168
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be, like, stupid fun.

56:41.049 --> 56:43.291
[SPEAKER_09]: From Keyboard Mania, Morning Music.

56:44.331 --> 57:05.479
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I think is about 15 BPM That would be so awful in DDR For memories, that one's really slow Threshold from Keyboard Mania is another suggestion Without You Around from Poppin' Music I'm not up on my Poppin' Music knowledge, so I don't know what that song is But from 2DX they suggest Flowers for Albion

57:07.093 --> 57:07.714
[SPEAKER_09]: God, no.

57:08.254 --> 57:14.659
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if the flowers would do the same thing that the notes do in the Seven Keeper Flowers.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.662
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that part is ass.

57:19.083 --> 57:20.124
[SPEAKER_12]: But it would be fun to do those.

57:20.924 --> 57:22.286
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, I like Twin's suggestion.

57:22.306 --> 57:24.527
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, let's DDR to Orange Lounge episodes.

57:25.708 --> 57:27.029
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about a long version.

57:27.089 --> 57:28.190
[SPEAKER_09]: These things are what?

57:28.350 --> 57:31.713
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the shortest episode of Orange Lounge is like 118 minutes.

57:32.554 --> 57:33.995
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be marathon mode right there.

57:36.602 --> 57:39.723
[SPEAKER_09]: From 2DX, also suggesting The Safari.

57:41.264 --> 57:42.705
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, The Safari would be fun.

57:42.745 --> 57:44.666
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a good idea, really.

57:44.686 --> 57:52.030
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, The Safari would be... But you know what song I would not... I mean, I don't think it's an original, but Get On Beat Wildstyle, definitely not.

57:52.250 --> 57:53.110
[SPEAKER_09]: It is an original, actually.

57:53.951 --> 57:54.531
[SPEAKER_09]: Lion and Sushi.

57:56.172 --> 57:56.872
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, I don't know.

57:57.532 --> 57:59.793
[SPEAKER_12]: Get On Beat would actually be kind of fun.

58:00.874 --> 58:02.435
[SPEAKER_12]: It wouldn't be a fast one, but it would be a fun one.

58:05.058 --> 58:30.445
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Freaks, Across the Nightmare Drum Mania with Waza Mobile Moga being suggested in the chatroom I believe I saw that on a preliminary list but I don't know how trustworthy those lists are the ones that have been released to date I don't think it's quite solid

58:33.806 --> 58:37.767
[SPEAKER_09]: Twins suggest we can DDR to the sounds of the sirens outside my house looking for Loki.

58:38.387 --> 58:40.108
[SPEAKER_12]: Just loop, you know, the beginning of Fuqua.

58:44.449 --> 58:48.370
[SPEAKER_09]: Presto V... What else are people suggesting in here?

58:48.390 --> 58:49.490
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Presto would be a pain in the butt.

58:50.670 --> 58:52.131
[SPEAKER_09]: How about... Oh, I know.

58:52.151 --> 58:52.131
1999.

58:52.851 --> 58:53.131
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

58:53.171 --> 58:55.991
[SPEAKER_09]: Fifth mix.

58:57.672 --> 58:58.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Saber Dance.

58:59.312 --> 59:00.353
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be fun.

59:01.813 --> 59:02.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

59:02.679 --> 59:03.839
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's what I voted for.

59:03.859 --> 59:07.560
[SPEAKER_11]: I voted for Outer Limits and my other computer.

59:08.801 --> 59:10.161
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care, okay?

59:10.181 --> 59:11.642
[SPEAKER_11]: I voted for it anyways.

59:11.662 --> 59:12.602
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all in Japanese.

59:12.662 --> 59:14.963
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't read their freaking Japanese language.

59:14.983 --> 59:15.483
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, wait a minute.

59:15.543 --> 59:17.383
[SPEAKER_09]: Outer Limits, I believe, is the LED, isn't it?

59:17.663 --> 59:18.444
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that the bonus chart?

59:19.524 --> 59:20.004
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

59:20.184 --> 59:20.484
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

59:20.884 --> 59:23.005
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I also voted for Instant Love.

59:23.985 --> 59:25.045
[SPEAKER_11]: With DJ Konami.

59:28.046 --> 59:29.747
[SPEAKER_09]: You voted for Instant Love?

59:31.687 --> 59:33.208
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, the dance floor is waiting for us.

59:33.228 --> 59:33.949
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're doing.

59:34.189 --> 59:40.555
[SPEAKER_09]: I want everybody right now listening to this show to go vote for Instant Love for DDR with DJ Konami's voice intact.

59:41.095 --> 59:42.457
[SPEAKER_09]: I want that to be the new lesson mode.

59:42.737 --> 59:49.423
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to God, if they release another DDR with Let Them Move as the lesson mode background, that old screeching woman, they need to do the new one for Beat Me In 3.

59:49.463 --> 59:50.844
[SPEAKER_12]: We have After the Game of Love on 3rd May.

59:50.864 --> 59:51.505
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's true, we do.

59:53.186 --> 59:54.007
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm done with my rant.

59:55.285 --> 59:56.466
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's all about this.

59:56.666 --> 01:00:06.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, what they're going to start doing on this site, starting on the 25th, which is in three days, so next week we'll be able to talk about this, Naoki's diary.

01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:07.436
[SPEAKER_11]: Naoki.

01:00:07.536 --> 01:00:08.637
[SPEAKER_11]: Naoki's diary.

01:00:09.197 --> 01:00:10.318
[SPEAKER_11]: How feminine of him.

01:00:11.419 --> 01:00:16.344
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they said diary, not journal, not logbook, not hey what's going on.

01:00:16.484 --> 01:00:17.665
[SPEAKER_11]: It's his diary.

01:00:17.685 --> 01:00:18.425
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm about ready.

01:00:18.666 --> 01:00:21.188
[SPEAKER_12]: See, I put Naoki in the same category I put Gakuten.

01:00:21.954 --> 01:00:25.097
[SPEAKER_12]: Dear Diary, I had the members of B4U over today.

01:00:25.117 --> 01:00:32.723
[SPEAKER_12]: We went on my nice little Pirates of the Caribbean ride with my monkey.

01:00:44.692 --> 01:00:48.535
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did my nails and I made another song.

01:00:48.675 --> 01:00:51.937
[SPEAKER_11]: And I tried to think of another name for another band that I could become.

01:00:53.739 --> 01:00:56.020
[SPEAKER_11]: And damn that Jenny Rump for stealing my idea.

01:00:57.501 --> 01:00:58.382
[SPEAKER_11]: I will become her.

01:00:58.902 --> 01:01:00.123
[SPEAKER_11]: She will not live.

01:01:00.944 --> 01:01:01.284
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

01:01:02.281 --> 01:01:03.161
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of odd.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:08.324
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, when they said, like, everybody's getting a live journal these days, I didn't think now he was getting it on it, too.

01:01:09.004 --> 01:01:13.567
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they'll have to have a separate journal for each of his alter egos, you know, revenge and desire.

01:01:14.107 --> 01:01:23.392
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm thinking, if it's going to be a weekly update, I'm sure that I could probably, with, you know, the proper payments, try to get somebody to translate it to...

01:01:24.132 --> 01:01:24.993
[SPEAKER_12]: To put up or something.

01:01:25.033 --> 01:01:29.576
[SPEAKER_12]: Or I could give highlights from it using my favorite translation program, Nifty at Global Games.

01:01:29.616 --> 01:01:30.376
[SPEAKER_11]: I can just see it now.

01:01:30.657 --> 01:01:32.278
[SPEAKER_11]: Weekend Update with Naoki.

01:01:34.679 --> 01:01:36.881
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll take our own liberties with the translation.

01:01:36.941 --> 01:01:37.561
[SPEAKER_09]: Mwahaha.

01:01:38.622 --> 01:01:41.724
[SPEAKER_09]: Today I got the B for you girls together today.

01:01:41.904 --> 01:01:45.286
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got together at my house and had a naked spa party.

01:01:45.366 --> 01:01:46.967
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we wrote another crappy song.

01:01:47.027 --> 01:01:48.108
[SPEAKER_12]: Instead of dead hair.

01:01:49.649 --> 01:01:50.310
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm sorry.

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.330
[SPEAKER_12]: That's polytery.

01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:51.871
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.562
[SPEAKER_09]: I made Politary mount the B4U girls.

01:01:57.523 --> 01:01:59.024
[SPEAKER_09]: Today I dressed up like Emi.

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:00.085
[SPEAKER_09]: I like her.

01:02:00.445 --> 01:02:01.266
[SPEAKER_11]: She's kinda cute.

01:02:01.606 --> 01:02:02.927
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'll become her someday.

01:02:03.347 --> 01:02:04.148
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Emi!

01:02:04.548 --> 01:02:05.869
[SPEAKER_11]: Added to the personalities.

01:02:09.372 --> 01:02:09.792
Next!

01:02:10.132 --> 01:02:13.495
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked the chatroom to submit me their funny Naoki diary entries.

01:02:13.655 --> 01:02:14.095
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear this?

01:02:14.155 --> 01:02:15.817
[SPEAKER_09]: Naoki's starting a diary on the 25th.

01:02:16.297 --> 01:02:17.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Naoki's diary.

01:02:17.398 --> 01:02:20.260
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think... What kinds of things do you think Naoki's gonna tell us about in his diary?

01:02:21.818 --> 01:02:23.761
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:27.326
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know Naoki, but that's probably why he's making a diary.

01:02:28.147 --> 01:02:30.190
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, is it a guy or a girl?

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:31.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's a guy.

01:02:31.592 --> 01:02:31.893
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:02:32.513 --> 01:02:33.194
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't sure.

01:02:33.815 --> 01:02:34.496
[SPEAKER_11]: Just checking.

01:02:34.757 --> 01:02:36.199
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all encompassing, okay?

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:39.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Deep thoughts with Naoki.

01:02:39.792 --> 01:02:42.936
[SPEAKER_11]: Naoki isn't hidden, either.

01:02:42.956 --> 01:02:44.238
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you ever see It's Pat?

01:02:44.458 --> 01:02:45.139
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Naoki.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.042
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no, because Naoki actually looks very pretty.

01:02:48.183 --> 01:02:50.065
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to interview Naoki on this show.

01:02:50.105 --> 01:02:52.628
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who I have to blow to get that to happen, but come on.

01:02:52.888 --> 01:02:53.229
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe him.

01:02:56.275 --> 01:02:59.436
[SPEAKER_09]: Would I get a free trip to Japan out of it?

01:02:59.576 --> 01:02:59.957
[SPEAKER_09]: Stopping.

01:03:00.597 --> 01:03:05.299
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked the chat room to submit their funny Naoki diary entries.

01:03:05.339 --> 01:03:10.861
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to send me a PM with what you think Naoki might just write in his diary, I'm going to read those aloud right now for you.

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:16.583
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's get some background music, shall we, for these lovely Naoki diary entries.

01:03:17.483 --> 01:03:18.084
[SPEAKER_09]: Dynamite Rave?

01:03:18.184 --> 01:03:18.484
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:03:19.844 --> 01:03:20.865
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to find Dynamite Rave.

01:03:20.885 --> 01:03:21.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

01:03:23.893 --> 01:03:25.774
[SPEAKER_09]: Dynamite Rave is not the worst song ever!

01:03:25.854 --> 01:03:26.474
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut your mouth!

01:03:26.494 --> 01:03:29.735
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the category of the worst songs ever folder, which encompasses DDR USA.

01:03:29.755 --> 01:03:31.516
[SPEAKER_09]: Dynamite Rave is a good song, it's just overplayed.

01:03:51.212 --> 01:03:52.652
[SPEAKER_09]: Naoki's Diary Chaos suggests...

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:17.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, I made a remix to Breakdown Reggae R&B version.

01:04:18.186 --> 01:04:19.107
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really great.

01:04:19.408 --> 01:04:22.350
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the Jamaican dude singing instead of the B4U girls.

01:04:23.271 --> 01:04:25.453
[SPEAKER_09]: I like how it's referred to as the Jamaican dude.

01:04:26.114 --> 01:04:30.038
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll have Jamaican drums and the black people singing, because B4U sucks.

01:04:31.624 --> 01:04:33.485
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Naoki would say his own band sucks.

01:04:33.525 --> 01:04:34.145
[SPEAKER_09]: That was beautiful.

01:04:34.185 --> 01:04:34.745
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chaos.

01:04:36.086 --> 01:04:41.729
[SPEAKER_09]: JB says, Dear Diary, I saw Politarian try to move my hand down her pants.

01:04:42.569 --> 01:04:42.769
[SPEAKER_09]: Nuts.

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:45.790
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of the obvious entry.

01:04:47.211 --> 01:04:49.312
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Konami submits us not one, but two.

01:04:49.392 --> 01:04:49.792
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

01:04:50.392 --> 01:04:52.874
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, I remixed Die for the 558th time today.

01:04:52.894 --> 01:04:53.074
[SPEAKER_09]: Praise me.

01:04:57.631 --> 01:04:59.873
[SPEAKER_09]: The part that makes that funny is at the end, praise me.

01:05:02.454 --> 01:05:05.977
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, I paid Paula and Kosaka to do some hot action today.

01:05:09.179 --> 01:05:10.180
[SPEAKER_09]: Twence says this.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.182
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, I had Paula Dairy record Let Them Move.

01:05:15.984 --> 01:05:18.686
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it, because Naoki died after hearing that.

01:05:20.127 --> 01:05:21.688
[SPEAKER_09]: SoCalKick, so this is a long one.

01:05:22.548 --> 01:05:23.329
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary...

01:05:24.662 --> 01:05:41.142
[SPEAKER_09]: I stumbled on an orange site that plays songs from that one place I used to work for and I listened to him and this random white American asked who would he have to blow to interview me I am curious and I'm going to have to pose as a random American hipster and get this blow that was the way

01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:44.249
[SPEAKER_09]: SoCalKicks wins the Diary competition.

01:05:44.869 --> 01:05:45.509
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're getting more.

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:48.571
[SPEAKER_09]: 23rd Magus submits this one.

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:58.557
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, I realize after doing 50,000 remixes of the same song that I have issues, one of which is a major identity crisis.

01:06:00.198 --> 01:06:01.119
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:03.480
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't know that.

01:06:04.981 --> 01:06:10.625
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'll create Bob, or Bob 2.0, to deal with that type of trauma.

01:06:11.454 --> 01:06:13.015
[SPEAKER_11]: I am too busy for that type of trauma.

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:14.616
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to make more songs.

01:06:14.976 --> 01:06:17.318
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, I can make a D for you.

01:06:18.258 --> 01:06:19.819
[SPEAKER_11]: Insert letter, number, letter.

01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:22.141
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:06:22.541 --> 01:06:27.745
[SPEAKER_09]: A black lab in the chat room points out, you know, admitting a problem is the first step to recovery.

01:06:29.326 --> 01:06:31.247
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll be going through like the million step program.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.220
[SPEAKER_09]: Our chat room people are hilarious tonight.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:37.920
[SPEAKER_09]: They're funny.

01:06:39.281 --> 01:06:40.222
[SPEAKER_09]: How about another quick break?

01:06:40.242 --> 01:06:40.682
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

01:06:40.702 --> 01:06:41.722
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to go on another subject?

01:06:41.742 --> 01:06:42.303
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to take a break?

01:06:42.323 --> 01:06:43.063
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you want to do?

01:06:43.323 --> 01:06:47.385
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that before we go to the break, I'll just go ahead and make a mention about Tourney.

01:06:47.685 --> 01:06:47.906
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:06:48.186 --> 01:06:52.368
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have an official site be up hopefully by mid-next week.

01:06:52.728 --> 01:06:59.111
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be linked from sakbemani.com, which is S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I dot com.

01:06:59.171 --> 01:06:59.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Sakbemani.

01:07:00.492 --> 01:07:01.213
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like it sounds.

01:07:01.273 --> 01:07:01.793
[SPEAKER_09]: Sakbemani.

01:07:02.153 --> 01:07:04.374
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't know how to spell Vimani, then you suck.

01:07:04.394 --> 01:07:05.775
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you have no reason at all to do that.

01:07:05.795 --> 01:07:06.375
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you here?

01:07:07.716 --> 01:07:10.417
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do have a date confirmed.

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:14.920
[SPEAKER_12]: It is November 9th at Scandia on, is it Hillsdale Road?

01:07:16.327 --> 01:07:16.667
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:07:16.827 --> 01:07:19.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Scandia, Madison, and I-80.

01:07:19.748 --> 01:07:20.349
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't miss it.

01:07:20.389 --> 01:07:21.069
[SPEAKER_09]: It's right by the freeway.

01:07:21.929 --> 01:07:23.910
[SPEAKER_12]: We will have maps to the site.

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:30.072
[SPEAKER_12]: The tournament will be freestyle, and it will be perfect attack in the morning.

01:07:30.432 --> 01:07:31.772
[SPEAKER_09]: Sponsored by Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:31.852 --> 01:07:32.993
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:34.453 --> 01:07:35.233
[SPEAKER_11]: What about the A-Team?

01:07:37.461 --> 01:07:43.984
[SPEAKER_12]: There will also be a team mode freestyle to be going on during normal freestyle tabulation.

01:07:44.664 --> 01:07:51.867
[SPEAKER_12]: And there also may be another surprise there waiting for us in the form of another Bomani game.

01:07:52.428 --> 01:07:55.289
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is on the boat, on its way to come hang out with us.

01:07:56.296 --> 01:08:02.501
[SPEAKER_09]: We should point out, this is not the same Scandia tournament as the Scandia tournament in December.

01:08:02.521 --> 01:08:03.942
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're having one in the Bay Area.

01:08:04.283 --> 01:08:05.764
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this is a different Scandia.

01:08:05.784 --> 01:08:07.145
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the Sacramento Scandia.

01:08:07.405 --> 01:08:09.707
[SPEAKER_09]: The tournament will not have Scandia in the name.

01:08:09.727 --> 01:08:12.249
[SPEAKER_09]: The tournament name is still kind of being ironed out.

01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:16.852
[SPEAKER_09]: But we think we know what it is, but we're going to say it next week.

01:08:17.253 --> 01:08:19.054
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll reveal the name next week.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:20.295
[SPEAKER_09]: All we can say is, shut your mouth.

01:08:21.539 --> 01:08:24.640
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll reveal the name next week, once we have our first meeting and get everything worked out.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:30.383
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll be posting all that information to just about every single freaking forum out there.

01:08:30.963 --> 01:08:32.244
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd have to be blind to miss it.

01:08:32.624 --> 01:08:40.528
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll say that an Orange Lounge website will be... An Orange Lounge new website will have forums in it coming very soon.

01:08:40.568 --> 01:08:41.548
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully in the next couple weeks.

01:08:42.889 --> 01:08:43.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:45.630
[SPEAKER_09]: So much for that secret.

01:08:47.684 --> 01:08:49.306
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't confirm it.

01:08:49.486 --> 01:08:50.327
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to confirm.

01:08:50.347 --> 01:08:51.328
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to deny those.

01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:52.329
[SPEAKER_09]: So there it goes.

01:08:55.573 --> 01:08:55.954
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

01:08:56.594 --> 01:08:59.418
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge random meeting promoted in SoCal by SCK.

01:08:59.458 --> 01:09:00.799
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the tournament's called, I guess.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:01.360
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:09:02.742 --> 01:09:03.022
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

01:09:03.042 --> 01:09:03.543
[SPEAKER_12]: Drive-thru, please.

01:09:05.002 --> 01:09:12.164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward to this because I'll be getting to get up there and MC this tournament with my good buddy Electro... God, I can never say it.

01:09:12.184 --> 01:09:12.505
[SPEAKER_09]: Tal!

01:09:14.165 --> 01:09:15.105
[SPEAKER_09]: His name's a tongue twister.

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:17.226
[SPEAKER_09]: Tal will be up there too and we're going to MC this tournament.

01:09:17.246 --> 01:09:17.666
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.

01:09:18.286 --> 01:09:20.107
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jamie, you're going to do a little MCing too, aren't you?

01:09:20.307 --> 01:09:22.328
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be too busy.

01:09:22.648 --> 01:09:26.389
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be hanging out in the little party room over there going, okay, you need to be doing this.

01:09:26.989 --> 01:09:28.511
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked for a Diet Coke.

01:09:28.811 --> 01:09:30.113
[SPEAKER_09]: You runners are shit.

01:09:30.313 --> 01:09:31.514
[SPEAKER_09]: This is regular Coke.

01:09:31.714 --> 01:09:32.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my Diet Coke?

01:09:32.976 --> 01:09:33.897
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be in my trailer.

01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:36.679
[SPEAKER_09]: I throw you out of this tournament, I'm going to my trailer.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.201
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not really.

01:09:38.401 --> 01:09:39.482
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:47.070
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust me, I'm going to be in the middle of the thing, and if it goes like, you know, I was just, you know, running around for everybody last year at Folsom, and I didn't eat all day, so...

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:56.707
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, then again, you know, I also, you know, I want to go ahead and thank, you know, the people who have been giving me advice on this too.

01:09:56.847 --> 01:09:58.429
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Iguana Girl especially.

01:09:58.449 --> 01:10:06.175
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Maple too for a lot of advice, you know, at 3 a.m.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:11.660
[SPEAKER_12]: in the morning with information and stuff on how a lot of the tournaments are run.

01:10:13.456 --> 01:10:19.220
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's take a really quick break, and we'll come back with much more information on the tournament next week.

01:10:21.061 --> 01:10:22.102
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all I have to say.

01:10:22.602 --> 01:10:23.923
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other thoughts to take us out?

01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:26.364
[SPEAKER_12]: Song.

01:10:27.125 --> 01:10:27.425
[SPEAKER_09]: Song.

01:10:27.485 --> 01:10:29.967
[SPEAKER_09]: How about... Okay, we'll do this.

01:10:30.107 --> 01:10:31.588
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a popular song here.

01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:34.930
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to play Spooky for you here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:01.687 --> 01:13:03.228
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a dance animal!

01:13:03.648 --> 01:13:04.148
Awesome!

01:13:04.228 --> 01:13:04.628
Awesome!

01:13:04.808 --> 01:13:05.228
Wow!

01:13:05.248 --> 01:13:05.608
Great!

01:13:05.668 --> 01:13:06.289
I was moved!

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:07.489
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always continuing!

01:13:07.529 --> 01:13:08.309
[SPEAKER_03]: You are awesome!

01:13:28.206 --> 01:13:29.987
[SPEAKER_02]: The crowd loves you!

01:13:30.027 --> 01:13:30.387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, do it!

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:31.388
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a dancing machine!

01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:31.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice step!

01:13:31.748 --> 01:13:32.568
[SPEAKER_02]: You surprised us all!

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.505
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, you are too cool!

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:07.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Combo is continuing great!

01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:08.770
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:11.633
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really follow me into the light?

01:14:12.133 --> 01:14:18.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream instructors on, dream instructors on my side Do you really make a man for dynamite?

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Love and peace is our fight

01:14:38.001 --> 01:14:41.245
I am your man, I will follow only you I am your man

01:15:43.174 --> 01:15:51.696
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi-ho, Kermit the E-Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:15:51.736 --> 01:15:57.478
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:15:57.698 --> 01:16:01.859
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't say 69, because there's a song in DDR called .59.

01:16:01.939 --> 01:16:02.279
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

01:16:02.379 --> 01:16:04.840
[SPEAKER_09]: V-A-59, ha ha ha.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.061
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone realizes that Little Miss Muffin's not a tough inch.

01:16:09.501 --> 01:16:10.181
[SPEAKER_09]: That was last week. .59.

01:16:12.962 --> 01:16:15.384
[SPEAKER_09]: If you weren't listening last week, that'll come out.

01:16:15.584 --> 01:16:16.465
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:19.287
[SPEAKER_09]: Explain the .59 for those that may not know what .59 is all about.

01:16:19.347 --> 01:16:19.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Explain this.

01:16:19.707 --> 01:16:27.712
[SPEAKER_12]: To do a quick bit of Japanese translation, point translates to ten, five translates to go, nine translates to ku, ten go ku means heaven.

01:16:28.493 --> 01:16:28.613
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

01:16:29.393 --> 01:16:34.917
[SPEAKER_12]: Hence, why if you notice the video in 2DX, it says ten go ku up on it with an angel.

01:16:35.818 --> 01:16:37.039
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

01:16:37.179 --> 01:16:39.080
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, why Devil Zuken in the background, though, on 4th Mix?

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.201
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:16:43.941 --> 01:16:46.544
[SPEAKER_09]: chat room saying they need to come out with a DDR Sesame Street mix.

01:16:47.385 --> 01:16:48.125
[SPEAKER_09]: Oha's cool, though.

01:16:48.486 --> 01:16:51.869
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you want... Oha, I think, would be cooler than anything Sesame Street could do.

01:16:51.949 --> 01:16:52.509
[SPEAKER_09]: Oha's does.

01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:54.011
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

01:16:55.172 --> 01:16:55.452
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:16:57.554 --> 01:17:00.597
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about... Oh, I got some sad news to report on the show.

01:17:00.657 --> 01:17:04.821
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, though, we need to talk about it, because it is Bomani-related, believe it or not.

01:17:06.661 --> 01:17:07.021
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:17:09.142 --> 01:17:13.684
[SPEAKER_09]: However, one of the singers from the group Roxette has a brain tumor.

01:17:14.645 --> 01:17:20.827
[SPEAKER_09]: Marie Fredrickson, a singer with a Swedish pop act, Roxette, best known in DDR for their contribution to Center of the Heart.

01:17:21.267 --> 01:17:25.349
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, the look was circulating on some early Max 2 lists.

01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:28.991
[SPEAKER_09]: However, it appears it got cut or it was just an outlier lie the whole time.

01:17:29.731 --> 01:17:31.113
[SPEAKER_09]: She looks like Lucy Lawless.

01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:31.834
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not her.

01:17:31.874 --> 01:17:32.334
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't her.

01:17:32.374 --> 01:17:34.577
[SPEAKER_09]: That chick looks like Lucy Lawless.

01:17:34.677 --> 01:17:35.457
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get to it here.

01:17:35.898 --> 01:17:36.519
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to cite here.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.985
[SPEAKER_09]: The 44-year-old singer fainted in her Stockholm home last week, and she's now in the hospital.

01:17:42.465 --> 01:17:48.211
[SPEAKER_09]: Her record label, EMI Sweden, if you ever wondered how they ended up on Dance Mania, they're just part of EMI Sweden.

01:17:48.992 --> 01:17:50.234
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

01:18:10.816 --> 01:18:11.977
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why I don't do real radio.

01:18:12.258 --> 01:18:24.307
[SPEAKER_09]: They had plans to do a Europe tour that was going to start in late October, and the duo is one of the most successful musical exports Sweden has ever produced, and the most successful ever in the US singles charts, which somewhat surprised me.

01:18:24.327 --> 01:18:26.629
[SPEAKER_09]: I always thought ABBA was the bigger of the two bands, but whatever.

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:31.753
[SPEAKER_09]: Their first UK hit was The Look, and it hit number 7 on the UK singles charts in 1989.

01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:42.198
[SPEAKER_09]: and they've had four more top ten hits in the UK, including It Must Have Been Love, Joyride, which were both also big hits in the US, and Almost Unreal.

01:18:43.439 --> 01:18:54.027
[SPEAKER_09]: Fredrickson had also enjoyed successes under her own name, hitting the Swedish charts in 1999 with a duet, Wonderful World, with one of the singers from ABBA, and that picture, the one you say looks like Lucy Lawless, that's the singer from ABBA.

01:18:54.407 --> 01:18:57.770
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be noted that that small tumor is actually Paul Oteri.

01:19:00.352 --> 01:19:01.012
[SPEAKER_12]: No!

01:19:01.353 --> 01:19:02.433
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul Oteri put it there.

01:19:05.586 --> 01:19:09.129
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an alien implant from Naoki so that he can control her too.

01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:11.190
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

01:19:12.271 --> 01:19:16.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly, in November, the duo joined US singer and actress Jennifer Lopez.

01:19:18.736 --> 01:19:20.757
[SPEAKER_09]: That was caused by Jennifer Lopez's ass, I'm sure.

01:19:21.218 --> 01:19:27.863
[SPEAKER_09]: And Swedish royal dignitaries at the party for Lopez's European... I can't say a goddamn word tonight.

01:19:29.484 --> 01:19:30.665
[SPEAKER_09]: I'mma pee in this show away.

01:19:31.365 --> 01:19:32.046
[SPEAKER_09]: European tour.

01:19:34.486 --> 01:19:35.988
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of some sad news.

01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:39.792
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't like it when DDR people are gonna die.

01:19:40.312 --> 01:19:40.773
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn!

01:19:40.933 --> 01:19:42.394
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't impolitary!

01:19:42.815 --> 01:19:43.475
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

01:19:46.932 --> 01:19:49.914
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to say this and then suddenly Politary is going to get hit by a bus.

01:19:49.934 --> 01:19:53.136
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, suddenly Politary is going to get hit by a bus and you're going to feel bad, aren't you?

01:19:53.156 --> 01:19:55.578
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like anything I ever say ever comes true.

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:56.419
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait.

01:19:57.379 --> 01:19:58.080
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it does.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:58.880
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn.

01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:02.703
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of... No, I cut naked cheeks and just crawl from the sky every day now.

01:20:03.904 --> 01:20:04.224
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn.

01:20:05.245 --> 01:20:06.646
[SPEAKER_11]: Asian porn stars.

01:20:08.347 --> 01:20:08.587
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:20:09.008 --> 01:20:09.568
[SPEAKER_12]: Next, please.

01:20:10.789 --> 01:20:11.710
[SPEAKER_09]: One quick little thing.

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:13.391
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this would be a funny thing to bring up.

01:20:13.751 --> 01:20:16.393
[SPEAKER_09]: For sale on Amazon.com through Toys R Us...

01:20:17.106 --> 01:20:20.405
[SPEAKER_09]: Barbie Dance Party and I'm going to post this link in the chat room here.

01:20:21.978 --> 01:20:22.859
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a dance pad.

01:20:23.039 --> 01:20:25.020
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Barbie's official dance pad.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:30.163
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to have the girls over for a night of dancing, you know, want to show off to Ken.

01:20:30.303 --> 01:20:34.725
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually a separate game that I don't think is affiliated with us.

01:20:35.005 --> 01:20:36.966
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like Pump It Up.

01:20:37.467 --> 01:20:38.887
[SPEAKER_10]: It does.

01:20:38.928 --> 01:20:39.948
[SPEAKER_09]: It does kind of look like Pump It Up.

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.349
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no arrows on it.

01:20:41.789 --> 01:20:42.369
[SPEAKER_12]: I bought this.

01:20:44.751 --> 01:20:46.972
[SPEAKER_12]: Dear Diary, I struck a deal with Mattel.

01:20:48.485 --> 01:20:54.247
[SPEAKER_12]: with Mattel and Andamiro to release this game to start subverting small children into the DDR cult.

01:20:55.187 --> 01:20:59.309
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but instead of arrows, it's got little flowers all in different colors.

01:20:59.829 --> 01:21:04.211
[SPEAKER_11]: Each child that plays this game will get a swift dose of Naoki-ism.

01:21:04.831 --> 01:21:05.131
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes.

01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:08.632
[SPEAKER_09]: And pretty soon Andamiro is going to be releasing the gem dance pad.

01:21:09.433 --> 01:21:14.614
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it should be noted that Pump It Up, that's just Naoki.

01:21:14.955 --> 01:21:15.515
[SPEAKER_11]: Still Naoki.

01:21:16.545 --> 01:21:20.351
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's just like a cigarette trying to hook them while they're young, you know?

01:21:20.971 --> 01:21:25.738
[SPEAKER_12]: So instead of having the seven degrees of Kevin Bacon, we now have the seven degrees of Naoki?

01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:27.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you just compare DDR to smoking?

01:21:28.282 --> 01:21:28.743
[SPEAKER_12]: No!

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:29.223
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I did.

01:21:29.383 --> 01:21:30.525
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe smoking crack.

01:21:35.075 --> 01:21:36.837
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:21:57.702 --> 01:21:59.263
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if it's padded, though.

01:22:00.963 --> 01:22:01.843
[SPEAKER_09]: Better be for $50.

01:22:02.944 --> 01:22:04.864
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's loading up the computer here.

01:22:04.965 --> 01:22:06.185
[SPEAKER_09]: She's going to find something.

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:10.226
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, well... She's looking over... Let's make fun of the Barbie pad some more.

01:22:11.347 --> 01:22:11.967
[SPEAKER_09]: Barbie pad.

01:22:11.987 --> 01:22:15.488
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think there'll be a Ken... Do you think there'll be a Ken pad, too?

01:22:15.968 --> 01:22:16.548
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, blue?

01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:25.632
[SPEAKER_11]: So, now, the Barbie pad, does that go with the new Barbie with the wonderful... The Barbie pad gives protections in the front and back, and also on the sides.

01:22:25.672 --> 01:22:26.432
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got the wings.

01:22:27.432 --> 01:22:29.074
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the new Barbie pad right there.

01:22:31.515 --> 01:22:36.319
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie found the link to the... Somebody just posted it in the chatroom.

01:22:36.339 --> 01:22:37.239
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually just beat you to it.

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.541
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like Slinky made that post in the chatroom here.

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:42.403
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, SoCalKicks suggested the G.I.

01:22:42.443 --> 01:22:43.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Marchathon.

01:22:44.657 --> 01:22:44.877
[SPEAKER_04]: G.I.

01:22:44.897 --> 01:22:48.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Marcheson SoCalKicks is witty tonight.

01:22:48.138 --> 01:22:49.319
[SPEAKER_09]: He's on the ball.

01:22:49.379 --> 01:22:49.859
[SPEAKER_09]: He's too funny.

01:22:49.899 --> 01:22:54.280
[SPEAKER_12]: But this machine, it's like, it would probably be as tall as me.

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:54.880
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:57.221
[SPEAKER_09]: It is kind of more like a little kid's machine.

01:22:57.261 --> 01:22:58.341
[SPEAKER_12]: It has this cutesy pad.

01:22:58.382 --> 01:23:02.483
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a solo, but it has like a flower shape with an up-down, left-right arrow.

01:23:03.203 --> 01:23:05.624
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just absolutely adorable.

01:23:05.644 --> 01:23:06.944
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute.

01:23:06.984 --> 01:23:11.926
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like it's... I don't know if anybody knows Manders, but it looks about as tall as her.

01:23:14.347 --> 01:23:15.388
[SPEAKER_09]: Only $800.

01:23:15.508 --> 01:23:16.649
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, Jamie?

01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:19.112
[SPEAKER_09]: Want to pool our money together and buy it?

01:23:19.132 --> 01:23:20.773
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have $10 on the couch.

01:23:21.574 --> 01:23:25.558
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I've got about $50 in my collection bottle.

01:23:25.838 --> 01:23:27.280
[SPEAKER_09]: We could sell Dave on the street.

01:23:28.081 --> 01:23:29.122
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he could get us about $3.

01:23:29.162 --> 01:23:35.227
[SPEAKER_12]: That thing is so cute.

01:23:35.508 --> 01:23:36.168
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very cute.

01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:36.589
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

01:23:36.689 --> 01:23:37.369
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute with a K.

01:23:38.615 --> 01:23:39.876
[SPEAKER_09]: It would never deal with small children again.

01:24:01.258 --> 01:24:06.222
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob just said that the machine should put out.

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:07.443
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for clarifying.

01:24:07.483 --> 01:24:07.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

01:24:08.684 --> 01:24:10.205
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that whole Jenny Rom talk, you know.

01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:17.871
[SPEAKER_09]: What else am I being given?

01:24:17.951 --> 01:24:19.152
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm being given all these other links.

01:24:19.192 --> 01:24:19.572
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

01:24:19.632 --> 01:24:24.156
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's... This is called Chatroom Sends Me Random Shit and I Look It Up.

01:24:25.837 --> 01:24:27.599
[SPEAKER_12]: Rave Station!

01:24:27.619 --> 01:24:28.479
[SPEAKER_09]: Rave Station!

01:24:30.643 --> 01:24:30.883
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:24:31.244 --> 01:24:32.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a rave in your house.

01:24:34.106 --> 01:24:34.686
[SPEAKER_12]: E not included.

01:24:35.627 --> 01:24:36.628
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, E not included.

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.531
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this?

01:24:40.731 --> 01:24:42.092
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is the Barbie dance pad again.

01:24:42.112 --> 01:24:44.433
[SPEAKER_09]: I think somebody just posted that again for somebody who missed it the first time.

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:45.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:48.557
[SPEAKER_12]: The Harry Potter vibrating broom palace.

01:24:49.858 --> 01:24:50.578
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

01:24:51.038 --> 01:24:53.240
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the worst picture I've ever seen.

01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.101
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at this.

01:24:54.121 --> 01:24:58.364
[SPEAKER_12]: Supposedly, it's supposed to be the Nimbus 2000 toy broom, and the thing vibrates.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.742
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's about the width of it.

01:25:01.802 --> 01:25:07.227
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at how that little kid is holding his little broom.

01:25:08.728 --> 01:25:09.769
[SPEAKER_09]: And it vibrates.

01:25:11.311 --> 01:25:12.492
[SPEAKER_09]: Every little girl's dream.

01:25:12.632 --> 01:25:14.334
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has the smile on his face.

01:25:18.134 --> 01:25:20.237
[SPEAKER_09]: This has absolutely nothing to do with DDR, but it's fucking funny.

01:25:20.257 --> 01:25:20.698
[SPEAKER_09]: Fly the broom.

01:25:21.979 --> 01:25:23.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold the shaft of the broom.

01:25:23.902 --> 01:25:24.803
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody say, up!

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:35.258
[SPEAKER_12]: Dear Diary, today I sold my design for the Nimbus 2000 broom to Mattel, and they bought it.

01:25:35.954 --> 01:25:40.015
[SPEAKER_12]: So now my personal vibrating tool is going to be carried around by small children.

01:25:40.315 --> 01:25:42.255
[SPEAKER_12]: Yet another insidious Maoki plot.

01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:42.776
[SPEAKER_12]: I rule.

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:49.057
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Konami wants me to point out that it does have a warning label on it that says, Warning, this toy does not fly.

01:25:50.997 --> 01:25:51.638
[SPEAKER_12]: That is cool.

01:25:53.218 --> 01:25:55.238
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't go jumping off the roof.

01:25:56.779 --> 01:25:57.959
[SPEAKER_09]: Little kids have done that, you know.

01:25:59.585 --> 01:26:03.306
[SPEAKER_09]: sat on their Aladdin magic carpet and jumped off the roof and fallen to their deaths and wondered why.

01:26:03.487 --> 01:26:05.327
[SPEAKER_12]: But mommy, I was thinking happy thoughts.

01:26:05.687 --> 01:26:11.590
[SPEAKER_10]: No, see, what you do is you're supposed to stay on flat ground and it lifts off from the ground.

01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:13.530
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like it just kind of glides.

01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:14.411
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a glider.

01:26:14.971 --> 01:26:15.571
[SPEAKER_10]: It flies.

01:26:15.691 --> 01:26:16.492
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't glide.

01:26:17.072 --> 01:26:18.492
[SPEAKER_10]: It flies off the ground.

01:26:18.572 --> 01:26:20.033
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't glide from the top down.

01:26:22.082 --> 01:26:26.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Twin posts a nice little, you know how Amazon has the talkback, you can comment on these things.

01:26:26.744 --> 01:26:37.868
[SPEAKER_09]: So a mother writes, My son has enjoyed zooming around, pretending he's flying, and it's important to stress to younger kids that they're only pretending and that brooms can't really fly, playing kidditch, and so on.

01:26:38.188 --> 01:26:42.409
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion-sensitive sound effects are apparently fun for him, but they do get kind of old.

01:26:43.410 --> 01:26:47.291
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that the broom looks just like the one in the movie doesn't hurt, as far as he's concerned, too.

01:26:48.809 --> 01:26:51.170
[SPEAKER_12]: Dear Diary, children are stupid.

01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:54.011
[SPEAKER_12]: They think that they can fly with a toy broom.

01:26:54.331 --> 01:26:55.412
[SPEAKER_12]: Ha ha ha ha.

01:26:56.732 --> 01:26:57.753
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I should do a diary.

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:00.914
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should make Naoki's diary.

01:27:01.454 --> 01:27:02.655
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get Naoki a dead journal.

01:27:02.855 --> 01:27:05.856
[SPEAKER_12]: We should make the Orange Lounge dead journal.

01:27:06.456 --> 01:27:07.617
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll have to look into that.

01:27:08.237 --> 01:27:08.717
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.

01:27:09.898 --> 01:27:11.959
[SPEAKER_12]: Dear Diary, we're taking over the world.

01:27:12.339 --> 01:27:14.620
[SPEAKER_12]: We've kidnapped Naoki and picked his brain.

01:27:16.954 --> 01:27:17.454
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

01:27:18.535 --> 01:27:23.397
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we want to do your sim update?

01:27:23.917 --> 01:27:25.097
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, let's do your sim update.

01:27:25.578 --> 01:27:25.938
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:27:26.418 --> 01:27:32.060
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I also promised we'd plug one of Loki's other creations here.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:35.361
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to play one of your songs tonight, Loki.

01:27:35.502 --> 01:27:37.042
[SPEAKER_09]: So give us your sim update first, please.

01:27:37.102 --> 01:27:38.183
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, sim update.

01:27:38.423 --> 01:27:41.364
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, no new DWI versions.

01:27:42.004 --> 01:27:46.886
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't care, I've abandoned all hope for DWI since StepMania has surpassed them.

01:27:47.186 --> 01:27:50.848
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to be a pro DWI guy, but I'm sorry.

01:27:51.749 --> 01:27:53.869
[SPEAKER_11]: I've found StepMania and I love it.

01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:56.351
[SPEAKER_11]: So, go StepMania!

01:27:56.791 --> 01:28:00.653
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, supposedly a new version coming out pretty soon, StepMania 6.

01:28:00.773 --> 01:28:02.653
[SPEAKER_11]: For some reason I already have StepMania 6.

01:28:03.394 --> 01:28:05.875
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, you know, whatever, CVS build version.

01:28:06.435 --> 01:28:09.898
[SPEAKER_11]: No, didn't you say that Step Mania 6 was first comprised of some other copy?

01:28:09.938 --> 01:28:14.162
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't like the actual Step Mania thing, and now I guess they're doing an official one or something?

01:28:14.182 --> 01:28:14.883
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, whatever I said.

01:28:14.903 --> 01:28:15.283
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:28:15.683 --> 01:28:21.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, and then there's also a nice little Max 2 skin that's going to be released that's pretty funny.

01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:25.432
[SPEAKER_11]: So that'll be coming out pretty soon, probably next week or so.

01:28:26.513 --> 01:28:28.335
[SPEAKER_11]: No new DDR PC characters...

01:28:29.055 --> 01:28:29.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Tourney Mix 2.

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:33.919
[SPEAKER_11]: It's wrapping up as of tonight, so we'll have the results next week for you guys.

01:28:34.359 --> 01:28:37.161
[SPEAKER_11]: See who won that, and that'll be fun.

01:28:37.701 --> 01:28:38.922
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't enter, don't care.

01:28:39.883 --> 01:28:42.184
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see, other news.

01:28:43.005 --> 01:28:49.229
[SPEAKER_11]: It may be possible that I might be starting a file serve on the DDR Maniacs chatroom.

01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:54.953
[SPEAKER_11]: So all 1,300 of my DWIs out there... You're going to give them away?! !

01:28:55.706 --> 01:29:02.888
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe, I don't know, I have to see, because I'm going to be doing this at work, so I have a T1 line constantly running for people to steal it.

01:29:02.908 --> 01:29:07.109
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to see how much hard drive space I have at my computer at work, and if the firewall will allow it.

01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:09.770
[SPEAKER_11]: So, maybe, maybe not.

01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:16.452
[SPEAKER_09]: It might not happen, but... Oh, somebody's suggesting you should do that file serve in Orange Lounge to get more people to come to the channel.

01:29:17.172 --> 01:29:17.552
[SPEAKER_11]: I could.

01:29:17.572 --> 01:29:18.093
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:29:19.273 --> 01:29:19.473
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:29:20.069 --> 01:29:21.871
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a thought.

01:29:21.891 --> 01:29:24.534
[SPEAKER_11]: See, other than that, there was a pretty cool thing I found about Step Mania.

01:29:24.635 --> 01:29:26.276
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a super shuffle mode.

01:29:26.417 --> 01:29:27.358
[SPEAKER_11]: That's also very fun.

01:29:27.638 --> 01:29:28.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Super shuffle?

01:29:28.459 --> 01:29:28.679
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:29.801
[SPEAKER_09]: Super duper shuffle?

01:29:29.821 --> 01:29:34.266
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that like all notes are completely randomized, not just all notes from up go to left or whatever?

01:29:34.747 --> 01:29:36.489
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that make us even more of a super duper power?

01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:40.551
[SPEAKER_11]: I have an addition for your sim update.

01:29:40.571 --> 01:29:50.116
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this is one you haven't really been following, but remember when we talked a couple weeks ago about the Dreamcast one that's coming out, the Feet of Fury?

01:29:59.546 --> 01:30:05.289
[SPEAKER_12]: I still play both of my Dreamcasts I played DDR the other day on my Dreamcast

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.022
[SPEAKER_09]: Cryptic Illusions Games Dreamcast Emulator

01:30:39.497 --> 01:30:41.819
[SPEAKER_09]: They released an update on September 20th.

01:30:41.939 --> 01:30:45.221
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying the release size is only going to be about 28 megs.

01:30:45.581 --> 01:30:48.543
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be seven songs in the beta they're going to release very soon.

01:30:49.404 --> 01:30:51.145
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be eight characters in it.

01:30:52.004 --> 01:30:59.170
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have a step editor, which is going to be... They've used it to create the steps they've got so far.

01:31:00.811 --> 01:31:10.518
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to have a swap CD capability, where you can use the swap CD menu, open up CDs and play your own songs with the music in Og Vorbis format, whatever that is.

01:31:11.078 --> 01:31:12.399
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Loki?

01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:14.001
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a new version.

01:31:14.221 --> 01:31:17.343
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like MP3s, except they're better quality and smaller size.

01:31:17.483 --> 01:31:17.763
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

01:31:18.324 --> 01:31:21.046
[SPEAKER_09]: And the steps in the standard Dance with Intensity format.

01:31:21.953 --> 01:31:28.477
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the basic stuff is supported, but nothing fourth mixer above, like BPM changes, pauses, freeze arrows, triplets, etc.

01:31:29.998 --> 01:31:31.679
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be very basic sorts of edits.

01:31:32.739 --> 01:31:33.840
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll post more about that.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.662
[SPEAKER_09]: Tentatively, they're going to have step files on the VMU.

01:31:38.302 --> 01:31:41.724
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll let you edit your steps for your own songs without having to burn a bunch of CDs.

01:31:42.505 --> 01:31:43.105
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be pretty cool.

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:46.205
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see about that.

01:31:46.866 --> 01:31:49.746
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumor is that's going to be released on October 1st, I guess.

01:31:50.206 --> 01:31:52.267
[SPEAKER_09]: So keep an eye on CAgames.com.

01:31:52.767 --> 01:31:58.408
[SPEAKER_09]: And as soon as we get our little hands on it, we'll give you a full review right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:58.888 --> 01:31:59.648
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the date today?

01:32:00.028 --> 01:32:00.448
[SPEAKER_09]: The 22nd.

01:32:00.988 --> 01:32:02.689
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got about... Oh, actually, no, it won't be next week.

01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:03.369
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be in a couple weeks.

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:08.890
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have it soon.

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:10.110
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have it soon.

01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:13.111
[SPEAKER_09]: When we get it, we'll tell you about it, as we always do here on Orange Lounge.

01:32:14.518 --> 01:32:17.520
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take one more quick break and then come back and wrap up the show.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.742
[SPEAKER_09]: But actually for this break, we've got a very special song.

01:32:21.122 --> 01:32:22.222
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you want to tell us about this song?

01:32:22.242 --> 01:32:24.003
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Night by Loki.

01:32:24.023 --> 01:32:25.264
[SPEAKER_09]: You want us to play this song for you?

01:32:25.284 --> 01:32:26.305
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is one of my old songs.

01:32:26.325 --> 01:32:27.305
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you wanted me to play this one.

01:32:27.325 --> 01:32:28.366
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to play one of the other ones instead?

01:32:28.925 --> 01:32:29.385
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we play two?

01:32:29.846 --> 01:32:30.326
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we play what?

01:32:30.506 --> 01:32:32.267
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they're kind of long, actually.

01:32:32.447 --> 01:32:36.190
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're all kind of long, so I just want to do one, if that's cool.

01:32:36.230 --> 01:32:37.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's play a newer one.

01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:39.472
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Nightmare's pretty good.

01:32:40.793 --> 01:32:43.695
[SPEAKER_11]: How about... Sorry, let me bring up your list.

01:32:44.736 --> 01:32:45.416
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

01:32:46.097 --> 01:32:47.217
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's start with...

01:32:50.672 --> 01:32:51.132
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Forest, Jenny Rom,

01:33:20.576 --> 01:33:21.918
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try and get to those.

01:33:22.218 --> 01:33:26.022
[SPEAKER_09]: If we don't get to them during the show, we'll do them during the afterbirth, okay?

01:33:26.102 --> 01:33:26.422
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.

01:33:26.882 --> 01:33:27.423
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we go.

01:33:27.463 --> 01:33:31.407
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Loki with Metropolis here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:10.669
Thanks for watching!

01:35:31.048 --> 01:35:31.591
Thanks for watching!

01:37:41.957 --> 01:37:42.718
Thank you for watching!

01:38:08.255 --> 01:38:09.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:38:33.342 --> 01:38:39.047
[SPEAKER_06]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:38:44.445 --> 01:38:46.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:46.026 --> 01:38:47.887
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to give a plug for people that like that song?

01:38:47.907 --> 01:38:49.468
[SPEAKER_09]: You got some good feedback in the chat room there, Loki.

01:38:49.488 --> 01:38:53.990
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to give a link for people that want to get more of your stuff?

01:38:54.370 --> 01:38:56.972
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, I've got some stuff on mp3.com right now.

01:38:56.992 --> 01:39:01.754
[SPEAKER_11]: I went under the name of Nightmare Hunter, so that was my old thing I used to go under.

01:39:01.794 --> 01:39:06.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, it's mp3.com slash nightmare underscore hunter.

01:39:06.857 --> 01:39:10.379
[SPEAKER_11]: So just look for that, and you'll find a bunch of my old stuff on there.

01:39:11.739 --> 01:39:12.280
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty good one.

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:12.860
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

01:39:13.928 --> 01:39:14.208
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks.

01:39:14.328 --> 01:39:15.768
[SPEAKER_11]: My one song on there, I have two.

01:39:15.868 --> 01:39:18.309
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one called Dark Side and My Nightmare.

01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:23.970
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, stupidmp3.com copied over My Nightmare with Dark Side, so I have two copies of that song on there.

01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:25.991
[SPEAKER_11]: And My Nightmare was really awesome.

01:39:26.351 --> 01:39:29.371
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that song, so if we can get to play that maybe by the end of the show, maybe.

01:39:29.391 --> 01:39:29.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:39:29.892 --> 01:39:30.392
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be cool.

01:39:30.452 --> 01:39:31.532
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get that worked in there somehow.

01:39:31.692 --> 01:39:34.052
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, we'll do it in the super secret after birth.

01:39:34.292 --> 01:39:35.073
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:39:36.293 --> 01:39:37.413
[SPEAKER_12]: Now not so super secret.

01:39:39.154 --> 01:39:41.034
[SPEAKER_09]: Twins putting a link in the chat room for everybody.

01:39:42.452 --> 01:39:44.734
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, one more topic I want to talk about before the end of the show.

01:39:45.194 --> 01:39:45.494
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry?

01:39:46.255 --> 01:39:46.495
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

01:39:47.275 --> 01:39:50.418
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about fair pricing for DDR.

01:39:50.618 --> 01:39:56.702
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's been some local arcades in the area that have kind of been wondering, you know, what's a fair price for us to be charging for DDR?

01:39:56.742 --> 01:39:58.343
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought I'd take your guys' suggestions.

01:39:58.783 --> 01:40:02.866
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people bitch and bitch and bitch about the Metreon being on the high end of places.

01:40:03.046 --> 01:40:06.809
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's either $1.50 or $2 a game for three songs.

01:40:07.009 --> 01:40:09.231
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a little bit overpriced, even though it is downtown...

01:40:10.638 --> 01:40:14.059
[SPEAKER_11]: But you could get on TV on that show Extended Play.

01:40:16.299 --> 01:40:17.740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's worth the $2, man.

01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:19.580
[SPEAKER_11]: Or not.

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.221
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that places like Matreon, that's way too much.

01:40:26.001 --> 01:40:36.224
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can see for newer mixes like Max 2 and maybe Max or Fifth Mix being four for three songs or something along that lines.

01:40:36.684 --> 01:40:38.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I know the...

01:40:39.808 --> 01:40:42.610
[SPEAKER_11]: One Riptide Arcade, is that the one at Pier 39?

01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:50.234
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that place has joint premium for Max 2, but it's like 8 quarters or something like that.

01:40:50.774 --> 01:40:54.236
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's expensive, but it's joint premium, so it's basically worth it.

01:40:55.297 --> 01:40:58.618
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you're saying is it costs $2 to play singles or doubles?

01:40:59.519 --> 01:41:00.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha ha.

01:41:00.599 --> 01:41:07.023
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you just find someone to split it with, because I never go to an arcade alone, like if I know that I'm not going to meet anyone there.

01:41:07.603 --> 01:41:08.444
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that kind of stuff.

01:41:09.284 --> 01:41:10.605
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gone to arcades alone.

01:41:11.686 --> 01:41:12.586
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody loves me.

01:41:13.287 --> 01:41:15.228
[SPEAKER_12]: I read the best to go to an arcade by myself.

01:41:15.568 --> 01:41:19.591
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but seriously, if I go to an arcade in Sacramento, I've never not seen anyone there.

01:41:19.711 --> 01:41:22.873
[SPEAKER_10]: Except that when they first got Max, I went there at 11 o'clock in the morning.

01:41:23.193 --> 01:41:23.894
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't see anyone there.

01:41:23.914 --> 01:41:25.575
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because they were asleep.

01:41:25.635 --> 01:41:27.236
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, okay, I must play Max.

01:41:27.356 --> 01:41:33.560
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I played Fantasy on Reverse, and I've never played a Reverse in my life.

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.202
[SPEAKER_09]: You had an interesting comment, Jamie, about Joint Premium.

01:41:36.322 --> 01:41:37.283
[SPEAKER_09]: Your thoughts on Joint Premium?

01:41:37.757 --> 01:41:39.678
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it makes sense to have older machines.

01:41:39.718 --> 01:41:42.920
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got multiple machines, have the older ones on joint premium.

01:41:43.641 --> 01:41:51.085
[SPEAKER_12]: That way you will encourage people to make use of those older machines too while you've got people that are on the more expensive machines.

01:41:51.425 --> 01:41:53.727
[SPEAKER_12]: That way all your machines will stay in use.

01:41:54.634 --> 01:41:56.396
[SPEAKER_09]: Good example is Scandia.

01:41:56.416 --> 01:41:58.638
[SPEAKER_09]: Over at Scandia, they've got the fourth mix.

01:41:59.179 --> 01:42:00.981
[SPEAKER_09]: Two tokens for three songs.

01:42:01.061 --> 01:42:02.362
[SPEAKER_09]: Joint premium is on.

01:42:02.843 --> 01:42:06.687
[SPEAKER_09]: So if two people want to play, it's one token for three songs apiece.

01:42:07.207 --> 01:42:07.928
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really nice.

01:42:08.068 --> 01:42:09.330
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's worked for me...

01:42:10.536 --> 01:42:15.460
[SPEAKER_09]: I've gotten back into playing doubles thanks to that, because doubles are always expensive, and I always bitch about how expensive double are.

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.144
[SPEAKER_09]: But for two tokens and joint premium being on, I can play three songs of doubles for two tokens.

01:42:20.184 --> 01:42:20.904
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really nice.

01:42:21.385 --> 01:42:22.085
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I like that.

01:42:22.906 --> 01:42:28.851
[SPEAKER_09]: And SoCalKicks is suggesting that, you know what, DarkSakura, you ought to just win the lottery and run an arcade the right way.

01:42:29.771 --> 01:42:32.033
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, if I could, you know I would.

01:42:32.513 --> 01:42:34.435
[SPEAKER_11]: And Scandia rules because they have bumper boats.

01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:39.419
[SPEAKER_12]: Scandia does indeed have bumper boats, and they have a batting cage.

01:42:41.164 --> 01:42:42.447
[SPEAKER_09]: So joint premium is really cool.

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:50.563
[SPEAKER_09]: So you think a fair price, if four tokens for three songs, let's say a dollar for three songs, too much?

01:42:50.583 --> 01:42:52.805
[SPEAKER_09]: I think 75 cents, a little more fair.

01:42:53.125 --> 01:42:55.507
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what's the most you will pay for DDR?

01:42:55.547 --> 01:42:59.310
[SPEAKER_09]: Have any of you ever paid to play DDR at the Metreon?

01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.650
[SPEAKER_09]: I have.

01:42:59.911 --> 01:43:04.614
[SPEAKER_12]: I paid $2 for three songs at Anime Expo my first year, but it was the first DDR machine I'd ever seen.

01:43:05.015 --> 01:43:05.795
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the third mix.

01:43:06.035 --> 01:43:11.600
[SPEAKER_11]: I played at the Metreon just because, like, yeah, it's the Metreon, and I didn't know about Gear 39, because that was stupid.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:34.611
[SPEAKER_11]: and so I paid way too much but yeah it's cool like I'm willing to pay a dollar for three songs I've gotten used to it because I remember when at first Roseville Golfland had gotten Guitar Freaks and there was all this people everyone was bitching including me going well it should be uh 75 cents for three songs or 50 cents for three songs because you know it's not DDR and DDR was

01:43:35.211 --> 01:43:37.452
[SPEAKER_11]: I paid $3 to play doubles at Phantomicon on a 4th bus machine.

01:43:37.472 --> 01:43:38.653
[SPEAKER_11]: If I made two years ago?

01:43:38.673 --> 01:43:39.213
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it two years ago?

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.020
[SPEAKER_12]: This year.

01:43:55.161 --> 01:43:55.781
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, they had it this year.

01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:58.003
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't realize.

01:43:58.103 --> 01:44:03.328
[SPEAKER_12]: The year before, I paid $1.50 to play each game of DDR because it was a fourth plus.

01:44:05.150 --> 01:44:10.575
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, my first Anime Expo, I paid $2 a game to play on my very first ever DDR machine.

01:44:12.196 --> 01:44:14.118
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, now we can afford to be picky.

01:44:16.715 --> 01:44:22.558
[SPEAKER_09]: I paid the full price over at the Metron a couple times just because I wanted to say I played DDR at the Metron.

01:44:22.598 --> 01:44:23.198
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all it was.

01:44:23.218 --> 01:44:25.679
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say, okay, you know, this is kind of like... I was there that time.

01:44:25.699 --> 01:44:26.480
[SPEAKER_09]: I played one game.

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.882
[SPEAKER_12]: That was it for me because, you know, yay 5th Mix.

01:44:29.942 --> 01:44:31.403
[SPEAKER_12]: I could have played that anywhere at the time.

01:44:33.284 --> 01:44:33.784
[SPEAKER_12]: Not now.

01:44:33.804 --> 01:44:36.586
[SPEAKER_12]: 5th Mix is becoming a relic along with... I know.

01:44:36.646 --> 01:44:38.206
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Max 2s are everywhere.

01:44:38.246 --> 01:44:39.767
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't find the old stuff anymore.

01:44:39.787 --> 01:44:42.729
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Max 2's cool and all, but sometimes you just want to be old school.

01:44:42.749 --> 01:44:44.390
[SPEAKER_12]: You still need to get to Auburn to play the 2nd Mix.

01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:50.272
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be one of the definitive moments of my life, is playing a real second base.

01:45:08.274 --> 01:45:13.698
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just one game, you know, and plus I got to play the old school 1.5 mix, and how often do you get to play that anymore?

01:45:14.258 --> 01:45:18.801
[SPEAKER_09]: It was expensive, yes I was ripped off, but you know, it was fun, that's what it's all about, it was worth it.

01:45:18.881 --> 01:45:27.887
[SPEAKER_12]: Well the thing about that particular machine, the one that was out in the hall outside the movie theater, is you get the glare from those big windows outside, and half of the machine was faded in color.

01:45:28.047 --> 01:45:28.287
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

01:45:28.527 --> 01:45:33.290
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if I were a regular gamer living in San Francisco, I would not go to the Metreon on a regular basis.

01:45:33.370 --> 01:45:34.710
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I know someone who does.

01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:37.251
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, why don't you go over to Riptide Arcade?

01:45:37.271 --> 01:45:39.472
[SPEAKER_09]: They got more money and they got a better deal on their games.

01:45:39.512 --> 01:45:40.233
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you go over there?

01:45:40.593 --> 01:45:43.254
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just kind of like, oh, I don't feel like walking over there.

01:45:43.314 --> 01:45:44.715
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't feel like taking bar to the bus.

01:45:44.795 --> 01:45:47.956
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just kind of like, well, if you really want to pay it, then go for it.

01:45:48.036 --> 01:45:51.338
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh...

01:45:54.978 --> 01:45:57.400
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that does it for DDR at the Metron.

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.843
[SPEAKER_09]: And what about, so we think fair prices, typical standard is about what, 25 cents each song?

01:46:03.344 --> 01:46:03.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty fair?

01:46:03.764 --> 01:46:06.266
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd probably say for a max two, fair is a dollar for three.

01:46:08.247 --> 01:46:13.791
[SPEAKER_12]: For, even for fifth mix, for fifth mix I'd say a dollar for four, anything under.

01:46:14.351 --> 01:46:24.498
[SPEAKER_12]: For third mix, for actually fourth mix and under, I would say three for four, or two for three, and leave it at that.

01:46:25.258 --> 01:46:27.900
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, for 1.5, you know, one for one.

01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:30.942
[SPEAKER_09]: SoCalKicks suggests... Or maybe one for three, I don't know.

01:46:31.522 --> 01:46:34.304
[SPEAKER_09]: SoCalKicks suggests 30 cents for five songs on a max too.

01:46:34.324 --> 01:46:36.845
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it has to be something realistic where the arcade owners are going to make their money back.

01:46:37.105 --> 01:46:39.286
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's a nickel arcade, that's a whole different story.

01:46:41.238 --> 01:46:45.600
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're going to take one more quick break and then come back and wrap up the show.

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.501
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why we're taking this break, there's some songs I really want to play for you guys.

01:46:48.861 --> 01:46:54.124
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got Jenny Rom with a song called Do You Want to Flirt, which is one of the producers' favorite songs.

01:46:54.484 --> 01:47:00.507
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're going to hear the full five-minute version of Steve Reiner with Dark Black Forest, Long Trip.

01:47:00.907 --> 01:47:04.748
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to play those and we're going to come back, wrap things up, and that'll be a show.

01:47:04.768 --> 01:47:06.029
[SPEAKER_09]: See you in a little bit.

01:47:34.927 --> 01:47:36.068
Thanks for watching!

01:48:58.925 --> 01:48:59.428
Thank you.

01:50:24.111 --> 01:50:25.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:52:11.385 --> 01:52:13.047
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long way to go, honey.

01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:16.212
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I'm afraid.

01:52:16.232 --> 01:52:17.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are we going?

01:52:19.176 --> 01:52:21.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the dark, black forest.

01:53:43.887 --> 01:53:46.444
[SPEAKER_04]: into the dark black forest.

01:55:53.843 --> 01:55:57.984
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:55:58.244 --> 01:55:59.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?

01:55:59.965 --> 01:56:00.325
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

01:56:00.445 --> 01:56:04.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we care what people think of us?

01:56:04.726 --> 01:56:06.566
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

01:56:06.586 --> 01:56:08.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:56:08.507 --> 01:56:11.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

01:56:12.588 --> 01:56:14.408
[SPEAKER_07]: Extreme Bomani Radio.

01:56:14.648 --> 01:56:17.329
[SPEAKER_07]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:17.867 --> 01:56:21.710
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're coming up on the end of the show here, Orange Lounge Radio episode number 13.

01:56:22.371 --> 01:56:24.252
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a big debate about that in the beginning of the show, by the way.

01:56:24.272 --> 01:56:27.535
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just going around the room collecting closing thoughts.

01:56:28.215 --> 01:56:29.396
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, any closing thoughts?

01:56:32.399 --> 01:56:34.160
[SPEAKER_11]: No, duct tape is cool.

01:56:35.161 --> 01:56:36.002
[SPEAKER_09]: Duct tape is cool.

01:56:36.022 --> 01:56:36.802
[SPEAKER_11]: Duct tape is cool.

01:56:36.902 --> 01:56:38.664
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, Naoki owns duct tape.

01:56:38.784 --> 01:56:40.325
[SPEAKER_11]: He will become one with duct tape.

01:56:40.465 --> 01:56:43.487
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, I've found many uses for duct tape.

01:56:43.848 --> 01:56:46.390
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I'll strip down Politary and... Anyway...

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:52.044
[SPEAKER_11]: I used it to attach my male member for when I wanted to change sexes.

01:56:52.284 --> 01:56:54.686
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, switching between Paul Terry and Naoki.

01:56:54.887 --> 01:56:57.629
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you ever see that one scene in Silence of the Lambs where it... Never mind.

01:56:58.429 --> 01:56:59.250
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't.

01:57:00.571 --> 01:57:01.032
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

01:57:01.052 --> 01:57:02.092
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dave, any thoughts from you?

01:57:02.132 --> 01:57:03.313
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dave, any final thoughts from you?

01:57:04.534 --> 01:57:06.896
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... Football is cool.

01:57:07.617 --> 01:57:09.879
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope DDR USA is.

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:13.021
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to get a Japanese PS2.

01:57:15.217 --> 01:57:17.102
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, 2DX rule.

01:57:18.465 --> 01:57:19.688
[SPEAKER_09]: Any final thoughts from you, Jamie?

01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:21.012
[SPEAKER_12]: I like fire.

01:57:22.122 --> 01:57:24.363
[SPEAKER_09]: I like fire too, and that's my final thought.

01:57:24.944 --> 01:57:26.825
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thanks.

01:57:27.786 --> 01:57:29.247
[SPEAKER_12]: We light my fire.

01:57:29.287 --> 01:57:30.187

01:58:29.481 --> 01:58:30.262
