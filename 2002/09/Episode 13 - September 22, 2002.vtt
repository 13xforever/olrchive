00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
It's a video tape! Put it in, put it in!

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Boring!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
This DDR SUCKS!

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
She layed pins on her ass, eh?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
The last Metroid is in captivity.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
The galaxy is at peace.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
My kind of people and assholes.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
One.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Warner.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
He's good.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.640
fit by that much. That's Dr. Evil's cat. How can you tell? I never forget a pussy.

01:26.640 --> 01:33.360
37! My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks! In a row? And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:33.360 --> 01:40.200
You are the weakest link to the fight. So you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!

01:40.200 --> 01:50.120
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count. I would like, if I may, to take you

01:50.120 --> 01:59.120
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.120
Sky. Do I look like the weather girl?

02:01.120 --> 02:04.120
Everything alright? Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.120
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06.120 --> 02:12.120
We are live, and this is episode number 13 for September the 22nd of 2002.

02:12.120 --> 02:18.120
You're tuned in to the Bamani Scene's most stupendous radio station of all things Bamane.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.120
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skye.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.120
This is 14?

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
Where's 14?

02:24.120 --> 02:25.120
Are you sure?

02:25.120 --> 02:26.120
Yes.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.120
No, no, no, 10.5 was the one at Golf Land.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.120
That wasn't really 11.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.120
And then 11 was the week that Jamie came back, and 12 was...

02:35.120 --> 02:36.120
This is 14.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.120
Well, then we're not going to have an episode 13.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.120
We're skipping it like hotels do.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.120
You want to make this episode 14?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.120
13.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.120
Okay, 13.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.120
So lucky 13.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.120
13.3? 13.2?

02:47.120 --> 02:59.120
The voice you might hear in the background is always resident happy bunny.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.120
Please say hello to Jamie Summers.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.120
also known as Dark Secular?

03:03.120 --> 03:06.120
Hey, don't forget about Harvey, he has to know...

03:06.120 --> 03:07.120
Who's who?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
He has to pick up...

03:08.120 --> 03:09.120
Your imaginary friend?

03:09.120 --> 03:11.120
Didn't you see that movie with Harvey?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.120
No.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.120
Okay, I have to give him proper hi.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.120
Okay.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.120
Hi, give me caffeine and money.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.120
Now, please.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.120
You are tuned in to the Bamani Scene's most stupendous radio station of all things Bamani.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.120
It's a small intimate house tonight, but we're going to have fun with this anyway.

03:28.120 --> 03:33.620
We are joined by a very large panel tonight, a panel of one. Say hello.

03:33.620 --> 03:34.620
Dark Sacral.

03:34.620 --> 03:35.620
I hate nature!

03:35.620 --> 03:38.120
Tonight's just a technical mess up show.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.620
I hate nature! I wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell!

03:41.620 --> 03:44.620
I'm really out of it going into tonight's show, by the way.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.620
Say hello, everybody, to Loki.

03:48.620 --> 03:49.620
Hello, everybody.

03:51.620 --> 03:52.620
Say hi again.

03:52.620 --> 03:53.620
Hello again.

03:54.620 --> 03:55.120
Who's again?

03:55.120 --> 03:59.120
Oh, we have a doorbell. Somebody else is here. I guess we'll see who that is.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.120
We'll be talking to everybody...

04:01.120 --> 04:05.120
They better have money. We will take bribes to be on the show.

04:05.120 --> 04:12.120
You know what? Why don't we just say the hell with Orange Lounge? We'll almost be two hours of just us just kind of ranting about everything crappy.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.120
It is Dave. Say hi to Dave.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.120
Say hello everybody to the...

04:16.120 --> 04:18.120
Hell, Victoria!

04:18.120 --> 04:25.960
We'll be talking to everybody a little more a bit later, but first I'm going to take a

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
quick break.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.560
So that people can go pee.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.680
Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?

04:31.680 --> 04:33.680
What's our deal?

04:33.680 --> 04:34.680
All right.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.160
We'll get to those FUs of the week.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.200
If you want to send me your FUs of the week, just join our chat room.

04:39.200 --> 04:46.200

04:47.480 --> 04:53.480

05:36.800 --> 05:39.800
Let's start with some sauna shall we

06:06.800 --> 06:12.800
Tell me, was this true?

06:12.800 --> 06:19.800
When you do leave the edge passing by

06:19.800 --> 06:25.800
No one cares to stop

06:25.800 --> 06:32.800
Can you see me fall above?

06:32.800 --> 06:37.800
Do you share my frozen memories?

06:38.800 --> 06:41.800
Set it down

06:42.800 --> 06:45.800
Let it be alone

06:45.800 --> 06:48.800
Silent time

06:49.800 --> 06:53.800
There ain't none of us

06:54.800 --> 06:57.800
Let us love the heat

06:57.800 --> 07:02.800
Please give me brand new star of mine

07:02.800 --> 07:04.800
Just a game

07:04.800 --> 07:08.800
Once more

07:08.800 --> 07:12.800
Let's not fake me

07:12.800 --> 07:17.800
Please give me brave one yesterday

07:17.800 --> 07:19.800
It's not for me

07:19.800 --> 07:24.800
Take my hand

07:24.800 --> 07:33.760
Let it snow face me

07:33.760 --> 07:40.760
I know, I know, what you need is I know, I know, what you need is

08:03.760 --> 08:07.760
I do, I do, what you want in crisis I know, I know

08:07.760 --> 08:11.760
In my face, being just for you

08:11.760 --> 08:14.760
You'll be the funny girl, happy when me down

08:14.760 --> 08:16.760
And we'll meet in love before ever

08:16.760 --> 08:19.760
You're such a lovely girl, this one is a girl

08:19.760 --> 08:22.760
Now this one is amazing, baby, see the baby

08:22.760 --> 08:25.760
You're a lovely girl, lovely darling girl

08:25.760 --> 08:28.760
I've been living on it for a long while

08:28.760 --> 08:31.760
You'll be here, everywhere, in the air

08:31.760 --> 08:33.960
Diggy diggy, how's your nigga?

08:33.960 --> 08:37.260
I need a lovely girl, where's he when he can?

08:37.260 --> 08:39.760
And when we don't love people there, I hope

08:39.760 --> 08:42.760
That the lovely girl, be a quality girl

08:42.760 --> 08:45.460
Not only for me, but really, hey, she's getting ready

08:45.460 --> 08:48.460
Need a lovely girl, lovely girl nigga

08:48.460 --> 08:50.960
Flying and living, love, need a fly for a while

08:50.960 --> 08:54.160
So be me anywhere, in the air

08:54.160 --> 08:56.160
I'm diggin', diggin', I'm goin' again

09:24.160 --> 09:25.200
They kind of...

09:25.200 --> 09:28.760
It was kind of like an abstraction of your voice. It was paint. It was modern art.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.100
I like that.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.280
Anywho...

09:31.280 --> 09:33.300
I sound cooler than that.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.160
That was cool though. It was like, you know, it was like you were swallowing...

09:36.160 --> 09:43.920
You were swallowing a butterfly. Orange lounge.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.580
Oh boy, oh boy.

09:46.580 --> 09:51.600
Let's see. What do we want to talk about at the start of the show? Should we talk about DDR Max USA?

09:51.600 --> 09:56.360
whole lot of news on DDR Max USA this week. Should we talk about some of that?

09:56.360 --> 10:03.640
Obviously the most obvious news about the new mix, the Max USA, is that one of the new

10:03.640 --> 10:11.000
licensed songs has been confirmed. So we do know that there will be a song, and I'm trying

10:11.000 --> 10:14.100
to pull up the full name of the song here, I forgot it off the top of my head. Thank

10:14.100 --> 10:19.500
you. Thank you. It's called Dark Black Forest Short Trip and it's by Steve Reiner. And this

10:19.500 --> 10:21.540
This news was confirmed through his site.

10:21.540 --> 10:25.500
He said on his official site, hey, I've got this song going on DDR Max soon.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.620
Actually, it was like a Dutch site, though, so it was more like, you know, oh, it was

10:29.620 --> 10:33.900
German, so it was like, ah, we've got DDR Max, ooh.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.900
I know, for Wienerschmückel.

10:35.900 --> 10:36.900
No.

10:36.900 --> 10:41.300
You know what, that's, though, I think it's pretty cool.

10:41.300 --> 10:44.100
I've heard a little bit of it, and the song is really cool.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.940
We're going to play a demo version of that song for you in a little bit.

10:46.940 --> 10:49.920
We got like a two-minute demo mix of that song we're going to play for you.

10:49.920 --> 10:54.280
This probably isn't the four-minute real media file you've seen floating out the internet

10:54.280 --> 10:55.900
elsewhere.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.320
This is another take on the song.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.120
So we don't know which version exactly is going to be in DDR, but we'll see.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.760
We do know that this song, in one way or another, is going to show up in DDR Max.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.280
Sorry for asking, but when exactly does Max USA get released?

11:11.280 --> 11:12.440
I don't know.

11:12.440 --> 11:17.700
I believe the release date tentatively right now is November 5th.

11:17.700 --> 11:23.340
I had been hearing that it was supposed to be right after Thanksgiving for the first

11:23.340 --> 11:25.300
day of the Christmas shopping season.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.740
So we've heard everything in November.

11:27.740 --> 11:29.660
However, I actually pulled up an article here.

11:29.660 --> 11:34.880
This comes from SoCalKicks' site, available at SoCalKicks.com, and he actually had a chance

11:34.880 --> 11:39.780
to talk with Jason Enos, who is the, if you're online on any of the forums, I'm sure you

11:39.780 --> 11:43.380
know him as the Konami of America representative and they talked about a

11:43.380 --> 11:49.020
few couple things about DDR Max USA including foot ratings will be in DDR

11:49.020 --> 11:54.060
Max USA if you remember one big bitch about DDR Max the Japanese version when

11:54.060 --> 11:57.340
it first came out hit arcades that they replaced it with that groove radar and

11:57.340 --> 12:01.460
while that radar is cool it doesn't really tell you how hard a song is on a

12:01.460 --> 12:08.300
scale you know the cadence and everything so but you know the the one

12:08.300 --> 12:13.860
One good thing about the Groove Radar is that it does show you what type of song you're

12:13.860 --> 12:19.780
going to play, if you're stronger at doing lots of jumps or if you're stronger at doing

12:19.780 --> 12:21.420
running moves.

12:21.420 --> 12:23.080
That is one good thing about the Groove Radar.

12:23.080 --> 12:29.700
So you can still say, oh these are the 9-footers, these are the katas I have to pass.

12:29.700 --> 12:33.620
It's going to make me run all over the place.

12:33.620 --> 12:37.980
Next thing, it will append with DDR economics.

12:37.980 --> 12:43.380
sure how this is going to work. I have a hard time fathoming this as being a disk change,

12:43.380 --> 12:47.700
just like the kind of disk change you would see when third mix, the Japanese third mix,

12:47.700 --> 12:50.180
you could put in second and first mix and play things on the new interface.

12:50.180 --> 12:51.060
It actually is possible.

12:51.060 --> 12:53.820
Maybe that is what they're going to do, but it seems kind of...

12:53.820 --> 12:54.460
If you think about it...

12:54.460 --> 12:56.660
Between a PlayStation 2 game and a PlayStation 1 game, it seems a little...

12:56.660 --> 13:01.140
Well, if you think about it this way, all they have to do is actually load the game

13:01.140 --> 13:07.740
engine itself into memory, and then have it run songs off of the disk.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.940
maybe that's what they're gonna do is that would be very cool that was

13:09.940 --> 13:12.500
actually something I said I remember getting on form saying hey that would be

13:12.500 --> 13:15.380
awesome if they could do something like that at a pound especially I would have

13:15.380 --> 13:20.220
liked to have seen it not only that but economics append the USA mix but I guess

13:20.220 --> 13:22.740
we'll see it's a smart move it'll help them make more money for people who

13:22.740 --> 13:25.740
don't have it unfortunately they're still keeping some of the same songs on

13:25.740 --> 13:31.340
a DDR max USA that they had on economics and on

13:31.340 --> 13:39.340
But not too many, and we do know that there's what, like 20 lysa songs and 20 konami, something

13:39.340 --> 13:40.340
like that.

13:40.340 --> 13:43.680
I don't know exactly how the breakdown of songs works, and we're probably not going

13:43.680 --> 13:50.420
to know exactly for sure until we get a finalized song list, but it's going to be significant.

13:50.420 --> 13:52.340
Will there be freeze arrows in edits?

13:52.340 --> 13:53.340
I would think so.

13:53.340 --> 13:58.860
Yeah, if it's based off the max Japanese, you can do freezes in the max Japanese editing,

13:58.860 --> 14:01.680
I don't see why he wouldn't be able to do it in the US.

14:01.680 --> 14:05.600
And one more thing, it probably won't be like Conomics, but will the edits be able to be

14:05.600 --> 14:09.000
played on the machines in the arcade?

14:09.000 --> 14:13.200
No, because they're region coded, so it ain't going to work.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.200
There is one thing though...

14:14.200 --> 14:16.560
I don't know, couldn't you take Conomics edits and play them on a fourth mix machine?

14:16.560 --> 14:17.560
No, you couldn't.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
I don't remember, I never tried.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.280
The only thing that I would think might even be possible, and this is what I'm wondering

14:21.280 --> 14:26.700
if anyone's tried with Conomics, there's a little program for people who have a DEX drive.

14:26.700 --> 14:40.940
There's two things for edits that kind of set them out to work in a machine or not.

14:40.940 --> 14:46.500
You have region coding and then you also have it keeps track of what mix the actual thing

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
was on.

14:47.500 --> 14:52.220
Like I took a economics edit and changed it to a Japanese so it would play but it didn't

14:52.220 --> 14:56.540
work because it still detected that it was made from economics so it's not going to work.

15:26.540 --> 15:30.700
rewrites its name on it so you can actually have max link data with the

15:30.700 --> 15:34.420
songs like you know max to exclusive things like the whistle song have grades

15:34.420 --> 15:38.860
for that so it looks very interesting just kind of looking for some feedback

15:38.860 --> 15:46.660
in the chat room there is so Cal kicks wants to make it a point that there you

15:46.660 --> 15:50.980
don't know if a new USA mix is going to come out or not yet it's still it's

15:50.980 --> 15:55.380
still a possibility they may may be a new u.s. mix still and who knows what's

15:55.380 --> 16:00.260
to happen with the arcade. Way better, I mean freaking Europe is starting to get a lead

16:00.260 --> 16:06.420
on us so we can't have the Europeans beating us, come on. No way. I understand a bunch

16:06.420 --> 16:12.820
of them aren't really that pleased with EuroMix 2. Unfortunately they are going to be releasing

16:12.820 --> 16:16.580
another mix for EuroMix that's going to be kind of fixing everything that they don't

16:16.580 --> 16:21.220
like about EuroMix 2. I wonder if that's going to be really going to happen or not. Yeah,

16:21.220 --> 16:32.460
it's like, okay, EuroMix II versus DDR USA. True, true. Real contest there. One more thing

16:32.460 --> 16:37.040
we should point out that arise from this interview between SoCal Kicks and Jason Enos, it will

16:37.040 --> 16:42.320
have licensed tracks from already released Japanese DDR mixes, so there will be some

16:42.320 --> 16:49.280
Dance Mania licensed tracks. Which ones? Don't know. And which games? Don't know. But I would

16:49.280 --> 16:54.080
imagine there would be kinds of things you would expect to see in the U.S., like one

16:54.080 --> 16:58.980
that comes to my mind would be Ordinary World. I would not be surprised one bit if that's

16:58.980 --> 16:59.980
one of the songs that's going to be in there.

16:59.980 --> 17:00.980
I would be perfectly happy if that song didn't make it in because that remix is a Travis

17:00.980 --> 17:01.980
Stevens song.

17:01.980 --> 17:06.960
I know, I know it's a Travis Stevens original, but it is a kind of popular techno hit here

17:06.960 --> 17:10.500
in America. I would not be surprised at all if it turned up. That's kind of number one

17:10.500 --> 17:14.280
on my list for expected Dance Mania licensed songs. I bet you that'll be one.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.280
Twilight Zone and...

17:15.280 --> 17:18.000
Twilight Zone's probably, I bet you that'll happen too, yep.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
You need to put peanut butter jelly in there.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Peanut butter jelly in a baseball bat!

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Shake what your mama gave you. Shake what your mama gave you.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Oh yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Shake that ass! Show me what you're working with!

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
I would like to make it clear to our listeners that I have nothing to do with that part of the conversation.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm sitting here.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Okay, let's play this little demo.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Loki, would you mind giving us a little background on where you found this little clip here?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
It's only a minute thirty?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I haven't heard this yet even.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.160
Yeah, um, well here's what it is.

17:50.160 --> 17:54.380
It's basically, I found it off of a site that was selling the vinyl version of Dark Black

17:54.380 --> 17:58.960
Forest, and it's kind of, it really kind of splits it up a little bit.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.520
It's kind of giving you an idea of what the whole song sounds like because it's like six

18:02.520 --> 18:04.000
or seven minutes long.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.360
So it cuts it up a little bit, so there are a little bit of spaces where it kind of comes

18:07.360 --> 18:11.260
off beat, but I mean you kind of get the idea of what it's going to sound like.

18:11.260 --> 18:16.980
I tried getting the original version of the MP3, but the stupid sight, their shop was

18:16.980 --> 18:19.180
down, and so it wouldn't let me buy it.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.900
So I would have had it, but it's all their fault.

18:21.900 --> 18:22.900
Stupid company.

18:22.900 --> 18:29.900
Well, we'll see. Here's the demo here. This is Dark Forests on Orange Lounge Radio.

18:52.900 --> 19:12.300
It's a long way to go, honey.

19:12.300 --> 19:18.340
I know, but I'm afraid we'll be golden.

19:18.340 --> 19:21.340
into the dark black forest.

19:48.340 --> 20:02.100
Okay, that was it.

20:02.100 --> 20:06.100
Kind of chopped up there, definitely, but somebody in the chat room offered us to send

20:06.100 --> 20:08.580
us a longer one, so we'll see if we can get that by the end of the show.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.340
Maybe we'll play the full five-minute version.

20:10.340 --> 20:13.500
If we're desperate for things to do by the end of the show, we'll play that for you at

20:13.500 --> 20:14.500
the end.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.500
How's that sound?

20:15.500 --> 20:16.500
Sounds like a winner.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
All right.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.500
What other DDR USA Max news was there?

20:47.500 --> 21:03.500
I think that, you know, it'll really be a good mix compared to most of the other stuff because, well, first of all, it'll have all the modifiers like Max and Max2, and plus, I guess, 0.5 speed, which will be fun new challenging mode. I just wish that they'd put challenge mode back on there. That was the coolest.

21:03.500 --> 21:24.500
Rumor is that challenge mode might be back a lot, I mean these are all rumors of course, you know you could make up anything you want about DDR Max, also this being said is that.5 speed actually didn't end up making the final cut because they had some errors with it with some of the slower songs with like My Summer Lover and 7.8 were just messing it up too bad, so we don't know if that's even going to be in there for sure, so we'll see.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.500
Darn. They should put 64 speed. That would be cool.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.500
Pointless shit like that.

21:29.500 --> 21:35.500
No, but I think it'll be pretty good, because DDR economics as far as actual...

21:35.500 --> 21:37.500
That was just as good as SportsMix, I think.

21:37.500 --> 21:41.500
Besides not having challenge mode, which I really love.

21:41.500 --> 21:46.500
You know, I have to ask Konami USA, I want my databank.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.500
Databank?

21:47.500 --> 21:50.500
That was cool, but I mean...

21:50.500 --> 22:05.500
Yeah, I don't use it at all. For people like Loki, who use lots of edits and stuff, and go to Golf Land with their little laptop, Penny and One, and change it all around, yeah, that would be cool.

22:05.500 --> 22:12.500
But I never looked at the databank. I mean, maybe once, if I need a little bit of a challenge or something.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.500
Yeah.

22:13.500 --> 22:21.580
Oh, JB says, he wants to point out, my summer love is on Disney Mix and Disney has 0.5 speed.

22:21.580 --> 22:22.580
So something's there.

22:22.580 --> 22:24.620
But you notice that Disney Mix looks a lot different also.

22:24.620 --> 22:29.460
But Disney Mix already is running at 1.5 speed anyway, so.

22:29.460 --> 22:35.300
SoCalKick says he asked Enos about the data bank in DDR Max USA and because of technical

22:35.300 --> 22:38.500
difficulties it ain't going to happen.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.500
Which is bummer.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.780
It would have made a fine addition to economics for sure.

22:41.780 --> 22:43.620
I would have had my stuff on there.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.180
Hell yeah.

22:45.180 --> 22:46.580
Maybe the next time.

22:46.580 --> 22:49.420
Maybe Max USA will sell really good and then they'll make another one.

22:49.420 --> 22:50.840
Then they can ask me.

22:50.840 --> 22:54.900
And then they'll come to you and get a bunch of edits.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.220
Sweet.

22:56.220 --> 22:58.280
So...

22:58.280 --> 22:59.640
ONI courses.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.820
Wouldn't that be interesting to have at home?

23:01.820 --> 23:04.580
It's not going to happen.

23:04.580 --> 23:08.500
I'm almost positive it's not going to happen because it's USA.

23:08.500 --> 23:12.260
They're like, well, people aren't good enough. They don't even know what ONI means.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.120
Maybe non-stops, then?

23:14.120 --> 23:17.120
I would honestly like them to put in, like,

23:17.120 --> 23:19.000
a 2DX-style expert course.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.080
Not do, like, an ONI, but, like, an actual expert course.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.960
You think they're going to do something...

23:24.960 --> 23:27.300
Well, you have a depreciating score bar.

23:27.300 --> 23:30.160
Do you think they're going to have internet ranking

23:30.160 --> 23:31.860
for USA?

23:31.860 --> 23:37.640
I don't see why they wouldn't. It would be a good move on their part. It would also be advertising for their site, too.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.880
the let them move on phony course

23:40.880 --> 23:43.280
if let them move is in that game

23:43.280 --> 23:45.380
then i will commit shop of course

23:45.380 --> 23:48.120
the nearly one hundred reports

23:48.120 --> 23:50.000
uh... all the facts on

23:50.000 --> 23:51.900
well you know i mean

23:51.900 --> 23:53.860
it could still be good i mean it

23:53.860 --> 23:58.320
if he actually yes the price with a good let them know which instant love would

23:58.320 --> 24:00.440
be awesome

24:00.440 --> 24:02.960
now i don't know for ever see that

24:02.960 --> 24:05.560
but we don't see any of them

24:05.560 --> 24:08.280
Hi, I'm DJ Konami.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.520
We actually have DJ Konami in the chat room right now.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.800
He'll teach you how to play.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.360
You know, I think that we should play that song again sometime during the show.

24:16.360 --> 24:20.920
Maybe we will. Maybe right before the end of the show.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.320
The instant love.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.560
I agree with electro-tal in the chat room.

24:26.560 --> 24:30.720
Basically, I think the non-stops will make it before the Oni courses will.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.060
A la Euromix 2, kind of the way they do it.

24:33.060 --> 24:36.100
And you can think of it like back to forth mix type thing.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.780
And how stops were a great idea.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.500
It all depends on what interface you're using.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.580
Because if they're using a Max 2 interface, it's going to

24:41.580 --> 24:42.900
be easy to do on eCourses.

24:42.900 --> 24:46.940
So it'll be harder to program something just non-stops into

24:46.940 --> 24:49.580
a Max 2 interface.

24:49.580 --> 24:51.540
It sounds like they're taking a little bit of liberties by

24:51.540 --> 24:53.180
changing some things around, especially with this whole

24:53.180 --> 24:55.100
foot ranking being in it, for sure thing.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.780
They're doing some changes to a Max interface.

24:57.780 --> 24:59.620
I guess we'll know more once we see screenshots.

24:59.620 --> 25:02.180
Now the rumor is that PlayStation Magazine is

25:02.180 --> 25:05.740
supposed to have a playable demo of this October 8th I believe when their new

25:05.740 --> 25:09.820
issue comes out so very soon now we're gonna see a new we're gonna be able to

25:09.820 --> 25:17.940
see what it looks like because we'll be able to see the interface. I'll buy it so

25:17.940 --> 25:23.220
well maybe I can make arrangements to get that magazine that particular store

25:23.220 --> 25:26.620
get the particular shipment of it yes we'll have to arrange that so we can look

25:26.620 --> 25:28.820
at the demo we'll look at that here on Orange Lounge unless you know what we

25:28.820 --> 25:34.940
think of that cuz not everybody gets that magazine okay let's get into the

25:34.940 --> 25:40.200
fun part of the show shall we let's talk about our F use of the week oh do I have

25:40.200 --> 25:44.580
one or not or what cuz I've been getting a lot of them from the chat room here so

25:44.580 --> 25:48.420
if you want to submit your F you the week just join channel pound orange

25:48.420 --> 25:54.280
lounge on any other side IRC server like IRC dot eggheads org and in the

25:54.280 --> 25:58.460
meantime we're gonna start with Jamie's F you the week I just have to cue her

25:58.460 --> 26:01.380
music. I'm kind of slow tonight. It's been a long day.

26:01.380 --> 26:02.660
Brad needs a nap.

26:02.660 --> 26:04.660
I don't need a nap. I just need a vacation.

26:04.660 --> 26:13.660
Okay, my nephew of the week goes for tonight. I'm halfway hate to say it. Roosevelt Golf

26:13.660 --> 26:20.660
Land. And this isn't because of the machines. This has to do with unprofessionalism. You

26:20.660 --> 26:24.500
want to know about unprofessionalism? I will tell about unprofessionalism. When you're

26:24.500 --> 26:30.500
I've sent close to nine emails and have had replies to three.

26:30.500 --> 26:37.500
When you try to set up a meeting with somebody to arrange running a tournament that's going to be bringing in money for them,

26:37.500 --> 26:41.500
and they don't even care enough about it to reply to you.

26:41.500 --> 26:47.500
Or, when you request a Saturday in the interest of having a large crowd and they go,

26:47.500 --> 26:50.060
and they go, no, we won't have a Saturday.

26:50.060 --> 26:52.060
Good luck with Scandia.

26:52.060 --> 26:53.980
Little do they know, we've already got approval

26:53.980 --> 26:55.780
with Scandia, so they can just go, you know,

26:55.780 --> 26:57.340
fall into the creek for all I care.

26:57.340 --> 26:58.540
Did they actually say that to you?

26:58.540 --> 26:59.420
Good luck with Scandia?

26:59.420 --> 27:00.620
That was the email I got.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.900
Wow, I didn't know that.

27:01.900 --> 27:02.500
I refused.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.860
It said, I refuse to rent Saturday.

27:04.860 --> 27:07.420
Good luck with Scandia.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.700
So that's business we'll be taking from them that day.

27:09.700 --> 27:13.340
Well, do you want to say anything about the new term?

27:13.340 --> 27:15.820
I know the tournament's details have been finalized,

27:15.820 --> 27:17.820
We'll say that for a future show.

27:17.820 --> 27:19.820
Not for a future show, but I'll say something later.

27:19.820 --> 27:21.820
That's not part of my Fuck You of the Week, because it's a pleasant thing.

27:21.820 --> 27:23.820
Oh yeah, that's pleasant. You're right, yes. Sorry, this is all about fuck yous right now.

27:23.820 --> 27:30.820
Scandi is so much better. Like, in terms of size, Scandi is not as good, but Roseville Golf Land?

27:30.820 --> 27:39.820
Like, last time I went there, both Romania and keyboard mania were broken, and it's always crowded with tons of little kids, and it's dark, and, you know, bad stuff.

27:39.820 --> 27:44.820
Scandi, very nice people, good tech, and everything is cool.

27:44.820 --> 27:49.820
We've got to try and keep this somewhat appealing to everybody out there, by the way. We don't want to talk about Sacramento politics all day, but...

27:49.820 --> 28:03.820
Well, where Roseville-Gotham does have more machines, the better quality arcade is Scandia, and I'm honestly even thinking about putting up a suggestion to everybody to change the Wednesday night location for the local meetings too.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.820
Interesting idea, we'll see.

28:07.820 --> 28:12.820
You have your own Fuck You of the Week, Loki. Hold on, I gotta load your song.

28:12.820 --> 28:14.820
I'm so out of it this week.

28:15.820 --> 28:18.820
Just go ahead and start with your Fuck You of the Week. Your song will kick in pretty soon.

28:18.820 --> 28:21.820
It's like I said, better be out of it than to have your foot stuck in it.

28:23.820 --> 28:29.820
Yeah, so my Fuck You of the Week goes to these really crappy winter movies that they're releasing right now.

28:29.820 --> 28:36.820
What the hell are they thinking with, like, uh, fear.com.com and, uh, you know, all these other stupid movies.

28:36.820 --> 28:42.820
Like, today I saw Ballistic, X vs. Ever. That has to be one of the most pointless movies I've seen in a long time.

28:42.820 --> 28:50.820
I mean, it had probably one of the slowest motorcycle chases I've ever seen, going a whopping 30 miles an hour through city streets.

28:50.820 --> 28:54.820
It was just completely pointless and I lost interest about halfway through it.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.820
But it's a free movie, so... Yay.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.820
Wait. Dude, song changing.

29:05.820 --> 29:08.820
Just start with your F.U. I'll give you a background song as soon as I can get to it.

29:08.820 --> 29:12.820
My F.U. is towards the 49ers, because they suck!

29:12.820 --> 29:16.820
And they beat Cade Matthews in the Redskins, and they are the best!

29:16.820 --> 29:19.820
Go Redskins! Yay!

29:19.820 --> 29:21.820
49ers suck.

29:21.820 --> 29:28.820
Jeff Garcia. I know you're listening. Okay, that's my fuck you. Football related.

29:28.820 --> 29:37.100
Another fuck you. You do? Yes. You can leave Dave's music because it's happy. My fuck you

29:37.100 --> 29:41.820
is not really directed toward anybody, it's toward the situation. I feel sorry for everybody

29:41.820 --> 29:45.780
with long distance relationships because I was away from my dad for a whole five days

29:45.780 --> 29:53.780
It sucked. It sucked, it sucked, it sucked, it sucked. So, whatever he went to. Except that I got free stuff from him.

29:53.780 --> 29:55.780
You got a free Xbox out of it, so...

29:55.780 --> 30:01.780
And free games, and tons of t-shirts, and a Capcom backpack, and other stuff.

30:01.780 --> 30:08.780
Yeah, my FUs. I have an FU of the week. F Microsoft. Where's my free Xbox? Thanks, I'm done.

30:08.780 --> 30:11.780
I don't have an FU, but this is something else.

30:11.780 --> 30:15.780
I'd like to congratulate the makers of Duck Tape.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.780
They've saved my life on numerous occasions, and it rocks.

30:18.780 --> 30:25.780
I mean, they fixed my car with Duck Tape, and they fixed my pads with Duck Tape, so hooray for Duck Tape.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.780
That's it. Hooray for Duck Tape.

30:27.780 --> 30:34.780
Duck Tape has multiple uses, like, you know, taping small children in their car, and holding together computers.

30:34.780 --> 30:39.780
or taping two people's buns together?

30:39.780 --> 30:44.780
how appropriate I'm playing drop the bomb

30:44.780 --> 30:49.780
on behalf of one of my friends who may or may not be listening

30:49.780 --> 30:54.780
she would regale us with a tale of how at the mississippi school of math and science

30:54.780 --> 30:59.780
they would hold together the school computer with duct tape and chicken wire

30:59.780 --> 31:05.180
computer with duct tape and chicken wire. And it worked until the duct tape fell off.

31:05.180 --> 31:09.180
Actually, the duct tape didn't fall off, but I understand it was removed and the whole

31:09.180 --> 31:10.180
thing fell apart.

31:10.180 --> 31:15.140
Okay, I have another bitch. Now JB in the chat room, he's bragging that he got a free

31:15.140 --> 31:20.020
Xbox as well through some other means. Did anybody around here not get a free Xbox? I

31:20.020 --> 31:24.320
mean, I realize they're going to have to give that system away to get people to play it,

31:24.320 --> 31:27.580
but I mean, honestly, where's my free Xbox?

31:27.580 --> 31:31.580
I know none of this reacts well, but I wish that I had it.

31:31.580 --> 31:36.580
There's some secret I'm not being told about, some secret cult, some Xbox.

31:36.580 --> 31:43.580
I found a game that kicks just about any other racing game, but it's, oh god, President O.

31:43.580 --> 31:49.580
It's something Redshift. No, it's not Orgasm Redshift.

31:49.580 --> 31:56.580
It's done by Microsoft's programmers group. That game is absolutely awesome.

31:56.580 --> 32:03.580
awesome. It's like Wipeout meets Hydro Thunder. It's kind of interesting. And I got to do

32:03.580 --> 32:09.580
one of those too. Let's get to our chat rooms, bitches, shall we? I need to get an Xbox.

32:09.580 --> 32:15.780
I'd like to add. Okay. 23rd Magus says, a big fuck you to Skrull. One Skrull in particular.

32:15.780 --> 32:19.900
Johnson, Maine. What the fuck? Welcome to Trainwreck High. I asked for web author training.

32:19.900 --> 32:26.900
I get choir. What the fuck is wrong with these fucking idiots?

32:30.100 --> 32:37.100
You ask for web author training and you get choir? What the hell is that?

32:38.900 --> 32:44.340
That's like making one of the Gauntlet Legends people get up and play DDR. There's some scary

32:44.340 --> 32:48.260
people to play gauntlet legends

32:48.260 --> 32:52.820
we talked about they don't play it they are gauntlet legends

32:52.820 --> 32:56.020
b-one with the gauntlet legends watch out for the girl with the big metal

32:56.020 --> 33:00.740
brothel in that game you know

33:01.380 --> 33:06.740
it's pathetic when we have to sit here make fun of addicts to other games

33:06.740 --> 33:11.060
hi pot this is kettle calling hi pot you're black you're black

33:11.060 --> 33:13.020
anyway uh...

33:13.020 --> 33:17.940
so-called kick says uh... what's the matter nothing nevermind fuck you all

33:17.940 --> 33:21.940
have nothing to run about well

33:21.940 --> 33:24.060
uh... deejay konami

33:24.060 --> 33:26.100
in between teaching us all how to play it

33:26.100 --> 33:27.120
the mania

33:27.120 --> 33:29.260
he says f you to aaron hostile

33:29.260 --> 33:32.460
because i get a hundred percent all the way throughout the song

33:32.460 --> 33:35.340
and then at the end when it makes you hit a big succession of dual notes i

33:35.340 --> 33:36.600
I drop it to 2%.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.200
Amen to that!

33:38.200 --> 33:43.320
That sucks.

33:43.320 --> 33:46.080
JB featuring Jenny Rom says,

33:46.080 --> 33:50.020
My F.U. is also to RVGL for not having the keys available to any games after the

33:50.020 --> 33:50.980
morning is over.

33:50.980 --> 33:53.740
Not even the guys in the jean colored shirts have access to them.

33:53.740 --> 33:57.080
Now Jamie can't rape the crane game.

33:57.080 --> 33:58.680
Did the crane game break?

33:58.680 --> 34:03.020
If the crane game broke quiet, you have a chance to play it from RVGL again.

34:03.020 --> 34:07.420
Except for them leaving, you know, Drummania on Freeplay for three weeks or something.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.420
That was cool.

34:11.420 --> 34:12.220
We are smart.

34:12.220 --> 34:13.620
We're geniuses there.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.720
It's like, it's getter-ific.

34:15.720 --> 34:19.520
And JV featuring Jenny Rom would also like to say,

34:19.520 --> 34:22.320
F you if you hate Jenny Rom for the zippers.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.920
We're going to talk about Jenny Rom a little later.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.420
We're going to talk about Jenny Rom after the next break.

34:27.420 --> 34:28.720
Twen says,

34:28.720 --> 34:32.620
f u to sharing a phone line with every freaking person in the house making me

34:32.620 --> 34:35.600
stay online till four a m at least every night because i can't use it any time

34:35.600 --> 34:36.540
during the day

34:36.540 --> 34:38.760
and f u to me

34:38.760 --> 34:41.600
sky for not putting up the news site or forum

34:41.600 --> 34:45.400
and he also says f u to individuals i'm not gonna name

34:45.400 --> 34:47.160
because that's not worth naming

34:47.160 --> 34:49.080
that's not cool

34:49.080 --> 34:50.800
uh...

34:50.800 --> 34:53.880
oh twenty three megas would like to point out he is a fine baritone but he hates

34:53.880 --> 34:55.480
choir

34:55.480 --> 35:01.880
but he is a fine bear i can't i can see the best of me i was in band for a reason

35:01.880 --> 35:04.960
i'm in band because we're going to hawaii

35:04.960 --> 35:06.680
how cool is that

35:06.680 --> 35:11.840
my band plays the only reason you joined band to go to hawaii no see last year it was disneyland

35:11.840 --> 35:13.160

35:13.160 --> 35:15.040

35:15.040 --> 35:16.960

35:16.960 --> 35:21.440
yeah you saw tits on a band trip

35:21.440 --> 35:23.720
one time at band

35:23.720 --> 35:27.240
Oh, who didn't see that joke coming a mile away?

35:27.240 --> 35:34.240
I'm going to be sending you with money to buy my manga then when you're over there. Can you go to Toys and Choice for me?

35:38.600 --> 35:40.480
A couple more, two more.

35:40.480 --> 35:44.320
SoCalKick says, fuck you to every gaming store for delaying Kingdom Hearts' release,

35:44.320 --> 35:46.000
but, yay, Kingdom Hearts owns.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.600
Um, actually, my fiancé's store had Kingdom Hearts the day of release.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.600
uh... paul paul

35:51.600 --> 35:54.880
so far

35:54.880 --> 35:57.640
and demand the morality

35:57.640 --> 35:59.360
some very happy

35:59.360 --> 36:02.200
well how does this happen takeout kids says

36:02.200 --> 36:06.260
fuck you to his and by the way takeout kid is uh... joining us from berkeley

36:06.260 --> 36:08.000
dot e two years old

36:08.000 --> 36:13.320
fuck you to his college writing teacher for thinking he was an e-s-l student

36:13.320 --> 36:18.400
but he's not even really here still

36:18.400 --> 36:27.400
How the hell? You've got to elaborate on that. Please elaborate on that. Send me more about how the hell that happens to somebody. That sucks.

36:27.400 --> 36:33.400
Yes, JB, please send me that file. I'm not going to respond. I'm too lazy to type right now.

36:33.400 --> 36:41.400
Thank you to Dan for getting me this really neat 007 watch that clips on my belt and is upside down so I can look at it and has a compass.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.400
I've been playing with this thing all night. It's the coolest thing ever.

36:45.400 --> 36:49.400
And F you to this upcoming movie I heard about called The Core.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.400
It's the dumbest idea I've ever heard of.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
The Earth's core stops.

36:54.400 --> 37:00.400
And then these people have to go drill down to the core and detonate a nuke and that will fix everything.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.400
It's the dumbest idea now.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.400
It's like Austin Powers except that the goal is to let it work.

37:06.400 --> 37:11.400
And here is us suspending our disbelief upon confession.

37:11.400 --> 37:19.400
You know what? Movies today are getting retarded, as are most TV shows, which is why Jamie doesn't want TV anymore.

37:19.400 --> 37:23.400
But, oh, and Dave's head hurts.

37:23.400 --> 37:30.400
But, The Transporter's gonna kick ass. Go see The Transporter. Awesome movie. On Asian Girl, yeah.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.400
Um, yeah.

37:33.400 --> 37:38.400
A special hello, by the way, out there to the Rice Princess, who's joining us in the chat room.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.400
Hi!

37:39.400 --> 37:44.200
And uh, one more, one more FU, one more, this last one, no more, don't send me any more.

37:44.200 --> 37:49.240
DarkTetsuya says, FU to his busted Knight's controller.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.520
Is that like Sonic Knight's?

37:51.520 --> 37:52.520
Oh, okay.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.520
Oh, okay.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.960
Which is the best controller ever invented.

37:56.960 --> 38:00.480
And you cannot really get them anymore unless you know where to look.

38:00.480 --> 38:03.000
Okay, TakeOutKid is elaborating on the ESL story.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.320
He says, she read my subject and she thought my writing was so bad that she thought I was

38:08.320 --> 38:16.280
ESL, and the readers of his subject had evidence of ESL attributes, so that's why she thought

38:16.280 --> 38:17.280
he was ESL.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
Go figure.

38:18.280 --> 38:22.800
Okay, why don't we take a quick break?

38:22.800 --> 38:23.800
You guys want to take a quick break?

38:23.800 --> 38:26.000
We're going to come back and we're going to talk about Jenny Rom.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.320
How's that sound?

38:27.320 --> 38:28.320
Wee!

38:28.320 --> 38:32.640
I'm going to start this off with, actually I can't find that route right now.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.120
Maybe we'll hear something from Fantasia 3 in the next break.

38:35.120 --> 38:41.120
I wanted to play you guys something from Fantasia 3, brand new, just came out, but I'm going to start this set off with...

38:41.120 --> 38:43.120
How about something from...

38:43.120 --> 38:45.120
Do you want to hear Papaya?

38:45.120 --> 38:47.120
Do you want to hear Supergirl?

38:47.120 --> 38:48.120
Of course Supergirl.

38:48.120 --> 38:52.120
We're going to have happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy Papaya song.

38:52.120 --> 38:57.120
Where was I? Oh, there it is. Hello. Found it. I can't even tell how I have my own songs for you.

38:57.120 --> 39:01.120
Everyone be prepared to be overloaded with sugar and brush your teeth when the song's over.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.120
Alright, and we'll get something from Fantasia 3 in here too.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.120
I'm gonna rule the world

39:36.120 --> 39:39.120

41:21.180 --> 41:25.460
We could travel all around the universe

We're gonna have some fun

When we're together

43:41.160 --> 43:46.160
Together, emotional alone

43:46.160 --> 43:49.160
In my heat of pleasure

43:49.160 --> 43:53.160
Take me on your own, sin to your own

43:53.160 --> 43:56.160
Never let me go

43:56.160 --> 44:02.160
Tonight I really need to know

44:02.160 --> 44:05.160
Tell it to my heart, tell me I'm the only one

44:05.160 --> 44:08.160
Is this really love or just a game?

44:08.160 --> 44:16.160
Tell it to my heart and I can do my body right Every time you call my name

44:38.160 --> 44:56.160
The passion's so complete, it's never-ending As long as I receive the message you send in

44:56.160 --> 45:03.160
But it's about a soul to soul Oh, it feels so near

45:03.160 --> 45:09.160
So say the words I long to hear

45:09.160 --> 45:12.160
Tell it to my heart Tell me I'm the only one

45:12.160 --> 45:16.160
Did you squeal in love or just a game?

45:16.160 --> 45:19.160
Tell it to my heart I look to my body right

45:19.160 --> 45:22.160
Every time you call my name

45:22.160 --> 45:26.160
Tell it to my heart, tell me I'm the only one

45:26.160 --> 45:29.160
Is it really love or just a game?

45:29.160 --> 45:33.160
Tell it to my heart, I can feel my body rot

45:33.160 --> 45:36.160
Every time you call my name

45:42.160 --> 45:46.160
Tell it to my heart, I can feel my body rot

45:46.160 --> 45:49.160
Every time you call my name

45:49.160 --> 45:51.160
Tell it to my heart

45:56.160 --> 45:58.160
Tell it to my heart

46:04.160 --> 46:08.160
Mr. Random Person on the Street, what do you think of the Orange Dives Bay Money Music and More show?

46:09.160 --> 46:11.160
Beautiful night, isn't it?

46:11.160 --> 46:16.160
It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a bloodsucker.

46:16.160 --> 46:33.160
What the hell was that look on her face when she was like, huh?

46:33.160 --> 46:34.160
Dude, I don't remember.

46:34.160 --> 46:36.160
I haven't watched that thing in a long, long time.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.160
I saw that once a while ago.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.160
A long, long ago.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.160
I haven't watched that fans of, like, Bobak.

46:41.160 --> 46:42.160
Wow.

46:42.160 --> 46:43.160
Like, my N-PEGs on my computer.

46:43.160 --> 46:48.340
I promised when we came back to the show we would talk about Jenny Rom, and this is very

46:48.340 --> 46:53.180
interesting because JB in the chat room, huge Jenny Rom fan, sent me some pictures of Jenny

46:53.180 --> 46:54.180
Rom.

46:54.180 --> 46:55.180
Damn, she's ugly.

46:55.180 --> 47:02.440
But this is the interesting thing, apparently Jenny Rom is not a real person, from what

47:02.440 --> 47:03.440
I'm reading.

47:03.440 --> 47:04.440
Gasp!

47:04.440 --> 47:05.440
Gasp!

47:05.440 --> 47:34.520
On the China MGL and ID Music, these two big music-related sites to talk about dance media,

47:34.520 --> 47:40.260
this big message board and this guy who calls himself Alex from Italy came on to this board

47:40.260 --> 47:46.280
and says that he was looking for stuff about dance mania and he found it and he's a member

47:46.280 --> 47:52.860
of Jenny Rom's team. He produced the first single www.blondegirl.com for Saifam and he

47:52.860 --> 47:56.840
saw that somebody was looking for the lyrics of Do You Want to Flirt and he posts them

47:56.840 --> 48:04.340
on this site. Let's see. Let's read some of these earth shattering lyrics from Jenny Rom

48:04.340 --> 48:12.440
shall we? Let's see. Boom boom, don't stop, love me babe. Boom boom, don't stop, kiss

48:12.440 --> 48:20.160
me babe. Boom boom, don't stop, love me babe. Tonight with me so high. What is up with the

48:20.160 --> 48:29.960
Japanese and boom boom? They put boom boom in everything. Yeah, but you know what? Here's

48:29.960 --> 48:35.600
who Jenny Rom really is. I know, I've heard this a long time ago, it's

48:35.600 --> 48:39.600
Politary! You think Jenny Rom is really Politary?

48:39.600 --> 48:46.000
There's a difference, there's a difference. Jenny Rom can hold a tune.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.240
Jenny Rom is just a Naoki. That's all it is. Naoki is everyone.

48:51.240 --> 48:56.120
So really what this is, is that Jenny Rom is actually an Italian singer, who just kind

48:56.120 --> 48:59.360
of, you know, comes in, the lady who does the voice, and also an Italian male singer,

48:59.360 --> 49:02.560
and i'm guessing this picture that got sent to me was actually that italian

49:02.560 --> 49:04.640
singer who poses as jenny rom

49:04.640 --> 49:06.280
general mail

49:06.280 --> 49:09.540
no no but you know that guy who does the voice like you know uh... you know

49:09.540 --> 49:11.760
come on barbie let's go party or you know

49:11.760 --> 49:14.060
i don't know why i don't want to do

49:14.060 --> 49:16.160
he's there's an italian guy

49:16.160 --> 49:20.300
you know what they all sound alike i swear to god aqua

49:20.300 --> 49:21.040
you know

49:21.040 --> 49:25.100
capping my seriously thought that guy was the guy from on what he sounds just

49:25.100 --> 49:28.640
sound like the girl doesn't sound the same that guy sounds just like the guy

49:28.640 --> 49:30.640
from aqua and aqua broke up a couple years ago from when I heard it.

49:30.640 --> 49:35.800
It's funny, they also have, what was it, I think King Kong and the Jungle Girls, I thought

49:35.800 --> 49:42.040
that was them, but they all sounded like two. And I've actually seen a video, not with aqua,

49:42.040 --> 49:47.520
but this other one, shit, I can't remember what it was called, Tarzan and Jane or something

49:47.520 --> 49:54.520
like that, and they look exactly like aqua. They're all aqua. Everyone is aqua.

49:54.520 --> 49:58.960
And the world is square.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.200
All bands are aqua and the world is square.

50:01.200 --> 50:04.200
Some more things that Alex says on this forum.

50:04.200 --> 50:07.320
He's proud to see that so many people love his virtual daughter.

50:07.320 --> 50:12.040
And he's got photos and a promotional video about Jenny Rom.

50:12.040 --> 50:15.480
Jenny's not a real girl, but a virtual woman that lives in the fantasy and into the computer

50:15.480 --> 50:16.480
world.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.040
That was the original concept about her.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.800
And he says, Do You Want to Flirt is his favorite song.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.480
It hasn't been released on Dance Media Compilation.

50:23.480 --> 50:27.480
I know somebody's got a copy of that, and maybe they'll send it to me so we can play it by the end of the show.

50:27.480 --> 50:28.480
Wink wink nudge nudge.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.480
I don't say any more.

50:30.480 --> 50:36.480
Uh, and he says, uh, we chose the name Jenny Rom because they were looking for a perfect name for a digital woman.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.480
And when Joe said, what do you think of Jenny Rom? He said, I love it.

50:39.480 --> 50:44.480
Just like, kind of, kind of like when, uh, Jamie and I came up with Orange Lounge. Let's call this show Orange Lounge.

50:44.480 --> 50:45.480
Oh, I love it!

50:45.480 --> 50:46.480
Same thing.

50:46.480 --> 50:48.480
I'll buy that for a dollar.

50:48.480 --> 50:51.480
Except I don't think we were that excited. It was like, oh yay, finally, we thought of a title.

50:51.480 --> 50:55.200
we're like tired and on the part i remember that i remember that we're on

50:55.200 --> 50:56.640
part when we decided

50:56.640 --> 50:58.400
call it that you know

50:58.400 --> 50:59.360
paula terry

50:59.360 --> 51:01.160
is now keys

51:01.160 --> 51:02.760
second head

51:02.760 --> 51:04.160
uh...

51:04.160 --> 51:06.240
so it is

51:06.240 --> 51:11.760
you know i love it

51:11.760 --> 51:13.480
okay uh... what else

51:13.480 --> 51:17.440
now he has many people

51:17.440 --> 51:20.960
where the most popular solace in another one girl

51:20.960 --> 51:24.880
and uh... will there be any more jenny ron indeed you are he says it depends on

51:24.880 --> 51:26.920
a lot of the uh... business affair

51:26.920 --> 51:29.240
however he says it's very probable

51:29.240 --> 51:32.640
uh... at the moment he's no longer with the junior on production team but he

51:32.640 --> 51:35.640
still has a good relationship with them so he doesn't know exactly what's going

51:35.640 --> 51:37.140
on

51:37.140 --> 51:39.840
that's that's a lot of story

51:39.840 --> 51:41.360
uh...

51:41.360 --> 51:44.280
it should be noted the reason he's not with their production team anymore is

51:44.280 --> 51:49.840
because he made some uh... explicit photos of jenny ron

51:49.840 --> 51:50.840
Yeah.

51:50.840 --> 51:51.840
Anyway.

51:51.840 --> 51:55.480
See if she was a natural blondie girl.

51:55.480 --> 52:02.240
And we were all shocked to find out she wasn't a blonde girl all over.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.560
They just forgot to render that part.

52:04.560 --> 52:09.680
Oh no, the polygon count dropped.

52:09.680 --> 52:15.440
For all we know it's www.shavedgirl.com.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.640
Next in the money news.

52:17.640 --> 52:23.480
so in the money news

52:23.480 --> 52:28.960
meanwhile back

52:28.960 --> 52:33.480
the curtains do not match the carpet which so mature here

52:33.480 --> 52:36.120
uh...

52:36.120 --> 52:39.960
they're talking about this is uh...

52:39.960 --> 52:43.640
i've never thought i'd hear this little money so uh... they got delayed play

52:43.640 --> 52:45.520
this game

52:45.520 --> 52:49.520
No, but certain people would be guaranteed not to.

52:49.520 --> 52:51.520
Like Paula Terry.

52:51.520 --> 52:53.520
Anyway.

52:53.520 --> 52:57.520
Oh, they want to know if Jenny Rahm has three tits.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.520
That can be programmed.

52:59.520 --> 53:06.520
You know, it's like, I don't know.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.520
I don't know how best to describe it.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.520
She's like a vacuum cleaner.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.520
She's got different attachments, you know.

53:12.520 --> 53:14.520
But all of them suck.

53:14.520 --> 53:16.520
She's gone from sun to blow!

53:19.520 --> 53:20.520
Yeah.

53:20.520 --> 53:22.520
And let's move on to something else, shall we?

53:22.520 --> 53:23.520
Something else.

53:23.520 --> 53:26.520
Oh, did you know that they confirmed DDR Max 3?

53:26.520 --> 53:32.520
Or I should say, not DDR Max 3 necessarily, but a new DDR is in production.

53:32.520 --> 53:35.520
So there is definitely going to be a new DDR coming out.

53:35.520 --> 53:43.520
And they're taking a poll over on the official website for this,

53:43.520 --> 53:47.780
which is over on Konami's Bimani portal, you can find it no problem, they want to know

53:47.780 --> 53:51.220
what kind of Konami original songs you want to see in this new DDR that haven't been there

53:51.220 --> 53:56.800
yet but from any Bimani game. So like, if there's a keyboard mania song you think should

53:56.800 --> 54:01.260
be in there, now I was an idiot when I first submitted it and I said, I want to see flotation

54:01.260 --> 54:07.920
in DDR except that's not a Konami original so, I already fucked it up so, they're looking

54:07.920 --> 54:08.920
for Konami originals.

54:08.920 --> 54:14.200
Speaking of the home versions though, this is somewhat unconfirmed, although I'm not

54:14.200 --> 54:16.560
doubting the reliability of my source.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.560
I cannot describe it.

54:17.560 --> 54:18.560
Dude, are those sirens picking up over the microphones?

54:18.560 --> 54:19.560
They're just hella loud.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.560
There's sirens going right by my house right now.

54:21.560 --> 54:22.560
They found Loki.

54:22.560 --> 54:23.560
Anyway.

54:23.560 --> 54:24.560
Anyway.

54:24.560 --> 54:31.400
There's been information given to me, again, this has not been officially confirmed by

54:31.400 --> 54:38.480
me with any member of Konami, but that they were going to stop production of the peripherals,

54:38.480 --> 54:39.480
like the dance pads.

54:39.480 --> 54:41.040
So we're talking Konami in the US again.

54:41.040 --> 54:42.040
Konami US.

54:42.040 --> 54:43.040
Konami USA.

54:43.040 --> 54:48.320
And that though they did mention Red Octane by name, that they were supporting whatever

54:48.320 --> 54:50.400
product that they would release.

54:50.400 --> 54:56.880
I'll try to get that confirmed, but in the meantime, this is what my sources told me.

54:56.880 --> 54:57.880
All right.

54:57.880 --> 54:58.880
So your...

54:58.880 --> 54:59.880
Inside sources.

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
...sources.

55:00.880 --> 55:05.520
Start buying those dance pads while you can get them.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.320
Yeah, so they're not going to be making the...

55:08.320 --> 55:12.000
Maybe they're not going to be making those official Konami pads anymore, and Red Octane

55:12.000 --> 55:15.360
is going to be the official Konami DDR pad dealer, basically.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.360
Maybe.

55:16.360 --> 55:19.280
If these sources are correct, that's what's happening.

55:19.280 --> 55:20.280
We'll see.

55:20.280 --> 55:21.280
Who knows?

55:21.280 --> 55:22.940
Red Octane seems to own everything DDR online.

55:22.940 --> 55:29.000
It's not that it was going to be necessarily official, it's just that they were going to,

55:29.000 --> 55:33.440
I guess, vouch for the production of the Red Octane pads.

55:33.440 --> 55:37.960
And the ignition pad was also mentioned by name.

55:37.960 --> 55:44.840
Now this is interesting, over on BamaniStyle.com, a fine little site, they are making suggestions

55:44.840 --> 55:52.480
for what kinds of things you should submit as songs to Konami for DDR Max 3 or whatever

55:52.480 --> 55:55.560
it is, whatever it is in whatever shape or form they're going to call it, it's basically

55:55.560 --> 55:57.160
DDR 8th Mix.

55:57.160 --> 56:01.560
And basically these are all the Konami original songs that would pretty much be impossible

56:01.560 --> 56:02.560
to dance to.

56:02.560 --> 56:05.680
So I'm going to read off this list here of possible submissions.

56:05.680 --> 56:09.840
If you can't think of anything you want to submit as a song that you think should be

56:09.840 --> 56:15.840
an eighth mix. Here are some suggestions. From Beatmania, the DJ battle. Can you imagine

56:15.840 --> 56:21.600
dancing to the DJ battle? Oh, I have one up on that. How about this? DJ battle, the yodeler

56:21.600 --> 56:31.600
mix. From Beatmania, the yodeler mix. The cat song from Beatmania? Ink go meow. That

56:31.600 --> 56:39.400
Ink go mam, that would be so lame to dance to, but it would be fun, it would be like

56:39.400 --> 56:41.120
stupid fun.

56:41.120 --> 56:49.440
From Keyboard Mania, morning music, which I think is about 15 BPM.

56:49.440 --> 56:53.280
That would be so awful in DDR.

56:53.280 --> 56:57.280
Threshold from Keyboard Mania is another suggestion.

56:57.280 --> 57:00.960
Without you around from pop and music, I'm not up on my pop and music knowledge so I

57:00.960 --> 57:05.760
I don't know what that song is, but from 2DX they suggest flowers for Albion.

57:05.760 --> 57:14.760
I wonder if the steps would do the same thing that the notes do in the 7 key for flowers.

57:14.760 --> 57:20.680
Okay, that part is ass, but it would be fun to do those.

57:20.680 --> 57:25.880
Ah, I like Twin's suggestion, he says let's DDR to Orange Lounge episodes.

57:25.880 --> 57:28.280
Talk about a long version, these things are what?

57:28.280 --> 57:32.660
I think the shortest episode of Orange Lounge is like 118 minutes.

57:32.660 --> 57:36.940
That would be marathon mode right there.

57:36.940 --> 57:41.280
From 2DX also suggesting the safari.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.000
You know, the safari would be fun.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.800
I think that's a good idea, really.

57:44.800 --> 57:50.020
The safari would be, but you know a song I would not, I mean I don't think it's an original,

57:50.020 --> 57:52.280
but Get On Beat Wild Style, definitely not.

57:52.280 --> 57:53.960
It is an original, actually.

57:53.960 --> 57:54.960
Lion & Sashi.

57:54.960 --> 57:57.640
Maybe, I don't know.

57:57.640 --> 58:03.280
would actually be kind of fun. It wouldn't be a fast one, but it would be a fun one.

58:03.280 --> 58:12.280
Okay, um, guitar freaks across the nightmare. That's been done, as a DWI at least.

58:12.280 --> 58:22.120
Drummania with Waza. Waza. There you have it, Waza. MobileMoga being suggested in the

58:22.120 --> 58:27.180
chat room. I believe I saw that on a preliminary list, but I don't know how trustworthy those

58:27.180 --> 58:34.060
lists are, the ones that have been released today, and I don't think it's quite solid.

58:34.060 --> 58:38.540
Twin suggests we can DDR to the sounds of the sirens outside my house, looking for Loki.

58:38.540 --> 58:44.540
Just looped with you at the beginning of Farquaad.

58:44.540 --> 58:47.580
Presto v...

58:47.580 --> 58:48.580
What else are people suggesting in here?

58:48.580 --> 58:50.580
Okay, Presto would be the pain in the butt.

58:50.580 --> 58:51.580
How about...

58:51.580 --> 58:52.580
Oh, I know.

58:52.580 --> 58:53.580
1999.

58:53.580 --> 58:54.580
No!

58:54.580 --> 58:55.580
No!

58:55.580 --> 58:56.580
Fifth Mix.

58:56.580 --> 58:57.580
Saber Dance.

58:57.580 --> 59:00.580
I think that would be fun.

59:00.580 --> 59:01.580
Oh yeah.

59:01.580 --> 59:03.580
Well, here's what I voted for.

59:03.580 --> 59:07.580
I voted for Outer Limits and my other computer.

59:07.580 --> 59:09.580
I don't care, okay?

59:09.580 --> 59:11.580
I voted for it anyways.

59:11.580 --> 59:12.580
It's all in Japanese.

59:12.580 --> 59:14.580
I can't read their freaking Japanese language.

59:14.580 --> 59:15.580
Actually, wait a minute.

59:15.580 --> 59:17.580
Outer Limits, I believe, is the LED, isn't it?

59:17.580 --> 59:18.580
Wasn't that the bonus trick?

59:18.580 --> 59:19.580
Whatever.

59:19.580 --> 59:20.580
Anyway.

59:20.580 --> 59:23.580
And then I also voted for Instant Love.

59:23.580 --> 59:25.580
With DJ Konami

59:31.380 --> 59:33.980
Great that's what we're doing

59:33.980 --> 59:40.460
I want everybody right now listening to the show to go vote for instant love for DDR with the DJ Konami's voice intact

59:40.460 --> 59:42.420
I want that to be the new lesson mode

59:42.420 --> 59:48.100
I swear to God if they release another DDR with let them move as the lesson mode background that old screeching woman

59:48.100 --> 59:50.100
They need to do the new one

59:50.580 --> 59:52.580
That's true we did

59:52.580 --> 59:55.340
Alright, I'm doing my rant.

59:55.340 --> 59:56.880
So that's all about this.

59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.660
Also what they're going to start doing on this site, starting on the 25th, which is

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:09.860
in three days, so next week we'll be able to talk about this, Naoki's diary, how feminine

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.860
of him.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:17.580
No, they said diary, not journal, not logbook, not hey what's going on, it's his diary.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:33.580
I'm about ready. See, I put Naoki in the same category. I put Gakton, as in, you know, very, very pretty, you know, to look at, talented, but definitely on the flame side, on the burning heat side.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:48.580
Dear Diary, I had the members of B4U over today. We went on my nice little Pirates of the Caribbean ride with my monkey, and I did my nails, and I made another song.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:56.580
And I tried to think of another name for another band that I could become. I damned that Jenny Rump for stealing my idea.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.580
I will become her. She will not live!

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.580
Anyways.

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.500
This is kind of odd.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.900
When they said everybody's getting a live journal these days, I didn't think now he

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.940
was getting it on it too.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.700
I wonder if he'll have to have a separate journal for each of his alter egos, you know,

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.140
Revenge and Desire.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:19.500
You know, I'm thinking if it's going to be a weekly update, I'm sure that I could probably,

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:25.060
with the proper payments, try to get somebody to translate it to put up or something, or

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:29.580
I could give highlights from it using my favorite translation program, NISTIA Global Games.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.820
I can just see it now, weekend update with Naoki.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:38.860
Maybe we'll take our own liberties with the translation, mwahaha.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:44.100
Today I got the B4U girls together today, and we got together at my house and had a

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.140
naked spa party, and then we wrote another crappy song, and-

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.140
I said it down my hair!

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.140
No, I'm sorry, that's polytary.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.720
I made polytary mount the B4U girls.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.060
Today I dressed up like Emi.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.060
I like her. She's kinda cute. Maybe I'll become her someday.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.060
Yes, Emmy! Add it to the personalities.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.060
Next!

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:16.060
I asked the chat room to submit me their funny Naoki diary entries. Did you hear this? Naoki's starting a diary on the 25th.

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:21.060
Naoki's diary. What kinds of things do you think Naoki's going to tell us about in his diary?

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:28.060
Well, I don't know. I don't know Naoki, but that's probably why he's making a diary.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.060
Wait, is it a guy or a girl?

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.060
Yes, it's a guy.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.060
Oh, okay.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.060
I wasn't sure.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.060
Just checking.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:38.060
It's all encompassing, okay?

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.060
Deep thoughts with Naoki.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.060
Naoki isn't hidden either.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:42.060
Let's see.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.060
Naoki's...

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.060
Do you ever see It's Pat?

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.060
That's Naoki.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:48.060
No, no, no, because Naoki actually looks very pretty.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.060
I would love to interview Naoki on this show.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.060
I don't know who I have to blow to get that to happen, but come on.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.060
Maybe him.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.060
We gotta make...

01:02:54.060 --> 01:03:06.220
I asked the chat room to submit their funny Naoki diary entries, so if you want to send

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.780
me a PM with what you think Naoki might just write in his diary, I'm going to read those

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:15.580
aloud right now for you, but let's get some background music, shall we, for these lovely

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.780
Naoki diary entries.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.780
Dynamite rave?

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:19.780
Alright.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.500
I gotta find dynamite rave, hold on.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.500
Dynamite Rave is not the worst song ever. Shut your mouth.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.020
That's right, remember? Let them move and buy a bye baby balloon or worse than Dynamite

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:35.220
Rave. We already did that list list on this show.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.660
Nobody can hear you if you don't talk into a microphone.

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:43.660
It's in the category of the worst songs ever folder, which encompasses like DDR USA.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:50.660
I'm so good by Boyzone. Dynamite Rave is a good song. It's just overplayed.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.660
Way, way, way, way, way overplayed.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.660
But it's still a good song.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.660
Way, way, way, way, way, way overplayed.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.660
Did I mention it's over- okay, anyway.

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:03.660
Uh, I couldn't find any of those, so we're just gonna use Brilliant T-Orchestal Groove. How's that sound?

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.660
That's because, you know, it's my favorite song and everybody loves me.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:07.660
No worries.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.660
So, Naoki's Diary.

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.660
Uh, Chaos suggests,

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:22.660
Dear Diary, I made a remix to break down Reggae R&B version. It was really great. It has the Jamaican dude singing instead of the B4U girls.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:30.660
I like how it's referred to as the Jamaican dude. It'll have Jamaican drums and the black people singing, because B4U sucks.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:34.660
I don't know if Naoki would say his own band sucks. That was beautiful, thank you Chaos.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:41.660
JB says Dear Diary, I saw Paula Terry and tried to move my hand down her pants.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.660
That's kind of the obvious entry.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:49.660
DJ Konami submits us not one but two. Here we go.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:54.660
Dear Diary, I remixed Die for the 558th time today. Praise me.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.660
The part that makes that funny is at the end. Praise me.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:10.940
me. Dear Diary, I paid Paula and Kosaka to do some hot action today. Twentz says this.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:17.900
Dear Diary, I had Paula Terry record Let Them Move. And that's it, because Naoki died after

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:26.340
hearing that. SoCalKick, so this is a long one. Dear Diary, I stumbled on an orange site

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:30.260
that plays songs from that one place I used to work for, and I listened to him and this

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:34.860
random white American asked, who would he have to blow to interview me? I am curious

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:38.860
and I'm going to have to pose as a random American hipster and get this blow.

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:44.860
That was the win. SoCal Kicks wins the diary competition. Oh,

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.260
we're getting more. 23rd Magus submits this one.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:56.380
Dear Diary, I realize after doing 50,000 remixes of the same song that I have issues, one of

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.100
which is a major identity crisis.

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.100
No!

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:05.180
We didn't know that.

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:11.340
That's why I'll create Bop 2.0 to deal with that type of trauma.

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.180
I am too busy for that type of trauma, I need to make more songs.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.220
Let's see, I can make a D for you.

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.540
Insert letter, number, letter.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.500
Yeah.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.460
A black lab in the chat room points out,

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:29.060
you know, admitting a problem is the first step to recovery.

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.380
He'll be going through, like, the million-step program.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.300
Oh, our chat room people are hilarious tonight.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.020
They're funny.

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.300
How about another quick break?

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:40.780
What do you guys think?

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.820
You want to go on another subject?

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.260
You want to take a break?

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.260
What do you want to do?

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:48.260
I think that before we go to the break, I'll go ahead and make a mention about Turney.

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:52.760
We're going to have an official site be up hopefully by mid-next week.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:59.260
It will be linked from sacbemani.com, which is S-A-C-B-M-A-N-I dot com.

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.260
Sacbemani.

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.260
Just like it sounds.

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.260
Sacbemani.

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.260
If you don't know how to spell bemani, then you suck.

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.260
Then you have no reason to listen to this.

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.260
Why are you here?

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.260
But we do have a date confirmed.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:16.260
It is November 9th at Scandia on, is it Hillsdale Road?

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.260
I don't know.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.780
Scandia, Madison and I-80.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:20.780
You can't miss it.

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:21.780
It's right by the freeway.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.380
We will have maps to the site.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:30.740
The tournament will be, it will be freestyle and it will be Perfect Attack in the morning.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:31.900
Sponsored by Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.540
Yes, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.580
What about the A-Team?

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:44.820
There will also be a team mode freestyle to be going on during normal freestyle tabulation,

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:50.780
and there also may be another surprise there waiting for us in the form of another Bimani

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:55.980
game, which is on the boat, on its way to come hang out with us.

01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:01.100
This is, we should point out, this is not the same Scandia tournament as the Scandia

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.140
tournament in December, I think they're having one in the Bay Area.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.860
No, this is a different Scandia.

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.780
the Sacramento Scandia, the tournament will not have Scandia in the name, the

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:14.580
tournament name is still kind of being ironed out, but we think we know what it

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.540
is, but we're gonna say it next week. We'll reveal the name

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:22.660
next week. All we can say is shut your mouth. We'll reveal the name next week

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.860
once we have our first meeting to get everything worked out, but we'll be

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:30.100
posting all that information to just about every single freaking forum out

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.900
there. You'd have to be blind to miss it, and I'll say that an Orange Lounge

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:41.900
The Orange Lounge website will be an Orange Lounge new website, we'll have forums in it coming very soon, hopefully in the next couple of weeks.

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:45.900
Wow, so much for that secret.

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:52.900
We didn't confirm it, we're not going to confirm, we're not going to deny those, so there it goes.

01:08:55.900 --> 01:09:00.900
Let's see, Orange Lounge random meeting promoted in SoCal by SCK, that's what the tournament is called I guess.

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.900
No. Thank you, drive-thru, please.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:10.900
I'm looking forward to this, because I'll be getting to get up there and emcee this tournament with my good buddy, Electro...

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.900
God, I can never say... Tal!

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.900
His name's a tongue twister. Tal will be up there, too, and we're gonna emcee this tournament. It'll be fun.

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:21.900
And Jamie, you're gonna do a little emceeing, too, aren't you? You gonna get up there and maybe do a little emceeing?

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.900
I'll be hanging out in the little party room over there going,

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.900
Okay, you need to be doing this...

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:32.100

I want to thank Maple, too, for a lot of the advice at 3am in the morning with information and stuff on how a lot of the tournaments are run.

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:19.260
Okay, let's take a really quick break and we'll have much more information on the tournament next week.

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:24.260
And that's all I have to say. Any other thoughts to take us out?

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.260
Song.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:34.100
Okay, we'll do this. This is a popular song here. We're going to play Spooky for you here

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.100
on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:11.100
You must be, must be, knowing that you're lost

I'm gonna make you feel that you're not in the screen

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.100
We can't go around for a while

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:26.100
We must be ahead of ourselves

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.100
Are you ready?

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.100
Let's see your energy!

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.100

You're a dead animal!

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.100
You are awesome!

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:31.100
The crowd loves you!

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:36.100
Yeah, do it!

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:41.100
You're a dancing machine!

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:46.100
Nice step!

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:51.100
You surprised us all!

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.100
You surprised us all!

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.100
Wow, you are too cool!

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.100
Come on, she's doing great!

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.100
Hi!

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.100
Do you really follow me into the light?

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:15.100
Drilling structures on, drilling structures on my side

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.100

Love in pieces, our fight, all for one Come together friends, we gotta take big chances tonight

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:43.100
Drill instructor, tell me what to do I'm your man, I will follow only you

See us making love all through the night

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:54.100
That's the reason why drill instructor left to fight

Now sound up, one two, bring it on up

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.600

Do you really follow me into the light?

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.600
Drilling structures on, drilling structures on my side

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.600
Do you really think a man's got a life?

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.600
Love and peace is our fight

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.600

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.600

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.600
All for one, come together friends

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.600
We gotta take this chance tonight

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.600
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.600
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:57.600
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.460
very cool

01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:01.420
let's talk about that i got some sad news to report on the show i thought

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.500
though we need to talk about it because it is uh... the money related believe it

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.620
or not

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.400
no whole

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.400
uh... however one of the uh... singers from the group rocks at

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.260
uh... has a brain tumor

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.960
uh... marie frederickson uh... singer with a swedish pop back rocks at best

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.200
known uh... for india after cap contribution center of the heart

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:29.200
And also, the look was circulating on some early Max 2 lists, however it appears it got cut or was just an outlight lie the whole time.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.200
She looks like Lucy Lawless.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.200
That's not her. This isn't her. This is somebody else.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.200
Okay, well that chick looks like Lucy Lawless.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:37.200
That's her out here. I'll get to it here. I'm on a site here.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.200
The 44-year-old singer fainted in her Stockholm home last week, and she's now in the hospital.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:49.200
Her record label, EMI Sweden, if you ever wondered how they ended up on Dance Mania, they were just part of EMI Sweden,

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.440
said that medical tests showed the singer has a small tumor in the back of her head

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.200
but that more tests were needed to determine proper treatment.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:02.040
Moroxet is a duo comprised of this young woman, well, older woman, Miss Fredrickson, and guitarist

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.920
and singer Per Gessel, and they were just about to watch a new single called A Thing

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:14.920
About You in three weeks, and they had plans to tour Europe tour that was going to start

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:18.920
in late October, and the duo is one of the most successful musical exports Sweden has

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:24.280
ever produced and the most successful ever in the US singles charts, which somewhat surprised

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.280
me.

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.520
I always thought ABBA was the bigger of the two bands, but whatever.

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:33.560
Their first UK hit was The Look and a hit number seven on the UK singles charts in 1989.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:38.720
And they've had four more top 10 hits in the UK, including It Must Have Been Love, Joyride,

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:43.440
which were both also big hits in the US, and Almost Unreal.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.880
Fredrickson had also enjoyed successes under her own name, hitting the Swedish charts in

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.920
in 1999, with a duet, Wonderful World, with one of the singers from ABBA, and that picture

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.440
the one you say looks like Lucy Lawless, that's the singer from ABBA.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.440
It should be noted that that small tumor is actually, uh, Polteri.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:05.680
No! Polteri put it there.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:11.680
It's an alien implant from Naoki so that he can control her, too. Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:22.240
Lastly, in November, the duo joined US singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, and Swedish royal

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:34.960
dignitaries at the party for Lopez's European tour.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.100
That's some sad news.

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.240
We don't like it when DDR people are going to die.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.240
Damn, it wasn't Paul-a-tary!

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.240
Grrr!

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.240
Why?

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.240
You're gonna say this and then suddenly Paul-a-tary's gonna get hit by a bus?

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.240
Yeah, suddenly Paul-a-tary's gonna get hit by a bus and you're gonna feel bad, aren't you?

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.240
It's not like anything I ever say ever comes true.

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.240
Oh wait.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.240
Yeah, it does. Damn.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.240
Speaking of, um...

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.240
All my cock-naked chicks just fall from the sky every day now.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.240
Damn.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.240
Asian porn stars.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.240
No. Next, please.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:14.520
One quick little thing, I thought this would be a funny thing to bring up, for sale on

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:19.600
amazon.com through Toys R Us, Barbie Dance Party, and I'm going to post this link in

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:25.940
the chat room here, it's a dance pad, it's Barbie's official dance pad, so if you want

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:30.700
to have the girls over for a night of dancing, you know, want to show off to Ken, it's actually

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:35.420
a separate game that I don't think is affiliated with a certain sort of system, it looks like

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:38.700
uh...

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.740
as it is going to look like one but i don't know we are a rose on it

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.900
i thought that

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:44.980
uh... that's right

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:48.380
diary i struck a deal with metall

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.180
and with the talent and in the air

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:55.180
to release this came to start subverting small children into the dvd are cold

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:58.420
nobody like instead of a rose got little flowers

01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.780
all different

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:02.540
each child that plays this game will get swift

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.780
swift dose of nyoki isn't

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:09.100
And pretty soon, Ann DiMuro is going to be releasing the Gemma dance pad.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.700
Actually, it should be noted that

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:14.900
Pump It Up, that's just Naoki.

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.540
Still Naoki.

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:20.900
No, it's just like a cigarette trying to hook them while they're young.

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:25.780
So instead of having the seven degrees of Kevin Bacon, we don't have the seven degrees of Naoki?

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.980
Did you just compare DDR to smoking?

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:29.340
No!

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:36.100
Maybe smoking crack.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.100
I don't know if this is an actual game or not.

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.080
I guess if I really wanted to I could look around Toys R Us's site some more, but I don't

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.080
feel like it.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.080
So if you guys want to send me stuff, that's fine.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.900
Do you remember that auction on eBay for DDR Kids?

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.940
Yeah, they're selling a DDR Ohasta machine.

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:49.940
That's pretty rad.

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:50.940
I don't think it's Ohasta.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:51.940
It's DDR Kids.

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.940
I'm trying to find the link for that.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.980
Wow, and it's only $50!

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.640
How cheap!

01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.920
i wonder if it's uh... padded though

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:04.580
uh... okay refer fifty dollars uh... did jamie's uh... load up the computer

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.060

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.620
anyways sliver

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:11.340
let's make fun of the barbie had some more uh...

01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.980
barbie and he could be a candidate

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.880
you think there'd be a kid that too

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.080
like blue

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:21.660
so now we're going to have it that go with new party with uh... wonderful

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:25.920
the party that gives protections in the front and back and also on the side got

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.080
the wings

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.760
That's the new barbie pad right there.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.920
Jamie found the link

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.800
to the uh...

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.600
Somebody just posted it in the chat room. They actually just beat you to it.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.980
Looks like Slinky made that post in the chat room here.

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:44.480
Oh! SoCalKicks suggests it's the GI Joe March-a-thon.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.760
GI Joe March-a-thon.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.200
SoCalKicks is witty tonight. He's uh... He's on the ball. He's te-funny.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.260
But this machine, it's like...

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:54.380
It would probably be as tall as me.

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:54.940
Oh, wow.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:57.340
It is kind of more like a little kid's machine.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:58.420
It has this cutesy pad.

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.140
It's like a solo, but it has like a flower shape

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.100
with an up, down, left, right arrow.

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.660
And it's just absolutely adorable.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:06.940
It has a little cheesy curve.

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.540
It looks like it's a little loopy hair.

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.580
I don't know if anybody knows Manders,

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:15.100
but it looks about as tall as her, if anybody knows her.

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.100
Only $800.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.300
What do you think, Jamie?

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.180
Want to pool our money together and buy it?

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.540
I think I have $10 on the couch.

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:25.860
I think I've got about $50 in my collection bottle.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.100
We could sell Dave on the street.

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.420
I think he could get us about $3.

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:35.500
That thing is so cute.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.220
It is very cute.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:36.740
I like that.

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:38.660
It's cute with a K.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:39.940
Somebody needs to buy this.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.340
We need to find some Sacramento arcade owner to buy that.

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.340
Of course, how much would we play it?

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.740
But this is the great thing.

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.980
You could get a little kid away from the big DDR machines.

01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:53.980
You got this little machine. Get all the babies on that instead of trying to jump on our machine.

01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:58.980
Yeah, have it put out tickets. That's it. That's the cure-all. Have this machine put out tickets.

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.980
It would never deal with small children again.

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:04.980
Rob just said that the machine should put out.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:07.980
Thank you for clarifying. Thank you.

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:13.980
Oh, that whole Jenny Rom talk, you know.

01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:16.980
The machine is adorable and people near us need to...

01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:24.980
What else am I being given? I'm being given all these other links. Let's see, this one's called Chat Room Sends Me Random Shit and I look it up.

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:26.980
And...

01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:29.980
Rave Station! Ooh!

01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:30.980
Um, no.

01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:33.980
Have a rave in your house!

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:35.980
E not included.

01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:39.980
Yeah, E not included.

01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:44.980
Oh, what's this? I think this is the Barbie dance pad again. I think somebody just posted that again for somebody who missed it the first time.

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:52.860
oh no Harry Potter vibrating room oh my god that is the worst picture I've ever

01:24:52.860 --> 01:25:01.100
seen look at the Nimbus 2000 toy broom and the thing vibrates and it's about

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:10.540
the width look at how that little kid is holding his little broom and it vibrates

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:15.540
Every little girl's dream. And he has the smile on his face.

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:20.540
This has absolutely nothing to do with DDR, but it's fucking funny.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:25.540
You must hold the shaft of the broom. Everybody say, up!

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:34.540
Dear diary, today I sold my design for the Memphis 2000 Broom to the hotel, and they bought it.

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.000
And they bought it!

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.240
So now my personal vibrating tool is going to be carried around by small children.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.120
Yet another insidious mauki plot, I rule.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.000
DJ Konami wants me to point out that it does have a warning label on it that says,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.140
Warning, this toy does not fly.

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.280
That is cool.

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.880
So don't go jumping off the roof.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.640
Little kids have done that, you know.

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.800
Sat on their Aladdin magic carpet and jumped off the roof and fallen to their deaths and

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.800
wondered why.

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.680
Tommy, I was thinking happy thoughts.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:09.560
No, see, what you do is you're supposed to say, on fly ground,

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.660
and it lifts off from the ground.

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.560
It's not like it just kind of glides.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.960
It's not a glider.

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.680
It flies.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.060
It doesn't glide.

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:18.560
It flies off the ground.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.560
It doesn't glide from the top down.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.120
And Twen posts a nice little, you know how Amazon has the talk back.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.760
You can comment on these things.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.080
So a mother writes, my son has enjoyed zooming around,

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:33.240
pretending he's flying, and it's important to stress to younger kids

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:38.240
that they're only pretending and the brooms can't really fly, playing kiddich and so on.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.480
The motion-sensitive sound effects are apparently fun for him, but they do get kind of old.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.720
The fact that the broom looks just like the one in the movie doesn't hurt, as far as he's

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.720
concerned too.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:54.720
Dear diary, children are stupid, they think that they can fly with a toy broom, ha ha

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.720
ha ha.

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.720
Maybe I should do a diary.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.600
Maybe we should make Naoki's diary.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.880
Let's get Naoki a dead journal.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:06.640
We should make the Orange Lounge dead journal.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:08.200
Maybe we'll have to look into that.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.200
I think so.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.480
Dear diary, we're taking over the world.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.160
We've kidnapped Stalki and picked his brain.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:23.600
Let's see, um, oh we want to do your sim update?

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.520
Yes, let's do your sim update.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:32.460
And then, I also promised we'd plug one of Loki's other creations here, so we're going

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:37.460
We're going to play one of your songs tonight, Loki. So, give us your sim update first, please.

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:47.460
Okay, sim update. No new DWI versions. I really don't care. I've abandoned all hope for DWI since StepMania has surpassed them.

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:56.460
I used to be a pro-DWI guy, but I'm sorry. I've found StepMania, and I love it. So, go StepMania!

01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:06.460
Anyways, supposedly a new version coming out pretty soon, Step Mania 6. For some reason, I already have Step Mania 6. I guess, you know, whatever, CBS Build version.

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:10.460
No, didn't you say that Step Mania 6 was first comprised of, like, some other kind?

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:14.460
It wasn't, like, the actual Step Mania thing, and now I guess they're doing an official one or something?

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:22.460
Yeah, whatever I said. I don't know. Anyways, and then there's also a nice little Max 2 skin that's going to be released that's pretty funny.

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:28.780
so that'll be coming out pretty soon, probably next week or so. No new DDR PC characters.

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:33.580
Turning Mix 2, it's wrapping up as of tonight, so we'll have the results next week for you

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:41.440
guys, see who won that, and that'll be fun. I didn't enter, don't care. And let's see,

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:48.740
other news, it may be possible that I might be starting a file serve on the DDR Maniacs

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:56.500
chat room. So all 1300 of my DWIs out there... You're going to give them away? Maybe. I don't

01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:00.360
know. I have to see, because I'm going to be doing this at work, so I have a T1 line

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.320
constantly running for people to steal it, and I have to see how much hardware space

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:10.780
I have at my computer at work and if the firewall will allow it. So, maybe, maybe not. It might

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:14.980
not happen, but... Oh, somebody's suggesting you should do that file serve in Orange Lounge

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.120
to get more people to come to the channel.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.120
I could.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.120
Mmm.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.120
Okay.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120
Just a thought.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.620
See, other than that, there's a pretty cool thing I found about StepMania, it has a Super

01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:26.620
Shuffle mode.

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:27.620
That's also very fun.

01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:28.620
Super Shuffle?

01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:29.620
Yeah.

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.620
Super Duper Shuffle?

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:34.540
Is that like all notes are completely randomized, not just all notes from up go to left or whatever?

01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:37.220
Does that make us even more of a Super Duper power?

01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:39.620
Uh, yeah.

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:40.620
Basically what Dave said.

01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:46.620
DownUpLeftRight does Super Shuffle and StepMania Beta 6, which is fun.

01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:51.620
And yeah, that's about it. Tons of songs, 1300 songs.

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:54.620
I have an addition for your sim update. I know this is one you haven't really been following,

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:57.620
but remember when we talked a couple weeks ago about the Dreamcast one that's coming out?

01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:00.620
The Feet of Fury? The game that they're doing?

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:02.620
No one plays the Dreamcast anymore.

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.620
I do!

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.620
Hey, I still play both of my Dreamcasts.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.620
I play the Nintendo emulator on the Dreamcast, that's about all I use it for.

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.620
I played DDR the other day on the Dreamcast.

01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:41.860
They released an update on September 20th.

01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:45.340
They're saying the release size is only going to be about 28 megs.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:48.700
There's going to be seven songs in the beta they're going to release very soon.

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:53.120
There's going to be eight characters in it. They're going to have a step editor

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.940
which is going to be...

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:59.300
They've used it to create the steps they've got so far.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:03.980
And they're going to have a swap CD capability where you can

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.200
use the swap CD menu, open up CDs and play your own songs with the music

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:20.520
in Ogg Vorbis format, whatever that is, and the steps in the standard Dance with Intensity

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:25.440
format. So most of the basic stuff is supported but nothing forth, mix or above, like BPM

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:31.280
changes, pauses, freeze arrows, triplets, etc. So it's going to be very basic sorts

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:36.720
of edits. They'll post more about that, and tentatively they're going to have step files

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.920
on the VMU, and it'll let you edit your steps for your own songs without having to burn

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.240
a bunch of CDs. That'd be pretty cool.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.240
So we'll see about that.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.080
It's fun if you beat batteries in your VMU.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.600
Rumor is that's going to be released on October 1st, I guess. So keep an eye on CAGames.com,

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:57.700
and as soon as we get our little hands on it, we'll give you a full review right here

01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:02.040
on Orange House Radio. What's the date today? The 22nd. So you got about, oh actually no,

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.320
it won't be next week. It'll be in a couple weeks.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:11.920
We'll have it soon. We'll have it soon. When we get it, we'll tell you about it, as we

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:16.600
always do here on Not Orange Long. We're going to take one more quick break and then come

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:21.100
back and wrap up the show, but actually for this break, we've got a very special song.

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:24.600
Loki, you want to tell us about this song? This is Night by Loki. You want us to play

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.240
this song for us? Oh, this is one of my old songs. I thought you wanted me to play this

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:30.520
one. You want to play one of the other ones instead? Can you play two? Can't play what?

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.520
can we play two? Oh, they're kind of long, actually.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:35.520
Yeah, they're all kind of long, so I just want to do one, if that's cool.

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.520
Let's play a newer one.

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.520
I mean, Nightmare's pretty good.

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.520
How about...

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.520
Sorry, let me bring up your list.

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520
Let's see...

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:50.520
Let's start with...

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:54.520
How about we do the one I named after last week's show, Metro Apple.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.520
Great, yeah.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:59.520
An ode to my speaking skills here.

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.120
Okay, we'll try that one.

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:04.260
I made this a couple months ago. It's fun.

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:08.040
So we're going to play this as Metroopolis. Any other stories behind the song you want to tell us about?

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.520
No, I didn't really have a title for it until about last week.

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:15.280
And people in chat were asking if I'm going to play that full version of

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.040
Dark Forest and also another special

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.440
Ginny Rom song.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.240
I'm going to try and get to those. If we don't get to them during the show,

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.800
we'll do them during the afterbirth, okay? For sure.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.560
So here we go, this is a Loki with Metropolis here on

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:37.560
orange lounge radio

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:24.100
Oh, you could say.

01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:39.100
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:44.100
Let's go wrestle, let's go wrestle, let's go wrestle.

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:15.400
of my old stuff on there. Pretty good one. Well, it sucks. My one song on there, I have

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:21.120
two. I have one called Dark Side and My Nightmare. Unfortunately, stupidmp3.com copied over My

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:25.480
Nightmare with Dark Side, so I have two copies of that song. And My Nightmare was really

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:29.040
awesome. I love that song, so if we can get to play that maybe by the end of the show,

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.720
maybe. Okay, that'd be cool. We'll get that worked in there somehow. If not, we'll do

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:36.320
in the super-secret after birth.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.240
Now that's a super-secret.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:42.360
Twins putting a link in the chat room for everybody.

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.880
Okay, one more topic I want to talk about for the end of the show.

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.720
I want to talk about fair pricing for DDR.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:54.280
Because there's been some local arcades in the area that have kind of been wondering,

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.240
you know, what's a fair price for us to be charging for DDR? So I thought I'd

01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:58.720
take your guys' suggestions.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:02.280
A lot of people bitch and bitch and bitch about the Metreon being on the high end

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:07.420
of places. I believe it's either $1.50 or $2 a game for three songs. I think that's

01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:13.620
a little bit overpriced. Very excessive. But you could get on TV on that show, Extended

01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:24.620
Play. Ooh. It's worth the $2, man. Or not. Well, I think that places like Metreon, that's

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:31.720
way too much. I mean, I can see for newer mixes, like Max II and maybe Max or Fifth

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:40.360
Mix being four for three songs or something along that lines. Like I know the one Riptide

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:47.620
Arcade is at the one at Pier 39. Yeah, that place has joint premium for Max II, but it's

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:52.540
like eight quarters or something like that. But it's expensive, but it's joint premium,

01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:58.740
So what you're saying is that it costs $2 to play singles or doubles?

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:05.620
Well, you just find someone to split it with because I never go to an arcade alone, if

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:09.180
I know that I'm not going to meet anyone there, so that kind of stuff.

01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:13.260
I've gone to arcades alone, nobody loves me.

01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:15.540
I read the best to go to an arcade by myself.

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:20.060
No, seriously, if I go to an arcade in Sacramento, I've never not seen anyone there, except that

01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:25.060
when they first got maxed, I went there at 11 o'clock in the morning and I didn't see

01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:26.060
anyone maxed.

01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:27.060
It's because they were asleep.

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.060
I was like, okay, I must play max.

01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:33.740
Then I played Fantasy on reverse and I've now played reverse and I failed.

01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:36.380
You had an interesting comment, Jamie, about joint premium.

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:37.380
Your thoughts on joint premium?

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:41.900
Well, it makes sense to have older, if you've got multiple machines, have the older ones

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.760
on joint premium.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:47.900
That way you will encourage people to make use of those older machines too while you've

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:51.460
you've got people that are on the more expensive machines.

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:54.660
That way, all your machines will stay in use.

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:57.380
Good example is Scandia, who are Scandia.

01:41:57.380 --> 01:41:59.180
They've got the fourth mix.

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:02.820
Two tokens for three songs, joint premium is on.

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:04.700
So if two people want to play, it's

01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:07.220
one token for three songs, a piece.

01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:08.140
So that's really nice.

01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:11.260
And what's worked for me, I've gotten back

01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:12.540
into playing doubles, thanks to that.

01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:13.740
Because doubles are always expensive,

01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:15.820
and I always bitch about how expensive double are.

01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:19.780
for two tokens and joint premium being on, I can play three songs of doubles for two

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:25.940
tokens. That's really nice. So, I like that. SoCalKicks is suggesting that you know what,

01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:29.700
DarkSecra, you ought to just win the lottery and run an arcade the right way.

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:34.060
Hey, if I could, you know I would. And Scandiad rules because they have bumper

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:38.380
boats. Scandiad does indeed have bumper boats and

01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:42.580
they have a batting cage. So joint premium is really cool.

01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:49.700
So you think a fair price, four tokens for three songs, let's say a dollar for three

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:54.700
songs too much, I think 75 cents, a little more fair, I mean what's the most you will

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:56.300
pay for DDR?

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.300
Have any of you ever paid to play DDR at the Metreon?

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.300
I have.

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:03.700
I paid two dollars for three songs at Anime Expo my first year but it was the first DDR

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:04.700
machine I had ever seen.

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:05.700
It was a third mix.

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:10.020
I played at the Metreon just because like, yay it's the Metreon and I didn't know about

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:16.000
up here at 39 because that was stupid and so I paid way too much but yeah it's cool.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.560
I'm willing to pay a dollar for three songs, I've gotten used to it because I remember

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:25.580
when at first Roseville Golf Land had gotten Guitar Freaks and there was all these people,

01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:30.300
everyone was bitching including me going, well it should be 75 cents for three songs

01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:36.100
or 50 cents for three songs because you know it's not DDR and DDR was a dollar for four

01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:38.140
back then because it was a fourth mix.

01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:42.140
And then they said, no, it's going to be a dollar for three. You'll get used to it. And everyone has.

01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:46.140
And that's basically just been the way of things now, like a dollar for three songs and this stuff.

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:50.140
I paid three dollars to play doubles at Phantom of Khan on a fourth plus machine.

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.140
Wow. Sucker.

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:54.140
That's what I made two years ago. Was it two years ago?

01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:57.140
This year. Oh, they had it this year. I didn't realize.

01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:04.140
You know, the year before, I paid a dollar fifty to play, you know, each game of DDR because it was a fourth plus.

01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:09.180
Um, you know, like I said, my first anime expo, I paid $2 a game to, to play on my very

01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:16.260
first ever DDR machine, so, I mean, now we can afford to be picky.

01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:20.980
I, I paid the full price over at the Metron a couple times, just because I wanted to say

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.760
I played DDR at the Metron.

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.760
That's all it was.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.760
I just wanted to say, okay, you know.

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760
I was there that time.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.760
I played, I played one game.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.900
That was it for me because, you know, yay, Fifth Mix, I could have played that anywhere

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:32.900
at the time.

01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:33.900
So.

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:36.900
Fifth Mix is becoming a relic along with Fifth Mix.

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:08.900
It's got the PlayStation, you know, sometimes it's just one game, you know.

01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:09.900
That machine was crappy though?

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:12.900
And plus I got to play the old school 1.5 mix, and how often do you get to play that anymore?

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:18.900
It was expensive, yes I was ripped off, but you know, it was fun, that's what it's all about, it was worth it.

01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:21.900
Well the thing about that particular machine, the one that was out in the hall outside the movie theater,

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:27.900
is you get the glare from those big windows outside and half of the machine was faded in color.

01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:32.900
Oh yeah, I mean if I were a regular gamer living in San Francisco, I would not go to the Metreon on a regular basis.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:36.860
basis. In fact, I know someone who does, and I'm like, why don't you go over to Riptide

01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:39.740
Arcade? They've got more money and they've got a better deal on their games. Why don't

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.180
you go over there? And it's just kind of like, oh, I don't feel like walking over there.

01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:46.700
I don't feel like taking bar to the bus. So it's just kind of like, well, if you really

01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:57.700
want to pay it, then go for it. So, I guess that does it for DDR at the Metron.

01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:03.700
So we think fair prices, typical standard is about what, 25 cents each song, pretty fair?

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:06.700
I would probably say for max 2 fair is $1 for 3.

01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:13.700
For even for 5th mix I'd say $1 for 4, anything under.

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:24.700
For 3rd mix, actually 4th mix and under, I would say 3 for 4 or 2 for 3 and leave it at that.

01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:28.700
You know, for 1.5, you know, 1 for 1.

01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:29.700
SoCalKicks suggests...

01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:31.700
Or maybe 1 for 3, I don't know.

01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:33.700
SoCalKicks suggests 30 cents for 5 songs on a max 2.

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:35.700
Okay, it has to be something realistic,

01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:36.700
where the arcade owner is going to make their money back.

01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:40.700
If it's a nickel arcade, that's a whole different story.

01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:43.700
Okay, we're going to take one more quick break

01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.700
and then come back and wrap up the show.

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:46.700
The reason why we're taking this break,

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.700
there's some songs I really want to play for you guys.

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:51.700
We've got Jenny Rom with a song called Do You Want to Flirt,

01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:53.700
which is one of the producer's favorite songs.

01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:58.040
songs and then we're gonna hear the full five-minute version of Steve Reiner with

01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:02.940
Dark Black Forest long trip so we're gonna play those and we're gonna come

01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:09.940
back, wrap things up, and that'll be a show. I'll see you in a little bit.

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.020
Can you feel the sky?

01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:37.380
Here we are

01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.480
One moment don't stop and love me baby

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.820
One moment don't stop and kiss me baby

01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:47.400
One moment don't stop and love me baby tonight

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:50.340
With me so high

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:53.420
One moment love is not forever

01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:56.440
One moment we'll just be together

01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:00.440
One moment don't stop and love me baby tonight

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.500
The night will fly

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:35.500
In the shadow of my life

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:40.500
You can be my sunlight tonight

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:44.500
And you wanna come with me

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:48.500
Hey, do you wanna have a hug?

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:51.500
Kiss me now, be my boy

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:54.500
I'll see you until the sky

01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.500
You'll be mine

01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:58.500
One woman down south

01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.500
Love me baby

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:32.500
It's not forever

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.500
On the moon we'll best be together

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:39.500
Woman woman dance like a lonely baby tonight

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.500
Land or flight

01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.500
What do you want to die for?

01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:13.500
It's a long way to go, honey.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:18.500
I know. But I'm afraid. Where are we going?

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.500
into the dark black forest.

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:46.500
Into the dark, black forest.

01:55:46.500 --> 01:56:12.660
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:17.660
Stream Bobbani Radio. That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:21.660
Well, we're coming up on the end of the show here, Orange Lounge Radio episode number 13.

01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:24.660
Uh, we had a big debate about that in the beginning of the show, by the way.

01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:27.660
Uh, so I'm just going around the room collecting closing thoughts.

01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:29.660
Uh, Loki, any closing thoughts?

01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:31.660
Um...

01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:34.660
No, duct tape is cool.

01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:35.660
Duct tape is cool.

01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:40.660
Duct tape is cool. In fact, Naoki owns duct tape. He will become one of duct tape.

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:45.820
Dear Diary, I've found many uses for duct tape. Sometimes I'll strip down Politarian

01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:46.820
t-anyway.

01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:52.940
I use it to attach my, uh, male members for when I want to change sexes. You know, switching

01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:54.580
me to playing Politarian Naoki.

01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:58.460
Did you ever see that one scene in Silence of the Lambs where it-nevermind.

01:56:58.460 --> 01:56:59.460
No, I haven't.

01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:00.460
Never mind.

01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:02.460
And Dave, any thoughts from you?

01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:05.460
And Dave, any final thoughts from you?

01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:09.580
Um, football is cool. I hope DDR USA is.

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:20.300
is, I need to get a Japanese PS2, yeah, 2DX rule. Any final thoughts from you, Jamie?

01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:24.980
I like fire. I like fire, too, and that's my final thought.

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:31.040
So, thanks. We light my fire. We light my fire, baby. Thanks to everybody

Let's end this on a high note.

01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:31.900
That was very good, Jamie. I'm impressed.

01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:34.060
