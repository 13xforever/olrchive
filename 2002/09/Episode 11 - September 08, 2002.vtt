[SPEAKER_12]: You have no morals, darling.

00:54.277 --> 00:59.339
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun, and it's a scorching case of curfews.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.701
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss my grip, nooch.

01:01.721 --> 01:04.042
[SPEAKER_00]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hidey ho.

01:04.122 --> 01:06.383
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

[SPEAKER_11]: Me too!

01:07.844 --> 01:08.344
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucker, yeah?

01:08.624 --> 01:10.145
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working on it.

01:10.225 --> 01:10.666
[SPEAKER_14]: Loser.

01:10.806 --> 01:11.326
[SPEAKER_11]: Lame!

01:12.346 --> 01:13.267
[SPEAKER_11]: On the side of my face.

01:14.241 --> 01:18.725
[SPEAKER_11]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.

01:18.786 --> 01:24.791
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

01:27.134 --> 01:46.980

[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, everyone.

[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello.

02:11.604 --> 02:12.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, there.

02:12.764 --> 02:21.847
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody else is busy this week, apparently, now that school's back in session, although most of the people on this show are out of high school already, with the exception of a couple.

02:21.887 --> 02:27.989
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave and Paul are still in high school, but like Brad and Irene, they had a visitor coming in from out of town, and Jamie had to go to another event.

02:28.009 --> 02:28.909
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into all that later.

02:29.489 --> 02:32.230
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, this is episode number 11 for September the 8th of 2002.

02:32.690 --> 02:34.751
[SPEAKER_05]: And we might get some more guests later.

02:34.811 --> 02:37.212
[SPEAKER_05]: There's rumors that some people might show up later as the show goes on.

02:38.812 --> 02:42.074
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

02:42.754 --> 02:44.755
[SPEAKER_05]: And any other opening thoughts from the people in the room?

02:45.735 --> 02:45.955
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

02:46.415 --> 02:47.215
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fair enough.

02:47.336 --> 02:51.277
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get some music and we'll be right back with Orange Lounge Radio live.

02:51.837 --> 02:53.818
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to join our chat room, go to...

06:10.075 --> 06:21.326
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't cry, I don't even know what true solitude is I'm still holding a drop of tears in my pale petals

09:53.237 --> 09:57.980
[SPEAKER_13]: From Step Squad to Orange Labs, this DDR sucks!

09:58.421 --> 10:03.844
[SPEAKER_13]: Holla, Holla, Holla, Steppin'!

10:03.864 --> 10:10.028
[SPEAKER_13]: T-T-P-O I have no idea what half those little acronyms mean.

10:10.609 --> 10:11.529
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I just uncool?

10:12.410 --> 10:12.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

10:13.379 --> 10:14.459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they mean either.

10:34.105 --> 10:35.866
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:00.120 --> 11:00.620
[SPEAKER_05]: So what else?

11:00.640 --> 11:01.940
[SPEAKER_05]: What were we talking about during the break there?

11:01.980 --> 11:06.541
[SPEAKER_05]: During the break we were kind of talking about songs that have been released for simulators lately.

11:06.861 --> 11:12.722
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've been looking... Now for those that don't know Matt, also known as Loki, he's really big into the simulator.

11:13.222 --> 11:17.983
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that don't know what a DDR simulator is, dance with intensity, step mania, things like that.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Things that will emulate DDR on your computer basically.

11:20.223 --> 11:21.324
[SPEAKER_05]: Or simulate, I should say.

11:21.624 --> 11:25.544
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people get on my ass for not clarifying the difference between emulate and simulate.

11:25.944 --> 11:26.985
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, whatever.

11:27.025 --> 11:28.405
[SPEAKER_05]: It's DDR on your computer basically.

11:29.065 --> 11:29.265
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

11:30.094 --> 11:34.850
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki really big into this, likes to download every single freaking song he can find and play them all.

11:35.746 --> 11:36.106
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

11:36.126 --> 11:37.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a sim scene update.

11:37.347 --> 11:39.269
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about some stuff you've been looking for recently.

11:39.709 --> 11:40.370
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.

11:40.450 --> 11:49.377
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, especially at my job, I suppose I should be actually doing real work at my job, but instead I exploit their T1 line.

11:49.737 --> 11:50.117
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.

11:50.378 --> 11:56.022
[SPEAKER_02]: And so lately I've been actually searching some of the smaller Japanese sites.

11:56.282 --> 12:01.666
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the ones that you can't understand a thing that's on them, but you see, you know, song files with BMS stuff.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, some of the stuff I've actually found...

12:05.269 --> 12:05.609
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

12:28.442 --> 12:40.055
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there's a, I forget which site I saw it on, but there's some guy that's actually doing basically like a mix, you know, with a bunch of different songs he's going to be releasing, and they're all Christian music.

12:43.078 --> 12:47.583
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the comment there from the little stuffed ferret or whatever the heck this thing is?

12:48.083 --> 12:49.024
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

12:53.061 --> 12:57.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so there's going to be a DDR God mix coming out soon, basically.

12:57.264 --> 12:58.105
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

12:59.526 --> 13:02.228
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very scary, but... Jesus Christ, it's DDR!

13:02.869 --> 13:06.231
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, well, I've already got that Paranoia Catholic, so there's the start.

13:07.172 --> 13:07.492
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

13:07.892 --> 13:09.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Paranoia Catholic?

13:09.934 --> 13:10.234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

13:10.714 --> 13:16.939
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Paranoia Catholic... There's tons of Paranoia mixes out there that we don't even know about.

13:17.662 --> 13:18.162
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there.

13:18.182 --> 13:20.203
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have a list on there.

13:20.223 --> 13:28.627
[SPEAKER_02]: If you actually search under Yahoo or something for Paranoia and then maybe DDR, they'll actually have a website that you can pull up a list of every single Paranoia ever made.

13:29.127 --> 13:31.108
[SPEAKER_02]: All the remixes that people have done that are fan-made.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.869
[SPEAKER_05]: As if you needed more Paranoias.

13:33.169 --> 13:35.570
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have links to the actual step files, too.

13:35.830 --> 13:36.090
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

13:36.130 --> 13:36.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you can download them.

13:37.211 --> 13:37.991
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of cool.

13:38.311 --> 13:40.452
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you dance little crosses in the Christian mix?

13:40.472 --> 13:42.493
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of like up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right.

13:42.553 --> 13:47.355
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just instead of some of the orchestra hits, you have God, God, God, that kind of stuff.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.993
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Madonna in a prayer going, God, God.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.634
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not quite, but anyway.

13:54.115 --> 14:00.676
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things, Bimani Ruler, Dave, actually he had a few files, eight more files that he was releasing.

14:00.956 --> 14:03.357
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some of his older stuff that look really awesome.

14:03.697 --> 14:07.958
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done some of the Parapara music by Hero Beat and My Sweet Banana and that kind of stuff.

14:08.358 --> 14:11.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, there's a few other ones that you can actually get right now.

14:11.178 --> 14:13.499
[SPEAKER_02]: He has Max Enigma, which is in Tourney Mix 2.

14:14.179 --> 14:16.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like Max mixed with Enigma music or something?

14:17.260 --> 14:17.420
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.060
[SPEAKER_02]: By that band Enigma?

14:19.100 --> 14:25.744
[SPEAKER_02]: He made it with the key sounds from Max 300 and 2DX Sims.

14:26.264 --> 14:28.506
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I recognize most of it in there.

14:28.726 --> 14:30.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it is just the key sounds from that.

14:30.767 --> 14:32.448
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just made his own mix out of it.

14:33.888 --> 14:38.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Something similar to what I was going to, but I got pissed off with it and decided not to.

14:38.931 --> 14:40.372
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one he's also released.

14:40.772 --> 14:44.454
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a link on DDR Maniacs in their boards.

14:44.494 --> 14:45.735
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got one for Gravity.

14:46.155 --> 14:49.798
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:09.213 --> 15:11.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not make DDR 2DX.

15:11.574 --> 15:14.715
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is pretty much what they're doing is making like 2DX.

15:14.855 --> 15:16.595
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's how they're making it harder.

15:16.695 --> 15:25.138
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how do you make DDR steps harder without getting just more convoluted and more like 2DX style step patterns?

15:25.178 --> 15:26.218
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's getting hard.

15:26.898 --> 15:34.860
[SPEAKER_05]: The freeze arrows are one way of doing it because the freeze arrows will screw you up on songs like Ordinary World where if you don't spin or do a little trick with your feet, you're not going to hit them all.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.321
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, you know, they are hard, but they do go with the music.

15:37.810 --> 15:40.370
[SPEAKER_02]: They go with the music perfectly, so I give them that.

15:40.791 --> 15:41.291
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

15:42.031 --> 15:46.132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still trying to get the other six or so files I'm missing.

15:46.152 --> 15:55.553
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a deal with the webmaster at DDR Mania X. I was going to send him some anime, and he was going to send me a burned copy, a CD with them on there.

15:56.253 --> 15:59.094
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, there's been some problems with me sending it to him.

15:59.734 --> 16:03.195
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear we have a lot of fans of the show in the DDR Mania X chatroom, so hello!

16:03.275 --> 16:03.935
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all of you.

16:04.075 --> 16:04.375
[SPEAKER_05]: Love ya!

16:05.407 --> 16:05.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Big kisses.

16:06.287 --> 16:07.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hear they hate the show.

16:09.629 --> 16:10.189
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised.

16:10.210 --> 16:10.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what can you do?

16:11.390 --> 16:13.511
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't even know if they've listened, but whatever.

16:14.192 --> 16:16.833
[SPEAKER_02]: They hate the show, so much for that.

16:18.214 --> 16:18.994
[SPEAKER_05]: We all hate this show.

16:19.334 --> 16:25.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, sim-wise, I mean, no updates as far as DWI goes.

16:25.397 --> 16:29.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Step Mania, I heard there's a Beta 6 out there somewhere, but I haven't played it and don't really care to.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.161
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given up on Step Mania.

16:33.056 --> 16:40.079
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Step Mania personally, but, you know, I don't really play DDR Sims because I just can't do DDR on my fingers.

16:40.099 --> 16:40.659
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make sense.

16:40.899 --> 16:44.741
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, when I'm playing DDR at home, I'll do the official Konami one.

16:44.841 --> 16:47.102
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you want to ask why the hell would I play that.

16:47.682 --> 16:49.222
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I can play with the pirates.

16:49.602 --> 16:49.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Arr!

16:50.863 --> 16:52.063
[SPEAKER_05]: The new DDR pirates.

16:54.292 --> 17:01.435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and for those who didn't hear, the new DDRPC characters, they've been releasing characters every other week or so.

17:01.775 --> 17:10.099
[SPEAKER_05]: The most recent characters they released, Elliot and, I forget the name of the other ones, started with C. I'm sure Charum will fill me in.

17:10.519 --> 17:12.260
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pirates, they're two pirates.

17:13.161 --> 17:19.003
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one were a couple of nightclubs, the second one were kind of, I don't know, dressed like cowboys.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.405
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the cowboys are the hidden ones in the game.

17:23.471 --> 17:27.675
[SPEAKER_05]: The other ones they released were kind of like, I don't know, they had a unique style to them.

17:27.695 --> 17:31.478
[SPEAKER_05]: They wore those hats on their heads that cover your whole head type thing.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.279
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they've got pirates out.

17:33.299 --> 17:36.441
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to know, though, is when are we going to get pirate music in DDR?

17:36.622 --> 17:38.403
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when are we going to have it?

17:39.704 --> 17:41.545
[SPEAKER_05]: What exactly is pirate music?

17:41.585 --> 17:44.107
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the theme from the Pirates of the Caribbean or something?

17:44.628 --> 17:46.629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

17:48.491 --> 17:50.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo ho ho, argh, get off me pad, matey.

17:51.633 --> 17:52.394
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, stuff like that.

17:53.775 --> 17:54.215
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

17:54.756 --> 17:58.840
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, sim file stuff, there is tons of it out there, you just gotta find it.

17:59.020 --> 18:13.733
[SPEAKER_02]: I might, if time permits, one of these days, just actually link to all these sites that have really cool stuff on them, and, you know, throw that out there, but in the meantime, I'm trying to get the largest collection on the internet, and one person's beaten me so far, but that'll be, uh,

18:14.997 --> 18:15.698
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:35.560 --> 18:42.584
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Jack, you know, seriously, I've actually gotten a lot more of his music that's in there.

18:42.724 --> 18:43.384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the same.

18:44.205 --> 18:45.585
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so is all of the erotic songs.

18:45.606 --> 18:49.227
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, literally, I have a new erotic song that's just a copy of an old erotic song.

18:49.648 --> 18:55.871
[SPEAKER_05]: An old erotic song from the first couple albums was called Sex on the Phone, which is a pretty well-known erotic song outside of DDR.

18:56.271 --> 19:01.394
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a new one on the latest album, or no, actually, I don't think it was the latest album, but the one before it, called Tempt Me on the Line.

19:01.634 --> 19:02.775
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

19:03.295 --> 19:05.738
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost the exact same melody, too, if you listen to it or something.

19:05.758 --> 19:06.678
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still cheesy.

19:06.719 --> 19:09.741
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got his... What was it?

19:09.781 --> 19:10.822
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Take Me Out to the Ballgame.

19:10.862 --> 19:12.584
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one that's School's Out.

19:13.325 --> 19:13.765
[SPEAKER_02]: That one.

19:14.546 --> 19:16.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Which isn't that School's Out for Summer.

19:16.368 --> 19:17.108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another one.

19:17.148 --> 19:19.150
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've also got one called Secret Agent Man.

19:19.971 --> 19:22.393
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not... It's not the Austin Powers Secret Agent Man.

19:22.413 --> 19:23.334
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping it was.

19:23.354 --> 19:25.636
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, that'd be sweet, but no.

19:26.497 --> 19:27.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately not.

19:27.178 --> 19:30.463
[SPEAKER_02]: Bus Stop would probably do a remix of Secret Agent Man.

19:31.224 --> 19:32.045
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very good point.

19:32.185 --> 19:34.208
[SPEAKER_05]: An artist that sounds the same all the time.

19:34.448 --> 19:36.631
[SPEAKER_05]: Three words, or four words, Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

19:38.574 --> 19:40.036
[SPEAKER_05]: Artists that sound the same all the time.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

19:43.744 --> 19:44.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

19:44.204 --> 19:46.465
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the FU of the week.

19:46.505 --> 19:50.066
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the big fuck you of the week that Jamie always likes to do when she's here.

19:50.086 --> 19:52.587
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, she's not here this week.

19:53.007 --> 19:55.728
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to fill in for her with our fuck yous of the week.

19:55.748 --> 19:57.768
[SPEAKER_05]: And I allowed the chat room to participate this week.

19:58.129 --> 20:00.769
[SPEAKER_05]: They sent me all their various fuck yous over private message.

20:00.789 --> 20:02.330
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't even opened them up to read them yet.

20:02.350 --> 20:05.611
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to read them live on air and see if they're stupid or what.

20:06.269 --> 20:07.930
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:31.772 --> 20:34.715
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck me, I'm an asshole for not finishing that intro, sorry.

20:35.155 --> 20:38.198
[SPEAKER_05]: And also for not doing a damn thing on the webpage, that's my bad.

20:38.238 --> 20:44.663
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping to get the webpage fixed up and all prettied and updated a lot, because it's kind of out of date.

20:45.824 --> 20:51.589
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't get around to that either, so I'm sorry, and a big fuck you to me for messing that up.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.671
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a fuck you of the week, Matt?

20:54.552 --> 20:57.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know, because this is in my music, obviously, so...

21:00.575 --> 21:01.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gee, that's better.

21:02.998 --> 21:03.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.

21:04.119 --> 21:08.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, FQ to the... Now, granted, I love QZAR.

21:08.965 --> 21:12.109
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Entertainment Zone because it's QZAR that's relatively close.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.412
[SPEAKER_02]: But goddamn, they're lazy.

21:14.792 --> 21:15.073
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

21:15.928 --> 21:17.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, they're very lazy.

21:18.170 --> 21:21.333
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to work at QZAR, so I know how lazy you can be at that job.

21:21.873 --> 21:24.576
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you used to be the guy that would stand there and read out the rules?

21:24.856 --> 21:25.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was.

21:26.357 --> 21:28.659
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted your job so bad when I was in high school.

21:28.699 --> 21:29.360
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, okay.

21:29.780 --> 21:32.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's basically what the job consists of at QZAR.

21:32.903 --> 21:36.366
[SPEAKER_02]: You sit on your ass in the office talking to the manager while someone's doing a brief.

21:36.706 --> 21:38.608
[SPEAKER_02]: When your brief comes up, you go do the brief.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.011
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you go help people get in the arena.

21:41.051 --> 21:44.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down, watch people play in the arena, make sure everyone gets out of the arena and go back and sit in the office.

21:45.117 --> 21:45.979
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of sitting.

21:46.259 --> 21:46.640
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

21:48.082 --> 21:49.444
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't go out there and arrest players?

21:50.245 --> 21:52.108
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well you can, but what's the point?

21:52.509 --> 21:53.771
[SPEAKER_02]: No one really cares anyways.

21:54.369 --> 21:56.791
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, because they wouldn't order me a pizza.

21:56.831 --> 22:01.055
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to walk around the corner to get a delicious pizza and go get pizza there.

22:02.016 --> 22:02.496
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucked.

22:03.417 --> 22:04.478
[SPEAKER_05]: So a big fuck you to Cusar?

22:05.318 --> 22:07.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, to the Cusar employees.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.281
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fair enough.

22:09.642 --> 22:14.966
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a ton of chatroom FUs to get to, so I've got to get to the FUs in the chatroom.

22:15.687 --> 22:24.593
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join our chatroom, just join any other side IRC server like irc.eggheads.org and join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

22:24.613 --> 22:29.677
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the same server that a lot of the big Bomani channels are on, like DDR Freak and 2DX Style and all those.

22:30.157 --> 22:31.540
[SPEAKER_05]: are also on that same server.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.403
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.

22:33.483 --> 22:36.229
[SPEAKER_02]: An FU to Nickelodeon for cancelling Invader Zim.

22:36.389 --> 22:36.769
[SPEAKER_02]: Again?

22:37.190 --> 22:39.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually gone for good now, I think.

22:39.254 --> 22:40.076
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on this morning.

22:41.107 --> 22:42.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, damn it.

22:42.287 --> 22:44.028
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep changing the time around.

22:44.148 --> 22:46.408
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to them for changing the time around all the time.

22:46.528 --> 22:49.189
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to stop the music because bless you to TiVo.

22:49.249 --> 22:51.710
[SPEAKER_05]: Because thanks to TiVo, we just got a TiVo in the house.

22:51.790 --> 22:54.871
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell it to record Invader Zim every time it's on, and it will.

22:55.071 --> 22:59.252
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what time it's on, it'll find when Invader Zim's on and tape it for me.

22:59.292 --> 22:59.672
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

23:00.352 --> 23:01.092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you were saying?

23:02.093 --> 23:03.293
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

23:03.473 --> 23:04.113
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to them.

23:04.193 --> 23:07.074
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to me for missing the whole thing of...

23:08.736 --> 23:10.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Trigger Happy TV, because that shit is awesome.

23:10.897 --> 23:11.217
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

23:11.618 --> 23:11.998
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.319
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any, uh, FDs of the week, Bradley?

23:15.480 --> 23:16.980
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you have, I'll let you have Jamie's music.

23:17.000 --> 23:25.465
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, uh, I don't know how many bad things happened this week, but just, uh, general fuck you to teeny buffers that hang around RVGL on...

23:27.387 --> 23:32.272
[SPEAKER_15]: The local arcade on Friday nights and toward into Saturdays.

23:32.673 --> 23:36.757
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, we manage to give a big fuck you to them every week on the show, but they deserve it, so go right ahead.

23:36.777 --> 23:42.984
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they stand around looking stupid and get in the way and look at each other and everything.

23:43.084 --> 23:43.605
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you hear that?

23:43.685 --> 23:45.787
[SPEAKER_05]: All you ever do is get in the way, you damn kids.

23:46.028 --> 23:46.708
[SPEAKER_05]: Get off our machine.

23:46.728 --> 23:47.069
[SPEAKER_05]: Go away.

23:47.975 --> 23:54.680
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you notice that it's interesting that this week, finally, they added a little sign that says, put your token here if you want to play next.

23:55.240 --> 24:05.567
[SPEAKER_05]: Because since they got rid of USA, finally, and they have the fourth plus, now the veterans are taking over both machines, so there's no, like, newbie machine for people to stand in line for and not worry about tokens.

24:06.007 --> 24:10.070
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you've got the token line on both machines, and some parents just don't understand the concept of a token line.

24:10.870 --> 24:12.351
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it had to be explained.

24:12.391 --> 24:14.173
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have a bat for those type of people.

24:15.073 --> 24:16.494
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a big orange bat out in the car.

24:16.954 --> 24:17.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

24:18.295 --> 24:20.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get on to the FUs of the week from the chatroom.

24:21.157 --> 24:23.699
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't even read these yet, so let's see what we've got.

24:25.320 --> 24:25.840
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

24:26.601 --> 24:30.683
[SPEAKER_05]: Twen gives a big fuck you to the first mini-competition they had.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.505
[SPEAKER_05]: Four players, two basic, one trick, one maniac.

24:33.545 --> 24:34.406
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the maniac.

24:34.966 --> 24:38.889
[SPEAKER_05]: He got a friggin' kata and the scoring was based off the AAA score, so he got last.

24:40.478 --> 24:45.281
[SPEAKER_05]: and they got Dynamite Rave hiring Mr. T and his cattle was Orion 7-8 and he failed it so he got one.

24:45.481 --> 24:49.563
[SPEAKER_05]: So he basically got screwed in a tournament so FU to that tournament the twin partners have made it in.

24:50.764 --> 25:00.809
[SPEAKER_05]: JB gives a big FU, fuck you, to the Saints Go Marching on 4th Plus because he got a... he accidentally selected Maniac thinking it was Trick somehow and failed it at the arcade.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.390
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the machine's fault, dummy.

25:02.410 --> 25:03.851
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another FU after we're done here too.

25:04.331 --> 25:05.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, go ahead with your FU.

25:05.859 --> 25:16.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my FU goes to Country Club Lanes in their fucking Max machine because it has a fucked up right arrow on the player one side.

25:16.246 --> 25:17.827
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was playing doubles and I kept failing.

25:17.887 --> 25:19.508
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, why the hell am I failing?

25:20.188 --> 25:26.132
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, I think one of RVGL's on Max 2 on the one player side, I think the left arrow is broken too.

25:26.152 --> 25:27.713
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just can't win anywhere.

25:27.893 --> 25:29.114
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, back to chat room.

25:30.754 --> 25:33.135
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe Mama says, big fuck you to school.

25:33.395 --> 25:34.435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, school's back in session.

25:34.455 --> 25:35.615
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you kids are enjoying it.

25:36.136 --> 25:36.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to school.

25:38.536 --> 25:47.819
[SPEAKER_05]: And SoCalKids says, fuck you to life and its endless amount of questions because I'm not sure if I want to do CG anymore.

25:47.839 --> 25:54.261
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what CG, I don't know if that means that's what he wanted to do when he got out of school or what have you.

25:55.301 --> 25:57.202
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was kind of deep.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.326
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to life, though.

26:00.366 --> 26:02.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave says he's coming over to the show.

26:02.727 --> 26:03.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not a fuck you.

26:04.587 --> 26:05.408
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't send me those messages.

26:05.828 --> 26:14.191
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Lab says fuck you to Neil, the CBGL tech guy, for fucking up the 4th Plus installation by not looking in the box for the flash card he needed.

26:15.472 --> 26:16.712
[SPEAKER_05]: So you gotta look for all the parts.

26:17.432 --> 26:18.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm being corrected.

26:18.933 --> 26:20.834
[SPEAKER_05]: Computer graphics animation, you bastard.

26:22.503 --> 26:23.424
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Jesus.

26:24.524 --> 26:29.326
[SPEAKER_05]: DCB says, give a big fuck you to non-optical mouses.

26:30.527 --> 26:32.388
[SPEAKER_05]: So, he hates mouses with balls.

26:32.788 --> 26:34.369
[SPEAKER_05]: He prefers the female mouses.

26:35.549 --> 26:38.571
[SPEAKER_05]: Little holes with beams of light shooting out of them.

26:40.452 --> 26:44.114
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the fuck yous of the week from the chat room.

26:44.754 --> 26:48.055
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any additional fuck yous, just send them to me real quick over private message.

26:48.115 --> 26:50.757
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in our chat room at Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

26:52.251 --> 26:54.739
[SPEAKER_05]: over on irc.eggheads.org.

26:55.120 --> 26:58.371
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat rooms like them at the lights, beams.

27:00.416 --> 27:02.616
[SPEAKER_05]: Little station updates to take care of.

27:02.656 --> 27:05.917
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some little housekeeping issues I need to tell you guys about.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.658
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, we rebroadcast this show.

27:08.758 --> 27:13.679
[SPEAKER_05]: The show we do tonight gets rebroadcast on Monday night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

27:14.199 --> 27:18.600
[SPEAKER_05]: And then an old show, a classic show, is rebroadcast at 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

27:18.640 --> 27:24.881
[SPEAKER_05]: And this week, it's going to be the show with the interviews from the Dollar Mendy Tournament, that Mountain Mike's tournament that was a few weeks ago.

27:25.221 --> 27:27.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Those interviews are up in the old show rotation.

27:27.282 --> 27:28.362
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be at 9 o'clock on Monday.

27:28.822 --> 27:29.202
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

27:30.094 --> 27:33.735
[SPEAKER_05]: This, starting with this last week, we tested it this last week and it's a go.

27:34.236 --> 27:38.717
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting, we're going to also rebroadcast on Thursdays at 2 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

27:38.997 --> 27:45.280
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's more for the benefit of people on the East Coast or just people overseas that want to try and catch the show at a different time.

27:45.740 --> 27:48.461
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're airing, because, you know, we do 7 o'clock tonight, we do 7 o'clock on Mondays.

27:48.821 --> 27:50.702
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll take it five hours earlier on Thursdays.

27:50.902 --> 27:52.383
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet, I can listen to it at work.

28:20.439 --> 28:37.974
[SPEAKER_05]: either next week or the week after going all the way back to episode one so the old show rotation will be like a couple months behind so it'll really give you a chance to catch up at that point we should do one day where we just play every show back to back we are going to do the marathon I just don't know when yet

28:38.690 --> 28:42.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably in the next couple weeks, like maybe weekend after next, something like that.

28:43.013 --> 28:43.873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to happen.

28:43.913 --> 28:45.394
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got to get the timing of it all worked out.

28:45.414 --> 28:47.355
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will do back-to-back-to-back episodes.

28:47.856 --> 28:51.898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be like MTV rerunning Real World or Sorority Life.

28:51.918 --> 28:54.319
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just catch everything that's happened in one day.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.701
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even have to listen every night.

28:56.981 --> 28:58.042
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'd like it if you do.

28:58.562 --> 29:01.323
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, have you seen the previews for Real World?

29:02.284 --> 29:03.965
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Las Vegas?

29:04.145 --> 29:05.346
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't watch crap.

29:06.796 --> 29:07.459
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

29:07.981 --> 29:10.793
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to watch the real world, but I think the last one I watched was...

29:13.083 --> 29:17.225
[SPEAKER_05]: The one, it was Seattle because you had the guy that bitch slapped the girl as she got in the car.

29:17.465 --> 29:18.646
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the last real world I saw.

29:19.106 --> 29:19.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just put it this way.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.227
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting really desperate.

29:21.447 --> 29:26.829
[SPEAKER_02]: I think every single person on there, their parents either died, got divorced, are druggies, are gay.

29:27.270 --> 29:32.852
[SPEAKER_02]: One or the other, they're all like that and they're all messed up and they're all like horny and having sex with each other.

29:33.032 --> 29:33.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's ratings.

29:34.193 --> 29:34.773
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

29:35.133 --> 29:36.154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not real at all.

29:36.194 --> 29:41.156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, let's get this big bunch of dysfunctional people, throw them together in a little closet and

29:41.716 --> 29:43.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope that everything works out.

29:45.179 --> 29:45.539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's retarded.

30:05.475 --> 30:09.138
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another big FU for the week, and actually for everything.

30:09.378 --> 30:09.618
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

30:10.819 --> 30:13.762
[SPEAKER_02]: This FU is going to reality TV.

30:14.542 --> 30:15.863
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate reality TV.

30:16.104 --> 30:18.606
[SPEAKER_02]: It is such an oxymoron.

30:20.267 --> 30:20.667
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

30:22.757 --> 30:23.518
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it inoxiable?

30:23.538 --> 30:24.358
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not really real.

30:24.598 --> 30:25.479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not real at all.

30:25.539 --> 30:26.439
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like retarded.

30:26.579 --> 30:30.621
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all these shows, like, okay, Survivor, maybe that was an original idea.

30:30.801 --> 30:33.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now everyone's trying to copy Survivor.

30:33.502 --> 30:35.443
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what happens to these people.

30:35.783 --> 30:36.944
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they all die.

30:36.964 --> 30:40.386
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for a jet plane to come overhead and crash down into them.

30:41.326 --> 30:43.207
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to go on one of these shows to win a million dollars?

30:44.528 --> 30:45.208
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go on the show.

30:45.248 --> 30:52.893
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, what do you think if they really, now remember there's a rumor a couple months back, I don't know how, the truth behind it, but that they were going to do a game show out of DDR.

30:52.913 --> 30:59.577
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about a reality show based around, because you could consider a game show a reality show, a reality show based on DDR.

30:59.597 --> 31:00.037
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

31:01.478 --> 31:03.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's about as good as the DDR movie.

31:05.455 --> 31:07.476
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we're at it, let's have a DDR sitcom.

31:07.636 --> 31:09.797
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole comedy set around DDR.

31:09.917 --> 31:10.977
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to introduce Dave.

31:11.017 --> 31:22.422
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave's in the house now, so a big hello to Dave, who, of course, five seconds in to him getting here, he wants to say something, so let's... Well, first I was going to say what happened during the show, because I wasn't here.

31:22.442 --> 31:24.783
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't our fault.

31:24.823 --> 31:27.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was just, you know, like, five second recap.

31:27.484 --> 31:27.864
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

31:29.500 --> 31:30.801
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about stuff.

31:31.401 --> 31:31.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

31:32.061 --> 31:35.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki bitched about DDR Sims.

31:35.682 --> 31:37.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki bitched about QZAR.

31:37.142 --> 31:40.223
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki bitched about reality TV shows.

31:40.743 --> 31:42.223
[SPEAKER_05]: Sky bitched about Loki.

31:42.544 --> 31:43.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Sky bitched about Loki.

31:44.084 --> 31:44.544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.

31:44.664 --> 31:47.925
[SPEAKER_04]: When did people start talking about themselves in the third person?

31:48.005 --> 31:49.005
[SPEAKER_04]: When did that start happening?

31:49.345 --> 31:49.705
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

31:51.106 --> 31:52.066
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's the cool thing to do.

31:53.072 --> 31:58.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, Dave was wondering about this DDR reality show.

31:59.235 --> 31:59.995
[SPEAKER_04]: How would that work?

32:00.035 --> 32:05.677
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, go to Survivor, uh-oh, the challenge, unless you get knocked off, you have to full combo this catastrophic heart.

32:06.018 --> 32:07.238
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that would do.

32:08.178 --> 32:11.360
[SPEAKER_04]: All I heard about you talking earlier was Paranoia, God Mix, or something.

32:12.020 --> 32:14.421
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance for immunity and throw people off the machines.

32:14.821 --> 32:20.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Lock 20 Bomani freaks in the arcade in the middle of the night, and...

32:21.761 --> 32:22.142
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

32:22.503 --> 32:23.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw things at them.

32:23.785 --> 32:26.951
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney rave mad onage stuff.

32:27.612 --> 32:27.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

32:30.397 --> 32:30.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

32:31.139 --> 32:32.221
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any FUs of the week, Dave?

32:34.634 --> 32:40.177
[SPEAKER_04]: F you people who play Soul Calibur against me because you're taking down my character.

32:41.037 --> 32:43.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I played Soul Calibur 2 for the first time.

32:44.038 --> 32:45.299
[SPEAKER_05]: For the first time yesterday.

32:45.679 --> 32:47.620
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know how to play Soul Calibur at all.

32:47.660 --> 32:48.660
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of butt mash.

32:49.161 --> 32:52.982
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started on the conquest and I beat everybody.

32:53.042 --> 32:53.623
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so happy.

32:53.663 --> 32:56.244
[SPEAKER_05]: I joined the green people and I whooped on the red people.

32:56.484 --> 33:02.807
[SPEAKER_05]: And the funny thing is, is that Will Slinky, if you're listening, we all picked his character to fight because we wanted to pick on him because we found him.

33:03.387 --> 33:05.549
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you fight my character because I was also in the red arm?

33:06.149 --> 33:06.950
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

33:07.030 --> 33:09.651
[SPEAKER_05]: It fought a lot of noobs and then Will was last.

33:09.691 --> 33:11.973
[SPEAKER_05]: And both me and Glenn kicked his ass, so we had fun.

33:13.314 --> 33:17.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Conquest mode is the best because you fight people who are basically the same level.

33:17.096 --> 33:21.439
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you join in with a new character, you'll basically fight all the easiest guys in that army.

33:21.940 --> 33:23.861
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you get the good people, you'll start fighting me.

33:25.112 --> 33:25.533
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see.

33:25.573 --> 33:28.815
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have to say, my Ivy, she rules.

33:29.316 --> 33:30.797
[SPEAKER_05]: Ivy is the bomb.

33:31.317 --> 33:33.419
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't this a DDR show and we're here just talking about Soul Calibur?

33:33.479 --> 33:33.699
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.

33:34.100 --> 33:37.423
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of the people that play DDR also in the other games.

33:37.463 --> 33:39.284
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to restrict yourself to just the music games.

33:39.865 --> 33:41.026
[SPEAKER_05]: But, whatever.

33:41.166 --> 33:43.908
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I got to play more Dance Maniacs this weekend.

33:44.469 --> 33:44.909
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

33:44.989 --> 33:45.449
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

33:45.690 --> 33:46.370
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that game.

33:47.031 --> 33:48.692
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it about Dance Maniacs that you enjoy?

33:48.992 --> 33:50.454
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's, I don't know, it's...

33:51.668 --> 33:53.889
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of possibility for freestyle in that.

33:53.909 --> 34:01.593
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not realize because I actually watched Mr. Wendell and this other guy doing freestyle in there and it was quite amazing.

34:01.713 --> 34:02.313
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fun.

34:02.453 --> 34:03.314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

34:04.835 --> 34:06.075
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do people play poppin' music?

34:07.856 --> 34:11.378
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people play poppin' music for the big round buttons.

34:11.458 --> 34:13.299
[SPEAKER_05]: Poppin' music's pretty rad.

34:13.439 --> 34:13.819
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

34:15.171 --> 34:15.732
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

34:15.812 --> 34:18.175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, why are you drawn to play DDR for the first time?

34:18.255 --> 34:19.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, big flashing lights.

34:19.697 --> 34:22.320
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to play poppin' music because, ooh, big buttons I can push.

34:22.360 --> 34:22.961
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.163
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I liked about it.

34:24.223 --> 34:26.265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and about the dance maniacs.

34:26.486 --> 34:27.647
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to hit like four at once.

34:27.687 --> 34:28.769
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to hit them with your forearm.

34:28.829 --> 34:29.269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

34:29.510 --> 34:29.690
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

34:30.259 --> 34:32.681
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyway, back to Dave's topic.

34:32.801 --> 34:33.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry.

34:34.223 --> 34:38.066
[SPEAKER_04]: About the Dance Maniacs, I really do not find that appealing at all.

34:38.507 --> 34:40.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, gee, why not?

34:40.729 --> 34:44.352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the Macarena mixed in with the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, or whatever it's called.

34:44.673 --> 34:46.034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just moving your hands.

34:46.414 --> 34:50.738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's para, except that you're restricted to two buttons at different height levels.

34:51.519 --> 34:52.440
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's no fun.

34:53.141 --> 34:55.463
[SPEAKER_04]: Para is okay, but not that good.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they're different games.

34:59.127 --> 35:02.171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not trying to be ParaPara, it's just trying to be Dance Maniacs.

35:04.034 --> 35:05.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and yeah.

35:05.816 --> 35:07.838
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's okay to play Dance Maniacs with your feet.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.582
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I tried that, and then...

35:11.320 --> 35:15.381
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried using my head, and I hit it on the machine, and it was pointy.

35:15.561 --> 35:16.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was pretty funny.

35:16.541 --> 35:27.983
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a bunch of spots where you had to hit both undersides of the thing, and this guy kept doing this thing where he'd grab the bar on the machine and actually kind of do like a hip thrust into the machine.

35:29.643 --> 35:35.324
[SPEAKER_05]: You just kind of have to just mount one of those little sensors that stick, and now like, right on like a cowboy.

35:35.904 --> 35:36.904
[SPEAKER_02]: But it worked.

35:37.044 --> 35:40.245
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like really funny, but it worked, so, you know.

35:41.195 --> 35:41.495
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

35:41.795 --> 35:45.677
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting some late submitted FUs of the week, so let's have a look at them.

35:46.997 --> 35:49.198
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to just drive this bit into the ground the other night.

35:49.538 --> 35:55.161
[SPEAKER_05]: JB gives a big fuck you to regular DDR for not having the Dance Magic mode that Disney Mix has.

35:55.221 --> 35:57.802
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean, that's a given.

35:58.062 --> 36:00.783
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Magic's been needed in regular DDR for a long time.

36:02.584 --> 36:12.815
[SPEAKER_05]: 23rd Magus says a big fuck you to ZTNet and whoever else sells the Boom PSX to USB converters I got seriously fucking stiffed out of 20 bucks so fuck you to ZTNet

36:14.426 --> 36:15.988
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll cover that more later on.

36:16.669 --> 36:18.451
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, let's talk about that.

36:19.412 --> 36:26.800
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about the USBs, because there's so many options here for going PlayStation to PC, and I don't know shit about it, so you've got to help me here, Loki.

36:26.940 --> 36:34.308
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, all these stupid converters that they have out there, they're meant for one thing, is making the actual PlayStation controllers work with the PC.

36:35.149 --> 36:40.634
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, is that, you know, most people buy these to use with like DDR SIMs and that kind of stuff.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.015
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not meant for that.

36:42.215 --> 36:47.360
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the way DDR pads are set up, it's really funky because they have them mapped as buttons.

36:47.500 --> 36:55.547
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the problem is, is all these converters, they map the actual directional pad, not as buttons, but as axes.

36:55.728 --> 36:58.050
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the problem is, is you can't...

36:58.763 --> 37:03.945
[SPEAKER_02]: Push, like, up and down at the same time, like, where there might be a jump, or you can't push left and right.

37:04.085 --> 37:07.046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you can only push, you know, one direction at one time.

37:07.966 --> 37:08.726
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the problem.

37:08.746 --> 37:21.491
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people buy these pads, and especially, you know, big FU2 fries for putting the Kiki Joys next to the DDR PC, because people think, oh, it's going to work with, you know, the DDR PC.

37:22.051 --> 37:23.131
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, not at all.

37:23.811 --> 37:28.173
[SPEAKER_05]: And DCB wants to send a big fuck you to the Kiki Joys, by the way, because the software doesn't work on his computer.

37:28.945 --> 37:29.825
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's another thing.

37:30.305 --> 37:35.447
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two USB converters also I bought a long time ago to try using with my sim.

37:35.927 --> 37:37.587
[SPEAKER_02]: Ended up having to buy a parallel one.

37:37.768 --> 37:39.928
[SPEAKER_02]: And trust me, that was the best move I ever made.

37:40.268 --> 37:44.729
[SPEAKER_02]: The parallel ones work great, and they work with the standard DirectPad Pro.

37:46.830 --> 37:47.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not buy USB ones.

38:13.220 --> 38:16.682
[SPEAKER_02]: All these controllers or converters do not work with the DDR pads.

38:17.282 --> 38:24.827
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be one out there, but you're going to go through about 50 of them before you find one that actually works.

38:25.587 --> 38:28.589
[SPEAKER_02]: So just buy the parallel ones, save yourself some time.

38:28.649 --> 38:35.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're using them for, say, Beatmania 2DX sim or something like that, they'll work fine for that, but just not DDR.

38:37.458 --> 38:37.738
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

38:38.298 --> 38:43.401
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things going over Dave's head, because he was sitting there going, this whole chat's going over my head because I don't play DDR on PC.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.142
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat room wants to know, how tall are you, Dave?

38:46.382 --> 38:47.743
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're seeing you on the webcam right now.

38:48.844 --> 38:50.544
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't even know we had a webcam up right now.

38:50.584 --> 38:51.965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we got a webcam.

38:52.325 --> 38:52.905
[SPEAKER_05]: How tall are you?

38:54.066 --> 38:54.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Freakishly tall.

38:55.047 --> 38:56.447
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, not that tall.

38:56.727 --> 38:57.208
[SPEAKER_04]: 6'1".

38:58.188 --> 38:58.608
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taller.

38:58.628 --> 38:59.008
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm 6'2".

39:00.689 --> 39:02.030
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm sitting down, so they can't tell.

39:03.158 --> 39:05.638
[SPEAKER_05]: So, last fuck yous of the week, okay?

39:05.678 --> 39:08.339
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten a couple more, so these are the last fuck yous of the week.

39:08.379 --> 39:11.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Lab says, fuck you to sims that don't work on Macs.

39:11.980 --> 39:15.980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a very valid fuck you of the week, because Macs are being neglected, of course.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.181
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to buy a real computer.

39:17.201 --> 39:18.421
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

39:18.441 --> 39:19.381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just going to say.

39:19.461 --> 39:20.181
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

39:20.201 --> 39:21.461
[SPEAKER_05]: When you make a computer... Macs are cool.

39:21.481 --> 39:22.742
[SPEAKER_05]: Macs are great for art stuff.

39:22.782 --> 39:23.222
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Macs.

39:23.242 --> 39:29.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they look like artsy computers that you'd find in an art gallery, because, let's see, one looked like a toaster...

39:30.303 --> 39:32.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Worked like a toaster, pretty much was a toaster.

39:32.604 --> 39:36.925
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have one that looks like a stupid little sphere with this thing sticking out of it.

39:37.045 --> 39:40.867
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to hand it to Max for coming up with these really freaky dimes.

39:40.927 --> 39:42.247
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the clear speakers.

39:42.287 --> 39:43.467
[SPEAKER_02]: That you can't upgrade.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.148
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing that sucks about Max.

39:47.209 --> 39:48.149
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what was it?

39:48.209 --> 39:52.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Gateway made this really retarded looking computer that's trying to copy the iPod.

39:53.611 --> 39:53.851
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

39:54.628 --> 39:57.631
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated Gateway to begin with, and this isn't really helping them.

39:58.111 --> 39:59.052
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks like crap.

39:59.172 --> 40:01.875
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're about to start a war in the chatroom, Macs versus PCs.

40:01.935 --> 40:03.196
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me get to the other FU of the week.

40:03.216 --> 40:04.117
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Dave, what do you want to say?

40:04.697 --> 40:08.861
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say that George Foreman Grill looks exactly like the iMac.

40:09.422 --> 40:12.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you put them next to each other, I thought that it was an iMac commercial.

40:12.905 --> 40:15.427
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, hamburger, hot dog.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.250
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you try to cook a hot dog on an iPod?

40:19.352 --> 40:24.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it did look pretty appetizing, you know, to just, like, put a hot dog in between the keys of the iMac.

40:25.034 --> 40:29.715
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, you know, they look exactly like, and they both have the same transparent colors.

40:29.975 --> 40:32.876
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do have... Get your hot dogs off the keyboard!

40:32.996 --> 40:37.437
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have, you know, seriously, though, for the G4, they really have this kick-ass monitor for it.

40:37.477 --> 40:44.039
[SPEAKER_02]: They have this, like, high-definition 24-inch monitor out there for the Macs, and those kick-ass.

40:44.099 --> 40:44.919
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that...

40:45.922 --> 40:47.666
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

40:47.766 --> 40:54.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you from Takeout Kid to UCB for not getting DDR Max 2 and making the current fifth mix a dollar.

40:55.888 --> 40:56.529
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

40:56.569 --> 41:02.413
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at one point, the Metreon was charging $2 a game for 5th Mix, I believe, so it could be worse.

41:02.674 --> 41:05.796
[SPEAKER_02]: $2 a game for 5th Mix, so that means $4 for doubles.

41:06.697 --> 41:07.257
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

41:07.497 --> 41:09.019
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on how many songs you're getting, I guess.

41:09.219 --> 41:20.608
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when the Metreon charged like $1.50 or $2 for like 1st Mix or $1.50 or something ridiculous, and then you go right into the other room and they have the same thing for like a quarter or 50 cents less each year.

41:22.173 --> 41:25.155
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, no more fuck you's of the week.

41:25.175 --> 41:26.515
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to save them until next week now.

41:27.356 --> 41:29.837
[SPEAKER_05]: JB has got a question for you, Loki.

41:29.917 --> 41:35.420
[SPEAKER_05]: He wants to know if you know anything about DSE, the DDR Sequence Editor, and what it is.

41:35.700 --> 41:41.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the DDR Sequence Editor is an old editing, or it's an edit-making program that's pretty old.

41:41.943 --> 41:44.885
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like compatible with, you know, fifth mix down.

41:46.465 --> 41:48.566
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do freeze arrows or anything like that.

41:48.726 --> 41:49.326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.

41:49.386 --> 41:51.547
[SPEAKER_02]: It works on older PCs and stuff.

41:52.167 --> 42:00.930
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're actually going to use an actual editor for making edits on your PC for DDR, I would recommend the...

42:02.589 --> 42:24.545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called DDR Edit Max 300 And it's actually pretty cool It supports freezeros and everything like that The only problem is it doesn't really Some of the edits that are made with it aren't really compatible You have to go in and hex edit something So you kind of have to know what you're doing Okay But it's No, I've never used it yet Because it's the only thing that will run on my Quit breaking things What are you doing?

42:24.566 --> 42:25.526
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell are you doing?

42:26.607 --> 42:31.811
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave's playing with a webcam Just ignore Dave Stop making animals in compromising positions here

42:32.688 --> 42:43.117
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, it's good for if you have an older computer, like my crappy ass laptop that I use for editing DDR songs at the arcade I go to, how sad is that?

42:43.758 --> 42:50.164
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, it's the only thing that'll work, so give it a try, but they're all Japanese, so it's hard to say.

42:51.359 --> 42:52.400
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.761
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you know about this new simulator?

42:54.781 --> 42:56.702
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's coming out called Feet of Fury.

42:56.722 --> 42:57.842
[SPEAKER_05]: You know anything about this at all?

42:57.942 --> 42:59.143
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first I've heard of it.

42:59.323 --> 42:59.703
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

42:59.783 --> 43:00.003
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

43:00.264 --> 43:01.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's go to a break.

43:01.084 --> 43:03.085
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you read up on this page, see what you think of it.

43:03.765 --> 43:06.507
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to a break here real fast, and we'll come back.

43:06.567 --> 43:13.230
[SPEAKER_05]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and thanks for tuning in, and we will be right back.

45:01.697 --> 45:02.978
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear the cheering?

45:03.018 --> 45:03.818
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Performance!

45:46.239 --> 45:46.619
Perfect!

46:15.928 --> 46:18.370
[SPEAKER_00]: Your dance showed us a dream for the future.

46:18.850 --> 46:20.172
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow is another day.

46:20.672 --> 46:22.874
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one who'll give us hope for the future.

48:20.803 --> 48:25.807
[SPEAKER_08]: After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.

48:26.607 --> 48:30.410
[SPEAKER_08]: Undersedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.

48:30.890 --> 48:37.875
[SPEAKER_08]: Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UndersedationLive.org.

48:39.856 --> 48:43.859
[SPEAKER_07]: Babe, I got you babe.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.101
[SPEAKER_07]: I got you babe.

48:53.563 --> 48:54.085
Thanks for watching!

50:41.403 --> 50:50.227
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's time for Erotic Op Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

50:50.717 --> 50:51.617
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it all night.

50:51.857 --> 50:52.718
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it with me.

50:53.178 --> 50:54.598
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, that was awful.

50:54.678 --> 50:55.558
[SPEAKER_12]: Bloody terrible.

50:55.598 --> 50:56.939
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you take vocal lessons?

50:57.019 --> 50:57.999
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill your teacher.

50:58.499 --> 50:59.499
[SPEAKER_05]: In the heat of the night.

50:59.980 --> 51:02.200
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

51:03.380 --> 51:04.061
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it.

51:04.581 --> 51:06.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

51:06.221 --> 51:06.681
[SPEAKER_05]: Next.

51:09.882 --> 51:11.003
[SPEAKER_13]: That was cool.

51:12.423 --> 51:14.203
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you even know why you're here?

51:14.283 --> 51:15.944
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just bloody pathetic.

51:16.024 --> 51:16.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Next.

51:21.843 --> 51:22.064
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes!

51:22.464 --> 51:23.106
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that's it!

51:23.466 --> 51:24.649
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a winner!

51:25.430 --> 51:29.338
[SPEAKER_10]: A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:30.931 --> 51:34.612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:36.492 --> 51:39.033
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave told me I couldn't come back saying that because I always say it.

51:39.893 --> 51:42.654
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured, though, that's really the last time I'm going to be able to use that.

51:42.674 --> 51:45.854
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to take that out of rotation now because American Idol's over.

51:45.914 --> 51:46.454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done with.

51:46.915 --> 51:48.275
[SPEAKER_05]: So the parody, it doesn't work.

51:48.735 --> 51:50.755
[SPEAKER_05]: People are going to forget about American Idol next week.

51:51.135 --> 51:53.056
[SPEAKER_05]: That chick who won, people ain't going to care.

51:53.116 --> 51:53.716
[SPEAKER_05]: Come next week.

51:54.476 --> 51:55.196
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care now.

51:56.437 --> 51:57.217
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you didn't care then.

51:57.697 --> 51:57.857
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

51:58.607 --> 52:00.228
[SPEAKER_05]: Farewell to that little promo.

52:00.288 --> 52:03.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Being suggested, I do something for the new Survivor that's debuting.

52:03.711 --> 52:06.392
[SPEAKER_05]: Do some kind of Orange Lounge Survivor.

52:06.412 --> 52:07.493
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea how that works.

52:07.733 --> 52:14.758
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can advertise a big twist, like, ooh, coming up, a big new intro, and then not do it like I did this week.

52:14.918 --> 52:22.343
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to mention, since I was noticing in the chat room, someone was listening to a remix of Let Them Move, which kind of jogged my memory.

52:22.503 --> 52:25.906
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember reading something back on the DDR Maniacs boards,

52:26.526 --> 52:28.268
[SPEAKER_02]: Not possible, I say.

52:28.288 --> 52:28.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

52:45.083 --> 52:52.346
[SPEAKER_02]: So I challenge people out there to find the damn MP3 for that so we can listen to it and see if it's actually good or if it just sucks or if it doesn't exist.

52:52.627 --> 52:57.349
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that you could make a good one if you made an instrumental remix of it.

52:57.789 --> 53:04.032
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, took out the... And then you took out the music and then you put in new music.

53:04.312 --> 53:05.193
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need to do?

53:05.413 --> 53:13.519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because a lot of times they'll take the old, I don't know, they'll take the Japanese songs, you know, sung by B4U, and they'll convert them into English.

53:13.559 --> 53:16.402
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's just have them sing that in, you know, Japanese.

53:16.662 --> 53:19.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Crash, which is Breakdown.

53:19.764 --> 53:20.185
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

53:20.405 --> 53:20.905
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically.

53:21.286 --> 53:25.789
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's still... Which was being requested in the chat room during the break, and no.

53:27.230 --> 53:28.511
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like Crash personally.

53:28.852 --> 53:30.233
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to take it out on everybody.

53:31.093 --> 53:31.614
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate that song.

53:32.134 --> 53:32.534
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

53:32.594 --> 53:33.075
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

53:33.515 --> 53:38.417
[SPEAKER_05]: If I get, like, money or other kinds of favors and begs and pleading, maybe we'll play it.

53:40.138 --> 53:40.598
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not.

53:41.138 --> 53:41.859
[SPEAKER_05]: I just gotta fuck you.

53:42.839 --> 53:43.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

53:45.540 --> 53:46.561
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do we want to talk about?

53:48.182 --> 53:53.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, that sim that we saw... Yeah, the one we were looking at during the break, and I accidentally took it off the screen.

53:54.005 --> 53:54.445
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go back.

53:54.885 --> 54:00.808
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like somebody is developing something for Dreamcast, and it's gonna be a DDR simulator.

54:00.828 --> 54:01.068
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there...

54:01.738 --> 54:06.762
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like they're being kind of careful not to call it like DDR, but they're saying it's in the same vein as DDR.

54:06.802 --> 54:08.323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Feet of Fury.

54:11.365 --> 54:13.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Feet of Fury, special!

54:14.727 --> 54:20.291
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like, I don't know, it's sort of like, um, it looks like it's just all dance magic mode.

54:20.311 --> 54:21.332
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what it is.

54:23.303 --> 54:23.704
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

54:23.724 --> 54:24.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

54:24.164 --> 54:33.034
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying... I'm looking at their website, and if you're in our chat room right now, our website address was posted, and maybe Twin will post it again for you if you want to see this page.

54:33.055 --> 54:38.761
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like DDR is going to be on the Dreamcast, basically, but it's more of a competitive thing.

54:38.781 --> 54:39.362
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying...

54:40.454 --> 54:44.716
[SPEAKER_05]: You want something a little more interesting or challenging and it doesn't require yet still more speed.

54:45.196 --> 54:51.719
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've spent over a year building tools and developing what will give you a step in the right direction for beat games.

54:52.600 --> 54:56.241
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to have a little bit of 3D.

54:56.742 --> 54:58.142
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use a standard controller.

54:58.162 --> 54:59.583
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use a DDR dance mat.

55:00.443 --> 55:01.764
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got 12 songs in it.

55:02.264 --> 55:04.605
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks like a demo of what's going on.

55:06.386 --> 55:07.046
[SPEAKER_05]: Some musicians.

55:07.086 --> 55:07.567
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to see...

55:08.807 --> 55:11.648
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of... They're saying it's going to be a little more competitive.

55:11.688 --> 55:15.190
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find any more information about that.

55:15.210 --> 55:16.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they're expecting a beta release of it.

55:16.670 --> 55:18.651
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be this October, October 1st.

55:18.711 --> 55:22.232
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the expected final release is going to be January 1st of next year.

55:23.073 --> 55:24.553
[SPEAKER_02]: So, looking forward to that.

55:24.813 --> 55:25.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

55:25.153 --> 55:25.974
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that'll be interesting.

55:26.014 --> 55:27.634
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll review that as soon as it's released.

55:28.375 --> 55:34.117
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anybody from that group is listening and wants to give us a sneak advance copy, hey, I don't say no to that stuff either.

55:35.397 --> 55:35.617
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

55:37.018 --> 55:37.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

55:37.318 --> 55:37.398
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

55:38.980 --> 55:48.132
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, big story, it's been two weeks since we've been here in the studio, quote unquote, because last week, as you know, we taped in advance at Roseville Golf Land.

55:48.352 --> 55:50.095
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of mixed reaction to that show.

55:50.175 --> 55:53.299
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people really liked it, some people thought it was ass, but what can you do, you know?

55:54.524 --> 56:10.455
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there, I was listening, and I thought it was, the one part was cool, where you were like, yeah, we're from that school, and doing an interview, yeah, and then the rest of it was kind of boring, except for like, Brad going, and you know, that stuff, but it was okay, it wasn't that good.

56:11.135 --> 56:13.677
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for that honest opinion, Siskel, I appreciate it.

56:15.398 --> 56:17.580
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Ebert, Siskel, maybe you're too young for that, I don't know.

56:18.300 --> 56:19.261
[SPEAKER_05]: He died a while ago.

56:21.062 --> 56:22.643
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the fat one didn't die, the fat one's still alive.

56:22.663 --> 56:23.904
[SPEAKER_05]: The fat one ate him, dammit.

56:27.200 --> 56:31.084
[SPEAKER_05]: We were actually secretly hoping we would get kicked out of Golf Land because it would have been great radio.

56:31.224 --> 56:32.766
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, oh shit, what do we do now?

56:32.786 --> 56:37.170
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll hitchhike our way over to... Well, we wouldn't have to hitchhike to Brookfields.

56:37.190 --> 56:41.754
[SPEAKER_05]: We could walk over there, hitchhike our way over to a nearby... Now broadcasting at the volcano on Hole 3...

56:47.828 --> 56:48.689
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit, alright.

56:49.210 --> 56:52.032
[SPEAKER_05]: But while we were gone, this big news story came out.

56:52.693 --> 56:57.938
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure everybody's heard of it by now, but we want to talk about it anyway, because we like to be repetitive on this show.

56:59.479 --> 57:05.184
[SPEAKER_05]: Greece, the Isle of Greece, banned electronic games, period.

57:05.645 --> 57:11.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning no DDR, no Game Boys, no Nintendos, no arcade games whatsoever.

57:12.222 --> 57:14.844
[SPEAKER_05]: No solitaire on your computer with Windows.

57:15.184 --> 57:15.525
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

57:16.065 --> 57:18.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they want to prevent gambling.

57:20.128 --> 57:20.869
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of this?

57:21.529 --> 57:22.390
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's retarded.

57:23.210 --> 57:25.652
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you two bucks that it won't last ten days.

57:26.673 --> 57:28.014
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's been ten days, hasn't it?

57:28.434 --> 57:28.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

57:30.236 --> 57:31.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I just gambled, so...

57:32.830 --> 57:35.492
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever you are, you are losing!

57:36.052 --> 57:38.554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gambling over whether or not it works or not.

57:39.094 --> 57:44.338
[SPEAKER_04]: And that revokes the point of... Oh shit, I did it again.

57:44.698 --> 57:53.464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being corrected, it wasn't just the gambling, it was the violence in games too, because you know, solitaire and Minesweeper can be a bloody fucking battle when you lose.

57:54.045 --> 57:57.167
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Minesweeper, I mean the bombs, they want to keep that away from the kids.

57:57.387 --> 57:59.709
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, you have to place the flag...

58:00.285 --> 58:02.586
[SPEAKER_04]: You get it wrong, uh-oh, you lose.

58:03.166 --> 58:04.846
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, they're just bitter over the Olympics.

58:06.907 --> 58:08.207
[SPEAKER_02]: How so, for those that don't know?

58:08.867 --> 58:10.087
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, they're just bitter.

58:10.407 --> 58:15.849
[SPEAKER_02]: That they didn't get to host the... Freaking crazy Greeks and their damn mythology and their gods and stuff.

58:16.049 --> 58:18.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's their gods of irony and gods of stupidity?

58:18.769 --> 58:20.650
[SPEAKER_02]: They must be working full swing now.

58:21.670 --> 58:25.471
[SPEAKER_05]: You can address those cards and letters to Loki, care of Orange Flown's radio.

58:27.752 --> 58:28.894
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Rob.

58:28.934 --> 58:31.837
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably heard all of our listeners listening from Greece.

58:32.938 --> 58:34.920
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I believe we do have listeners from Greece.

58:34.940 --> 58:36.742
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to check the statistics really fast.

58:36.762 --> 58:37.583
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go check the stats.

58:38.183 --> 58:41.387
[SPEAKER_05]: Some interesting things, though, about the stats, which surprised me.

58:41.867 --> 58:45.131
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada is no longer the number two country listening to this program.

58:45.151 --> 58:45.631
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what it is?

58:46.452 --> 58:46.913
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan.

58:47.233 --> 58:47.894
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's third?

58:49.102 --> 58:49.502
[SPEAKER_05]: Korea.

58:50.243 --> 58:51.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Greece?

58:51.604 --> 58:52.104
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Greece.

58:52.324 --> 58:52.765
[SPEAKER_05]: No, then.

58:53.005 --> 58:55.847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we invite the Greek to live vicariously through us.

58:55.927 --> 58:59.829
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've had your video games robbed from you, hey, we'll tell you about what you're missing out on.

59:00.069 --> 59:04.052
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, I'm just... No, I have them like... Alright, thank you.

59:04.512 --> 59:05.193
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

59:05.700 --> 59:06.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

59:06.241 --> 59:07.782
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, how many people are listening?

59:07.802 --> 59:08.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean... Enough.

59:09.424 --> 59:15.109
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, we got the number... It's like coming in second place with two listeners is Japan.

59:15.430 --> 59:17.512
[SPEAKER_04]: And then tied for third is Canada, Korea, and the U.S.

59:17.532 --> 59:18.553
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it's more than that.

59:18.633 --> 59:19.213
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more than that.

59:20.154 --> 59:24.598
[SPEAKER_15]: We will be the new underground movement for our computer games and our cha-cha games.

59:25.419 --> 59:25.980
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God.

59:27.580 --> 59:28.601
[SPEAKER_04]: We will overcome.

59:29.302 --> 59:31.464
[SPEAKER_04]: We shall overcome.

59:31.484 --> 59:34.767
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is what happens when you play too much 2DX like Bradley.

59:34.807 --> 59:35.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Grease.

59:35.688 --> 59:38.691
[SPEAKER_04]: You stopped it at the root.

59:38.892 --> 59:39.913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking for Grease.

59:40.853 --> 59:43.076
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nobody has listened to this show from Grease, unfortunately.

59:44.201 --> 59:45.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's that there?

59:45.242 --> 59:46.663
[SPEAKER_02]: I see one stream from Greece.

59:46.723 --> 59:47.264
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there they are.

59:47.304 --> 59:48.365
[SPEAKER_05]: The very, very bottom.

59:48.425 --> 59:48.765
[SPEAKER_05]: Greece.

59:49.425 --> 59:50.246
[SPEAKER_05]: The very bottom.

59:50.506 --> 59:54.690
[SPEAKER_05]: One stream connected from Greece, not even for a full minute.

59:55.771 --> 59:58.093
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's somebody who connected and listened to that.

59:58.533 --> 01:00:00.615
[SPEAKER_05]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:00.655 --> 01:00:01.896
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just like disconnected right there.

01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:03.717
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:03.757 --> 01:00:06.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha, Greece doesn't have electronic games.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:06.660
And then they...

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:14.165
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think they got that far, and then like the little underground Gestapo Grecian people came and was like, what are you doing?

01:00:14.205 --> 01:00:18.368
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be listening to something from out of, you know, the country, and then they break it.

01:00:18.808 --> 01:00:20.629
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if this show would be illegal in Greece.

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:27.574
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, you know, especially, we're like, you know, freaking propaganda over there, you know.

01:00:28.354 --> 01:00:35.719
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a weird thing, it applies to tourists too, so if you're going to go to Greece, don't take your Game Boy, because they'll throw your ass in jail, they don't care if you're a stupid American or what.

01:00:36.827 --> 01:00:42.111
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they just take the Game Boy and then they've got like the secret vault of all these Game Boys and stuff.

01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:44.452
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like the landfills with Atari 2600 games?

01:00:44.492 --> 01:00:45.873
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all the old copies of E.T.

01:00:45.913 --> 01:00:47.554
[SPEAKER_05]: that no one bought just in a landfill somewhere?

01:00:47.795 --> 01:00:49.456
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think it would be like a landfill.

01:00:49.476 --> 01:00:53.718
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep it in like, you know, I don't know if it's a president or the king of Greece or, you know, emperor or ruler.

01:00:53.758 --> 01:00:54.539
[SPEAKER_04]: The king of Greece.

01:00:54.679 --> 01:00:55.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.360
[SPEAKER_04]: The god of Greece.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.561
[SPEAKER_04]: The Grecian star.

01:00:57.781 --> 01:00:58.682
[SPEAKER_04]: Orpher to him is Zeus.

01:00:58.702 --> 01:01:01.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I think that Zeus... John Travolta.

01:01:02.184 --> 01:01:03.085
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

01:01:03.105 --> 01:01:03.365
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:01:04.646 --> 01:01:05.947
[SPEAKER_04]: The Greece title.

01:01:07.048 --> 01:01:18.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so anyway, John Travolta slash Zeus is secretly made up this whole rule, got his secret Grecian Gestapo, just going around taking all the games just so he can play them.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.123
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he makes a secret black market of...

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Messing with Bradley's 2DX controller.

01:01:26.063 --> 01:01:28.645
[SPEAKER_05]: He's taking out his aggressions on the Greek on Bradley's controller.

01:01:29.446 --> 01:01:30.407
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley doesn't like that.

01:01:31.027 --> 01:01:39.175
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, he's normally the quiet type, but then sometimes he does his little evil takeover the world type C-Lab 2021 type thing.

01:01:40.736 --> 01:01:44.760
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, back to my story on the Grecian underworld takeover.

01:01:45.817 --> 01:01:55.905
[SPEAKER_04]: And so after they steal all of the games from everyone else, they'll make a secret black market and John Travolta will be able to play all the games.

01:01:56.465 --> 01:01:57.986
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think he gets so good at dancing?

01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:02.289
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he can do all those little special hip thrust move things.

01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:04.151
[SPEAKER_04]: You are on crack.

01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:08.874
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm being told if we were to gamble on this show, then it would be illegal in Greece.

01:02:09.315 --> 01:02:09.595
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

01:02:10.587 --> 01:02:12.108
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you a dollar, Loki.

01:02:12.208 --> 01:02:16.149
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you one dollar that we're not going to get any higher than that.

01:02:16.409 --> 01:02:17.450
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now illegal.

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:20.731
[SPEAKER_05]: That Greece will forever be the last place country on our list.

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:21.231
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say?

01:02:22.631 --> 01:02:23.372
[SPEAKER_05]: Take me up on that bet?

01:02:23.392 --> 01:02:24.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Will anyone take me up on that bet?

01:02:25.252 --> 01:02:25.472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:02:25.852 --> 01:02:26.053
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:02:26.293 --> 01:02:27.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will take you up on that bet.

01:02:27.593 --> 01:02:31.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, therefore, now we are gambling on this show, and this show is now illegal in Greece.

01:02:31.334 --> 01:02:33.955
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're listening, the cops are coming for you.

01:02:34.035 --> 01:02:34.696
[SPEAKER_05]: Lock the doors.

01:02:34.776 --> 01:02:35.496
[SPEAKER_05]: Lock the windows.

01:02:36.641 --> 01:02:37.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have doors and windows in Greece?

01:02:38.782 --> 01:02:39.703
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding, of course they do.

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:41.404
[SPEAKER_04]: They sure don't have video games, that sucks.

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.186
[SPEAKER_05]: Primitive cavemen without their video games, ha ha ha.

01:02:45.566 --> 01:02:47.908
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, them in the crappy Olympics.

01:02:50.049 --> 01:02:50.469
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:52.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was that supposed to sound like?

01:02:52.851 --> 01:02:53.291
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:02:53.992 --> 01:02:56.313
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, yeah, rich, snobby British people.

01:02:56.433 --> 01:02:56.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:58.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, what's Britain?

01:02:58.894 --> 01:03:00.395
[SPEAKER_05]: Britain's right about that.

01:03:00.415 --> 01:03:02.257
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not listing out much either, so.

01:03:02.317 --> 01:03:03.237
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, shit, that's like an hour.

01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:04.538
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make fun of the British, I won't.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see, okay.

01:03:06.281 --> 01:03:07.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my FUs for the week here.

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:16.368
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got FU to Greece, FU to Denmark, FU to Belgium, Taiwan, Yugoslavia, Germany, Pakistan, Netherlands.

01:03:17.008 --> 01:03:24.313
[SPEAKER_05]: Taiwan gets an excuse, because if you ever looked at a lot of the games you buy, they were made in Taiwan, so they don't have time to listen to the show, because they're all in slave labor making these games.

01:03:24.813 --> 01:03:28.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and special FU to Yugoslavia for beating the USA team.

01:03:28.216 --> 01:03:31.478
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that Taiwanese are in slave labor copying the games from Japan.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:33.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, look!

01:03:34.281 --> 01:03:35.061
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it.

01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:36.842
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweden is actually up there.

01:03:38.783 --> 01:03:39.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistan!

01:03:40.103 --> 01:03:40.804
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that cool?

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:51.709
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet people that they can't guess what the number 7 ranked is.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:55.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because you're looking at the thing.

01:03:55.211 --> 01:03:56.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you know, Rob.

01:03:56.491 --> 01:03:58.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, since you can't see it, it's Venezuela.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:04.587
[SPEAKER_04]: People in Venezuela listening to us talking about DDR.

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:07.609
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR is a hit worldwide.

01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:08.249
[SPEAKER_05]: What can you say?

01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:08.989
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big thing.

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.571
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexico, right above Venezuela.

01:04:12.211 --> 01:04:13.112
[SPEAKER_05]: The French.

01:04:13.572 --> 01:04:15.393
[SPEAKER_02]: The French are listening.

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.794
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we make fun of the French a few shows back?

01:04:17.834 --> 01:04:19.695
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember somebody went off on the French.

01:04:19.775 --> 01:04:21.056
[SPEAKER_05]: It was probably a Brad thing.

01:04:21.276 --> 01:04:28.300
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I remember on our boards, I blamed the French for the whole getting rid of the games in Greece.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.482
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no correlation, but I blame the French.

01:04:32.362 --> 01:04:33.263
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was it.

01:04:33.823 --> 01:04:38.306
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that there was any public slander of the French on this radio.

01:04:38.346 --> 01:04:39.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe we need some.

01:04:39.827 --> 01:04:40.248
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

01:04:40.568 --> 01:04:44.491
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the French, personally, I really like French people.

01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:50.835
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they make good food, and they've got one of those chefs that are on the Iron Chef, along with...

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Other countries that I don't see.

01:04:53.821 --> 01:05:00.283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have every country that has an Iron Shaft guy is listening to this show.

01:05:00.544 --> 01:05:02.364
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet the stats are going off.

01:05:03.125 --> 01:05:07.646
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'd like to give a shout out to Salman Bin Laden for listening to us from Pakistan.

01:05:07.847 --> 01:05:09.467
[SPEAKER_02]: So, way to go.

01:05:09.767 --> 01:05:10.228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah!

01:05:10.248 --> 01:05:12.709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:18.691
[SPEAKER_05]: Address those cards and letters once again to Loki because of views and opinions expressed on this show, blah, blah, blah.

01:05:19.071 --> 01:05:20.732
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's look at cities in the U.S.,

01:05:22.032 --> 01:05:27.475
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously Sacramento ranked number one, no surprise because we're all in Sacramento, we all listen to this station.

01:05:27.896 --> 01:05:32.058
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I knew AOL was big, but I never knew that they were their own city.

01:05:32.378 --> 01:05:36.581
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the weird thing is that AOL all goes through one thing, so they show up as one city on here.

01:05:36.621 --> 01:05:38.202
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody that's on AOL has their own city.

01:05:39.365 --> 01:05:41.807
[SPEAKER_05]: San Francisco, followed by Columbus, Ohio.

01:05:41.907 --> 01:05:43.088
[SPEAKER_05]: We got fans in Columbus.

01:05:43.568 --> 01:05:43.908
[SPEAKER_02]: Word.

01:05:43.988 --> 01:05:48.972
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I did a big shout-out to us, you know, on the East Coast Invasion boards.

01:05:49.772 --> 01:05:50.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see who's in last place.

01:05:51.313 --> 01:05:54.796
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see who's in last place and who we need to rough up some people.

01:05:55.096 --> 01:05:57.998
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to guess what city's in last place?

01:05:58.018 --> 01:05:59.399
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just the U.S.

01:05:59.679 --> 01:06:00.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the U.S.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, remember, this doesn't just count the live show.

01:06:02.901 --> 01:06:04.742
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also the Bomani Music and More program.

01:06:04.782 --> 01:06:06.303
[SPEAKER_04]: Bismarck, North Dakota.

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:07.244
[SPEAKER_05]: North Dakota.

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:08.505
[SPEAKER_05]: You're saying Bismarck, North Dakota.

01:06:08.525 --> 01:06:08.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Bismarck.

01:06:09.325 --> 01:06:09.726
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:10.447
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Bismarck.

01:06:10.707 --> 01:06:11.428
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Bismarck.

01:06:11.448 --> 01:06:12.589
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Des Moines.

01:06:12.729 --> 01:06:12.990
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:13.891
[SPEAKER_05]: It was close!

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:15.392
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it!

01:06:15.432 --> 01:06:18.236
[SPEAKER_05]: Des Moines is in last place, followed by Bakersfield.

01:06:19.534 --> 01:06:20.394
[SPEAKER_05]: They have computers there.

01:06:20.414 --> 01:06:24.615
[SPEAKER_05]: Bakersfield's like, kind of by, like, it's a little poo town, right?

01:06:24.875 --> 01:06:25.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like, cool?

01:06:26.396 --> 01:06:27.476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sorta.

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:29.776
[SPEAKER_05]: It's between here and L.A., really.

01:06:29.956 --> 01:06:31.937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right before you go over the grapevine, if I'm not mistaken.

01:06:32.517 --> 01:06:35.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what's the, hold on, scroll back up here for a second.

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.698
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, don't scroll.

01:06:37.018 --> 01:06:38.978
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that causes dropouts, but yeah.

01:06:39.278 --> 01:06:40.179
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry.

01:06:40.399 --> 01:06:40.759
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

01:06:40.799 --> 01:06:41.799
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm causing dropouts.

01:06:42.159 --> 01:06:42.539
[SPEAKER_04]: Lookout.

01:06:42.639 --> 01:06:47.323
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Denver counts for one city for like six different states.

01:06:47.463 --> 01:06:48.624
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

01:06:48.664 --> 01:06:51.967
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got like Denver, Colorado, MT, I don't know what that is.

01:06:51.987 --> 01:06:52.427
[SPEAKER_04]: Montana.

01:06:52.447 --> 01:06:54.189
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevada.

01:06:54.369 --> 01:06:55.169
[SPEAKER_05]: Nebraska, Nevada.

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:59.473
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's because theoretically anybody right on the borders could be connecting through a hub in Denver.

01:06:59.733 --> 01:07:00.273
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would count.

01:07:00.514 --> 01:07:01.514
[SPEAKER_05]: This is getting really boring.

01:07:01.534 --> 01:07:03.096
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to go back to talking about Bumani.

01:07:03.636 --> 01:07:05.758
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's check Sky's private messages in the chat room.

01:07:06.662 --> 01:07:07.623
[SPEAKER_05]: This show sucks.

01:07:08.484 --> 01:07:09.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, gee, thank you.

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.508
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to have the webcam at a better angle.

01:07:13.568 --> 01:07:15.169
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wouldn't mind adjusting that, that would be nice.

01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:17.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what else I have.

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:18.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, do not touch the webcam.

01:07:18.532 --> 01:07:19.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, you're not allowed to touch the webcam.

01:07:19.592 --> 01:07:21.594
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, you are the weakest webcam.

01:07:21.614 --> 01:07:21.894
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodbye.

01:07:25.537 --> 01:07:25.837
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave.

01:07:26.698 --> 01:07:27.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave.

01:07:30.721 --> 01:07:32.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it down.

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:32.783
[SPEAKER_05]: No 2DX for you.

01:07:33.688 --> 01:07:39.592
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making people dizzy on our webcam.

01:07:39.892 --> 01:07:44.575
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to know where the webcam is located, you have to be in our chat room at irc.eggheads.org.

01:07:44.875 --> 01:07:46.296
[SPEAKER_05]: Just join Channel Pound to Orange Lodge.

01:07:46.436 --> 01:07:47.376
[SPEAKER_04]: Plug, plug, plug, plug.

01:07:47.416 --> 01:07:48.337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, plug, plug, plug, plug.

01:07:48.637 --> 01:07:49.418
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I do on this show.

01:07:50.798 --> 01:07:55.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now we are going to talk about what Rob wants to talk about.

01:07:55.581 --> 01:07:57.342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, what I also have on the list.

01:07:57.422 --> 01:07:58.123
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's talk about this.

01:07:59.479 --> 01:08:04.504
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami very soon is supposed to be announcing some kind of online Bomani game.

01:08:05.925 --> 01:08:13.612
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know what it's going to be, but it's going to be an online music... Actually, I shouldn't say it's Bomani, but if it's Konami and if it's a music game, it's probably going to be Bomani.

01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:17.776
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to be some kind of music game that's going to be playable online.

01:08:18.376 --> 01:08:19.618
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think it's going to be?

01:08:20.298 --> 01:08:21.659
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about this once before.

01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:24.022
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it was on the air or not, but I think that...

01:08:24.922 --> 01:08:38.230
[SPEAKER_04]: We basically all thought that it would be something around frequency or something like that with different players doing different instruments or combining to form a song or something of that sort.

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:41.632
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically a rip off of frequency you think?

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:43.753
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Marshall Beat Online.

01:08:45.839 --> 01:08:46.900
[SPEAKER_05]: Marshall Beat Online.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.503
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, the new Marshall Beat is so awesome because it's got Can't Touch This.

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:52.284
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't touch this in Marshall Beat.

01:08:52.685 --> 01:08:56.108
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, you need to explain to me what Marshall Beat is because I don't know.

01:08:56.168 --> 01:08:57.269
[SPEAKER_05]: Marshall Beat is what?

01:08:57.329 --> 01:08:59.190
[SPEAKER_05]: Like para-para except it's karate.

01:08:59.250 --> 01:08:59.571
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:08:59.711 --> 01:08:59.951
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

01:09:00.071 --> 01:09:01.432
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how else to explain it.

01:09:01.452 --> 01:09:05.455
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what it is is you've got like these sensors that are on your hands and on your feet.

01:09:05.856 --> 01:09:07.697
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got another sensor kind of pretty much like...

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.019
[SPEAKER_02]: Mambo A Go Go or whatever that is.

01:09:11.039 --> 01:09:12.220
[SPEAKER_02]: Mambo!

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.460
[SPEAKER_02]: No, whatever that is.

01:09:13.521 --> 01:09:14.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Punch Mania.

01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:16.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Samba de Amigo or whatever like that.

01:09:16.382 --> 01:09:17.002
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

01:09:17.102 --> 01:09:20.404
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it's got the sensors and it can kind of, you know, that kind of thing.

01:09:20.704 --> 01:09:26.207
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, you're on there and they'll ask you to punch up, punch down, kick, do whatever and you have to mimic stuff.

01:09:26.407 --> 01:09:29.208
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have a mode where you can fight people and stuff.

01:09:29.629 --> 01:09:32.050
[SPEAKER_02]: And all at the same time, they have really crappy music in the background.

01:09:32.671 --> 01:09:33.712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Raining Men and Petite Love

01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:04.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you punch to the music?

01:10:04.272 --> 01:10:05.712
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it go like on beat punching?

01:10:06.773 --> 01:10:07.333
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it does.

01:10:08.793 --> 01:10:09.854
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Taibo.

01:10:10.614 --> 01:10:11.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom says.

01:10:11.535 --> 01:10:12.455
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like Taibo.

01:10:12.495 --> 01:10:16.376
[SPEAKER_04]: Taibo, except that you pay by the minute instead of by the tape.

01:10:16.516 --> 01:10:17.837
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:10:18.757 --> 01:10:20.638
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone finds me a place where I can get this.

01:10:20.838 --> 01:10:24.440
[SPEAKER_02]: I will purchase this so that we can have it here.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.721
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the coolest thing ever.

01:10:28.921 --> 01:10:30.622
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play that all day.

01:10:31.744 --> 01:10:33.945
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can find where we can get this, I'll get it.

01:10:34.405 --> 01:10:35.786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just because.

01:10:36.386 --> 01:10:37.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Move the webcam.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.267
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at a really bad point.

01:10:39.767 --> 01:10:41.548
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's now DaveTV.

01:10:42.048 --> 01:10:43.069
[SPEAKER_02]: All Dave, all the time.

01:10:43.929 --> 01:10:45.630
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other ideas what they could do for an online game?

01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:48.431
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania type thing?

01:10:48.451 --> 01:10:49.152
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about that?

01:10:49.272 --> 01:10:51.392
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to add some more instruments to that, I think.

01:10:51.933 --> 01:10:53.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Keyboard Mania?

01:10:53.393 --> 01:10:54.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe bring that back?

01:10:54.154 --> 01:10:59.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Keyboard Mania, Drum Mania, let's get like... Singing Mania, Karaoke Mania.

01:11:00.442 --> 01:11:06.986
[SPEAKER_04]: Get, like, maybe even, uh... Yeah, I've discussed the karaoke thing before, but it's impossible to tell how you're singing.

01:11:07.046 --> 01:11:16.051
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing that can really... I mean, you can sync up noises to tell how much it is, but it's not like you can get a better singing voice, you know?

01:11:16.551 --> 01:11:22.535
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can get more in tune and hit the right notes, but it's not like you have to hit with a certain amount of pressure or something.

01:11:22.595 --> 01:11:27.317
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay, fat people can't play because you gotta hit it, you know, one gram of pressure.

01:11:27.698 --> 01:11:30.019
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami presents American Idol Online!

01:11:32.059 --> 01:11:35.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, bring back the demo, or the promo, or whatever it's called.

01:11:35.905 --> 01:11:44.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that's pretty funny that I actually saw, they have it as part of Monster Rancher 3 for the PlayStation 2, you can actually capture your face and put it on the monster.

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.581
[SPEAKER_05]: We have that in the front room right now, I kid you not.

01:11:47.601 --> 01:11:49.121
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Monster Hunter 3.

01:11:49.321 --> 01:11:50.162
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I saw it.

01:11:50.522 --> 01:11:52.583
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually capture your face and put it on there.

01:11:52.803 --> 01:11:56.944
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be funny to capture your face and stick it on the dancers that are in the backgrounds.

01:11:57.284 --> 01:12:00.646
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you should capture your face and stick it on the crotch part of the dancer.

01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:08.829
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just have like, I can just see Rob's smiling face right over Rage's like, I don't know, didn't we, I forget what we said about him like a few shows ago.

01:12:08.969 --> 01:12:09.829
[SPEAKER_05]: As Emi's third tit?

01:12:11.138 --> 01:12:11.918
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool, too.

01:12:11.938 --> 01:12:12.839
[SPEAKER_05]: Pantsless Rage.

01:12:13.299 --> 01:12:17.361
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that might have been funny if I was in junior high.

01:12:17.441 --> 01:12:21.082
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have you, like, the Pantsless Rage thing that we were talking about, like, three weeks ago.

01:12:21.182 --> 01:12:21.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay!

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:25.964
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, like, censor it out with Rob's smiling head, being like, Whee!

01:12:26.745 --> 01:12:28.185
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, this is, yeah.

01:12:28.265 --> 01:12:29.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm in Rage's pants!

01:12:31.027 --> 01:12:31.527
[SPEAKER_13]: Whee!

01:12:33.368 --> 01:12:36.729
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being told in the chatroom that they are making an American Idol game.

01:12:39.082 --> 01:12:42.605
[SPEAKER_05]: Help Justin save the world from his big hair.

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:43.106
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:12:43.146 --> 01:12:44.947
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell would an American Idol game be?

01:12:46.869 --> 01:12:48.511
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do in an American Idol game?

01:12:49.191 --> 01:12:52.655
[SPEAKER_05]: How about, like, press a button if you want Simon to use this bitch out.

01:12:52.675 --> 01:12:54.496
[SPEAKER_05]: Press a button if you want Simon to use this.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:55.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I challenge this.

01:12:55.577 --> 01:12:56.738
[SPEAKER_02]: Press this button to bring out Paul.

01:12:56.758 --> 01:13:04.506
[SPEAKER_02]: For our chat room here, I challenge you guys to make an American Idol sound basically...

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:07.360
[SPEAKER_02]: Promo?

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:16.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, no, well, a promo would be good too, but I was thinking more along the lines of a sound theme for DWI or something like that.

01:13:16.724 --> 01:13:23.287
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, go back to, you know, you should, your music teacher should be shot or something like that, you know.

01:13:24.896 --> 01:13:27.898
[SPEAKER_05]: You just want a sound file of somebody saying that?

01:13:27.918 --> 01:13:35.041
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just basically, you know, like DWI has sound themes where you have a bunch of different sound clips for like, you know, if you score an A, a combo, whatever.

01:13:35.721 --> 01:13:37.682
[SPEAKER_02]: So something like that.

01:13:38.443 --> 01:13:39.923
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to go ahead and take another break.

01:13:40.584 --> 01:13:43.425
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we come back, you want to do a listless?

01:13:43.845 --> 01:13:44.406
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think?

01:13:45.686 --> 01:13:46.507
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only four of us.

01:13:47.987 --> 01:13:53.070
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the topic I was thinking of we could do is a song we'd like to see a decent freestyle done to.

01:13:55.089 --> 01:13:55.489
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:55.910
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:57.831
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do you guys have any ideas?

01:13:58.472 --> 01:13:59.773
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put the topics to the chatroom.

01:13:59.793 --> 01:14:02.155
[SPEAKER_05]: What does the chatroom want us to decide tonight on Listless?

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:04.316
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put the question out to them.

01:14:04.897 --> 01:14:07.318
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see as soon as they respond to that.

01:14:07.979 --> 01:14:09.500
[SPEAKER_05]: No ideas from the peanut gallery here?

01:14:11.342 --> 01:14:14.644
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've got to wait because we have to do our Listless thing during the break.

01:14:14.744 --> 01:14:17.226
[SPEAKER_05]: People are sending them over private message.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:17.646
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:20.849
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're sending me a request for songs.

01:14:20.869 --> 01:14:23.611
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not sending me... Songs you would like to hear on Marshall Beatz.

01:14:25.356 --> 01:14:27.517
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised his Kung Fu Fighting wasn't on that.

01:14:27.537 --> 01:14:28.918
[SPEAKER_05]: The best yoga song.

01:14:29.958 --> 01:14:32.859
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's only like four songs to pick from, dummy.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:39.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Damn Dare Ram, the remix of Damn Dare Ram, the KCP remix, or another one.

01:14:40.503 --> 01:14:41.383
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn Dariam.

01:14:41.523 --> 01:14:42.624
[SPEAKER_05]: You say it like my dad would.

01:14:42.684 --> 01:14:43.864
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn that Damn Dariam.

01:14:44.004 --> 01:14:51.868
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say Damn Dariam, Damn Dariam, KCP remix, there's No Nobody's Love, and Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

01:14:54.216 --> 01:14:57.517
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Charon's not giving me many good ideas here.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Dance Maniacs song.

01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:06.621
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Dance Maniacs?

01:15:06.661 --> 01:15:09.002
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know enough Dance Maniacs songs to be able to do that.

01:15:09.022 --> 01:15:10.062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they all suck anyways.

01:15:10.682 --> 01:15:13.003
[SPEAKER_05]: We did the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania song already, right?

01:15:13.924 --> 01:15:14.224
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we?

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:16.485
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.

01:15:16.525 --> 01:15:17.005
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we never did.

01:15:17.085 --> 01:15:17.865
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, want to do that?

01:15:20.206 --> 01:15:21.807
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's Paul's fault for not being here.

01:15:23.866 --> 01:15:25.847
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked Paul if he wanted to come, he said no.

01:15:27.767 --> 01:15:28.247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so hurt.

01:15:28.267 --> 01:15:29.848
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if that's the case, then we're doing that tonight.

01:15:29.868 --> 01:15:31.648
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do Best Guitar Freak Song without him here.

01:15:31.969 --> 01:15:35.410
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're doing Best Guitadora Song, I guess.

01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:38.311
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania.

01:15:38.431 --> 01:15:40.291
[SPEAKER_05]: All three of those kind of meshed into one.

01:15:40.731 --> 01:15:42.952
[SPEAKER_05]: Best song out of those.

01:15:43.012 --> 01:15:46.553
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do that when we come back from this little break.

01:15:46.893 --> 01:15:51.035
[SPEAKER_05]: We started out with a song that was requested a lot in the chat room during the last break.

01:15:51.075 --> 01:15:52.035
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is for you guys.

01:15:53.673 --> 01:15:54.599
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not drop the Bizom.

01:16:00.834 --> 01:16:01.494
Thanks for watching!

01:16:34.075 --> 01:16:34.797
Thanks for watching!

01:17:23.362 --> 01:17:24.423
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.088
and the team.

01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:39.611
Sorry, could you make the music louder?

01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:40.631
Yeah, drop the bomb

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:30.426
The Mind Can Do More Than Fit, Explosives That Are Not What It Takes, You Know The Terrorists Always Make Some Mistakes, What We Gotta Do Is Build Momentum, If You Need The Right Tools, Invent Them, Try The Waves, Time, Count Through The Rhythms, The March That You Just Began, Get With Them, The Brain Is Generating All Mighty Power, You Can Do It Now, Your Mastermind Goes Sour, Yes, I'm Ready To Take That Fall, It's Up to You To Make That Culture Stop The Fall,

01:19:51.175 --> 01:20:07.176
[SPEAKER_07]: What we gotta do is build momentum, if you need the right tools, invent them, ride the wave, time comes with the rhythm, the march of the future's begun, get with it, your brain is staring almighty, if I were you to do it now, your message can't go sour, yeah, if you're ready to take that fall, and it's up to you to make that call, and if it don't work, make the real thing, wipe it out, so drop the fall.

Thanks for watching!

01:23:15.442 --> 01:23:19.606
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:23:19.826 --> 01:23:21.548
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to be a staff member by Hollywood?

01:23:21.588 --> 01:23:21.948
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

01:23:22.069 --> 01:23:25.712
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we care what people think of us?

01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:28.195
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

01:23:28.215 --> 01:23:29.656
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:23:30.116 --> 01:23:32.379
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.022
[SPEAKER_10]: Extreme Babani Radio.

01:23:36.282 --> 01:23:38.945
[SPEAKER_10]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:39.645 --> 01:23:42.387
[SPEAKER_05]: That is us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:43.088 --> 01:23:45.669
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just seeing if Dave had a negative reaction to me doing that, too.

01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:46.410
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:54.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, he saved the picture of me looking like I was sucking on some... Well, it was actually the end of that little furry talkie thing.

01:23:54.256 --> 01:23:54.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

01:23:55.256 --> 01:23:55.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

01:23:58.419 --> 01:23:58.899
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing.

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:00.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a picture on the webcam.

01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:05.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds like it's orgasming half the time.

01:24:05.571 --> 01:24:11.575
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but, um... And he saved it, so... I know he's gonna put it on, like, the main Orange Lounge.

01:24:11.955 --> 01:24:13.556
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the only one that saved it, by the way.

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:14.897
[SPEAKER_05]: People in the chatroom saved it, too.

01:24:16.898 --> 01:24:18.419
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, have you seen this man?

01:24:18.819 --> 01:24:20.220
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays the DDR.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.181
[SPEAKER_04]: He sucks the furry cock.

01:24:23.282 --> 01:24:24.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I did not say that.

01:24:25.303 --> 01:24:25.603
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:24:26.504 --> 01:24:29.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week on Orange Lounge... Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:24:30.446 --> 01:24:31.407
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't pull that shit.

01:24:32.107 --> 01:24:32.628
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

01:24:33.028 --> 01:24:33.148
Yeah.

01:24:34.457 --> 01:24:35.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Song in Guitarora

01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:04.049
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go ahead and start.

01:25:04.369 --> 01:25:06.972
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I find some game show music this week for Listless?

01:25:08.713 --> 01:25:09.374
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, why not?

01:25:09.454 --> 01:25:11.836
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do some game show music, if I can find some.

01:25:12.176 --> 01:25:15.759
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you go ahead and tell us your number three song, Loki, and we'll find the game show music.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to go with... Looks like Primal Soul.

01:25:23.225 --> 01:25:24.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Primal Soul, okay.

01:25:28.409 --> 01:25:30.671
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know that song, to be honest, but my bad.

01:25:31.434 --> 01:25:45.080
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, uh... Well then let's hear if your choice is any better, Bradley.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.000
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your number three choice?

01:25:46.881 --> 01:25:48.762
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley is somehow really hyper right now.

01:25:48.782 --> 01:25:50.622
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all like, yeah, girl sounds really good.

01:25:50.642 --> 01:25:54.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're getting him to talk on this show.

01:25:54.644 --> 01:25:55.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut your mouth!

01:25:55.345 --> 01:25:56.105
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, yes.

01:25:57.831 --> 01:25:58.912
[SPEAKER_15]: My number three choice would be Liar Liar.

01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:32.808
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my number three is Naminori Johnny, but it's on 7Mix and 6Mix, Guitar Freaks Romania, and it's actually in Japanese, so you can't see Naminori Johnny.

01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:34.589
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't say that.

01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:39.692
[SPEAKER_05]: Spelled it out really bad, so you're just going to have to deal with me in the chat room.

01:26:39.712 --> 01:26:41.513
[SPEAKER_05]: I just spelled that out best I could.

01:26:41.873 --> 01:26:45.335
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, my number three choice was Miss You.

01:26:46.152 --> 01:26:49.874
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is the long version of Ride on Time, but in Japanese, for those who don't know.

01:26:49.994 --> 01:26:51.294
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was my number three choice.

01:26:51.414 --> 01:26:51.874
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

01:26:51.914 --> 01:26:52.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to hell!

01:26:54.536 --> 01:26:55.496
[SPEAKER_02]: Our music stopped.

01:27:00.918 --> 01:27:01.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Your number two choice.

01:27:02.519 --> 01:27:05.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, my number two choice has to be Eraser Engine.

01:27:06.361 --> 01:27:07.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Eraser Engine.

01:27:09.233 --> 01:27:10.174
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the older stuff.

01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:13.438
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going for... Getting a little old school.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the original Racer Moto Maximo.

01:27:19.024 --> 01:27:19.424
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

01:27:20.125 --> 01:27:21.426
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, your number two choice, Bradley?

01:27:21.947 --> 01:27:23.909
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be Sanagi from Seven Spikes.

01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:28.774
[SPEAKER_05]: Good choice.

01:27:28.855 --> 01:27:29.956
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, your number two choice, Dave.

01:27:32.023 --> 01:27:34.464
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this one's really hard.

01:27:35.705 --> 01:27:39.786
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two choice, I guess, is Double Trouble.

01:27:39.926 --> 01:27:41.627
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great song.

01:27:41.907 --> 01:27:47.890
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Paul Voltaire has his least favorite song on any Bomani game, but that was just for Guitar Freaks.

01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:49.250
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual song, Success.

01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:51.191
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have that really stuff.

01:27:51.811 --> 01:27:52.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Double Cheeseburger!

01:27:54.872 --> 01:27:55.153
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

01:27:55.593 --> 01:27:55.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:27:56.953 --> 01:28:00.735
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my number two choice would be Carnival.

01:28:01.482 --> 01:28:07.305
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like the cardigans, they're cool, and I like that cover of it in Guitar Freak Smith Mix, so Carnival is my number two choice.

01:28:07.765 --> 01:28:10.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Small hands smell like cabbage.

01:28:10.206 --> 01:28:11.627
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you're going to correct my spelling?

01:28:12.327 --> 01:28:12.787
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do.

01:28:13.868 --> 01:28:14.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one?

01:28:14.468 --> 01:28:14.688
[SPEAKER_05]: Here?

01:28:16.469 --> 01:28:17.730
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Bradley's going to correct my spelling.

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:23.332
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get Loki's number one choice for best Guitar Freak Strum Mania song.

01:28:23.533 --> 01:28:24.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is easy.

01:28:24.993 --> 01:28:26.074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be Fireball.

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:27.234
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireball.

01:28:28.015 --> 01:28:28.395
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:28:28.415 --> 01:28:28.575
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:31.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireball.

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:32.921
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good choice.

01:28:33.261 --> 01:28:35.883
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireball.

01:28:35.903 --> 01:28:38.425
[SPEAKER_05]: Your number one choice, Bradley, for best Guitar Freaks drum media song.

01:28:38.905 --> 01:28:39.646
[SPEAKER_15]: Giant Slug.

01:28:39.826 --> 01:28:41.327
[SPEAKER_05]: Giant Slug, right on.

01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:52.915
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to MGL two weeks ago to go play that on 6th Mix, because it's not in 7th Mix on Guitar Freaks.

01:28:53.876 --> 01:28:54.817
[SPEAKER_15]: They removed it from the mix.

01:28:55.857 --> 01:28:56.158
[SPEAKER_05]: Dope!

01:28:56.818 --> 01:29:00.841
[SPEAKER_15]: And lots of the old songs they removed, because it was a cool time.

01:29:02.318 --> 01:29:03.638
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and your number one choice, Dave?

01:29:05.259 --> 01:29:10.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know, this one's kind of typical, but I said at least 100 seconds.

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:11.280
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good song.

01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:17.001
[SPEAKER_04]: The long version kicks so much more ass, but it's not, like, on the Drum Mania or Guitar Freaks.

01:29:17.041 --> 01:29:17.761
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad.

01:29:18.521 --> 01:29:18.821
[SPEAKER_04]: Bummer.

01:29:19.602 --> 01:29:22.542
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one song, I can't believe none of you mentioned it, come on.

01:29:22.902 --> 01:29:25.183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the best song in Guitar Freaks, you know it.

01:29:25.603 --> 01:29:26.363
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say Venus.

01:29:26.663 --> 01:29:27.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say Venus.

01:29:27.243 --> 01:29:27.923
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not Venus.

01:29:28.643 --> 01:29:29.484
[SPEAKER_05]: Haru Spring.

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.404
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, with the Dancing Panda?

01:29:35.054 --> 01:29:35.434
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire, Overbite

01:29:57.469 --> 01:29:58.969
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this one guy.

01:29:59.449 --> 01:30:00.050
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:04.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Guy at Roseville Golf Lane, staff guy, who plays this... Oh, sorry if you're listening.

01:30:04.931 --> 01:30:06.571
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

01:30:06.911 --> 01:30:10.412
[SPEAKER_04]: Who plays this song three songs in a row.

01:30:10.712 --> 01:30:11.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, he puts in money.

01:30:12.072 --> 01:30:12.532
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire!

01:30:13.873 --> 01:30:16.233
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget how the song goes, but anyway, I should remember it.

01:30:16.493 --> 01:30:19.154
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, okay, let's mix it up a little with fire!

01:30:19.554 --> 01:30:19.914
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like...

01:30:20.274 --> 01:30:21.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to challenge myself a little.

01:30:21.796 --> 01:30:22.557
[SPEAKER_04]: FIRE!

01:30:23.277 --> 01:30:27.962
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that he's playing three different games since there's only the long version in, uh, seventh mix.

01:30:28.483 --> 01:30:31.046
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this was in, uh, the fifth mix, Guitar Freaks, I think.

01:30:31.266 --> 01:30:31.366
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

01:30:31.786 --> 01:30:34.009
[SPEAKER_04]: But now he just plays it burn, I think.

01:30:34.369 --> 01:30:35.450
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, FIRE!

01:30:36.251 --> 01:30:37.052
[SPEAKER_13]: BURN!

01:30:37.853 --> 01:30:38.454
[SPEAKER_05]: FIRE!

01:30:40.678 --> 01:30:42.419
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the full list we have so far.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.101
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we get to do the elimination part.

01:30:44.121 --> 01:30:44.641
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be fun.

01:30:45.222 --> 01:30:56.250
[SPEAKER_05]: Primal Soul, Liar Liar, Nami Norijana, Miss You, Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble, Carnival, Fireball, Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Haru Spring.

01:30:56.871 --> 01:30:58.312
[SPEAKER_05]: Your elimination choice, Loki.

01:30:59.022 --> 01:31:02.884
[SPEAKER_02]: Your choice to eliminate from this lovely list we have, Bradley.

01:31:28.496 --> 01:31:32.120
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be Miss You, because Right on Time is a lot better than that one.

01:31:32.721 --> 01:31:33.481
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so hurt.

01:31:34.002 --> 01:31:35.423
[SPEAKER_05]: But okay, that's the way it works.

01:31:35.884 --> 01:31:36.765
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to like Right on Time.

01:31:36.785 --> 01:31:37.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley's fired from the show by the way.

01:31:37.966 --> 01:31:38.787
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:31:38.807 --> 01:31:41.290
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, small e. No, never mind.

01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:49.839
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it was overplayed partially by me, partially by these rocker people at Gulfland, and Rob, and everyone else.

01:31:50.771 --> 01:32:08.054
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know one song I left off my list and I'm really sad I had to leave this list actually I had two songs I had to leave off my list I'm Gonna Get You which I love, I love that song and Mr. Moon, I like that song I usually think of Keyboard Mania when I think of that song so I dumped it yes, you gotta pick one off Dave

01:32:08.607 --> 01:32:10.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I can't pick my own off.

01:32:11.589 --> 01:32:14.310
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I guess I'll take Primal Soul off.

01:32:14.370 --> 01:32:15.531
[SPEAKER_05]: Primal Soul.

01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:18.072
[SPEAKER_05]: You bastard.

01:32:18.372 --> 01:32:19.073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my turn.

01:32:19.093 --> 01:32:23.155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good song, but I thought it was the worst.

01:32:23.215 --> 01:32:24.096
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hard.

01:32:24.156 --> 01:32:25.376
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually like all of these.

01:32:30.699 --> 01:32:35.342
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take off... Oh, this is really hard.

01:32:35.382 --> 01:32:36.823
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually kind of like all these songs.

01:32:36.863 --> 01:32:37.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:32:37.043 --> 01:32:37.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:32:38.997 --> 01:32:39.618
[SPEAKER_05]: Liar Liar.

01:32:39.758 --> 01:32:40.780
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take off Liar Liar.

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:41.741
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:32:41.841 --> 01:32:44.324
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... Oh, Liar Liar.

01:32:45.546 --> 01:32:50.772
[SPEAKER_05]: I just... Yeah, Liar Liar is... Out of that list is my least favorite, but those were all good choices.

01:32:51.473 --> 01:32:51.674
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

01:32:52.538 --> 01:32:55.539
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're going to post the full list into the chat room.

01:32:56.180 --> 01:33:02.202
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to send me your votes over private message in the chat room from the list that we have.

01:33:02.642 --> 01:33:04.663
[SPEAKER_05]: So send me your choice from this list.

01:33:04.683 --> 01:33:06.484
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't vote for anything not on this list.

01:33:06.524 --> 01:33:07.204
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way it works.

01:33:07.324 --> 01:33:15.767
[SPEAKER_05]: From this list of the eight songs we have, Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble, Carnival, Fireball, Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Haru Spring.

01:33:15.807 --> 01:33:17.508

[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to take a quick break while you send those over Private Message.

01:33:23.873 --> 01:33:25.474
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only going to have about three minutes.

01:33:25.514 --> 01:33:28.656
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to play a quick song from the Dance Mania series.

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:30.998
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all the time you get.

01:33:31.098 --> 01:33:34.641
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's play from the Dance Mania series.

01:33:36.743 --> 01:33:39.184
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to do... No, that's Trans Party.

01:33:39.945 --> 01:33:41.326
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not Dance Mania.

01:33:41.346 --> 01:33:44.789
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do... I don't know.

01:33:44.829 --> 01:33:45.249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking.

01:33:45.289 --> 01:33:45.809
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do...

01:33:48.328 --> 01:33:49.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do Tears in May.

01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:52.150
[SPEAKER_05]: You get three minutes while we listen to Missing Heart.

01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:54.251
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the people that did Moonlight Shadow, by the way.

01:33:54.591 --> 01:33:55.672
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Tears in May.

01:33:55.692 --> 01:33:59.093

[SPEAKER_05]: Fireball is the third place winner.

01:39:36.897 --> 01:39:45.160
[SPEAKER_05]: Second place, which would be the first place loser, second place Guitar Freaks song, Drum Mania, Haru Spring.

01:39:46.175 --> 01:39:47.877
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to beat this fanfare thing to the ground.

01:39:47.897 --> 01:39:51.320
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's twice in like one minute.

01:39:51.421 --> 01:39:52.161
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, anyway.

01:40:05.126 --> 01:40:12.928
[SPEAKER_05]: Least 100 seconds is the winner of bestest ever Guitar Freaks Drum Mania song.

01:40:13.388 --> 01:40:13.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

01:40:13.928 --> 01:40:16.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that to Bradley's controller.

01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:17.249
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll beat you up.

01:40:17.969 --> 01:40:19.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd be more worried about the microphone.

01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:20.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.

01:40:24.171 --> 01:40:24.831
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?

01:40:24.851 --> 01:40:26.032
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're doing the webcam.

01:40:26.212 --> 01:40:27.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the webcam.

01:40:28.486 --> 01:40:36.813
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to look at the webcam, the super secret location is only available in our chatroom at Channel Pound Orange Lounge on any other side IRC server.

01:40:37.313 --> 01:40:40.136
[SPEAKER_05]: Same server that hosts a lot of the Big Bomani chatrooms.

01:40:41.096 --> 01:40:41.417
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

01:40:42.432 --> 01:40:43.332
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do we want to talk about?

01:40:43.352 --> 01:40:44.733
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got 20 minutes left on the show.

01:40:45.253 --> 01:40:48.695
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's not here to vent about anything this week because she's out of town.

01:40:48.775 --> 01:40:56.118
[SPEAKER_05]: She's at Step Squad convention or some kind of meeting for her team there, which includes some out of town folks that she's interviewing.

01:40:56.518 --> 01:40:58.379
[SPEAKER_15]: I can do a preemptive fuck you over the week.

01:40:58.579 --> 01:40:59.499
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, go for it.

01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:01.580
[SPEAKER_15]: You downloaded the music.

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:02.901
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I haven't unpacked it though yet.

01:41:03.441 --> 01:41:05.702
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to wait for me to do that before you can go.

01:41:06.142 --> 01:41:07.342
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that and we'll do it.

01:41:07.382 --> 01:41:09.403
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:10.904
[SPEAKER_05]: You got anything you want to talk about, Matt?

01:41:11.758 --> 01:41:14.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, what are you doing, Dave?

01:41:14.541 --> 01:41:16.622
[SPEAKER_13]: One second.

01:41:16.662 --> 01:41:16.963
[SPEAKER_13]: Webcam.

01:41:17.523 --> 01:41:18.404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

01:41:18.424 --> 01:41:20.226
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn off your webcams.

01:41:21.126 --> 01:41:23.769
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a brain, you'll turn off the webcam for about a minute.

01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:27.392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but see, now everyone will turn it on.

01:41:28.353 --> 01:41:31.135
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a request for you to do the Black Mage, whatever that means.

01:41:33.137 --> 01:41:33.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave.

01:41:33.598 --> 01:41:34.719
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's the Black Mage?

01:41:34.879 --> 01:41:35.900
[SPEAKER_04]: I really have no idea.

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:37.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell Dave to do the Black Mage.

01:41:37.481 --> 01:41:38.062
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a request.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:45.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Maid, what am I doing?

01:41:46.584 --> 01:41:47.964
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what they saw, by the way, huh?

01:41:48.265 --> 01:41:49.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's too blurry!

01:41:49.846 --> 01:41:51.106
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a crotch shot!

01:41:51.126 --> 01:41:55.329
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a gynecology appointment!

01:41:59.731 --> 01:42:03.594
[SPEAKER_02]: What you just saw there was the official background for DDR God Mix.

01:42:05.395 --> 01:42:07.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't inflate your ego anymore.

01:42:08.036 --> 01:42:08.397
[SPEAKER_02]: I am God.

01:42:08.417 --> 01:42:09.377
[SPEAKER_05]: I am more than it needs to be.

01:42:09.697 --> 01:42:10.358
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, what's up?

01:42:13.928 --> 01:42:14.850
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, yes.

01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:16.152
[SPEAKER_05]: Glenn is clarifying.

01:42:16.192 --> 01:42:18.116
[SPEAKER_05]: The Black Mage is this.

01:42:19.259 --> 01:42:23.788
[SPEAKER_05]: If you ever read... Do you want to tell us about the story behind the Black Mage, Glenn, who's just joined us in the room?

01:42:24.995 --> 01:42:34.161
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Mage is the most popular character on 8-bit theater, which is a Final Fantasy 1 sprite comic that's insanely, insanely funny.

01:42:36.422 --> 01:42:38.643
[SPEAKER_06]: And Black Mage is the shit, basically.

01:42:39.264 --> 01:42:42.666
[SPEAKER_15]: You gotta hold it for 12 seconds.

01:42:42.786 --> 01:42:44.487
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so... No.

01:42:44.727 --> 01:42:44.927
[SPEAKER_15]: Go.

01:42:45.227 --> 01:42:45.487
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold it.

01:42:45.508 --> 01:42:45.487
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

01:42:53.896 --> 01:42:54.637
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Black Mage.

01:43:00.199 --> 01:43:01.100
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we do it correctly?

01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:02.180
[SPEAKER_04]: 23rd Megas?

01:43:03.121 --> 01:43:03.561
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:43:04.141 --> 01:43:05.762
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddy Jesus, it's Buddy Christ.

01:43:08.444 --> 01:43:09.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Dogma reference.

01:43:10.925 --> 01:43:11.786
[SPEAKER_05]: and Wee!

01:43:11.986 --> 01:43:12.386
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:43:12.707 --> 01:43:14.748
[SPEAKER_05]: Since Jamie's not here, I have to give a big Wee!

01:43:15.209 --> 01:43:15.769
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's not here.

01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:17.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did she... There is a Wee.

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:18.932
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Jamie Wee file, actually.

01:43:18.972 --> 01:43:20.133
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in one of the other promos.

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:22.195
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh... Hold on, let me get Jamie's Wee.

01:43:23.396 --> 01:43:23.596
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:24.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

01:43:25.218 --> 01:43:25.518
[SPEAKER_05]: Dammit.

01:43:26.599 --> 01:43:26.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Dammit!

01:43:30.142 --> 01:43:30.482
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

01:43:30.882 --> 01:43:31.963
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Jamie doing Wee.

01:43:32.043 --> 01:43:33.024
[SPEAKER_05]: That's in one of the other promos.

01:43:35.662 --> 01:43:48.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt has attached the cam to his head, but since it only takes a picture like every 20 seconds, it doesn't really work like one of those extreme sport people, you know, where you see it from their point of view.

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:53.490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of like random clip of what Matt might see if you were standing on top of his head.

01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:57.392
[SPEAKER_15]: Extreme sports, falling off the cliff, you see him falling off the cliff, then you see him dead on the ground.

01:43:57.872 --> 01:43:59.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like you can see him clip...

01:44:00.043 --> 01:44:05.065
[SPEAKER_04]: preparing to pull the cord, and then you just kind of see the cam scattered on the ground.

01:44:05.446 --> 01:44:07.226
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what happened in those 20 seconds?

01:44:07.907 --> 01:44:12.709
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I guess the cord kind of failed, and then the second... What the hell am I talking about?

01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:19.332
[SPEAKER_05]: The show has just gotten so much... I know, the show has gotten so stupid, but people are still listening, go figure.

01:44:19.472 --> 01:44:19.933
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:44:20.913 --> 01:44:21.513
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:44:21.533 --> 01:44:22.934
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the terrible heat.

01:44:23.114 --> 01:44:25.235
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the California heat, we blame it on that.

01:44:25.255 --> 01:44:27.016
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, it got up to like 80 today.

01:44:28.077 --> 01:44:28.657
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong?

01:44:31.595 --> 01:44:35.625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, people just look at us like... I have a Bomani-related topic we could discuss.

01:44:36.166 --> 01:44:36.908
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, how about this?

01:44:38.211 --> 01:44:38.973
[SPEAKER_05]: Internet rankings.

01:44:40.047 --> 01:44:45.428
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any way that you think internet ranking for the various games out there could be improved?

01:44:45.528 --> 01:44:49.369
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides having more than just a crappy USA internet ranking competition in the US.

01:44:49.649 --> 01:44:53.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know how they have the Max 2 internet ranking for various songs you could do?

01:44:53.910 --> 01:45:01.532
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the 2DX internet ranking, which is really popular right now for Sixth Style at Home, which Dave is giving the thumbs down to because he can't rank on it.

01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:12.741
[SPEAKER_04]: The stick style thing is cool because it's at home, and so you're already at home and stuff, but the Max 2 one, first of all, you have to write down, I think it's 16 digits or numbers or letters or combine something.

01:45:12.901 --> 01:45:13.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Numbers!

01:45:14.703 --> 01:45:21.129
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not the fact that you have to have a pen and paper ready to be able to record it.

01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:24.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hello, if you're playing internet ranking, would you think, gee, uh...

01:45:25.734 --> 01:45:34.118
[SPEAKER_05]: All you gotta do, on the PlayStation version, you go into Records, and then you hit, I believe, the Select key when it shows your scores, and it'll show you the internet ranking password.

01:45:35.379 --> 01:45:38.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, you're talking about on Home version.

01:45:38.601 --> 01:45:39.361
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:40.222
[SPEAKER_05]: You were talking about the arcades.

01:45:40.242 --> 01:45:40.582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:45:40.662 --> 01:45:41.582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Dave.

01:45:41.743 --> 01:45:43.483
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you use a memory card, it'll save it.

01:45:43.884 --> 01:45:44.344
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.

01:45:45.064 --> 01:45:46.465
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what's awesome?

01:45:46.905 --> 01:45:49.046
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it playing Versus, it crashes the machine.

01:45:49.867 --> 01:45:50.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, that is pretty cool.

01:45:51.067 --> 01:45:51.928
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but first of all...

01:45:52.521 --> 01:45:56.424
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes three great fields of unlaziness to do this.

01:45:57.065 --> 01:46:01.649
[SPEAKER_04]: First, you have to have a pen and piece of paper and a pen or pencil ready.

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:04.932
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have to waste three songs.

01:46:04.972 --> 01:46:11.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not necessarily waste, but play three songs that you wouldn't normally play just so you can get the internet ranking.

01:46:11.757 --> 01:46:15.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Play them on probably a difficulty that you wouldn't want to or, you know, whatever.

01:46:15.521 --> 01:46:15.861
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:46:16.941 --> 01:46:19.381
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't play internet ranking, shit.

01:46:19.441 --> 01:46:22.642
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to write them down quickly, and then go home.

01:46:23.402 --> 01:46:25.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, stop grabbing the mic.

01:46:25.282 --> 01:46:26.523
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:46:26.983 --> 01:46:27.483
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't talk.

01:46:28.903 --> 01:46:30.983
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it, I'm one of the co-hosts of the show.

01:46:31.323 --> 01:46:32.284
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the co-host.

01:46:32.384 --> 01:46:33.464
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the new host.

01:46:34.204 --> 01:46:39.405
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to go home and actually go on the computer, which I really do not like using computers.

01:46:41.365 --> 01:46:43.686
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, we're on internet radio right now.

01:46:43.726 --> 01:46:46.066
[SPEAKER_05]: You might want to keep the computer bashing a little light.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have for days.

01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:51.861
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just saying, like, I cannot use computers.

01:46:52.301 --> 01:46:53.662
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to go on the internet.

01:46:54.002 --> 01:46:56.903
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you have lost all the memory on your computer.

01:46:57.043 --> 01:46:58.803
[SPEAKER_04]: Your computer is now shutting down.

01:46:59.403 --> 01:47:00.984
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not our fault.

01:47:01.004 --> 01:47:05.185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a special email has been sent to a little midget who will come and kill you now.

01:47:05.465 --> 01:47:06.145
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:47:07.105 --> 01:47:08.646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've gotten those messages before.

01:47:08.966 --> 01:47:09.786
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not true, are they?

01:47:11.114 --> 01:47:11.514
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:47:12.115 --> 01:47:12.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Have the midgets come yet?

01:47:14.456 --> 01:47:14.836
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:47:14.876 --> 01:47:16.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little kids have been threatening me.

01:47:16.337 --> 01:47:17.337
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have been midgets.

01:47:17.717 --> 01:47:18.518
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know this.

01:47:19.258 --> 01:47:23.940
[SPEAKER_04]: No, midgets you can... Sorry, if there's any midgets out there, midgets are awesome.

01:47:24.241 --> 01:47:25.061
[SPEAKER_04]: And they really are.

01:47:25.521 --> 01:47:26.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Itty bitty gang bang.

01:47:27.362 --> 01:47:28.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nasty.

01:47:28.723 --> 01:47:32.265
[SPEAKER_02]: A special F you for all those Greek midgets out there.

01:47:32.865 --> 01:47:33.105
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

01:47:34.088 --> 01:47:35.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what was that all about?

01:47:35.129 --> 01:47:36.090
[SPEAKER_02]: Greek midgets are awesome.

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:37.651
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so last hour.

01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:41.354
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, what do you suggest they do then, Dave?

01:47:41.394 --> 01:47:43.236
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have an internet ranking on your honor?

01:47:43.596 --> 01:47:46.499
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, oh yeah, Eiffel comboed Max Unlimited.

01:47:46.699 --> 01:47:47.580
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not that.

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:49.601
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm number one in the world.

01:47:49.621 --> 01:47:50.282
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crap.

01:47:50.662 --> 01:47:59.050
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that they should hook all the Max 2 arcade machines up to the internet so it kind of like tells you your ranking as you put it in.

01:47:59.410 --> 01:48:01.251
[SPEAKER_04]: That and have a webcam that records your...

01:48:02.032 --> 01:48:07.316
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it's like, I say I full perfect max unlimited three times and somehow get to see it.

01:48:07.577 --> 01:48:08.417
[SPEAKER_05]: No, stop grabbing the mic.

01:48:08.718 --> 01:48:27.613
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're suggesting that Roosevelt Golf Land spend, or any golf land, or any arcade with a max two machine, which is just about everywhere these days, spend thousands of dollars to get a DSL brought in next to the machine, and just so you can have internet rankings, so you can make a pathetic attempt at being the best DDR player in the nation.

01:48:28.948 --> 01:48:29.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know I'm not the best.

01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:31.571
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, not any arcade.

01:48:31.731 --> 01:48:33.092
[SPEAKER_04]: Every arcade needs to do this.

01:48:33.693 --> 01:48:35.154
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be like a specialty.

01:48:35.234 --> 01:48:37.716
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be part of the machine.

01:48:38.057 --> 01:48:41.320
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it should have like a... You're forgetting they're all illegal anyway.

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:42.180
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all bootlegs.

01:48:43.241 --> 01:48:45.684
[SPEAKER_04]: So get the illegal bootleg DSL whatever.

01:48:46.364 --> 01:48:46.965
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um...

01:48:47.997 --> 01:48:49.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

01:48:49.759 --> 01:49:02.353
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's say, you know, I full perfect everything, and it says, yay, you are number one, congratulations, and then, you know, you see, it's kind of like the Soul Calibur 2 thing, you know, with your armies fighting against each other.

01:49:03.213 --> 01:49:05.516
[SPEAKER_02]: Your DDR armies fighting against each other.

01:49:06.297 --> 01:49:08.219
[SPEAKER_04]: I full perfect something, and it's like...

01:49:08.699 --> 01:49:12.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Corey already did this, you are poser, or something like that.

01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:19.204
[SPEAKER_05]: Conquest mode in DDR would be stupid because everybody would pick on MGL, and you know it.

01:49:19.524 --> 01:49:21.725
[SPEAKER_05]: MGL would be gone in five seconds.

01:49:22.706 --> 01:49:34.211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how long we'd last though, because we've got a constant stream of people playing, but most of the people, sorry if you're listening, I do this a lot, are pretty bad, except for like us.

01:49:36.048 --> 01:49:39.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Us being sacramentals who know each other.

01:49:41.251 --> 01:49:41.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:49:41.931 --> 01:49:44.613
[SPEAKER_04]: Because lots of these new sacramentals don't know them.

01:49:44.793 --> 01:49:47.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, let's get off this rant because it's kind of boring.

01:49:48.535 --> 01:49:49.235
[SPEAKER_05]: Give the mic back, Dave.

01:49:51.197 --> 01:49:51.737
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave's pouting.

01:49:52.509 --> 01:49:55.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, other things coming up we should talk about.

01:49:56.411 --> 01:49:58.011
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can give a little plug for me.

01:49:58.291 --> 01:49:59.672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my birthday on Wednesday!

01:49:59.912 --> 01:50:00.653
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

01:50:01.833 --> 01:50:04.954
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday, there was something about Wednesday that was important.

01:50:06.295 --> 01:50:07.655
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I was supposed to remember.

01:50:08.416 --> 01:50:10.597
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other kind of anniversary, I forget.

01:50:11.277 --> 01:50:12.358
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

01:50:13.178 --> 01:50:13.898
[SPEAKER_05]: How could I forget?

01:50:13.938 --> 01:50:15.759
[SPEAKER_05]: If I turn on the TV, they keep reminding me.

01:50:16.079 --> 01:50:17.580
[SPEAKER_05]: Your birthday happens to be on September 11th, huh?

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:22.455
[SPEAKER_15]: Another important data is that supposedly my cable is supposed to be installed.

01:50:22.837 --> 01:50:24.302
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably AT&T is going to fuck it up.

01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:34.597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and also, if you calculate the hours correctly, that's the time that I will be finished downloading the porn that I am starting to download now.

01:50:34.737 --> 01:50:36.578
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be finished by September.

01:50:36.818 --> 01:50:37.539
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I swear.

01:50:37.999 --> 01:50:40.842
[SPEAKER_04]: It will take like 100, like 400 hours or something.

01:50:40.862 --> 01:50:43.704
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares about the porn, Dave?

01:50:43.824 --> 01:50:45.565
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you planning to do to celebrate your birthday?

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:47.527
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you planning to do to celebrate your birthday?

01:50:47.587 --> 01:50:49.409
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm throwing a Bomani party.

01:50:50.349 --> 01:50:52.390
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you're throwing the Big Bomani Party next weekend.

01:50:52.471 --> 01:50:52.751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:50:53.011 --> 01:50:57.013
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll do something, we'll have to tape something for Orange Lounge there, I don't know what, but we'll do something.

01:50:57.093 --> 01:51:04.178
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun, I'll have my sim set up with the metal pads and all that fun stuff, and I'll be making burgers.

01:51:04.238 --> 01:51:05.579
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it next weekend or Wednesday?

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:06.679
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Saturday.

01:51:06.799 --> 01:51:07.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:11.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, if it was the weekend, then I wouldn't, or the weekday, because I wouldn't be able to.

01:51:12.083 --> 01:51:13.404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Wednesday, I don't know.

01:51:13.424 --> 01:51:16.285
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents are cool in case they're listening, but they're not.

01:51:17.006 --> 01:51:17.106
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

01:51:18.067 --> 01:51:22.249
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but see, I can't go on weekdays because I'm trapped in my house.

01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:23.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:30.374
[SPEAKER_02]: See, on Friday we're going down to the Winchester Mystery House to do a midnight tour.

01:51:30.434 --> 01:51:31.035
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds fun.

01:51:31.075 --> 01:51:32.035
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday the 13th.

01:51:32.395 --> 01:51:34.276
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do that because that'll be fun.

01:51:34.557 --> 01:51:36.658
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Saturday at my party and stuff.

01:51:37.198 --> 01:51:40.060
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone's invited, so come crash the party if you want.

01:51:41.036 --> 01:51:44.298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being reminded of something in the chat room that's going on right now as we speak.

01:52:04.443 --> 01:52:04.583
[SPEAKER_05]: Dansu?

01:52:04.663 --> 01:52:04.863
[SPEAKER_05]: Dansu?

01:52:04.883 --> 01:52:04.984
[SPEAKER_05]: Dansu?

01:52:05.004 --> 01:52:05.104
[SPEAKER_05]: Dansu?

01:52:28.593 --> 01:52:29.854
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to explain this to me.

01:52:30.494 --> 01:52:38.482
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the plot was they go to Japan to find Hank's, the main character's, half-brother or something, because there was some love grandfather thing.

01:52:38.863 --> 01:52:48.572
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyway, they see DDR on this giant screen, you know, it's on one of the mega screens, broadcasting in basically a Times Square type of place.

01:52:49.313 --> 01:52:51.215
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, the...

01:52:51.949 --> 01:52:59.234
[SPEAKER_04]: The main character's son goes up there and starts playing and busts out to, I think it was, was it Kung Fu Fighting?

01:52:59.254 --> 01:52:59.815
[SPEAKER_04]: Shake Your Booty.

01:53:00.275 --> 01:53:03.357
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't Shake... That's the way I like it.

01:53:03.417 --> 01:53:04.218
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I like it.

01:53:04.258 --> 01:53:04.898
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was later.

01:53:04.918 --> 01:53:06.039
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the ceramic slot.

01:53:06.099 --> 01:53:06.659
[SPEAKER_04]: Baby got back.

01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:14.365
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what happened was this girl comes up and it's kind of like funny romance off of DDR.

01:53:15.305 --> 01:53:18.127
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got the, I forget, the robot characters.

01:53:18.187 --> 01:53:18.828
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget their names.

01:53:20.492 --> 01:53:22.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Casento, or whatever that is.

01:53:22.794 --> 01:53:24.175
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just put Rob to sleep.

01:53:25.595 --> 01:53:27.717
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, King of the Hill usually puts me to sleep.

01:53:27.757 --> 01:53:28.918
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't find the show funny at all.

01:53:29.078 --> 01:53:30.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you don't like propane?

01:53:31.399 --> 01:53:33.501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to talk about this new... Yes, Matt?

01:53:37.429 --> 01:53:38.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you finished?

01:53:38.230 --> 01:53:38.950
[SPEAKER_02]: May I finish?

01:53:39.150 --> 01:53:39.551
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I finish?

01:53:39.711 --> 01:53:40.331
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I finish?

01:53:40.351 --> 01:53:40.731
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I finish?

01:53:41.132 --> 01:53:47.616
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I'd like to talk about this new TV show that's actually on Comedy Central that's an old British show called Trigger Happy TV.

01:53:48.337 --> 01:53:49.237
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is damn funny.

01:53:49.658 --> 01:53:51.839
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, British... Is it related to Vimani?

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:53.540
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be.

01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:54.681
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't watched the whole thing.

01:53:54.701 --> 01:53:56.843
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got music in it.

01:53:59.022 --> 01:54:00.963
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, just like DDR, they both have music.

01:54:01.103 --> 01:54:01.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well done.

01:54:01.764 --> 01:54:02.544
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, shit.

01:54:02.564 --> 01:54:04.146
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, tell us more about this show.

01:54:04.806 --> 01:54:05.687
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.

01:54:05.807 --> 01:54:06.267
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:54:07.288 --> 01:54:08.949
[SPEAKER_02]: Betsy, you've worn it out of me.

01:54:09.069 --> 01:54:10.550
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like talking about it anymore.

01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:12.651
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I wear you out, Matt?

01:54:12.671 --> 01:54:13.132
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:54:13.192 --> 01:54:13.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.

01:54:14.813 --> 01:54:15.393
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:54:16.154 --> 01:54:20.116
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, yeah, so they have it on there, and it's cool, and yeah.

01:54:21.657 --> 01:54:22.298
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

01:54:24.045 --> 01:54:28.487
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the chat room, 23rd Magus says he's going to come to your Be-Money party.

01:54:29.207 --> 01:54:29.607
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

01:54:29.667 --> 01:54:32.628
[SPEAKER_05]: To celebrate Konami's famous Be-Money series.

01:54:33.328 --> 01:54:34.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'll actually get to meet him.

01:54:34.469 --> 01:54:38.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've tried to meet him numerous times and it never worked.

01:54:38.110 --> 01:54:40.691
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was in the same arcade once and I never saw him again.

01:54:41.181 --> 01:54:42.442
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a Kodak moment, I'm sure.

01:54:42.462 --> 01:54:42.962
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised.

01:54:43.002 --> 01:54:44.483
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was funny.

01:54:44.503 --> 01:54:48.385
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought people would come to my QZAR trip since it was just me and that guy.

01:54:48.525 --> 01:54:49.305
[SPEAKER_05]: I was broke.

01:54:49.445 --> 01:54:51.707
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wanted to go, but I'm so broke.

01:54:51.767 --> 01:54:52.287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:54:52.507 --> 01:54:53.407
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it next time.

01:54:53.488 --> 01:54:58.210
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Bomani party, it sounds like there's going to be tons of people there, and I was expecting there to be like five people.

01:54:58.410 --> 01:54:58.790
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hey.

01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:02.390
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the more the merrier.

01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:06.571
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have an empty house that night, so hopefully we won't be waking anyone up.

01:55:07.011 --> 01:55:08.011
[SPEAKER_02]: And my neighbors suck.

01:55:08.091 --> 01:55:08.831
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate my neighbors.

01:55:09.092 --> 01:55:10.972
[SPEAKER_02]: A special F you to my freaking neighbors.

01:55:12.092 --> 01:55:18.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this dumbass, I guess her boyfriend moved in next door, and he parks his truck.

01:55:19.094 --> 01:55:24.136
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're in a court, and instead of parking along the curb, he actually parks perpendicular to the curb.

01:55:24.236 --> 01:55:27.377
[SPEAKER_02]: So his truck is taking up half of our driveway.

01:55:29.073 --> 01:55:29.654
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a bastard.

01:55:29.894 --> 01:55:51.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think Bomani parties, getting together and playing, to make this more of a topic everybody can relate to than just people who are within driving distance of Loki's house, do you think Bomani parties are a cool thing to do once in a while, get together and just play all the home versions, or do you think maybe we ought to go to the arcade to play these things, or is it more fun because at home you can drink and play DDR?

01:55:51.332 --> 01:55:55.576
[SPEAKER_05]: Although if you go to Dave & Buster's at home you can drink and play DDR too, but just hypothetically.

01:55:56.056 --> 01:55:56.697
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fun.

01:55:57.361 --> 01:55:59.962
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, does anyone else have Vimani parties?

01:56:01.043 --> 01:56:01.523
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

01:56:02.063 --> 01:56:02.524
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

01:56:02.564 --> 01:56:03.764
[SPEAKER_05]: Friends get together, play Vimani.

01:56:04.485 --> 01:56:06.385
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, man, people have LAN parties.

01:56:06.485 --> 01:56:07.266
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

01:56:07.926 --> 01:56:08.446
[SPEAKER_02]: They have what?

01:56:08.967 --> 01:56:09.547
[SPEAKER_02]: LAN parties.

01:56:09.627 --> 01:56:14.549
[SPEAKER_02]: Local Area Networks, where you play network games like Quake 3 and that kind of crap, and you hook computers up.

01:56:14.569 --> 01:56:16.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, Quake 3.

01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:17.551
[SPEAKER_03]: Look out.

01:56:17.951 --> 01:56:19.812
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to... I don't know what the game's about.

01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:27.938
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter, there's parties for everything It's point and shoot, that's all it is People get together to watch like, you know, I Love Lucy shows and that kind of shit

01:56:29.497 --> 01:56:30.918
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave with the stupid webcam.

01:56:30.958 --> 01:56:34.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so, yeah, I think it's a good idea that people get together.

01:56:34.661 --> 01:56:38.464
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that will bring people together to actually be able to enjoy something will be great.

01:56:38.584 --> 01:56:40.965
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whether it be an arcade or whatnot.

01:56:41.205 --> 01:56:43.907
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's about time to close the show, but a closing thought.

01:56:44.168 --> 01:56:47.590
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be the absolute worst thing that you could do at a Bomani party?

01:56:47.630 --> 01:56:50.152
[SPEAKER_05]: Say you're going to a Bomani party for the first time as a newbie.

01:56:50.552 --> 01:56:51.853
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute worst thing you could do?

01:56:52.233 --> 01:56:52.914
[SPEAKER_05]: Show up on the wrong day.

01:56:55.543 --> 01:57:01.545
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, absolute worst thing you could do at a Bomani party your first time?

01:57:01.585 --> 01:57:02.285
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, you have any ideas?

01:57:03.205 --> 01:57:05.006
[SPEAKER_04]: The absolute worst thing?

01:57:05.406 --> 01:57:11.748
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first I could think about getting really drunk and playing naked, but I'm guessing that you could do worse stuff than that.

01:57:11.968 --> 01:57:20.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know, because I mean, that party that you had a while back, it wasn't really a Bomani party, but all these people that played Bomani showed up, and so it kind of turned into one.

01:57:20.695 --> 01:57:31.522
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, where, uh, I think, Ryan Samumangus, or Magus, or whatever, um, he put on his girlfriend's clothes and started parrying.

01:57:32.763 --> 01:57:34.084
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really bad.

01:57:34.104 --> 01:57:41.128
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it looked like a tutu slash, like, he looked very, very fruity.

01:57:41.588 --> 01:57:42.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Rob.

01:57:42.549 --> 01:57:43.269
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it's okay.

01:57:43.289 --> 01:57:43.570
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:57:43.670 --> 01:57:43.810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:57:48.123 --> 01:57:49.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Any ideas from Bradley?

01:57:51.484 --> 01:57:52.605
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, whoops, my bad.

01:57:52.845 --> 01:57:53.465
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, yes.

01:57:53.946 --> 01:57:55.146
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further ideas, Bradley?

01:57:55.306 --> 01:58:01.289
[SPEAKER_15]: Like breaking people's machines or playing Let Them Move for the first time.

01:58:01.509 --> 01:58:02.449
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow!

01:58:02.929 --> 01:58:03.730
[SPEAKER_14]: Let Them Move!

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.750
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:08.312
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, now that I flashback to my first Bimani party, what was it?

01:58:08.352 --> 01:58:10.433
[SPEAKER_02]: My modded pad got broken.

01:58:11.733 --> 01:58:12.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

01:58:12.634 --> 01:58:14.294
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember my first Bimani party.

01:58:14.895 --> 01:58:15.275
[SPEAKER_04]: It was...

01:58:16.508 --> 01:58:17.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, no, I don't.

01:58:17.229 --> 01:58:18.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember one Bomani party.

01:58:18.810 --> 01:58:24.636
[SPEAKER_04]: It involved people getting drunk and, you know, dressing up in their girlfriend's clothes and playing para.

01:58:25.697 --> 01:58:26.918
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny because it wasn't me.

01:58:27.379 --> 01:58:32.504
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to agree with the chat room that the absolute worst thing you could do at your first Bomani party is para naked.

01:58:33.585 --> 01:58:34.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Para naked.

01:58:34.626 --> 01:58:37.249
[SPEAKER_04]: You could, like, dick whip across the thing.

01:58:37.349 --> 01:58:37.669
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, um...

01:58:41.019 --> 01:58:43.264
[SPEAKER_05]: Another bad thing would be trying to play DDR in the pool.

01:58:43.545 --> 01:58:44.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Would be another bad idea.

01:58:45.429 --> 01:58:48.175
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't take your PS2 in the pool.

01:58:48.997 --> 01:58:50.660
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play DDR on thin ice.

01:58:51.998 --> 01:58:53.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to see that on a game show.

01:58:53.559 --> 01:58:55.059
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR on Ice.

01:58:55.219 --> 01:58:59.121
[SPEAKER_04]: You've referenced this before, but that game... Stomp, stomp.

01:58:59.341 --> 01:59:00.541
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, I've got like 30 seconds.

01:59:01.102 --> 01:59:06.744
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing where you get it wrong and the floor drops out from under you, what's that show called?

01:59:06.764 --> 01:59:07.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Russian Roulette.

01:59:07.404 --> 01:59:08.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Russian Roulette.

01:59:08.244 --> 01:59:15.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Like DDR Russian, you hit a wrong note and the floor just drops out from under you, so you're like trying to step, and then the floor goes bye-bye.

01:59:15.307 --> 01:59:16.948
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like So Goonies, okay?

01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:37.365
[SPEAKER_15]: Baby Ruth And Rob came up with a good idea for a new show DDR on Ice With Ryan Boitano And John Tesh announcing Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp to my beat Stomp to my beat, stomp to my beat

01:59:38.564 --> 01:59:39.565
[SPEAKER_14]: This player of DDR.

01:59:39.905 --> 01:59:41.646
[SPEAKER_14]: He has such a terrible youth.

01:59:42.146 --> 01:59:43.387
[SPEAKER_14]: He grew up in the slums.

01:59:44.668 --> 01:59:47.410
[SPEAKER_14]: And now he plays DDR and he gets money that way.

01:59:47.850 --> 01:59:48.911
[SPEAKER_14]: He's won tournaments.

01:59:49.411 --> 01:59:51.192
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just breaks my heart.

01:59:53.454 --> 01:59:56.876
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for those who don't know, this is the most Bradley's ever talked.

01:59:57.496 --> 01:59:57.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

01:59:58.057 --> 02:00:02.920
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, cumulative in this two hours, he's talked more than he's ever talked in his entire life.

02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:04.881
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard he here on Orange Lounge first.

02:00:05.661 --> 02:00:05.762
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

02:00:06.986 --> 02:00:08.927
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of funny to know that I actually had a radio show one time.

02:00:09.267 --> 02:00:09.687
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?
