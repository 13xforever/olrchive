00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
All your days are belong to us.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.640
Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content, and many instances are the f-word, which is not safe for children.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.240
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1

00:36.240 --> 00:50.240
God damn you, stop calling here! Isn't this 4215 pussy way? You bitch! Now let me take

00:50.240 --> 00:55.240
the zip code! You want to fuck you? You have no morals, darling. I'd also like to add that

00:55.240 --> 01:02.240
I have my father's gun and a scorching case of purpose. Kiss my grass, nuge. Mecha lecha

01:02.240 --> 01:06.240
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.240
Me too!

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
Fuck are you?

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
I'm working on it.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
Loser.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.240
Lame.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.240
On the side of my face.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.240
Breathing.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.240
Breath.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.240
Heaving breath.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.240
Heaving whatever.

01:18.240 --> 01:25.240
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience records.

01:25.240 --> 01:30.240
I am your singing telegram.

01:30.240 --> 01:39.240
Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

01:39.240 --> 01:44.240
You're tuned into the Bemani scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bemani.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.240
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me better as Sky.

01:47.240 --> 01:52.240
Typically, I would be saying, joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.240
However, unfortunately, she had to make a last-minute cancellation.

01:55.240 --> 02:00.920
So, filling in as co-hosts tonight, say hello to honorary co-host and sym-fan extraordinaire,

02:00.920 --> 02:03.000
Matt, also known as Loki.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Hey, everyone.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.680
And, of course, as always, we're joined by some other in-studio friends.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.960
Actually, we're down to one tonight.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.120
We got Bradley in the house.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.120
Say hello.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.120
Hello, there.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.640
And everybody else is busy this week, apparently, now that school's back in session, although

02:17.640 --> 02:21.400
most of the people on this show are out of high school already, with the exception of

02:21.400 --> 02:22.400
a couple.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.980
still high school but like Brad and Irene they had a visitor coming in from out of

02:25.980 --> 02:28.880
town and Jamie had to go to another event we'll get into all that later

02:28.880 --> 02:33.720
anyway this is episode number 11 for September the 8th of 2002 and we might

02:33.720 --> 02:36.360
get some more guests later there's rumors that some people might show up

02:36.360 --> 02:40.840
later show goes on we'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later but

02:40.840 --> 02:44.480

Got the best of the way speakers

04:00.460 --> 04:04.460

04:22.860 --> 04:25.260
All you gotta do is get down

04:25.260 --> 04:29.860
All you gotta do is get down to the mask on

04:29.860 --> 04:33.660

05:06.360 --> 05:09.680
From the bottom, up and from the camera top

05:09.680 --> 05:13.160
You're cheeky on your teeth and start it up

05:13.160 --> 05:16.360
No matter what, I never thought that

05:16.360 --> 05:20.360
Daddy didn't work, a really smart guy

05:20.360 --> 05:24.880
But daddy's something we all know

05:24.880 --> 05:28.400
T-t-tala lila, T-tala lila

05:28.420 --> 05:31.720
T-t-tala la, T-tala lila

05:31.760 --> 05:35.200
T-t-ta-ta-ta, T-tala lila

05:35.240 --> 05:38.340
Where do these voices speak in our house?

05:38.360 --> 05:41.900
T-t-ta-ta-ta-la lila, T-tala lila

05:41.940 --> 05:45.260
T-t-ta-ta-ta-la, T-tala lila

05:45.280 --> 05:48.160
Let's take the Attention, T-tala lila

05:48.180 --> 05:50.760
Oh, my Crossing is down the Wind

07:20.760 --> 07:27.240
Ochiteku, soki no amari kamori

07:27.240 --> 07:34.600
Tsurikee, tsutabini, kidoku maru

07:34.600 --> 07:41.240
Nekishimata, imatake, sudatefuri shita

07:41.240 --> 07:47.400
Tatta, kidoku de kenara, kenbu, tenpuiramae

07:47.400 --> 07:49.720
Living like I'm lost

07:49.760 --> 07:54.420
For me, I come close,

07:54.420 --> 07:52.740
Even if I

07:54.340 --> 07:54.760

07:54.460 --> 08:17.180

Because we know what it's ready to be

09:18.080 --> 09:20.080

Don't ever quit

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
Don't ever give me any love

09:37.080 --> 09:48.640
You are the best You all happen to me

09:48.640 --> 09:46.300
From the Step Squad to DAYZ, this DTR Stocks Speak,

09:46.300 --> 10:10.620
I have no idea what half those little acronyms mean.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.340
Am I just uncool?

10:13.340 --> 10:14.540
I don't know what they mean either.

10:14.540 --> 10:16.920
All right, cool. We'll both be un-cool then.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.640
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Big thanks to Step Squad for getting

10:20.640 --> 10:23.720
together and recording that promo for us.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.880
But a big F-you to them too, because it's because of them that Jamie's gone this

10:26.880 --> 10:28.840
week, and I'm sitting here

10:28.840 --> 10:32.640
with a very empty room tonight. Big thank you to Matt and Bradley for

10:32.640 --> 10:34.060
showing up, though.

10:34.060 --> 10:37.360
No, I'm just kidding. Nothing but love for Step Squad. We love all of them and

10:37.360 --> 10:40.560
stuff, Ab. But Jamie is at a Step Squad event today.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.360
She's going to be seeing some friends, I guess, that are coming up from out of town

10:44.360 --> 10:48.200
for some big gathering that are going on. But needless to say, she took the remote kit

10:48.200 --> 10:51.920
and she's getting some interviews, so next week we'll hear from a lot of people throughout

10:51.920 --> 10:54.840
the DDR scene. There's a lot of really great people in Step Squad I'm sure we'll be hearing

10:54.840 --> 10:56.440
from next week, so that'll be cool.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.440
Yes.

10:57.440 --> 11:02.320
All right. So what else? What were we talking about during the break there? During the break

11:02.320 --> 11:07.060
we were kind of talking about songs that have been released for simulators lately, and you've

11:07.060 --> 11:10.760
been looking, you know, now for those that don't know Matt, also known as Loki, he's

11:10.760 --> 11:13.720
He's really big into the simulator.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.560
For those who don't know what a DDR simulator is, dance with intensity, step mania, things

11:17.560 --> 11:18.560
like that.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.680
Things that will emulate DDR on your computer basically, or simulate I should say.

11:21.680 --> 11:26.080
Some people get on my ass for not clarifying the difference between emulate and simulate.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.240
But you know, whatever, it's DDR on your computer basically.

11:29.240 --> 11:34.120
But Loki really big into this, likes to download every single freaking song he can find and

11:34.120 --> 11:35.840
play them all.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.840
What's going on?

11:36.840 --> 11:39.400
Give us a sim scene update, tell us about some stuff you've been looking for recently.

11:39.400 --> 11:49.400
Well, let's see. Recently, especially at my job, I suppose I should be actually doing real work at my job, but instead I exploit their T1 line.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.400
Right on.

11:50.400 --> 12:01.400
And so lately I've been actually searching some of the smaller Japanese sites. You know, the ones that you can't understand a thing that's on them, but you see, you know, song files with BMS stuff.

12:01.400 --> 12:07.400
Anyways, some of the stuff I've actually found recently is actually some 2DX8 style stuff.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.400
That's pretty cool.

12:08.400 --> 12:15.400
Found a whole bunch of remixes for stuff like the Long Train Running Ventura mix.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
They actually have a file for that out there.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.400
There's actually tons of files out there.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.400
It's just people don't know where to look.

12:21.400 --> 12:25.400
Now what were you telling me about some things in development that are going on right now?

12:25.400 --> 12:27.400
Because there's a couple really funny ones.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
ones.

12:28.400 --> 12:33.120
Okay, there's a, I forget which side I saw it on, but there's some guy that's actually

12:33.120 --> 12:38.840
doing basically like a mix, you know, with a bunch of different songs he's going to be

12:38.840 --> 12:39.840
releasing.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.840
They're all Christian music.

12:40.840 --> 12:47.440
What was the comment there from the little stuffed ferret or whatever the heck this thing

12:47.440 --> 12:48.440
is?

12:48.440 --> 12:49.440
Good idea.

12:49.440 --> 12:57.440
Anyway, so there's going to be a DDR god mix coming out soon, basically.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.640
Yes, exactly.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.800
It's very scary, but...

13:00.800 --> 13:02.440
Jesus Christ, it's DDR!

13:02.440 --> 13:07.280
Hey, well, I've already got that Paranoid Catholic, so there's the start.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.280
What else?

13:08.280 --> 13:09.280
There's also...

13:09.280 --> 13:10.280
Paranoid Catholic?

13:10.280 --> 13:11.280
Yes!

13:11.280 --> 13:12.280
There is a...

13:12.280 --> 13:13.880
There's a Paranoid Catholic...

13:13.880 --> 13:17.800
There's tons of Paranoid mixes out there that we don't even know about.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.800
They're out there.

13:18.800 --> 13:23.720
They have a list on there. If you actually search under Yahoo or something, for Paranoia

13:23.720 --> 13:27.240
and then maybe DDR, they'll actually have a website that you can pull up a list of every

13:27.240 --> 13:31.120
single Paranoia ever made. All the remixes that people have done that are fan-made.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.040
As if you needed more Paranoia.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.760
And they have links to the actual step files, too.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.760
Really?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.040
Where you can download them. So that was kind of cool.

13:38.040 --> 13:41.520
Do you dance little crosses in the Christian mix? Just kind of like up, down, left, right?

13:41.520 --> 13:46.840
No, it's just instead of some of the orchestra hits, you have God, God, God, you know, that

13:46.840 --> 13:47.840
kind of stuff.

13:47.840 --> 13:55.080
like Madonna and like a prayer going God? God? No, not quite, but anyways. Other things,

13:55.080 --> 14:01.040
BimaniRuler, Dave, actually he had a few files, eight more files that he was releasing. There

14:01.040 --> 14:05.320
are some of his older stuff that looked really awesome. He's done some of the Para Para music

14:05.320 --> 14:09.960
by Eurobeat and My Sweet Banana and that kind of stuff. Plus, there's a few other ones that

14:09.960 --> 14:14.400
you can actually get right now. He has Max Enigma which is in Tourney Mix 2. Is that

14:14.400 --> 14:17.400
Max mixed with Enigma music or something?

14:17.400 --> 14:26.400
No, he made it with the key sounds from Max 300 and the 2DX sims.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
Actually, I recognize most of it in there.

14:28.400 --> 14:33.400
Most of it is just the key sounds from that and he just made his own mix out of it.

14:33.400 --> 14:38.400
Something similar to what I was going to but got pissed off with it and decided not to.

14:38.400 --> 14:50.400
There's another one he's also released that there's a link on DDR Maniacs in their boards. They've got one for Gravity from, I believe, Sevenstyle.

14:50.400 --> 14:58.400
And let me just say that, you know, people have gotten A's and B's and C's on it and stuff in The Sims, but it's pretty much impossible.

14:58.400 --> 15:02.400
But as Jamie would say, to do that you'd have to be the king of iron fingering.

15:02.400 --> 15:08.400
Well, no, here's the thing. I mean, DDR is DDR. I mean, you play it, you kind of dance to it and stuff on the keyboard, it's cool.

15:08.400 --> 15:14.400
Let's not make DDR 2DX. I mean, this is pretty much what they're doing, is making it like 2DX.

15:14.400 --> 15:24.400
Well, that's how they're making it harder. I mean, how do you make DDR steps harder without getting just more convoluted and more like 2DX-style step-ups?

15:24.400 --> 15:34.400
The freeze arrows are one way of doing it, because the freeze arrows will screw you up on songs like Ordinary World where if you don't spin or do a little trick with your feet, you're not going to hit them all.

15:34.400 --> 15:41.400
Granted, you know, they are hard, but they do go with the music. They go with the music perfectly, so I give them that. That's cool.

15:41.400 --> 15:46.400
I'm still trying to get the other six or so files I'm missing.

15:46.400 --> 15:51.400
I actually have a deal with the webmaster at DDRMania X

15:51.400 --> 15:56.400
and I'm going to send him some anime and he's going to send me a burned copy and a CD with them on there.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.400
But unfortunately there's been some problems with me sending them to him.

15:59.400 --> 16:03.400
I hear we have a lot of fans of the show in the DDRMania X chatroom, so hello!

16:03.400 --> 16:06.400
It's all of you! Love ya! Big kisses.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.400
Yeah, I hear they hate the show.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
I'm surprised.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.400
Eh, what can you do?

16:11.400 --> 16:14.240
I mean, I don't even know if they've listened, but whatever.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.280
They hate the show, so, so much for that, you know.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.280
We all hate this show.

16:19.280 --> 16:25.520
Well, see, other than that, sim-wise, I mean, no updates as far as DWI goes.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.080
Step Mania, I heard there's a Beta 6 out there somewhere, but I haven't played it and don't

16:29.080 --> 16:30.080
really care to.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.960
I'm just, I've given up on Step Mania, so.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.200
I like Step Mania, personally, but, you know.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.360
I've given up on it.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.640
I don't really play DDR Sims because I just can't do DDR on my fingers, it doesn't make

16:40.640 --> 16:41.640
sense.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.760
And really, when I'm playing DDR at home, I'll do the official Konami one.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.860
I know you want to ask why the hell would I play that.

16:47.860 --> 16:50.900
That's why I can play with the pirates, argh!

16:50.900 --> 16:53.240
The new DDR pirates!

16:53.240 --> 16:54.240
Yeah.

16:54.240 --> 17:00.220
And for those who didn't hear, the new DDR PC characters, they've been releasing characters

17:00.220 --> 17:01.800
every other week or so.

17:01.800 --> 17:07.360
The most recent characters they released, Elliot and, I forget the name of the other

17:07.360 --> 17:10.480
one, it started with C. I'm sure Chawram will fill me in.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.480
They're pirates.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.200
They're two pirates.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.080
The first one were a couple of nightclubs, the second one were kind of, I don't know,

17:17.080 --> 17:23.480
dressed like cowboys, no the cowboys are the hidden ones in the game.

17:23.480 --> 17:27.360
The other ones they released were kind of like, I don't know, they had a unique style

17:27.360 --> 17:28.360
to them.

17:28.360 --> 17:33.300
on their heads that cover your whole head type thing. Now they've got pirates out.

17:33.300 --> 17:37.600
What I want to know though is when are we going to get pirate music in DDR? I mean when

17:37.600 --> 17:42.960
are we going to have it? What exactly is pirate music? Like the theme from the Pirates of

17:42.960 --> 17:50.020
the Caribbean or something? Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Yo ho ho, argh, get off me

17:50.020 --> 17:57.440
pad, matey. Yeah, stuff like that. I don't know. But yeah, sim file stuff, there is tons

17:57.440 --> 18:01.680
of it out there, you just gotta find it. I might, if time permits, one of these days,

18:01.680 --> 18:05.880
just actually link to all these sites that have really cool stuff on them and, you know,

18:05.880 --> 18:09.200
throw that out there, but in the meantime, I'm trying to get the largest collection on

18:09.200 --> 18:15.520
the Internet and one person's beaten me so far, but that'll be, uh, that'll be changed

18:15.520 --> 18:16.520
pretty soon.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.520
You shall see. We shall see about that.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.680
Yes, the official count right now, and this is all the stuff that's actually converted

18:20.680 --> 18:25.040
over in the sim and working right now, is 1,110.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.240
You're a sad, sad man.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.640
but i've got another two hundred the converted

18:29.640 --> 18:33.280
are the chairman's got a good point if a pirate song already in dvd are in the

18:33.280 --> 18:36.400
navy

18:36.400 --> 18:38.760
not really i think jack you know kind of pushing it

18:38.760 --> 18:42.360
seriously some of the i've actually have done a lot more of his music that's in

18:42.360 --> 18:43.820
their something

18:43.820 --> 18:46.800
i mean well so is all of the erotic sounds like literally i have a new

18:46.800 --> 18:50.520
erotic song that's just a copy of an older i saw that an older i saw the

18:50.520 --> 18:51.240
first

18:51.240 --> 18:54.540
couple album was called uh... sex on the phone which is pretty well-known erotic

18:54.540 --> 18:56.260
song outside of the art

18:56.260 --> 18:59.340
they have a new one of the latest album or no i don't think it was late on the

18:59.340 --> 19:00.540
one before it called

19:00.540 --> 19:01.700
tell me on the line

19:01.700 --> 19:03.260
same thing

19:03.260 --> 19:06.740
almost the exact same melody to feel as though i was but it's still like to see

19:06.740 --> 19:08.940
that uh... his uh...

19:08.940 --> 19:14.300
take or was it not take out the ballgame i've got one that's a school's out

19:14.300 --> 19:17.660
uh... which isn't that schools out for summer is is another one and i've also

19:17.660 --> 19:19.940
got one called secret agent man

19:19.940 --> 19:20.740
but it's not

19:20.740 --> 19:21.740
not uh...

19:21.740 --> 19:25.740
I was hoping it was. I was like, oh, that'd be sweet, but no.

19:25.740 --> 19:30.740
Unfortunately not. Bus Stop would probably get a remix of Secret Agent Man.

19:30.740 --> 19:33.740
Oh, very good point. Artist that sounds the same all the time.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.740
Three words. Or four words. Bye bye baby balloon.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.740
Artist that sounds the same all the time.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.740
Yeah. Yeah.

19:42.740 --> 19:45.740
Anyway. Let's go to the F you of the week.

19:45.740 --> 19:49.740
This is the big fuck you of the week that Jamie always likes to do when she's here.

19:49.740 --> 19:54.140
she's here but unfortunately she's not here this week so we have to fill in for

19:54.140 --> 19:57.380
her with our fuck yous of the week and I allowed the chat room to participate

19:57.380 --> 20:00.940
this week they sent me all their various fuck yous over private message and I

20:00.940 --> 20:03.380
haven't even opened them up to read them yet we're just gonna read them live on

20:03.380 --> 20:07.820
air and see see if they're stupid or what if they're valid F yous or if

20:07.820 --> 20:11.660
they're petty things or what have you but since Jamie's out this week we're

20:11.660 --> 20:16.340
gonna fill in for her with the F you the week I'll go ahead and start my fuck you

20:16.340 --> 20:22.940
the week is myself. I am a total lazy asshole because I promised that we would have a new

20:22.940 --> 20:27.940
intro for the show this week and, well, I got kind of lazy. Another stuff came up and

20:27.940 --> 20:33.500
yada, yada, yada. I didn't get that new intro done. So fuck me, I'm an asshole for not finishing

20:33.500 --> 20:37.980
that intro. Sorry. And also for not doing a damn thing on the webpage. That's my bad.

20:37.980 --> 20:43.860
I was hoping to get the webpage fixed up and all prettied and updated a lot because it's

20:43.860 --> 20:49.700
kind of out of date, but I didn't get around to that either, so I'm sorry, and a big fuck

20:49.700 --> 20:54.980
you to me for messing that up. Do you have a fuck you of the week, Matt? Well, I don't

20:54.980 --> 21:04.980
know, because this is in my music, obviously, so... Oh gee, that's better. Let me see. Yeah,

21:04.980 --> 21:11.020
FQ2 the... Now, granted, I love Qzart. I love the Entertainment Zone because it's Qzart

21:11.020 --> 21:17.300
is relatively close. Well, goddamn, they're lazy. I mean, seriously, they're very lazy.

21:17.300 --> 21:21.580
I have never... I used to work at Qsar, so I know how lazy you can be at that job. They

21:21.580 --> 21:25.780
were... Did you used to be the guy that would stand there and read out the rules? Yes, I

21:25.780 --> 21:30.100
was. Oh, I wanted your job so bad when I was out of school. Seriously, okay. Here's what,

21:30.100 --> 21:34.300
here's basically what the job consists of at Qsar. You sit on your ass in the office

21:34.300 --> 21:37.780
talking to the manager while someone's doing a brief. But when your brief comes up, you

21:37.780 --> 21:46.780
You go do the brief, and then you go help people get in the arena. Sit down, watch people play in the arena, make sure everyone gets out of the arena and go back and sit in the office. It's a lot of sitting, that's it.

21:46.780 --> 21:53.780
You don't go out there and arrest players? Oh, well you can, but what's the point? No one really cares anyways.

21:53.780 --> 22:02.780
But, yeah, because they wouldn't order me a pizza, so I had to walk around the corner and do the delicious pizza and go get pizza there. That sucked.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.780
So, big fuck you to Qsar?

22:04.780 --> 22:06.780
Uh, to the Qsar employees.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.780
Alright, fair enough.

22:08.780 --> 22:14.780
I've got a ton of chat room FUs to get to, so I gotta get to the FUs in the chat room.

22:14.780 --> 22:23.780
Uh, if you wanna join our chat room, just join any other side IRC server, like IRC.Akeheads.org, and join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

22:23.780 --> 22:30.780
And that's the same server that a lot of the big Bomani channels are on, like DDR Freak and 2DX Style, and all those are also on the same server.

22:30.780 --> 22:35.340
that same server. One more. Oh, yes, go on. Sure. And F you to Nickelodeon for canceling

22:35.340 --> 22:40.220
Invader Zim. Again? Well, it's actually gone for good now, I think. It was on this morning.

22:40.220 --> 22:45.460
Well, dammit. They keep changing the time around. F you to them for changing the time

22:45.460 --> 22:49.460
around all the time. I have a big, I have to stop the music, because bless you to TiVo.

22:49.460 --> 22:52.900
Because thanks to TiVo, I just, we just got a TiVo in the house. I can tell it to record

22:52.900 --> 22:56.840
Invader Zim every time it's on, and it will. No matter what time it's on, it'll find when

22:56.840 --> 23:01.040
Invader Zim's on and tape it for me. I love it. I'm sorry, you were saying?

23:01.040 --> 23:09.040
That's pretty much it. F you to them and F you to me for missing the whole thing of Trigger

23:09.040 --> 23:12.040
Happy TV because that shit is awesome. That's it.

23:12.040 --> 23:15.040
Alright. Do you have any F yous of the week, Bradley?

23:15.040 --> 23:17.040
I'll let you have Jamie's music.

23:17.040 --> 23:32.040
Okay, well, I don't know how bad things happen this week, but I think it will fuck you to teeny-buffers that hang around RBGL on our local arcade on Friday nights and sort it into Saturdays.

23:32.040 --> 23:37.040
Boy, we manage to give a big fuck you to them every week on the show, but they deserve it, so go right ahead.

23:37.040 --> 23:43.040
Yeah, they stand around looking stupid and get in the way and look at each other and everything.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.040
Do you hear that? All you ever do is get in the way, you damn kids!

23:46.040 --> 23:48.000
Get off our machine, go away.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.240
Did you notice that it's interesting that this week,

23:50.240 --> 23:52.440
finally, they added a little sign that says,

23:52.440 --> 23:55.280
put your token here if you want to play next.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.640
Because since they got rid of USA, finally,

23:57.640 --> 23:59.800
and they have the fourth plus, now the veterans

23:59.800 --> 24:01.040
are taking over both machines.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.280
So there's no newbie machine for people

24:03.280 --> 24:05.700
to stand in line for and not worry about tokens.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.700
Now you've got the token line on both machines.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.280
And some parents just don't understand

24:09.280 --> 24:10.840
the concept of the token line.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.400
So it had to be explained.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.080
They should have a bat for those type of people.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.980
I got a big orange bat out in the car.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.320
Seriously.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.140
All right, let's get on to the FUs of the week

24:20.140 --> 24:21.180
from the chat room.

24:21.180 --> 24:22.420
And I haven't even read these yet,

24:22.420 --> 24:23.940
so let's see what we've got.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.860
Let's see, Twen gives a big fuck you

24:28.860 --> 24:31.220
to the first mini-competition they had.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.580
Four players, two basic, one trick, one maniac.

24:33.580 --> 24:34.980
He was the maniac.

24:34.980 --> 24:35.980
He got a frigging cata,

24:35.980 --> 24:37.860
and the scoring was based off the triple-A score,

24:37.860 --> 24:39.320
so he got last.

24:40.460 --> 24:42.780
And they got Dynamite Rave hiring Mr. T,

24:42.780 --> 24:44.300
and his cata was Orion78,

24:44.300 --> 24:50.300
and he failed it, so he got one. So he basically got screwed in a tournament, so FU to that tournament the twin participated in.

24:50.300 --> 25:01.300
JB gives a big FU fuck you to the Saints Go Marching on 4th Plus, because he accidentally selected Maniac thinking it was trick somehow and failed it at the arcade.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.300
That's not the machine's fault, dummy.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.300
I have another FU after we're down here, too.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.300
Alright, go ahead with your FU.

25:05.300 --> 25:16.300
Okay, my FU goes to Country Club Plains in their fucking Max machine because it has a fucked up right arrow on the Player 1 side.

25:16.300 --> 25:19.300
So I was playing doubles and I kept failing. I was like, why the hell am I failing?

25:19.300 --> 25:26.300
You know what, I think one of RBGL's on Max 2 on the one player side, I think the left arrow is broken too.

25:26.300 --> 25:29.300
So you just can't win anywhere. Anyway, back to chat room.

25:29.300 --> 25:33.300
Joe Mama says, uh, big fuck you to school.

25:33.300 --> 25:37.300
Yeah, school's back in session. I hope you kids are enjoying it. Fuck you to school.

25:37.300 --> 25:41.300
And, uh, SoCalKicks says, uh,

25:41.300 --> 25:45.300
fuck you to life and its endless amount of questions because

25:45.300 --> 25:49.300
I'm not sure if I want to do CG anymore.

25:49.300 --> 25:53.300
I don't know what CG, I don't know if that means that's what he wanted to do when he got

25:53.300 --> 25:57.300
out of school or what have you. Well, that was kind of deep.

25:57.300 --> 26:00.300
The fuck you to life though.

26:00.300 --> 26:04.300
Dave says he's coming over to the show, that's not a fuck you.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.300
Don't send me those messages.

26:05.300 --> 26:15.300
Black Lab says fuck you to Neil, the CVGL tech guy for fucking up the fourth plus installation by not looking in the box for the flash card he needed.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.300
So you gotta look for all the parts.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.300
Oh, I'm being corrected.

26:18.300 --> 26:22.300
Okay, okay. Computer graphics animation you bastard.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.300
Sorry, Jesus.

26:24.300 --> 26:32.860
DCB says give a big fuck you to non-optical mouses, so he hates mouses with balls. He

26:32.860 --> 26:42.100
prefers the female mouses, little holes with beams of light shooting out of them. That's

26:42.100 --> 26:46.020
all the fuck yous of the week from this chat room. If you have any additional fuck yous,

26:46.020 --> 26:49.980
just send them to me real quick over a private message. I'm in our chat room at Channel Pound

26:49.980 --> 26:55.100
Orange Lounge over on IRC.eggheads.org.

26:55.100 --> 27:00.340
Chat room's liking that, the lights, beams.

27:00.340 --> 27:02.620
Little station updates to take care of.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.180
There are some little housekeeping issues I need to

27:05.180 --> 27:06.380
tell you guys about.

27:06.380 --> 27:08.700
As you know, we rebroadcast this show.

27:08.700 --> 27:11.820
The show we do tonight gets rebroadcast on Monday night at

27:11.820 --> 27:14.100
7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

27:14.100 --> 27:17.200
And then an old show, a classic show, is rebroadcast at

27:17.200 --> 27:18.620
9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

27:18.620 --> 27:22.940
And this week, it's going to be the show with the interviews from the Dallarmendy tournament,

27:22.940 --> 27:25.320
that Mountain Mike's tournament that was a few weeks ago.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.340
Those interviews are up in the old show rotation.

27:27.340 --> 27:29.460
That'll be at 9 o'clock on Monday.

27:29.460 --> 27:33.980
However, starting with this last week, we tested it this last week and it's a go.

27:33.980 --> 27:38.380
Starting, we're going to also rebroadcast on Thursdays at 2 o'clock Pacific Standard

27:38.380 --> 27:39.380
Time.

27:39.380 --> 27:43.360
And that's more for the benefit of people on the East Coast or just people overseas

27:43.360 --> 27:45.780
that want to try and catch the show at a different time.

27:45.780 --> 27:46.780
Or are we?

27:46.780 --> 27:50.020
Because we do 7 o'clock tonight, we do 7 o'clock on Mondays, so we'll take a five hours earlier

27:50.020 --> 27:51.020
on Thursdays.

27:51.020 --> 27:52.420
We can listen to it at work.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.900
You can listen to it at work.

27:53.900 --> 27:54.900
Exactly.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.340
You can thieve your line some more.

27:56.340 --> 27:57.980
That's mostly for the benefit for the East Coast people.

27:57.980 --> 28:01.600
I kind of tried to time it so it would come on right when they get home from school on

28:01.600 --> 28:03.260
Thursday.

28:03.260 --> 28:08.420
I'm being questioned on calling things a classic when it only happened three weeks ago for

28:08.420 --> 28:09.420
that show.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.800
Well, yeah okay.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.080
But every episode of Orange Lounge is a classic right?

28:13.080 --> 28:14.080
Right?

28:14.080 --> 28:15.080
Yeah.

28:15.080 --> 28:21.160
Anyway, actually we will probably start the rotation of old shows again either next week

28:21.160 --> 28:24.880
or the week after going all the way back to episode one so the old show rotation will

28:24.880 --> 28:27.760
be like a couple months behind.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.200
So it will really give you a chance to catch up at that point.

28:30.200 --> 28:35.260
We should do one day where we just play every show back to back.

28:35.260 --> 28:39.240
We are going to do the marathon, I just don't know when yet.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.880
Probably in the next couple weeks, like maybe weekend after next, something like that.

28:42.880 --> 28:46.680
it's gonna happen. I just gotta get the timing of it all worked out. But we will do back-to-back-to-back

28:46.680 --> 28:50.640
episodes, so if you... It's gonna be like MTV re-running

28:50.640 --> 28:54.440
Real World or Sorority Life. You can just catch everything that's happened in one day.

28:54.440 --> 28:58.200
You don't even have to listen every night, but we'd like it if you do.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.720
Speaking of which, have you seen the previews for Real World?

29:01.720 --> 29:05.520
Was it Las Vegas? No, I don't watch crap.

29:05.520 --> 29:10.120
Yeah. No, I'm just kidding. I used to watch the Real World, but I think the last one I

29:10.120 --> 29:11.000
watched was

29:11.000 --> 29:16.880
The one, it was Seattle, because you had the guy that bitch slapped the girl as she got

29:16.880 --> 29:17.880
in the car.

29:17.880 --> 29:18.880
That's the last real world I saw.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.400
Let me just put it this way, they're getting really desperate.

29:21.400 --> 29:26.360
I think every single person on there, their parents either died, got divorced, are druggies,

29:26.360 --> 29:30.720
are gay, one or the other, they're all like that, and they're all messed up, and they're

29:30.720 --> 29:33.040
all like horny and having sex with each other.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.040
Well that's ratings!

29:34.040 --> 29:39.080
That's it, but it's not real at all, it's just like, let's get this big bunch of dysfunctional

29:39.080 --> 29:46.080
people, throw them together in a little closet and hope that everything works out.

29:46.500 --> 29:53.160
The one show I have been watching is Big Brother 3. I don't know why. I somehow just get gravitated

29:53.160 --> 29:58.520
to this. You've got a lot of real fucked up people in that house too, but sometimes it's

29:58.520 --> 30:02.980
like you enjoy watching things get set on fire. You like when things go bad and horribly

30:02.980 --> 30:05.460
wrong on tv so

30:05.460 --> 30:07.320
is another big f you've heard

30:07.320 --> 30:10.820
you know the weekend actually for everything

30:10.820 --> 30:12.340
is that you

30:12.340 --> 30:17.260
is going to reality tv i hate reality tv is

30:17.260 --> 30:22.080
section

30:22.080 --> 30:25.640
except how is it an option because it's not really real it's not real at all it's

30:25.640 --> 30:27.300
like retarded i mean

30:27.300 --> 30:31.020
all these shows like okay survivor maybe that was an original idea all now

30:31.020 --> 30:33.420
Now everyone is trying to copy Survivor.

30:33.420 --> 30:35.700
I don't care what happens to these people.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.700
I hope they all die.

30:36.700 --> 30:41.400
I'm just waiting for Jetplane to come overhead and crash down into them.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.480
You don't want to go on one of these shows to win a million dollars?

30:44.480 --> 30:45.480
I'd go on the show.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.920
What do you think, what do you think if they really, now remember there's a rumor a couple

30:47.920 --> 30:51.520
months back, I don't know how, the truth behind it, but that they were going to do a game

30:51.520 --> 30:52.520
show out of DDR.

30:52.520 --> 30:56.520
What do you think about, a reality show based around, because you could consider a game

30:56.520 --> 31:01.000
show a reality show, a reality show based on DDR, what do you think?

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Yeah, that's about as good as the DDR movie.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
And while we're at it, let's have a DDR sitcom. It's a whole comedy set around DDR.

31:10.000 --> 31:18.000
I have to introduce Dave. Dave's in the house now, so big hello to Dave, who of course, five seconds into him getting here, he wants to say something, so let's...

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
Well, first I was going to say what happened during the show, because I wasn't here.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
And then...

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
It's not our fault.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Well, I was just, you know, like, five second recap, what happened?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
We talked about stuff.

31:31.000 --> 31:41.000
Let's see, Loki bitched about DDR Sims, Loki bitched about QZR, Loki bitched about reality TV shows, and...

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Sky bitched about Loki.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Yes, Sky bitched about Loki.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
That's about it.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
When did people start talking about themselves in the third person? When did that start happening?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
I don't know.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Okay.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Just now, it's the cool thing to do.

31:53.000 --> 32:00.000
Okay, well Dave was wondering, about this DDR reality show, how would that work?

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
It's like, go to Survivor, uh-oh, the challenge, unless you get knocked off, you have to full-combo this catastrophic harm.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I don't know what they would do.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
All I heard about you talking earlier was Paranoia, God Mix, or something.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Dance for immunity and throw people off the machines.

32:15.000 --> 32:24.000
I'm going to knock 20 Bamani freaks in the arcade in the middle of the night and, I don't know, throw things at them.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
Disney rave mad ownage stuff. Cool.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
Yes. Do you have any FUs of the week, Dave?

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
FU people who play Soul Calibur are against me because you're taking down my character.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.960
Oh, I played Soulcalibur II for the first time, for the first time yesterday, and I

32:45.960 --> 32:47.640
don't know how to play Soulcalibur at all.

32:47.640 --> 32:53.040
I just kind of butt-mash, and I started on the Conquest, and I beat everybody.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.040
I was so happy.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.360
I joined the green people, and I whooped on the red people, and the funny thing is, is

32:57.360 --> 33:01.400
that Will Slinky, if you're listening, we all picked his character to fight, because

33:01.400 --> 33:03.480
we wanted to pick on him, because we found him.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.920
Did you fight my character, because I was also in the red arm?

33:05.920 --> 33:06.920
I don't remember.

33:06.920 --> 33:07.920
I don't think so.

33:07.920 --> 33:11.680
a lot of noobs and then Will was last and both me and Glen kicked his ass so we had

33:11.680 --> 33:12.680
fun.

33:12.680 --> 33:13.680
Yeah.

33:13.680 --> 33:17.120
Conquest mode is the best because you fight people who are basically the same level so

33:17.120 --> 33:21.120
if you join in with a new character you'll basically fight all the easiest guys in that

33:21.120 --> 33:24.880
army but once you get the good people you'll start fighting people.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.880
Ah, I see.

33:25.880 --> 33:29.200
Well, I have to say, my Ivy, she rules.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.200
Ivy is the bomb.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.200
So.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.440
Isn't this a DDR show and we're here just talking about Soul Calibur?

33:33.440 --> 33:34.440
Oh well.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.500
I know a lot of the people that play DDR also and other games.

33:37.500 --> 33:41.500
you don't have to restrict yourself to just the music games

33:41.500 --> 33:44.340
i got to play more dance maniacs this weekend

33:44.340 --> 33:46.980
oh really how was that i love that game

33:46.980 --> 33:51.380
what is it about dancing actually enjoyed it's just it's i don't know it's

33:51.380 --> 33:54.980
you think there's a lot of possibility for freestyle and i did not realize

33:54.980 --> 33:56.900
because actually i watched uh...

33:56.900 --> 34:01.040
mister wendell and this other guy uh... doing freestyle in there and

34:01.040 --> 34:04.020
quite amazing it's just fun i don't know what it is

34:04.020 --> 34:07.820
It's like, why do people play popin' music?

34:07.820 --> 34:11.020
I think people play popin' music for the big, round buttons.

34:11.020 --> 34:12.300
Otherwise, they don't play DDS.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.300
Popin' music's pretty rad.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.780
It's just, I don't know.

34:15.780 --> 34:18.220
It's like, why are you drawn to play DDR for the first time?

34:18.220 --> 34:19.660
Ooh, big flashing lights.

34:19.660 --> 34:21.940
You go to play popin' music because, ooh, big buttons I

34:21.940 --> 34:22.380
can push.

34:22.380 --> 34:23.020
You know, I don't know.

34:23.020 --> 34:24.220
That's what I liked about it.

34:24.220 --> 34:26.420
Yeah, and about the maniacs.

34:26.420 --> 34:27.660
You have to hit, like, four at once.

34:27.660 --> 34:28.780
You have to hit them with your forearm.

34:28.780 --> 34:29.500
It's crazy.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.220
Yeah.

34:30.220 --> 34:32.780
OK, anyway, back to Dave's topic.

34:32.780 --> 34:37.780
About the Dance Maniacs, I really do not find that appealing at all.

34:37.780 --> 34:39.780
Well, gee, why not?

34:39.780 --> 34:45.780
It's like the Macarena mixed in with the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, or whatever it's called, and it's just moving your hands up.

34:45.780 --> 34:52.780
It's Para, except that you're restricted to two buttons at different height levels. And that's no fun.

34:52.780 --> 34:56.780
Para is, okay, not that good. DDR.

34:56.780 --> 34:58.780
Yeah, but they're different games.

34:58.780 --> 35:03.780
It's not trying to be Para Para, it's just trying to be Dance Maniacs.

35:03.780 --> 35:05.780
Yeah, and yeah.

35:05.780 --> 35:08.780
And it's okay to play Dance Maniacs with your feet.

35:08.780 --> 35:14.780
Yeah, I tried that and then I tried using my head and I hit it on the machine.

35:14.780 --> 35:15.780
And it was pointy.

35:15.780 --> 35:27.780
Actually it's pretty funny, they had a bunch of spots where you had to hit both undersides and this guy kept doing this thing where he'd grab the bar on the machine and actually do a hip thrust into the machine.

35:27.780 --> 35:28.780
the game.

35:28.780 --> 35:33.360
You just kind of have to just mount one of those little sensors that's sticking out like

35:33.360 --> 35:35.540
right on like a cowboy.

35:35.540 --> 35:41.780
But it worked, it looked like really funny but it worked so, you know, whatever.

35:41.780 --> 35:46.980
I'm getting some late submitted FUs of the week so let's have a look at them.

35:46.980 --> 35:49.540
I'm going to just drive this bit into the ground the other night.

35:49.540 --> 35:54.640
JB gives a big fuck you to regular DDR for not having the dance magic mode that Disney

35:54.640 --> 35:55.640
Mix has.

35:55.640 --> 36:01.640
Yeah, I mean, that's a given. Dance Magic's been needed in regular DVR for a long time.

36:01.640 --> 36:08.640
23rd Magus says, a big fuck you to ZTNet and whoever else sells the Boom PSX to USB converters.

36:08.640 --> 36:13.640
I got seriously fucking stiff out of 20 bucks, so fuck you to ZTNet.

36:13.640 --> 36:16.640
Everyone will remember that more later on.

36:16.640 --> 36:23.640
Yeah, well, let's talk about that. Talk about the USBs, because there's so many options here for going PlayStation to PC,

36:23.640 --> 36:26.840
PC, and I don't know shit about it, so you gotta help me here, Logy.

36:26.840 --> 36:30.940
Okay. Well, all these stupid converters that they have out there, they're meant for one thing,

36:30.940 --> 36:34.640
is making the actual PlayStation controllers work with the PC.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.240
Problem is, is that, you know, most people buy these

36:38.240 --> 36:42.140
to use with, like, DDR SIMs and that kind of stuff. They're not meant for that.

36:42.140 --> 36:45.240
I mean, the way DDR pads are set up, it's really funky, because,

36:45.240 --> 36:49.140
you know, they have them mapped as buttons. So basically, the problem is, is

36:49.140 --> 36:53.440
all these converters, they map the actual directional pad

36:53.440 --> 37:23.240
not as buttons, but as axes. So, what the problem is, is you can't push, like, up and down at the same time, like where there might be a jump, or you can't push left and right. It's just you can only push, you know, one direction at one time. So that's the problem. Most people buy these pads, and especially, you know, big FV2 fries for putting the kiki joists next to the DDR PC, because people think, oh, it's going to work with, you know, the DDR PC. Nope, not at all.

37:23.240 --> 37:28.240
And DCB wants to send a big fuck you to the Kiki Joys, by the way, because the software doesn't work on his computer.

37:28.240 --> 37:35.240
Yeah, that's another thing. I have two USB converters also that I bought a long time ago to try using with my SIM.

37:35.240 --> 37:40.240
I ended up having to buy a parallel one, and trust me, that was the best move I ever made.

37:40.240 --> 37:49.240
The parallel ones work great, and they work with the standard DirectPad Pro 5.0 or whatever, just the drivers that they have.

37:49.240 --> 37:54.740
that they have. Works great, you can remap the buttons to whatever, and it's awesome.

37:54.740 --> 38:00.540
So buy the parallel ones. They have, I forget what it's called, mine was like, it's compatible

38:00.540 --> 38:06.300
with like DualShock or something like that, and it was a two player parallel one, so just

38:06.300 --> 38:14.100
buy that one, it's like 20 bucks, it's the best way to go. Do not buy USB ones. USB controllers

38:14.100 --> 38:19.260
or converters do not work with the DDR pads. There might be one out there, but you're

38:19.260 --> 38:20.260
going to go through about...

38:20.260 --> 38:21.260
Not that you've found yet.

38:21.260 --> 38:24.140
Yeah, you're going to go through about 50 of them before you find, you know, one that

38:24.140 --> 38:28.660
actually works. So, just, you know, buy the parallel ones, save yourself some time. Now,

38:28.660 --> 38:33.580
if you're using them for, like, say, I don't know, BeatMania, you know, 2DX or something

38:33.580 --> 38:36.020
like that, they'll work fine for that, but just not DDR.

38:36.020 --> 38:41.100
All right. Speaking of things going over Dave's head, because he was sitting there going,

38:41.100 --> 38:44.860
this whole chat is going over my head because I don't play DDR on the PC, chat room wants

38:44.860 --> 38:49.060
to know how tall are you Dave? Because they're seeing you on the webcam right now. You didn't

38:49.060 --> 38:54.540
even know we had a webcam up right now, yes we got a webcam. How tall are you? Freakishly

38:54.540 --> 39:01.540
tall, I don't know, not that tall, 6'1". I'm taller, I'm 6'2". But I'm sitting down so

39:01.540 --> 39:06.940
they can't tell. So, last fuck yous of the week, okay, I've got a couple more, so these

39:06.940 --> 39:11.340
to the last Fuck You's of the Week. Black Lab says, Fuck you to sims that don't work

39:11.340 --> 39:15.580
on Macs. I think that's a very valid Fuck You of the Week, because Macs are being neglected,

39:15.580 --> 39:18.340
of course. You need to buy a real computer. I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

39:18.340 --> 39:20.180
Yeah, I was just going to say. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

39:20.180 --> 39:21.180
When you make a computer that...

39:21.180 --> 39:23.240
Macs are cool. Macs are great for art stuff. I like Macs.

39:23.240 --> 39:28.140
Yeah, they look like artsy computers that you'd find in an art gallery, because, let's

39:28.140 --> 39:32.660
see, one looked like a toaster, worked like a toaster, pretty much was a toaster, and

39:32.660 --> 39:36.040
now they have one that looks like a stupid little sphere with this thing sticking out

39:36.040 --> 39:41.400
of it. You've got to hand it to Max for coming up with these really freaky dines, like the

39:41.400 --> 39:48.520
clear speakers. That you can't upgrade. That's the thing that sucks about Max. Also, Gateway

39:48.520 --> 39:54.520
made this really retarded looking computer that's trying to copy the iPod. I mean, I

39:54.520 --> 39:59.100
hated Gateway to begin with, and this isn't really helping them. It just looks like crap.

39:59.100 --> 40:02.340
I think we're about to start a war in the chat. We're on Max versus PC. So let me get

40:02.340 --> 40:05.160
to the other F.U. of the week. Alright Dave, what do you want to say? I was just going

40:05.160 --> 40:10.480
say that George Foreman Grill looks exactly like the iMac. Like, if you put them next

40:10.480 --> 40:16.600
to each other, I thought that it was an iMac commercial. It's like, hamburger, hot dog.

40:16.600 --> 40:21.600
Did you try to cook a hot dog on an iPod? Well, it did look pretty appetizing, you know,

40:21.600 --> 40:26.980
to just like put a hot dog in between the keys of the iMac. But, you know, they look

40:26.980 --> 40:31.300
exactly like, and they both have the same transparent colors as well. But they do have...

40:31.300 --> 40:35.600
your hot dogs off the keyboard! They do have, seriously though, for the G4, they really

40:35.600 --> 40:40.800
have this kick-ass monitor for it. They have this, like, high-definition 24-inch monitor

40:40.800 --> 40:48.160
out there for the Max and those kick-ass. But other than that, yeah. Yeah. Uh, fuck

40:48.160 --> 40:54.360
you from Takeout Kid to UCB for not getting DDR Max 2 and making the current 5th Mix a

40:54.360 --> 41:00.640
dollar. Wow. Well, at one point, the Metreon was charging $2 a game for 5th Mix, I believe,

41:00.640 --> 41:05.640
Yeah, it's two dollars a game for fifth mix, so that means four dollars for doubles.

41:05.640 --> 41:14.640
Yeah, I remember when the Metreon charged like a buck fifty or two dollars for like first mix or one point five or something ridiculous.

41:14.640 --> 41:18.960
ridiculous. Then you go right into the other room and they have the same thing for like

41:18.960 --> 41:22.240
a quarter or fifty cents less if you do it.

41:22.240 --> 41:28.640
Anywho, no more fuck yous of the week. You've got to save them until next week now. JB has

41:28.640 --> 41:34.240
got a question for you, Loki. He wants to know if you know anything about DSE, the DDR

41:34.240 --> 41:35.680
Sequence Editor, and what it is.

41:35.680 --> 41:41.580
Yeah, the DDR Sequence Editor is an old editing, or it's an edit making program that's pretty

41:41.580 --> 41:47.900
old it's like compatible you know fifth mix down it doesn't do free zeros or

41:47.900 --> 41:52.220
anything like that it's pretty good it works on like older PCs and stuff if

41:52.220 --> 41:58.100
you're actually going to use an actual editor for you know making edits on your

41:58.100 --> 42:06.140
PC for DDR I'd recommend the was it's called DDR edit max 300 and it's

42:06.140 --> 42:09.700
actually pretty cool it supports free zeros and everything like that the only

42:09.700 --> 42:13.460
the problem is it doesn't really, some of the edits that are made with it aren't really

42:13.460 --> 42:16.340
compatible, you have to go in and hex edit something so you kind of have to know what

42:16.340 --> 42:17.340
you're doing.

42:17.340 --> 42:18.340
Okay.

42:18.340 --> 42:21.580
But it's, you know, I've never used it yet because it's the only thing that will run

42:21.580 --> 42:22.580
on my...

42:22.580 --> 42:23.580
Quit breaking things!

42:23.580 --> 42:24.580
What are you doing?

42:24.580 --> 42:26.700
What the hell are you doing?

42:26.700 --> 42:28.620
Dave's playing with a webcam, just ignore Dave.

42:28.620 --> 42:32.420
Stop making animals in compromising positions here.

42:32.420 --> 42:33.420
Anyway.

42:33.420 --> 42:37.980
So yeah, it's good for if you have an older computer like my crappy ass laptop that I

42:37.980 --> 42:44.980
use for editing DDR songs at the arcade I go to, how sad is that, and so yeah, it's

42:44.980 --> 42:49.660
the only thing that'll work, so give it a try, but you know, they're all Japanese, that's

42:49.660 --> 42:51.780
hard to say.

42:51.780 --> 42:55.780
Another question, what do you know about this new simulator, looks like it's coming out,

42:55.780 --> 42:57.980
called Feet of Fury, you know anything about this at all?

42:57.980 --> 42:59.380
This is the first I've heard of it.

42:59.380 --> 43:00.380
Oh really?

43:00.380 --> 43:02.820
Alright, well let's go to a break, we'll let you read up on this page, see what you think

43:02.820 --> 43:06.580
of it, we'll go to a break here real fast, and we'll come back.

43:06.580 --> 43:09.940
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and thanks for

43:09.940 --> 43:13.400
tuning in, and we will be right back.

44:39.940 --> 44:42.940
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the music of our show.

45:12.940 --> 45:16.940
Can you hear the cheering?

45:28.940 --> 45:30.940
Super performance!

45:30.940 --> 45:40.940
Nice!

45:40.940 --> 45:50.940
Perfect!

45:50.940 --> 46:18.820
Your dance showed us a dream for the future.

46:18.820 --> 46:20.820
Tomorrow is another day.

46:20.820 --> 46:27.820
You're the one who'll give us hope for the future!

48:20.820 --> 48:26.700
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

48:26.700 --> 48:33.860
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica, Saturdays, 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.

48:33.860 --> 48:40.860
of civic standard time at understudationlive.org

50:33.860 --> 50:47.300
And now it's time for Erotic Op Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

50:47.300 --> 50:50.260
favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

50:50.260 --> 50:53.260
Do it all night, do it with me.

50:53.260 --> 50:58.580
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible, do you take vocal lessons, kill your teacher!

50:58.580 --> 50:59.860
In the heat of the night.

50:59.860 --> 51:03.260
Oh god, I think my ears are bleeding.

51:03.260 --> 51:04.480
I liked it.

51:04.480 --> 51:07.300
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next!

51:07.300 --> 51:08.300
Ummm...

51:08.300 --> 51:12.420
That was cool.

51:12.420 --> 51:19.420
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic. Next!

51:21.860 --> 51:22.480
Yes!

51:22.480 --> 51:23.380
Yes, that's it!

51:23.380 --> 51:25.300
We have a winner!

51:25.300 --> 51:30.880
A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:30.880 --> 51:36.400
yes the star is born here on orange lounge radio

51:36.400 --> 51:39.560
they've told me i couldn't come back saying that as i always say it

51:39.560 --> 51:42.440
uh... i figured though that's really the last time i'm going to be able to use

51:42.440 --> 51:44.940
that i'm gonna have to take that out of rotation now because

51:44.940 --> 51:46.840
american idols over it's done with

51:46.840 --> 51:48.720
so the parity it doesn't work

51:48.720 --> 51:51.120
people are going to forget about american aisle next week

51:51.120 --> 51:52.200
that chick who won

51:52.200 --> 51:54.680
people i get a care come next week

51:54.680 --> 51:56.400
care now

51:56.400 --> 51:58.520
leading care them

51:58.520 --> 52:02.020
farewell to that little promo baby suggested i do something for the new

52:02.020 --> 52:03.700
survivor that's debuting

52:03.700 --> 52:05.160
do some kind of uh...

52:05.160 --> 52:07.720
orange lounge survivor i have no idea how that works

52:07.720 --> 52:10.620
they back in advertise like a big twist

52:10.620 --> 52:13.240
who coming up a big new intro and then like

52:13.240 --> 52:15.420
not do it like i did this week well

52:15.420 --> 52:19.200
i was going to mention since does no sanchar and someone was listening to a

52:19.200 --> 52:20.760
remix of what the move

52:20.760 --> 52:24.880
yes which kai jar memory i remember reading something back on the dvd

52:24.880 --> 52:26.400
armaniac sports

52:26.400 --> 52:28.120
about eight actual

52:28.120 --> 52:33.800
good version of let them move. Not possible, I say. I know, I know, I have my doubts too,

52:33.800 --> 52:40.660
but they said it was the training song in Beatmania 3, and it was sung by a guy, not

52:40.660 --> 52:46.260
some crazy ass chick that can't sing. Let them move! So I challenge people out there

52:46.260 --> 52:50.900
to find the damn MP3 for that so we can listen to it and see if it's actually good or if

52:50.900 --> 52:55.340
it just sucks or if it doesn't exist. Well, I think that you could make a good one if

52:55.340 --> 52:57.760
You made an instrumental remix of it.

52:57.760 --> 53:00.820
You know, you took out the...

53:00.820 --> 53:02.820
and then you took out the music

53:02.820 --> 53:04.400
and then you put in new music.

53:04.400 --> 53:08.660
You know what they need to do is because a lot of times they'll take the old

53:08.660 --> 53:11.980
I don't know, they'll take the Japanese songs, you know, sung by B4U

53:11.980 --> 53:16.540
and they'll convert them into English. Well, let's just have them sing that in, you know, Japanese.

53:16.540 --> 53:18.140
Or crash.

53:18.140 --> 53:21.260
Which is a breakdown, basically.

53:21.260 --> 53:25.420
well that's which is being requested in the chat room during the break and uh...

53:25.420 --> 53:27.180
no

53:27.180 --> 53:28.780
i don't like crash personally

53:28.780 --> 53:32.060
so i'm gonna take it out of everybody uh...

53:32.060 --> 53:33.460
maybe we'll see

53:33.460 --> 53:35.180
if i get like money

53:35.180 --> 53:40.100
or other kinds of favors and baes and pleading maybe we'll play it

53:40.100 --> 53:45.140
or not but i thought about you haha

53:45.140 --> 53:47.300
uh... what else we want to talk about

53:47.300 --> 53:49.240
uh... here is that sam

53:49.240 --> 53:52.680
uh... that we saw the other one we're looking at during the break and i

53:52.680 --> 53:54.840
actually took it off the screen let me go back

53:54.840 --> 53:59.140
it looks like somebody is developing something for dreamcast

53:59.140 --> 54:01.700
and it's going to be a tdr simulator there

54:01.700 --> 54:04.340
it sounds like they're being kind of careful not to call it like tdr but

54:04.340 --> 54:05.120
they're saying it's

54:05.120 --> 54:11.400
in the same being this tdr it's called feet of fury

54:11.400 --> 54:14.720
you know theory special

54:14.720 --> 54:21.720
Well, it's like, I don't know, it's sort of like, it looks like it's just all game's magic mode, that's pretty much what it is.

54:21.720 --> 54:32.720
Hmm, I don't know, let's see, they're saying, I'm looking at their website, and if you're in our chatroom right now, our website address was posted, and maybe Twen will post it again for you, if you want to see this page.

54:32.720 --> 54:38.720
It looks like DDR is going to be on the Dreamcast, basically, but it's more of a competitive

54:38.720 --> 54:39.720
thing.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.720
They're saying you want something a little more interesting or challenging and it doesn't

54:42.720 --> 54:45.280
require yet still more speed.

54:45.280 --> 54:50.480
So they've spent over a year building tools and developing what will give you a step in

54:50.480 --> 54:52.760
the right direction for beat games.

54:52.760 --> 54:56.800
And it's going to have a little bit of 3D.

54:56.800 --> 54:58.200
You can use a standard controller.

54:58.200 --> 55:00.520
You can use a DDR dance mat.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.400
They've got 12 songs in it.

55:02.400 --> 55:06.500
That looks like a demo of what's going on.

55:06.500 --> 55:10.900
Some musicians, I'm trying to see what kind of, they're saying it's going to be a little

55:10.900 --> 55:11.900
more competitive.

55:11.900 --> 55:14.380
I can't find any more information about that.

55:14.380 --> 55:18.260
Anyways, they're expecting a beta release of it's going to be this October, October

55:18.260 --> 55:22.980
1st, and then the expected final release is going to be January 1st of next year.

55:22.980 --> 55:24.780
So, looking forward to that.

55:24.780 --> 55:25.780
Cool.

55:25.780 --> 55:26.780
Well, that'll be interesting.

55:26.780 --> 55:28.460
We'll review that as soon as there's a release, so.

55:28.460 --> 55:31.820
And if anybody from that group is listening and wants to give us a sneak advance copy,

55:31.820 --> 55:35.220
hey, I don't say no to that stuff either.

55:35.220 --> 55:36.540
Right.

55:36.540 --> 55:37.740
Okay.

55:37.740 --> 55:40.460
Oh, big story since we're...

55:40.460 --> 55:44.980
It's been two weeks since we've been here in the studio, quote unquote, because last

55:44.980 --> 55:48.180
week, as you know, we taped an advance at Roseville Golf Land.

55:48.180 --> 55:50.260
A lot of mixed reaction to that show.

55:50.260 --> 55:54.140
Some people really liked it, some people thought it was ass, but what can you do, you know?

55:54.140 --> 55:55.140
I wasn't there.

55:55.140 --> 55:56.140
I was listening.

55:56.140 --> 55:59.520
I thought it was the one part was cool where you were like, yeah,

55:59.520 --> 56:02.600
we're from that school and doing an interview. Yeah.

56:02.600 --> 56:06.480
And then the rest of it was kind of boring except for like brag on,

56:07.720 --> 56:10.240
you know, that stuff. But it was okay. It wasn't that great.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.760
Well, thank you for that honest opinion Cisco. I appreciate it.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.600
Like Ebert Cisco. Maybe you're too young for that. I don't know.

56:18.160 --> 56:22.680
He died a while ago. No, the fat one didn't die. A fat one still alive.

56:22.680 --> 56:27.000
The fat one ate him, dammit.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.240
Uh, we were actually secretly hoping we would get kicked out of Golf Land, because it would have been great radio.

56:31.240 --> 56:35.680
You know, like, oh shit, what do we do now? We'll hitchhike our way over to...

56:35.680 --> 56:39.480
Well, we wouldn't have to hitchhike to Brookfield's. We'd walk over there, hitchhike our way over to a nearby volcano.

56:39.480 --> 56:47.680
Now broadcasting at the volcano on hole three.

56:47.680 --> 56:49.160
Oh, shit. Alright.

56:49.160 --> 56:52.520
But while we were gone, this big new story came out.

56:52.520 --> 56:55.260
And I'm sure everybody's heard of it by now, but we want to

56:55.260 --> 56:57.040
talk about it anyway, because we like to be

56:57.040 --> 56:59.440
repetitive on the show.

56:59.440 --> 57:04.680
Greece, the Isle of Greece banned electronic games,

57:04.680 --> 57:10.400
period, meaning no DDR, no Game Boys, no Nintendos, no

57:10.400 --> 57:15.120
arcade games, no Solitaire on your computer with Windows.

57:15.120 --> 57:16.040
Why?

57:16.040 --> 57:20.040
because they want to prevent gambling

57:20.040 --> 57:21.520
what do you think of this

57:21.520 --> 57:23.160
i think it's retarded

57:23.160 --> 57:26.540
i bet you two bucks that it won't last ten days

57:26.540 --> 57:28.320
i think it's been ten days hasn't it

57:28.320 --> 57:30.800
yeah

57:30.800 --> 57:32.800
i just gambled so

57:32.800 --> 57:34.240
wherever you are

57:34.240 --> 57:35.940
you are losing

57:35.940 --> 57:38.980
i'm gambling over whether or not it works or not

57:38.980 --> 57:40.120
and that

57:40.120 --> 57:43.000
revokes the point of

57:43.000 --> 57:44.640
gosh said i didn't

57:44.640 --> 57:48.000
and being corrected it wasn't just the gambling it was the violence

57:48.000 --> 57:49.720
in games to be as you know

57:49.720 --> 57:54.040
solitaire and minesweeper can be a bloody fucking battle when you lose

57:54.040 --> 57:58.560
did minesweeper i mean the bombs they want to keep that away from the kids

57:58.560 --> 57:59.280
yet

57:59.280 --> 58:00.240
flag

58:00.240 --> 58:03.040
to get it wrong

58:03.040 --> 58:05.480
and they're just bitter over the olympics

58:05.480 --> 58:08.720
uh... also for those who don't know

58:08.720 --> 58:10.400
i don't know they're just bitter

58:10.400 --> 58:11.400
that they didn't get to host the-

58:11.400 --> 58:16.880
Freakin' crazy Greeks and their damn mythology and their gods and stuff. Where's their gods

58:16.880 --> 58:21.600
of irony and gods of stupidity? They must be working full swing now.

58:21.600 --> 58:25.440
You can address those cards and letters to Loki in care of Orange Flown's radio.

58:25.440 --> 58:33.160
I'm sorry, Rob. I've probably heard all of our listeners listening from Greece.

58:33.160 --> 58:36.200
Actually, I believe we do have listeners from Greece. I'm going to have to check the statistics

58:36.200 --> 58:37.880
really fast. Let's go check the stats.

58:37.880 --> 58:41.820
of some interesting things though about the stats which surprised me

58:41.820 --> 58:45.200
canada's no longer the number two country listening to this program you

58:45.200 --> 58:46.400
know it is

58:46.400 --> 58:47.160
japan

58:47.160 --> 58:50.280
you know what's third

58:50.280 --> 58:51.440
green

58:51.440 --> 58:55.800
they agree to know that yeah we invite the greek to live vicariously through us

58:55.800 --> 58:58.920
if you've had your video games robbed from you hey we'll tell you about what

58:58.920 --> 59:00.040
you're missing out on

59:00.040 --> 59:01.920
no way i'm i'm just

59:01.920 --> 59:04.480
uh... no i i have my i think is right now

59:04.480 --> 59:06.280
wait

59:06.280 --> 59:08.280
Wait, how many people are listening?

59:08.280 --> 59:09.280
Enough.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.280
It's like, yeah, we got the number.

59:11.280 --> 59:14.280
It's like coming in second place with two listeners

59:14.280 --> 59:18.280
is Japan, and then tied for third is Canada, Korea, and the U.S.

59:18.280 --> 59:19.280
No, no.

59:19.280 --> 59:20.280
It's more than that.

59:20.280 --> 59:23.280
We will be the new underground movement for computer games

59:23.280 --> 59:25.280
and track track games.

59:25.280 --> 59:27.280
Oh my god.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.280
We will overcome.

59:29.280 --> 59:31.280
We shall overcome.

59:31.280 --> 59:33.280
See, this is what happens when you play

59:33.280 --> 59:34.280
too much 2DX like Bradley.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.280
Good job, Grace.

59:35.280 --> 59:38.840
Greece, you stopped it at the root.

59:38.840 --> 59:40.400
I'm looking for Greece.

59:40.400 --> 59:43.680
No, nobody has listened to this show from Greece, unfortunately.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.240
Hey, what's that there?

59:45.240 --> 59:47.360
I see one stream from Greece.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.480
The very, very bottom, Greece.

59:49.480 --> 59:50.560
The very bottom.

59:50.560 --> 59:55.840
One stream connected from Greece, not even for a full minute.

59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.400
So that's somebody who connected and listened to that, you're listening to Orange Lounge

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.000
Radio, and then just like disconnected right there.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.800
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.280
haha greases have electronic games

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.940
no i think i think they got that far and then like a little underground gestapo

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.700
grecian people came in and was like

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.940
what are you doing you can't be listening to something from out of

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:17.780
the country

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.780
and then they break it

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.940
i wonder if this show it would be illegal in greece

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:25.880
maybe you know especially we're like uh...

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.500
freaking out propaganda over there you know

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.100
and this is a weird thing it applies to tourists too so if you're going to go to greece

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.920
take your game boy gazelle for your ass in jail they don't care if you're stupid

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.600
american or what

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.760
i think that they just take the gameboy and then they've got like a secret ball

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.800
of all these game boys and stuff is that like the landfills of the three twenty

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.640
six hundred games like all the old copies of e t that no one bought this

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.520
little until somewhere no i don't i don't think it'd be like a landfill they

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.280
keep in mind

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.840
you know i don't know if it's a president of the king of greece or you

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.560
know and for the king of greece whatever the god of three years

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.360
because it was our or fertile mississippi

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.080
well i i think it's it's not triple up

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.600
what but i get

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.040
looks at the great

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.400
okay so anyway

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.400
john for all of the classes

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.320
is uh...

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.520
secretly made up this whole rule got a secret greeting to stop

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.040
going around taking all the games

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.480
just so he can play them

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.200
and then he makes a secret

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.240
black market

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.400
video sorry

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.820
uh... messing with uh...

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.660
Bradley's 2DX controller. He's taking out his aggressions on the Greek

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.900
on Bradley's controller, and Bradley doesn't like that.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:36.460
Bradley, he's normally the quiet type, but then sometimes he does his little evil takeover

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:43.460
the world type C-Lab 2021 type thing. No, and anyway, back to my story on the Grecian

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:49.780
underworld takeover. And so after they steal all of the games from

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.780
everyone else

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.620
they'll make a secret black market

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.260
john travolta will be able to play all the games that why do you think it's a

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.500
good dancing

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.380
i mean he can do all those little special hip thrust move things like you

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.940
are on crack

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:07.580
now i'm being told i'm being told if we were to like gamble on this show

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.180
that it would be illegal in greece

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.440
so

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.160
i'd bet you a dollar low-key i bet you one dollar

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.780
that we're not going to get any higher than that we are now legal

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.980
that greece will forever be the last place country on our list what do you

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.620
say

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:26.260
take me up on that that will anybody tell them about uh... yes

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.820
yes building up on that okay therefore now we are gambling on the show and the

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.740
show is now a legal increase so if you're listening

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:36.640
the cops are coming for you lock the doors lock the windows

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.700
do they have doors windows agrees

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.620
i don't know of course it if you don't have video games that side

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.540
primitive cavemen without their video games haha

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:51.460
yes limited crappy olympics

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.940
who that's what the sound like i don't know

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:57.860
as i get every snobby british people

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:02.220
wait wait what's what's great and great

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:04.980
i said i'd like an hour

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.260
let's see okay

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.860
here's my nephews for the week here uh... we've got uh... f you degrees

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:16.860
FU to Denmark, FU to Belgium, Taiwan, Yugoslavia, Germany, Pakistan, Netherlands

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:21.420
Taiwan gets an excuse, because if you ever looked at a lot of the games you buy, they were made in Taiwan

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.820
so they don't have time to listen to the show, because they're all in slave labor making these games

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:28.820
Oh, and special FU to Yugoslavia for beating the USA team

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.500
No, the Taiwanese are in slave labor copying the games from Japan

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:39.500
Wow, look, I can't believe it, Sweden is actually up there

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:51.500
Wait, okay. I bet people that they can't guess what the number, wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven ranked is.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.500
Like, I know.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:58.500
Yeah, because you're looking at the thing, of course you know, Rob. Anyway, since you can't see it, it's Venezuela.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:05.500
People in Venezuela listening to us talking about DDR and I find that good.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.500
DDRs that hit worldwide, what can you say? It's a big thing.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.500
New Mexico, right above Venezuela. Somebody want to know where Mexico ranks?

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:17.500
The French. The French you're listing. The French? Now, didn't we make fun of the French a few shows back?

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.500
I seem to remember somebody went off on the French. It was probably a Brad thing.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.500
I know I remember on our boards, I blame the French for the whole

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.500
getting rid of the games in Greece. There was no

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.500
correlation, but I blame the French. I think that was it.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:38.380
I don't think that there was any public slander of the French on this radio.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.380
Well, maybe we need some.

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.380
You know what?

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:45.260
I think that the French, personally, I really like French people.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:50.420
They make good food, and they've got one of those chefs that are on the Iron Chef, along

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.900
with other countries that I don't see.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:05:00.420
Yes, we have every country that has an Iron Chef guy listening to this show.

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.620
I bet the stats are going off.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:07.620
Alright, I'd like to give a shout-out to Salman Laden for listening to us from Pakistan.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.620
So, uh, way to go.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:10.620
Keep up the good work.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.620
Yeah!

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.620
Yeah!

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.620
Okay.

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:17.180
Address those cards and letters once again to Loki because of views and opinions, views

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.100
based on this show, blah blah blah.

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.620
Now let's look at cities in the US.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:26.200
Obviously, Sacramento ranked number one, no surprise, because we're all in Sacramento,

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.140
we all listen to this station, you know, they all come started here.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.540
You know, I knew AOL was big, but I never knew that they were their own city.

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.540
Well, that's the weird thing is that AOL all goes through one thing, so they show up as

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.700
one city on here.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.620
Anybody that's on AOL has their own city.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.980
Look at this, San Francisco followed by Columbus, Ohio.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.460
We've got fans in Columbus.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.460
Word.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:49.940
Well, I did a big shout out to us on the DDR East Coast Invasion boards and everything.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.460
Let's see who's in last place.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:55.180
Let's see who's in the last place and who we need to rough up some people.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.860
You want to guess what city is in last place?

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.140
Wait, is this just National City?

01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.980
This is just the US.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:00.980
Just the US.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:04.200
Now remember, this doesn't just count the live show, this is also the Bahmani Music

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200
& More program.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200
Bismarck, North Dakota.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200
North Dakota.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200
You're saying Bismarck, North Dakota.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200
Bismarck.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.200
Here we go.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200
Come on, Bismarck.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.200
Come on, Bismarck.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.200
It is Des Moines.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200
No!

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200
It was close!

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.200
Damn it!

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200
Des Moines is in last place.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200
Followed by Bakersfield.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.600
Where the hell is that?

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600
They have computers there.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.880
Bakersfield's like, kind of by, like, it's a little poo town, right?

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880
Between...

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.880
Is that like...

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.880
Cool?

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.880
Yes.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.880
Sort of.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.880
It's between here and LA, really.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.880
Great, fine, if I'm not mistaken.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.880
Wait, what's the... hold on, scroll back up here for a second.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880
No, don't scroll.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.880
Oh, yeah, that causes dropouts, but yeah.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.880
Okay, sorry.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.880
That's alright.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.880
I'm causing dropouts.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880
Look out.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.880
And then Denver counts for one city for like six different states.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880
That's pretty cool.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.880
They've got like Denver, Colorado, M.T., I don't know what that is.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.880
Montana.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.880
Nebraska, Nevada.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.880
Well, that's because theoretically anybody right on the borders could be connecting through

01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880
a hub in Denver, so that would count.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.880
That would count.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.880
This is getting really boring.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.760
We need to go back to talking about Bomani.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.240
Let's check Sky's private messages in the chat room.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.960
This show sucks.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.240
Oh, gee, thank you.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.480
They want to have the webcam at a better angle.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.440
If you would mind adjusting that, that would be nice.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440
Let's see what else I have.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.440
Dave, do not touch the webcam.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.200
Dave, you're not allowed to touch the webcam.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.160
Dave, you are the weakest webcam.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.160
Goodbye.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.160
Dave.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.160
Dave.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.160
Dave Dave

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.800
Put it down no 2dx for you what the hell you're putting it like the way up

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.400
There Dave making a microphone busy on our webcam

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.420
And if you want to know where the webcams located you have to be in our chat room at IRC

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.940
Eggheads org just join channel pound orange

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.320
Yes, that's why I do on this show

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.720
Okay, now we are going to talk about

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.720
about what Rob wants to talk about.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:00.880
Yes. What I also have on the list. Okay, let's talk about this. Konami very soon is supposed

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:07.600
to be announcing some kind of online Bahmani game. Don't know what it's going to be, but

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.780
it's going to be an online music, actually I shouldn't say it's Bahmani, but if it's

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:14.040
Konami and if it's a music game, it's probably going to be Bahmani, but it's going to be

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:19.200
some kind of music game that's going to be playable online. What do you guys think it's

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.320
going to be?

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.800
We talked about this once before, I'm not sure if it was on the air or not, but I think

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:30.000
that we basically all thought that it would be something around frequency or something

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000
like that with different players doing different instruments or combining to form a song or

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.480
something of that sort, I don't know.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.280
So it's basically a rip-off of frequency, you think?

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.840
It's Marshall Beat Online.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.600
partial b on like

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.640
the new marshall be is so awesome because it's got can't touch this and

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.080
that you can't touch this in marshall d

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.880
you need to explain to me what what marshall beat is

01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.040
uh... marshall beat is what like para para except it's karate okay right i

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.320
don't know how to explain it basically what it is is you've got like the

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.720
sensors that are on your hands and on your feet they've got another sensor

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.760
kind of pretty much like uh...

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.480
uh... mambo gogo or uh... whatever

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480
some

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480
bowl

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480
whatever that is

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.480
punchmania

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.480
samba de amigo

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.480
or whatever like that

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.480
where it's got the sensors

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480
and it can kinda

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.480
you know

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480
that kind of thing

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.480
so anyways

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.480
you're on there

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.480
and they'll ask you to like

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.480
to punch up

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.480
punch down

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:27.480
kick

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.480
do whatever

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.480
and you have to mimic stuff

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.480
they also have a mode where you can fight

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.480
like people and stuff

01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.480
and all at the same time

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.480
they have really crappy music

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480
in the background

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.480
I mean

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.480
not to say that

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.480
you know

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480
you can't touch this isn't bad

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480
but

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480
I mean

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.240
men and petite love? I mean, that doesn't just sound like the action fighting music

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.520
that you would normally expect. Wait, do they actually have, are you serious, they actually

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:56.280
do have petite love? Jackie Chan stars in. Petite love! Oh my god, that's really bad.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:01.560
Childie on cutie chaser. It's raining men. Cutie chaser isn't there? That's pitiful.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:08.920
I mean, do you punch to the music? Does it go like on beat punching? Er, okay, it does.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:16.920
It's like Tybo, except that you pay by the minute instead of by the tape.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.760
Alright, someone finds me a place where I can get this.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.840
I will purchase this so that we can have it here.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.840
That would be the coolest thing ever.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.840
I would play that all day.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.840
All day.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.840
So if we can find where we can get this, I'll get it.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.840
Just because.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:43.840
Okay, it's now DaveTV. All Dave, all the time.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.840
Any other ideas what they could do for an online game? Maybe guitar freaks? Drummania

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.840
type thing? What do you think about that?

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.840
We need to add some more instruments to that, I think.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.840
Like keyboard mania? Maybe bring that back?

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.840
Keyboard mania, drummania, let's get like...

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.840
Singing mania, karaoke mania.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:09.000
I've discussed the karaoke thing before, but it's impossible to tell how you're singing.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.840
You can sync up noises to tell how much it is, but it's not like you can get a better

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.840
singing voice.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.600
You can get more in tune and hit the right notes, but it's not like you have to hit with

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.640
a certain amount of pressure or something.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.800
It's like, okay, fat people can't play because you have to hit one gram of pressure.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.120
konami presents american idol online

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.280
oh my god bring back the demo

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.280
well no no no no or whatever it's called living a pretty funny that she's uh...

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.280
they have it as

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.160
part of monster rancher three the playstations you

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.680
you can actually capture your face and put it on the monster

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.000
we have that the far right now i get you know we have a lot of three

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.200
as well as that's where i thought uh... you can actually capture your face and

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.040
put it on it

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.840
i think you can capture faces become dancers

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.000
there in the

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.200
I think that you should capture a face and stick it on the crotch part of the dancer.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.220
You know, just have like...

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:05.880
I can just see Rob's smiling face right over Rage's like...

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.880
I don't know, didn't we... I forget what we said about him like a few shows ago.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.140
As Emmy's third tit.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:13.360
That would be cool too. Pantsless Rage.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.440
You know, that might have been funny if I was in junior high.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.600
We can have you like...

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:24.600
the pantsless rage thing that we were talking about like three weeks ago. Okay! And then like censor it out with Rob's smiling head.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.800
Whee!

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:39.800
I'm being told in the chatroom that they are making an American Idol game.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.680
Help Justin save the world from his big hair.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.960
I don't know what the hell would an American Idol game be.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.240
What are you doing in an American Idol game?

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.800
How about like, press a button if you want Simon to use this bitch out.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.760
Press a button if you want Simon to use this.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:10.200
I challenge you guys to make an American Idol sound basically, a promo would be good too,

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.960
but I was thinking more along the lines of a sound theme for a DWI or something like

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:42.760
I think we're going to go ahead and take another break, and when we come back, you want to

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.760
do a list list?

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:49.680
what do you guys think there's only four of us now the one topic I was thinking

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.600
of we could do is a song we'd like to see a decent freestyle done to okay I

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.280
don't know I don't what it what else you guys you guys have any ideas for time

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.200
let's put the topics to the chat room was the chat room want us to decide

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:06.080
tonight on listless I'm gonna put the question out to them so we'll see as

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.680
soon as they respond to that no ideas from the peanut gallery here well I got

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.280
We gotta wait because we have to do our listless thing during the break.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.680
Oh, people are sending them over private message. Let's see.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.480
Oh, they're sending me a request for songs. They're not sending me.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.680
Songs you would like to hear are Marshall Beatz.

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:27.480
No, I'm surprised. It's Coming From Fighting wasn't on that.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.980
That's the best Jogas song.

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.980
I think there's only like four songs to pick from, dummy.

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:36.180
Like Damn Dare Ram, the remix of Damn Dare Ram,

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.880
KCP remix, or another one.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.880
Damn Dari M. You say it like my dad would. Damn that Damn Dari M.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:51.880
I'm going to say Damn Dari M, Damn Dari M, KCP remix. There's No Nobody's Love and Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.880
Or, oh, Chariot.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:59.880
Oh, Chariot's not giving me many good ideas here.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.880
Best Dance Maniac Song.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.880
Best Dance Maniac. I don't know enough Dance Maniac songs to be able to do that.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.320
Yeah, they all suck anyways.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.940
We did the Guitar Freak Stromania song already, right?

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:14.440
Have we?

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.280
I think so, yeah.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.080
No, we never did.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:17.560
OK.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.200
Want to do that?

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.880
Well, it's Paul's fault for not being here.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.760
I asked Paul if he wanted to come, he said no.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.320
I'm so hurt.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.920
Well, if that's the case, then we're doing that tonight.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.220
We're going to do best Guitar Freak song without him here.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.480
So we're doing best Gita Dora song, I guess.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.320
Guitar Freak, Stromania, Keyboard Mania,

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.720
All three of those kind of meshed into one.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.040
Best song out of those.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.780
We're gonna do that when we come back

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.840
from this little break.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.720
We started out with a song that was requested a lot

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.080
in the chat room during the last break.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.480
So here it is for you guys.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.840
No, not drop the biz-om.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:55.840
The music is loud

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.840
Yeah, drop the ball

01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.840
Just drop the ball

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.840
You can't do the both of my dreams

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.840
Yes, you can try the fossil-like system

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.840
Now and ever, it's the time to resist

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.840
It's easy to blast you all away

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.840
You still have trigger fixes for the same audio to today

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.840
Don't get me wrong, I'm a pacifist

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.840
The mind can't do more than this

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.840
Explosives that are not what it takes

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.840
You know that terrorists always make them mistakes

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.840
What we got is a slow momentum

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.840
If you need the right tools and methods

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.840
Ride the wave time, count for the rhythm

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.840
The marks that teach us, we can't get with them

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.640
We can't get with them

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.160
The brain is generate all mighty power

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.920
We need to ignite your mass in an angle of power

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.280
Yeah, so ready to take that fall

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.520
It's up to you to make that call to drop the bomb

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.720
Get off the bomb

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.920
Let's drop the bomb

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.120
Let me see that fall

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.520
Hope you guys just feel momentum

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.980
If you need the right tools, then vent it

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.580
Ride the wave of time, come see the rhythm

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.180
The Martian future's begun, get with it

01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.480
The rain is staring almighty

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.420
Before we even do it now, you must be tangled in power

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.820
Yeah, you're ready to take that ball

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:03.780
And it's up to you to make that call

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:06.180
And if it all works, make the real bet and wipe it out

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.380
So drop the ball

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:10.580
Yeah, drop the ball

01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:13.780
Yeah, drop the ball

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.980
Yeah, drop that ball

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:18.580
That ball

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:20.180
That ball

01:22:50.180 --> 01:23:19.420
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.420
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.420
No!

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.420
Do we care what people think of us?

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.420
No!

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.420
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.420
Yeah!

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:33.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:39.420
Extreme Babani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:42.420
That is us! Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:46.420
I was just seeing if Dave had a negative reaction to me doing that too. I don't know.

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:51.420
Dude, he saved the picture of me looking like I was sucking on some...

01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:58.420
Well, it was actually the end of that little furry talkie thing. Wait, hold on. Hold on.

01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:59.420
That thing.

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:03.420
And, wait, hold on. Get a picture on the webcam.

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.420
Yeah, it sounds like it's orgasming half the time. No, but, um...

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.920
And he saved it, so, um...

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.920
I know he's gonna put it on, like, the main orange lounge.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:16.920
I'm not the only one that saved it, by the way. People in the chatroom saved it, too.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.800
Like, have you seen this man?

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.800
He plays the DDR.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.280
He sucks the furry cock.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.440
Wait, I did not say that. No.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.420
Last week on Orange Loun- Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:31.640
Don't pull that shit.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.400
Oh, yeah.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.640
Like you would be able to stop it.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:44.640
If I got Jamie doing the King of Iron Fingering, I can do anything I want.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.000
Anywho,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.600
let's get to the damn list list segment.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.560
We're talking about the best

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.160
guitar freaks, drum mania, keyboard mania song. We're talking about the big session.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.400
Really, we're kind of focused here on guitar freaks and drum mania.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.600
Best song in Gitarora.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.360
We'll go ahead and start.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.600
type limits i find some game show music this week the listless

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:12.080
sure why not let's do some game show music uh... if i can find some

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.100
why you go ahead and tell us your number three song lucky and will uh... find a

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:16.000
game show music

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.520
uh...

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.260
i'm gonna have to go with uh...

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:23.260
looks like primal soul

01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:28.400
primal soul okay

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:31.400
i don't even know i finally honest but my bad

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:39.400
Alright, uh, I don't like that song too. But I don't like the long verse, because that's the singing that doesn't do it very good.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.400
But, uh, most of the time this is just me dancing.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.400
Well, then let's hear if your choice is any better, Bradley. What's your number three choice?

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:52.400
Bradley is somehow really hyper right now. He's all like, yeah, girl sounds really good, but the long verse...

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.400
Hey, we're getting the talk on this show. Shut your mouth!

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.400
Alright, yes.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.400
Alright.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.400
Yes, your number three choice.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.400
My number three choice would be Liar Liar.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:06.400
Liar Liar, that's a good one.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.400
Alright, Dave, what is your number three choice?

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.400
I dropped my list on the ground.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:24.400
I guess my number three is Nami Nori Johnny, but it's on 7 Mix and 6 Mix,

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:34.400
or guitar freaks from Romania, and it's actually in Japanese spelling, so you can't see Nanomori John, he doesn't say that.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:00.880
our music stuff

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.440
you're number two choice

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.280
all right my number two choice has to be eraser engine

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:12.280
eraser engine

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.960
get a little old school

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.040
the original racer motor maximum

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.040
all right your number two choice radley

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:28.360
he said

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:35.360
uh... yes you're number two to receive

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.120
my number two

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.880
i guess is uh...

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.560
i mean although there is

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.240
these favorites all

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:51.800
on anybody and that that was different

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:58.800
double cheeseburger

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.180
would be carnival

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.560
i like the cardigans they're cool and i like that cover of it in guitar freaks

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:12.560
with mix of carnivals one of the two choice

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.460
which one here

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:19.020
alright brownies correct my story to get

01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:27.040
Loki's number one choice for best guitar-free Stromania song. All right, this is easy. It's gonna be fireball fireball

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:29.540
All right

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:33.220
Fireball

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:41.220
Your number one choice Bradley for best guitar-free Stromania song giant slug giant slug right on

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:53.220
I went to MGL two weeks ago to go play that on 6th Mix, because it's not in 7th Mix on guitar freaks.

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:55.220
They removed it for the next set.

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:56.220
Doh!

01:28:56.220 --> 01:29:01.220
And lots of the old songs they removed, because it was cool time.

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:04.220
Alright, and your number one choice, Dave?

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:10.220
Um, I don't know, this one's kind of typical, but I said at least 100 seconds.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.220
It's a good song.

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:17.220
The long version kicks so much more ass, but it's not, like, on the Drumanian guitar freaks.

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:18.220
It's too bad.

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:19.220
Bummer.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:22.220
My number one song, I can't believe none of you mentioned it, come on.

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:24.220
It's the best song in Guitar Freaks.

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:25.220
You know it.

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:26.220
Don't say Venus.

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:27.220
Don't say Venus.

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:28.220
No, not Venus.

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:29.220
Haru Spring.

01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.220
Come on, with the dancing panda?

01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:35.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.220
Come on, that's the best song. How could you forget that?

01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:41.220
We tried. Shut up.

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:47.220
Anyway, the list, the full list is some notable exceptions that the chat list is pointing out.

01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:51.220
We didn't say Fire, Hand to Hold, Long Train Runnin'

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.220
Okay, wait, hold on, hold on

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:55.220
I said Long Train Runnin', I don't like the version of Guitareve

01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.300
fire

01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.420
overplay yet this one guy

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:00.380
fuck you

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.660
guy roosevelt golfing staff guide

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:04.900
who plays this uh... oh sorry for listening

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.860
uh... hypnotic also

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:08.620
who played a song

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.660
three songs in a row

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:12.020
like he put in money

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:12.900
fire

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.980
do you know i forget a song goes

01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:16.420
but anyway i should remember it

01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:20.160
and then okay let's mix it up a little with fire

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.900
okay i'm gonna challenge myself with fire

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:27.900
I assume that he's playing three different games since there's only the long version in 7th mix.

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:31.900
No, this was in the 5th mix, Guitar Freak 6.

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.900
But now he just plays it in Burn, I think.

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:35.900
It's like, Fire!

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:37.900
Burn!

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:39.900
Fire!

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:44.900
Anyway, the full list we have so far, and now we get to do the elimination part. This'll be fun.

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:52.060
Primal Soul, Liar Liar, Naminori Janna, Miss You, Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble,

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:56.980
Carnival, Fireball, Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Hadu Spring.

01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:58.540
Your elimination choice, Loki.

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:03.980
Well, because I can hardly pronounce that, it's going to be Naminori Janna.

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:05.540
I can't say I blame you.

01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:06.540
It's not a great song, anyway.

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:08.460
I don't know what Dave was thinking.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:11.300
That song rules, and it's Johnny, not Janna.

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.300
Yeah, Johnny.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:18.220
The interesting thing is that when I was in SoCal to go to the Anime Expo, I went to the

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:24.980
Mandaraki store that was closing, and I heard it on the radio. It was interesting.

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.940
Your choice to eliminate from this lovely list we have, Bradley.

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:32.700
It would be Miss You, because Right On Time is a lot better than that one.

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:35.820
I'm so hurt. But okay. That's the way it works.

01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:36.820
I used to like Right On Time.

01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:37.820
Bradley's fired from the show.

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:40.820
A small e. No, nevermind.

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:49.820
But then it was overplayed partially by me, partially by these rocker people at Gulfland, and Rob, and everyone else.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:54.820
And you know one song I left off my list, and I'm really sad I had to leave those to the list?

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:56.820
Actually I had two songs I had to leave off my list.

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:59.820
I'm Gonna Get You, which I love, I love that song.

01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:00.820
Yeah, that song.

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:01.820
And Mr. Moon, I like that song.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:04.820
I usually think of Keyboard Mania when I think of that song, so I dumped it.

01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.820
Okay, now I gotta pick one off, huh?

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.820
Yes, you've got to pick one off, Dave.

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.820
Okay, well, I can't pick my own off.

01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:13.820
So, I guess I'll take Primal Soul.

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.820
Primal Soul.

01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:17.820
You bastard.

01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:18.820
Oh, my turn.

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:22.820
It's a good song, but I thought it was the worst.

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.820
This is hard.

01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:25.820
I actually like all of these.

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.820
I'm going to take off...

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:34.820
Oh, this is really hard.

01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.540
Can't vote for anything not on this list.

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:07.340
That's the way it works.

01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:09.300
From this list of the eight songs we have,

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:13.020
Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble, Carnival, Fireball,

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:15.820
Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Haru Springs.

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:18.820
Send me your vote for your favorite Guitar Freaks drum

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.420
mania song.

01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:21.060
Private message.

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:22.500
And we're going to take a quick break.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.940
While you send those over private message,

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:25.860
you're only going to have about three minutes.

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:29.500
I'm going to play a quick song from the Dance Mania series.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.060
And that's all the time you get.

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:36.780
So, let's play from the Dance Mania series.

01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:37.780
You want to do...

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:38.780
No, that's Transparty.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:39.780
You're thinking...

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:40.780
You're not...

01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:41.780
That's not Dance Mania.

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:42.780
We're going to do...

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:44.780
I don't know.

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:45.780
I'm thinking.

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.460
Let's do...

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.460
Let's do Tears in May.

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:52.260
You get three minutes while we listen to Missing Heart.

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:54.700
These are the people that did Moonlight Shadow, by the way.

All in vain, tears in vain, tears in vain

01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:18.020
The secret world of our dreams is to wait my soul

01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:24.020

Don't do that to Bradley's controller, he'll beat you up.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.240
I think I'd be more worried about the microphone.

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.240
Whoa!

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:26.040
What are you doing here, oh wait, are you doing the webcam?

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.520
Thanks for the webcam.

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.880
If you want to look at the webcam, the super secret location is only available in our chat

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:37.480
room at Channel Pound Orange Lounge on any other side IRC server.

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:41.160
Same server that hosts a lot of big Bahmani chat rooms.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:45.760
So what else do we want to talk about? We've got 20 minutes left on the show. Jamie's not

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.260
here to vent about anything this week because she's out of town. She's at a step squad convention

01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:55.460
or some kind of meeting for her team there, which includes some out of town folks that

01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:56.460
she's interviewing.

01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:58.740
I can do a preemptive fuck you over the week.

01:40:58.740 --> 01:40:59.740
Okay, go for it.

01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:00.740
You downloaded the music.

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:05.740
Yeah, I haven't unpacked it though yet. You've got to wait for me to do that before you can

01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:06.740
go.

01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:07.740
Oh, then do that and we'll do the music.

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:11.740
Oh, you got anything you want to talk about, Matt?

01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:15.740
Yes. What are you doing, Dave?

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:19.740
One second. Webcam. Oh my god.

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:23.740
Turn off your webcams. If you have a brain, you'll turn off the webcam for about a minute.

01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:27.740
Yeah, but see, now everyone will turn it on.

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:31.740
We have a request for you to do the Black Mage, whatever that means.

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:35.740
Dave. Well, what's the Black Mage? I really have no idea.

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.460
tell dave to do the black mage

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:40.700
i have a request

01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:42.100
black mage

01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:44.420
doo doo doo doo doo

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:46.600
what am i doing

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.740
this is what they saw by the way huh

01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:56.740
it looks like a crotch shot it looks like a gynecology appointment

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:01.840
uh... which you just saw there was the official background

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.380
for uh... dgr god mix

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:12.380
don't inflate his ego any more than it needs to be.

01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:38.600
And black mage is the shit basically

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.220
Yeah, so

01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:45.860
No, go hold it

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:55.460
It's the black mage

01:42:55.460 --> 01:43:00.200
uh...

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.480
if you do it correctly

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:03.080
twenty-third maggots

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.120
i don't know you know

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.280
buddy do you think buddy christ

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.440
uh...

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:11.580
dogma

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.000
you okay

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.280
he's not here i have to give a big week

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.640
this is not your where did she

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.100
there is a we have a jamie we file actually it's in one of the other promos

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:21.080
it's uh...

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.200
hold on we can see his way

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.560
Dammit!

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:30.080
Dammit!

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.600
There it is! There's Jamie Doolery! That's one of the other promos.

01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.980
Matt has attached the

01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:39.480
cam to his head

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.640
but since it only takes a picture like every twenty seconds

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.960
it doesn't really work like one of those extreme

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.200
sport people

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.400
you know where you see it from their point of view

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:53.360
it's just kind of like random cliff of what Matt might see if you were standing on top of his head.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.920
sports is falling off the cliff

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:58.640
the employee of the cliff they see him

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:00.160
you seem

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.700
preparing to pull the cord

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.920
and then you just kind of see

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:05.560
scattered on the ground

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.920
like what happened in those twenty seconds

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.080
well you know i guess the court

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.620
what the hell am i talking about

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:16.280
shows his guys

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:19.420
i know it's just got so stupid but people are still listening go figure

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:20.900
i'm sorry

01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:22.180
i'm sorry

01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:25.180
It's the California Heat, we blame it on that.

01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:28.180
Oh my god, it got up to like 80 today.

01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:29.180
What's wrong?

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:33.180
Yeah, people just look at us like...

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:36.180
I have a Bomani-related topic we could discuss.

01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:38.180
Okay, how about this?

01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.180
Internet ranking.

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:41.180
Do you think...

01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:45.180
Is there any way that you think internet ranking for the various games out there could be improved,

01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:49.180
besides having more than just a crappy USA internet ranking competition in the US?

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:54.060
Like, you know how they have the Max 2 internet ranking for various songs you could do?

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:58.020
There's the 2DX internet ranking, which is really popular right now for 6 style at home,

01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:02.460
which Dave is giving the thumbs down to, probably because he can't rank on it.

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:06.260
The 6 style thing is cool because it's at home, and so you're already at home and stuff,

01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:11.100
but the Max 2 one, first of all you have to write down, I think it's 16 digits or numbers

01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.220
or letters or combined something.

01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.220
Numbers?

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:15.220
No.

01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:21.220
It's not the fact that you have to have a pen and paper ready to be able to record it.

01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:24.220
Well hello, if you're playing internet ranking, would you think, gee, uh...

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:25.220
Nope.

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:26.220
Dave.

01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:34.220
All you gotta do on the PlayStation version, you go into records, and then you hit, I believe, the select key when it shows your scores, and it'll show you the internet ranking password.

01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:38.220
Oh, oh, you're talking about on, uh, home version.

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:41.220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you were talking about the arcades. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dave. I'm sorry.

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:45.220
But if you use a memory card, it'll save it, just so you know.

01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:49.220
I know it's awesome, is if you do it playing versus, it crashes the machine.

01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.220
Whoa, that is pretty cool.

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:57.220
No, but first of all, it takes three great deals of unlaziness to do this.

01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:02.220
First you have to have a pen and piece of paper and a pen or pencil ready.

01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:06.220
Then you have to waste three songs, well not necessarily waste,

01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:11.220
But play three songs that you wouldn't normally play, just so you can get the internet ranking.

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:16.220
Play them on, probably, difficulty that you wouldn't want to, or, you know, whatever, I don't know.

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:19.220
Then don't play internet ranking! Shit!

01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:23.220
And then you have to write them down quickly, and then go home.

01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:27.220
Wait, stop grabbing the mic. And then, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't talk.

01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:31.220
No, it's... God damn it, I'm one of the co-hosts of the show!

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:34.220
You're the co-host. I'm the new host.

01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:40.220
And then you have to go home and actually go on the computer, which I really do not like using computers.

01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:47.220
By the way, we're on internet radio right now. You might want to keep the computer bashing a little light.

01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:54.220
No, I'm just saying, I cannot use computers. I try to go on the internet.

01:46:54.220 --> 01:47:00.220
It's like, you have lost all the memory on your computer. Your computer is now shutting down.

01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:01.580
it's not our fault

01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:04.900
like a special email has been sent to a little midget who will come and kill you

01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:05.820
now

01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.180
haha

01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:09.060
they have gotten those messages before

01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:10.900
they're not sure

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:12.080
i don't know i have

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.480
have the midgets come yet

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:17.700
i don't know those little kids have been threatening me they could have been midgets

01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:19.280
i don't know this

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.900
no midgets you can

01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:23.020
sorry if there's any midgets out there

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:24.240
midgets are awesome

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.540
and they really are

01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:26.980
itty bitty gang man

01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:28.980
Oh, nasty!

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:32.980
A special F.U. for all those Greek midgets out there.

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:33.980
Oh yeah.

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:34.980
Yeah, what was that all about?

01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:35.980
Greek midgets are awesome.

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.980
That was so last hour.

01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:40.980
Anyway, what do you suggest they do then, Dave?

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:42.980
Just have an internet ranking on your honor?

01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:45.980
You know, oh yeah, Eiffel combo'd Max Unlimited.

01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:46.980
No!

01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:47.980
Yes, I did!

01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:48.980
I'm number one in the world!

01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:49.980
That is crap.

01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:54.980
No, I think that they should hook all of the Max 2 arcade machines up to the internet

01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:58.980
So it kind of like tells you your ranking as you put it in.

01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:00.980
That and have a webcam that records your...

01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:06.980
You know, so it's like I say I pull perfect max unlimited three times and it somehow gets the...

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:07.980
No! Stop driving the line!

01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:13.980
So you're suggesting that Roosevelt Golf Land spend or any Golf Land or any arcade with a Max 2 machine,

01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:20.980
which is just about everywhere these days, spend thousands of dollars to get a DSL brought in next to the machine

01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:25.900
machine, and just so you can have internet ranking so you can make a pathetic attempt

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:29.060
at being the best DDR player in the nation.

01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:33.500
Well I know I'm not the best, but not any arcade, every arcade needs to do this.

01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:38.480
A, it shouldn't be like a specialty, it should be part of the machine, you know it should

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.820
have like a...

01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:42.300
You're forgetting they're all illegal anyway, they're all bootlegs.

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:46.460
So get the illegal bootleg DSL, whatever.

01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:47.460
And then um...

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:48.460
Hold on.

01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:49.460
Illegal bootleg DSL.

01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:56.460
So let's say, you know, I full perfect everything and then it says, yay, you are number one, congratulations.

01:48:56.460 --> 01:49:02.460
And then, you know, you see, it's kind of like a Soul Calibur II thing, you know, with your armies fighting against each other.

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:05.460
Your DDR armies fighting against each other.

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:12.460
I full perfect something and it's like, Corey already did this, you are Poser or something like that.

01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:17.460
Conquest mode in DDR would be stupid because everybody would pick on MGL and you know it.

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.460
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool, though.

01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:22.460
MGL would be gone in five seconds.

01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:25.460
I'm not sure how long we'd last, though, because I'm not...

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:29.460
Like, we've got a constant stream of people playing, but most of the people...

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.460
Sorry if you're listening, I do this a lot...

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.460
Are pretty bad.

01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:35.460
Except for, like, us.

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:41.460
Us being sacramentals who know each other.

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.460
Yeah...

01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:44.460
Because lots of these new sacramentals...

01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.980
Well, let's get off this rant because it's kind of boring.

01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.260
Give the mic back, Dave.

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.580
Dave's pouting.

01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:57.420
Let's see, other things coming up that we should talk about, I guess I can give a little

01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:58.420
plug for me.

01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:00.060
It's my birthday on Wednesday!

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.060
Yay!

01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:06.900
Wednesday, there was something about Wednesday that was important, something I was supposed

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.540
to remember.

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.980
Some other kind of anniversary, I forget.

01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:13.220
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:16.860
How could I forget? If I turn on the TV, they keep reminding me. Your birthday happens to

01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:18.940
be on September 11th, huh?

01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:23.940
Another porn date is when my cable is supposed to be installed. Probably AT&T is going to

01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:26.660
fuck it up.

01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:31.220
Yes, and also, if you calculate the hours correctly, that's the time that I will be

01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:36.540
finished downloading the porn that I am starting to download now. It will be finished by September

01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:40.820
11th. No, I swear. It will take like a hundred, like four hundred hours or something.

01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:45.820
What are you planning to do to celebrate your birthday?

01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:49.820
I'm throwing a bimani party.

01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:52.820
That's right, you're throwing the big bimani party next weekend.

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:56.820
Maybe we'll have to tape something for Orange Lounge there, I don't know what, but we'll do something.

01:50:56.820 --> 01:51:03.820
It'll be fun, I'll have my sim set up with the metal pads and all that fun stuff, and I'll be making burgers.

01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:05.820
Is it next weekend or Wednesday?

01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:07.820
It's on Saturday.

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:11.700
Because, like, if it was the weekend, then I wouldn't, or the weekday, because I wouldn't

01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:12.700
be able to pass.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:13.700
Yes.

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:14.700
Wednesday, I don't know.

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:15.700
My parents are cool.

01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:16.700
My girlfriend.

01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:17.700
But, they're not.

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:22.700
And, yeah, but, see, I can't go on weekdays, because I'm, like, trapped in my house.

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:23.700
Yeah.

01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:28.220
Um, let's see, on Friday, we're going down to, um, the Winchester Mystery House to do

01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:31.820
a mid-light, uh, midnight tour, because that's on Friday the 13th.

01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:32.820
Right on.

01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:36.140
So we're going to do that, because that'll be fun, and then, uh, Saturday, yeah, my party

01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:41.580
and stuff and you know everyone's invited so come crash the party if you want and uh

01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:45.480
well obviously you need to know the directions are but remember this is a national show i

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:50.300
don't think the people in uh you know uh columbus ohio give a crap about your party no offense

01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:58.800
fly in i'll i'll be working welcome international people in venezuela vamanos ah loki the microphone

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.160
anyway uh i'm being reminded of something in the chat room is going on right now as

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:07.760
As we speak, the King of the Hill episode that featured the DDR parody is replaying

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:13.000
right now, and you missed it because you're listening to us!

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.300
You know, it was first played on Mother's Day, which is pretty funny.

01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:20.860
I think the funny wore off the first time, but I actually didn't see it the first time,

01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:23.100
so I'm having the TiVo grab it right now so I can watch it.

01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:24.100
I didn't see it.

01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.100
Dansu?

01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:26.100
Dansu?

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:27.100
Dansu?

01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:28.100
Dansu?

01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:29.100
What is...

01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:30.100
I don't...

01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.100
You have to explain this to me.

01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:59.100
The plot was they go to Japan to find Hank's, the main character's, half-brother or something, because there was some love grandfather thing, and anyway, they see DDR on this giant screen, you know, it's on one of the megascreens, broadcasting in basically a Times Square, or, yeah, type of place, and so, you know, the main character's son goes up there and starts playing, and, you know, busts out too, I think it was, was it Kung Fu fighting?

01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:06.100
it

01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:08.540
and then

01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:12.100
what happened was this girl comes up and it's kind of like

01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:15.180
funny romance

01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:16.740
and they've got the

01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:20.540
i forget the robot characters i forget them

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:21.700
sent out

01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:23.460
whatever that is

01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.580
brought to sleep

01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:28.760
well i a king of the hill usually puts me to sleep i'll find the show funny at

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.360

are you finished may i finish get it all that is a terrorist

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.200
forget about what type of the t-v- show that's actually on a colony central

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.480
that's an old british show called trigger happy t-v uh...

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:50.140
things damn funny

01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:53.080
british interrelated the money

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:56.160
it could be a lot of the whole thing

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:59.380
that music in it

01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:03.600

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:04.960

it's hilarious i don't know i'm

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:08.480

so they have it on there and it's cool

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:30.160
In the chat room, 23rd Magus says he's going to come to your B Mani party to celebrate

01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.680
Konami's famous B Mani series.

01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:37.520
Hey, I'll actually get to meet him, because I've tried to meet him numerous times and

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:38.520
never worked.

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.200
Actually, I was in the same arcade once and I never saw him.

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.200
It'll be a Kodak moment, I'm sure.

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.200
I'm surprised.

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.200
It was funny.

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:48.400
I thought people had come to my Qzart trip since it was just me and that guy.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:49.400
I was broke.

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:51.480
I really wanted to go, but I'm so broke.

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:56.120
broke, I'm sorry. And then the Bomani party, it sounds like there's going to be tons of

01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:01.440
people there, and I was expecting there to be like five people. Well, hey. So, yeah,

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:05.720
more the merrier. I think I have an empty house that night, so hopefully we won't be

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:10.540
waking anyone up, and my neighbors suck. I hate my neighbors. A special F-you to my freaking

01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:18.080
neighbors. Because this dumbass, I guess her boyfriend moved in next door, and he parks

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:22.800
his truck, because we're in a court and instead of parking along the curb, he actually parks

01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:29.240
perpendicular to the curb, so his truck is taking up half of our driveway. And he's a

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:30.240
bastard.

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:34.280
Do you think Bahmani parties getting together and playing this, to make this more of a topic

01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:39.920
everybody can relate to than just people who are within driving distance of Loki's house,

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:42.960
you think Bahmani parties are a cool thing to do once in a while, get together and just

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:47.220
play all the home versions, or do you think maybe we ought to go to the arcade to play

01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:51.460
these things or is it more fun because at home you can drink and play DDR? Although

01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:55.960
if you go to Dave and Buster's you can drink and play DDR too, but just hypothetically.

01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:02.740
I think it's fun. Wait, does anyone else have Maimani parties? I'm sure. I'm sure. Friends

01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:08.100
get together and play Maimani. Shit man, people have LAN parties. I mean, come on. They have

01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:13.100
what? LAN parties, local area networks where you play network games like Quake 3 and that

01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:18.420
that kind of crap, and you hook computers up. Uh-oh, Quake 3, look out! We're going

01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:21.860
to- I don't know what the game's about. It doesn't matter, there's parties for everything,

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:25.900
so I'm sure- It's point and shoot, that's all it is. People get together to watch, like,

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:31.920
you know, I Love Lucy shows and that kind of shit. Dave with the stupid webcam. Anyways,

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.540
so yeah, I think it's a good idea that people get together. Anything that'll bring people

01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:40.020
together to actually be able to enjoy something will be great, so, whether it be an arcade

01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:47.020
It's about time to close the show, but a closing thought. What would be the absolute worst thing that you could do at a Bimani party?

01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:52.020
Say you're going to a Bimani party for the first time as a newbie. Absolute worst thing you could do?

01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:53.020
Show up on the wrong day?

01:56:53.020 --> 01:57:02.020
What do you think? Absolute worst thing you could do at a Bimani party your first time? Dave, do you have any ideas?

01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:12.020
The absolute worst thing, well first I could think about getting really drunk and playing naked, but I'm guessing that you could do worse stuff than that.

01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:20.020
Well I don't know, because I mean that party that you had a while back, it wasn't really a Bumani party, but all these people that played Bumani showed up, so it kind of turned into one.

01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:30.300
Where, I think, Ryan Samu-mangus, or magus or whatever, he put on his girlfriend's clothes

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.860
and started pairing.

01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.340
That was really bad.

01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:37.860
It looked like a tutu slash.

01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:41.500
Like he looked very, very fruity.

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:43.500
Sorry Rob.

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:48.180
He said it's okay.

01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:49.180
Any ideas from Bradley?

01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:55.180
Hello, whoops, my bad. I'm sorry, yes. Any further ideas, Bradley?

01:57:55.180 --> 01:58:05.180
Breaking people's machines or playing Let Them Move for the first time. Wow! Let Them Move! That's awesome!

01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:11.180
Actually, now that I've flashed back to my first Bimani party, what was it? My modded pad got broken.

01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:17.700
Yeah, I remember my first Bamani party, it was, oh wait, no I don't, well I remember

01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:22.660
one Bamani party, it involved people getting drunk and, you know, dressing up as, in their

01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:27.280
girlfriend's clothes, and playing Farah, and that was funny because it wasn't me.

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.500
I'm going to have to agree with the chatroom that the absolute worst thing you could do

01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:33.580
at your first Bamani party is ParaNaked.

01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:35.960
there and they could be

01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:39.560
big whip across the thing or in the nose

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:40.980
or um...

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:43.580
another bad thing would be i try to play d r in the pool

01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:45.180
would be another bad idea

01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:49.060
you know don't take the you know i am full yes to the pool

01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:51.740
you'd like to hear on tonight

01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:53.600
i'd love to see it on a game show

01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:55.780
here are nice to meet with you

01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:57.880
references before but on

01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:59.340
that game on stop

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:00.820
i would have got like thirty seconds

01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:02.060
uh... the thing

01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:03.540
where you

01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:06.880
you get it wrong, and the floor drops out from under you, what's that show called?

01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:07.880
Russian Roulette.

01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:11.540
Russian Roulette, like DDR Russian Roulette, you hit a wrong note, and the floor just drops

01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:15.020
out from under you, so you're like, trying to step, and then the floor goes bye-bye.

01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:20.140
That's like, so Goonies, okay?

01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:23.140
Baby Moot?

01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:29.620
And Rob came up with a good idea for a new show, DDR on Ice, with, uh, Jon Tesh.

01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:31.620
Brian Boitano

01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.620
John Tesh announcing

01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:38.620
Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp to my beat, stomp to my beat, stomp to my beat

01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:42.620
This player of DDR, he has such a terrible youth

01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:44.620
He grew up in the slums

01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:47.620
And now he plays DDR and he gets money that way

01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:49.620
He's won tournaments

01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:53.620
And it just breaks my heart

01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:57.620
For those who don't know, this is the most Bradley's ever talked

01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:02.620
Like, cumulative in this two hours. He's talked more than he's ever talked in his entire life.

02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:04.620
You heard he here on Orange Lounge first.

02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:08.620
Uh-huh. And it's kind of funny to know that I actually had a radio show one time.

02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:09.620
Really?

02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:10.620
I have tapes of it.

02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:12.620
Oh, I gotta hear this stuff.

02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:13.620
I got really crazy on it.

02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:17.620
I used to have a college radio show too. But anyway, we're past nine o'clock. We gotta end the show.

02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:22.620
Big thank you to everybody listening. Big thanks to Loki, tonight's honorary co-host.

02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:24.620
Any final words, Loki?

02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:28.620
Logie?

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:35.620
No, I wish Dave would stop playing with the webcam, but, yeah.

02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:37.620
Nothing really.

02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:40.620
Any final thoughts from Dave, the cam whore?

02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:43.620
Webcam is my friend.

02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:45.620
Any final thoughts from Bradley?

02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:49.620
Tea lovers, go somewhere else to neck and play with each other.

02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:52.620
And my final thought of the day?

02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:53.900
do something

02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:56.340
my mom by the day

02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:57.360
okay that's it

02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:59.660

02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:36.540
Listen, pal, you've got to make it a little more sexy, you know, and don't just ram it in there like that.

02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:39.980
