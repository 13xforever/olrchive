00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:50,240
God damn you, stop calling here! Isn't this 4215 pussy way? You bitch! Now let me take

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,240
the zip code! You want to fuck you? You have no morals, darling. I'd also like to add that

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I have my father's gun and a scorching case of purpose. Kiss my grass, nuge. Mecha lecha

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Me too!

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Fuck are you?

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm working on it.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Loser.

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Lame.

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
On the side of my face.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
Breathing.

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
Breath.

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Heaving breath.

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Heaving whatever.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,240
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience records.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,240
I am your singing telegram.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,240
You're tuned into the Bemani scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bemani.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,240
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me better as Sky.

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Typically, I would be saying, joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,240
However, unfortunately, she had to make a last-minute cancellation.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,920
So, filling in as co-hosts tonight, say hello to honorary co-host and sym-fan extraordinaire,

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,000
Matt, also known as Loki.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hey, everyone.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
And, of course, as always, we're joined by some other in-studio friends.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,960
Actually, we're down to one tonight.

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,120
We got Bradley in the house.

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Say hello.

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Hello, there.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,640
And everybody else is busy this week, apparently, now that school's back in session, although

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,400
most of the people on this show are out of high school already, with the exception of

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
a couple.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,980
still high school but like Brad and Irene they had a visitor coming in from out of

38
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,880
town and Jamie had to go to another event we'll get into all that later

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,720

Yeah, everyone is just better than us, baby

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,680
From the bottom, up and from the camera top

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,160
You're cheeky on your teeth and start it up

74
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,360
No matter what, I never thought that

75
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Daddy didn't work, a really smart guy

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,880
But daddy's something we all know

77
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,400

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,160
Let's take the Attention, T-tala lila

84
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,760
Oh, my Crossing is down the Wind

85
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,240
Ochiteku, soki no amari kamori

For me, I come close,

91
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:52,740
Even if I

92
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,760

You are the best You all happen to me

111
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:46,300
From the Step Squad to DAYZ, this DTR Stocks Speak,

112
00:09:46,300 --> 00:10:10,620
I have no idea what half those little acronyms mean.

113
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,340
Am I just uncool?

114
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,540
I don't know what they mean either.

115
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,920
All right, cool. We'll both be un-cool then.

116
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,640
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Big thanks to Step Squad for getting

117
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,720
together and recording that promo for us.

118
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,880
But a big F-you to them too, because it's because of them that Jamie's gone this

119
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,840
week, and I'm sitting here

120
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,640
with a very empty room tonight. Big thank you to Matt and Bradley for

121
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,060
showing up, though.

122
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,360
No, I'm just kidding. Nothing but love for Step Squad. We love all of them and

123
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,560
stuff, Ab. But Jamie is at a Step Squad event today.

124
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,360
She's going to be seeing some friends, I guess, that are coming up from out of town

125
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,200
for some big gathering that are going on. But needless to say, she took the remote kit

126
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,920
and she's getting some interviews, so next week we'll hear from a lot of people throughout

127
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,840
the DDR scene. There's a lot of really great people in Step Squad I'm sure we'll be hearing

128
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,440
from next week, so that'll be cool.

129
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Yes.

130
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,320
All right. So what else? What were we talking about during the break there? During the break

131
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,060
we were kind of talking about songs that have been released for simulators lately, and you've

132
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,760
been looking, you know, now for those that don't know Matt, also known as Loki, he's

133
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,720
He's really big into the simulator.

134
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,560
For those who don't know what a DDR simulator is, dance with intensity, step mania, things

135
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
like that.

136
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
Things that will emulate DDR on your computer basically, or simulate I should say.

137
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,080
Some people get on my ass for not clarifying the difference between emulate and simulate.

138
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,240
But you know, whatever, it's DDR on your computer basically.

139
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,120
But Loki really big into this, likes to download every single freaking song he can find and

140
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
play them all.

141
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
What's going on?

142
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,400
Give us a sim scene update, tell us about some stuff you've been looking for recently.

143
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Well, let's see. Recently, especially at my job, I suppose I should be actually doing real work at my job, but instead I exploit their T1 line.

144
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Right on.

145
00:11:50,400 --> 00:12:01,400
And so lately I've been actually searching some of the smaller Japanese sites. You know, the ones that you can't understand a thing that's on them, but you see, you know, song files with BMS stuff.

146
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Anyways, some of the stuff I've actually found recently is actually some 2DX8 style stuff.

147
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
That's pretty cool.

148
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Found a whole bunch of remixes for stuff like the Long Train Running Ventura mix.

149
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
They actually have a file for that out there.

150
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
There's actually tons of files out there.

151
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
It's just people don't know where to look.

152
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Now what were you telling me about some things in development that are going on right now?

153
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Because there's a couple really funny ones.

154
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
ones.

155
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,120
Okay, there's a, I forget which side I saw it on, but there's some guy that's actually

156
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,840
doing basically like a mix, you know, with a bunch of different songs he's going to be

157
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
releasing.

158
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
They're all Christian music.

159
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:47,440
What was the comment there from the little stuffed ferret or whatever the heck this thing

160
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
is?

161
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Good idea.

162
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Anyway, so there's going to be a DDR god mix coming out soon, basically.

163
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,640
Yes, exactly.

164
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,800
It's very scary, but...

165
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,440
Jesus Christ, it's DDR!

166
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,280
Hey, well, I've already got that Paranoid Catholic, so there's the start.

167
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
What else?

168
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
There's also...

169
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Paranoid Catholic?

170
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Yes!

171
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
There is a...

172
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,880
There's a Paranoid Catholic...

173
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,800
There's tons of Paranoid mixes out there that we don't even know about.

174
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
They're out there.

175
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,720
They have a list on there. If you actually search under Yahoo or something, for Paranoia

176
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,240
and then maybe DDR, they'll actually have a website that you can pull up a list of every

177
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,120
single Paranoia ever made. All the remixes that people have done that are fan-made.

178
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
As if you needed more Paranoia.

179
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
And they have links to the actual step files, too.

180
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Really?

181
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,040
Where you can download them. So that was kind of cool.

182
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,520
Do you dance little crosses in the Christian mix? Just kind of like up, down, left, right?

183
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,840
No, it's just instead of some of the orchestra hits, you have God, God, God, you know, that

184
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
kind of stuff.

185
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:55,080
like Madonna and like a prayer going God? God? No, not quite, but anyways. Other things,

186
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,040
BimaniRuler, Dave, actually he had a few files, eight more files that he was releasing. There

187
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,320
are some of his older stuff that looked really awesome. He's done some of the Para Para music

188
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,960
by Eurobeat and My Sweet Banana and that kind of stuff. Plus, there's a few other ones that

189
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,400
you can actually get right now. He has Max Enigma which is in Tourney Mix 2. Is that

190
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Max mixed with Enigma music or something?

191
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:26,400
No, he made it with the key sounds from Max 300 and the 2DX sims.

192
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Actually, I recognize most of it in there.

193
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Most of it is just the key sounds from that and he just made his own mix out of it.

194
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Something similar to what I was going to but got pissed off with it and decided not to.

195
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:50,400
There's another one he's also released that there's a link on DDR Maniacs in their boards. They've got one for Gravity from, I believe, Sevenstyle.

196
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:58,400
And let me just say that, you know, people have gotten A's and B's and C's on it and stuff in The Sims, but it's pretty much impossible.

197
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,400
But as Jamie would say, to do that you'd have to be the king of iron fingering.

198
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Well, no, here's the thing. I mean, DDR is DDR. I mean, you play it, you kind of dance to it and stuff on the keyboard, it's cool.

199
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Let's not make DDR 2DX. I mean, this is pretty much what they're doing, is making it like 2DX.

200
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Well, that's how they're making it harder. I mean, how do you make DDR steps harder without getting just more convoluted and more like 2DX-style step-ups?

201
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:34,400
The freeze arrows are one way of doing it, because the freeze arrows will screw you up on songs like Ordinary World where if you don't spin or do a little trick with your feet, you're not going to hit them all.

202
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Granted, you know, they are hard, but they do go with the music. They go with the music perfectly, so I give them that. That's cool.

203
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm still trying to get the other six or so files I'm missing.

204
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,400
I actually have a deal with the webmaster at DDRMania X

205
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,400
and I'm going to send him some anime and he's going to send me a burned copy and a CD with them on there.

206
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
But unfortunately there's been some problems with me sending them to him.

207
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,400
I hear we have a lot of fans of the show in the DDRMania X chatroom, so hello!

208
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,400
It's all of you! Love ya! Big kisses.

209
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Yeah, I hear they hate the show.

210
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm surprised.

211
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Eh, what can you do?

212
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,240
I mean, I don't even know if they've listened, but whatever.

213
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,280
They hate the show, so, so much for that, you know.

214
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
We all hate this show.

215
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,520
Well, see, other than that, sim-wise, I mean, no updates as far as DWI goes.

216
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,080
Step Mania, I heard there's a Beta 6 out there somewhere, but I haven't played it and don't

217
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
really care to.

218
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm just, I've given up on Step Mania, so.

219
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,200
I like Step Mania, personally, but, you know.

220
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,360
I've given up on it.

221
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,640
I don't really play DDR Sims because I just can't do DDR on my fingers, it doesn't make

222
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
sense.

223
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,760
And really, when I'm playing DDR at home, I'll do the official Konami one.

224
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,860
I know you want to ask why the hell would I play that.

225
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,900
That's why I can play with the pirates, argh!

226
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,240
The new DDR pirates!

227
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Yeah.

228
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,220
And for those who didn't hear, the new DDR PC characters, they've been releasing characters

229
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,800
every other week or so.

230
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,360
The most recent characters they released, Elliot and, I forget the name of the other

231
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,480
one, it started with C. I'm sure Chawram will fill me in.

232
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
They're pirates.

233
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,200
They're two pirates.

234
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,080
The first one were a couple of nightclubs, the second one were kind of, I don't know,

235
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:23,480
dressed like cowboys, no the cowboys are the hidden ones in the game.

236
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,360
The other ones they released were kind of like, I don't know, they had a unique style

237
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
to them.

238
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,300
on their heads that cover your whole head type thing. Now they've got pirates out.

239
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,600
What I want to know though is when are we going to get pirate music in DDR? I mean when

240
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,960
are we going to have it? What exactly is pirate music? Like the theme from the Pirates of

241
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:50,020
the Caribbean or something? Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Yo ho ho, argh, get off me

242
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:57,440
pad, matey. Yeah, stuff like that. I don't know. But yeah, sim file stuff, there is tons

243
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,680
of it out there, you just gotta find it. I might, if time permits, one of these days,

244
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,880
just actually link to all these sites that have really cool stuff on them and, you know,

245
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,200
throw that out there, but in the meantime, I'm trying to get the largest collection on

246
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,520
the Internet and one person's beaten me so far, but that'll be, uh, that'll be changed

247
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
pretty soon.

248
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
You shall see. We shall see about that.

249
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,680
Yes, the official count right now, and this is all the stuff that's actually converted

250
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,040
over in the sim and working right now, is 1,110.

251
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,240
You're a sad, sad man.

252
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,640
but i've got another two hundred the converted

253
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,280
are the chairman's got a good point if a pirate song already in dvd are in the

254
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,400
navy

255
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,760
not really i think jack you know kind of pushing it

256
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,360
seriously some of the i've actually have done a lot more of his music that's in

257
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,820
their something

258
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,800
i mean well so is all of the erotic sounds like literally i have a new

259
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,520
erotic song that's just a copy of an older i saw that an older i saw the

260
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,240
first

261
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,540
couple album was called uh... sex on the phone which is pretty well-known erotic

262
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,260
song outside of the art

263
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,340
they have a new one of the latest album or no i don't think it was late on the

264
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,540
one before it called

265
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,700
tell me on the line

266
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,260
same thing

267
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,740
almost the exact same melody to feel as though i was but it's still like to see

268
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,940
that uh... his uh...

269
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,300
take or was it not take out the ballgame i've got one that's a school's out

270
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,660
uh... which isn't that schools out for summer is is another one and i've also

271
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,940
got one called secret agent man

272
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,740
but it's not

273
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
not uh...

274
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,740
I was hoping it was. I was like, oh, that'd be sweet, but no.

275
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Unfortunately not. Bus Stop would probably get a remix of Secret Agent Man.

276
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Oh, very good point. Artist that sounds the same all the time.

277
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,740
Three words. Or four words. Bye bye baby balloon.

278
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,740
Artist that sounds the same all the time.

279
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,740
Yeah. Yeah.

280
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Anyway. Let's go to the F you of the week.

281
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,740
This is the big fuck you of the week that Jamie always likes to do when she's here.

282
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,140
she's here but unfortunately she's not here this week so we have to fill in for

283
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,380
her with our fuck yous of the week and I allowed the chat room to participate

284
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,940
this week they sent me all their various fuck yous over private message and I

285
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,380
haven't even opened them up to read them yet we're just gonna read them live on

286
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,820
air and see see if they're stupid or what if they're valid F yous or if

287
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,660
they're petty things or what have you but since Jamie's out this week we're

288
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,340
gonna fill in for her with the F you the week I'll go ahead and start my fuck you

289
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,940
the week is myself. I am a total lazy asshole because I promised that we would have a new

290
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,940
intro for the show this week and, well, I got kind of lazy. Another stuff came up and

291
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,500
yada, yada, yada. I didn't get that new intro done. So fuck me, I'm an asshole for not finishing

292
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,980
that intro. Sorry. And also for not doing a damn thing on the webpage. That's my bad.

293
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,860
I was hoping to get the webpage fixed up and all prettied and updated a lot because it's

294
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,700
kind of out of date, but I didn't get around to that either, so I'm sorry, and a big fuck

295
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,980
you to me for messing that up. Do you have a fuck you of the week, Matt? Well, I don't

296
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:04,980
know, because this is in my music, obviously, so... Oh gee, that's better. Let me see. Yeah,

297
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:11,020
FQ2 the... Now, granted, I love Qzart. I love the Entertainment Zone because it's Qzart

298
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,300
is relatively close. Well, goddamn, they're lazy. I mean, seriously, they're very lazy.

299
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,580
I have never... I used to work at Qsar, so I know how lazy you can be at that job. They

300
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,780
were... Did you used to be the guy that would stand there and read out the rules? Yes, I

301
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,100
was. Oh, I wanted your job so bad when I was out of school. Seriously, okay. Here's what,

302
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,300
here's basically what the job consists of at Qsar. You sit on your ass in the office

303
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,780
talking to the manager while someone's doing a brief. But when your brief comes up, you

304
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:46,780
You go do the brief, and then you go help people get in the arena. Sit down, watch people play in the arena, make sure everyone gets out of the arena and go back and sit in the office. It's a lot of sitting, that's it.

305
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:53,780
You don't go out there and arrest players? Oh, well you can, but what's the point? No one really cares anyways.

306
00:21:53,780 --> 00:22:02,780
But, yeah, because they wouldn't order me a pizza, so I had to walk around the corner and do the delicious pizza and go get pizza there. That sucked.

307
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,780
So, big fuck you to Qsar?

308
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,780
Uh, to the Qsar employees.

309
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,780
Alright, fair enough.

310
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,780
I've got a ton of chat room FUs to get to, so I gotta get to the FUs in the chat room.

311
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:23,780
Uh, if you wanna join our chat room, just join any other side IRC server, like IRC.Akeheads.org, and join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

312
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:30,780
And that's the same server that a lot of the big Bomani channels are on, like DDR Freak and 2DX Style, and all those are also on the same server.

313
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,340
that same server. One more. Oh, yes, go on. Sure. And F you to Nickelodeon for canceling

314
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,220
Invader Zim. Again? Well, it's actually gone for good now, I think. It was on this morning.

315
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,460
Well, dammit. They keep changing the time around. F you to them for changing the time

316
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,460
around all the time. I have a big, I have to stop the music, because bless you to TiVo.

317
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,900
Because thanks to TiVo, I just, we just got a TiVo in the house. I can tell it to record

318
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,840
Invader Zim every time it's on, and it will. No matter what time it's on, it'll find when

319
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,040
Invader Zim's on and tape it for me. I love it. I'm sorry, you were saying?

320
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:09,040
That's pretty much it. F you to them and F you to me for missing the whole thing of Trigger

321
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Happy TV because that shit is awesome. That's it.

322
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Alright. Do you have any F yous of the week, Bradley?

323
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
I'll let you have Jamie's music.

324
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Okay, well, I don't know how bad things happen this week, but I think it will fuck you to teeny-buffers that hang around RBGL on our local arcade on Friday nights and sort it into Saturdays.

325
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Boy, we manage to give a big fuck you to them every week on the show, but they deserve it, so go right ahead.

326
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Yeah, they stand around looking stupid and get in the way and look at each other and everything.

327
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Do you hear that? All you ever do is get in the way, you damn kids!

328
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,000
Get off our machine, go away.

329
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,240
Did you notice that it's interesting that this week,

330
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,440
finally, they added a little sign that says,

331
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,280
put your token here if you want to play next.

332
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,640
Because since they got rid of USA, finally,

333
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,800
and they have the fourth plus, now the veterans

334
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,040
are taking over both machines.

335
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,280
So there's no newbie machine for people

336
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,700
to stand in line for and not worry about tokens.

337
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Now you've got the token line on both machines.

338
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,280
And some parents just don't understand

339
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,840
the concept of the token line.

340
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,400
So it had to be explained.

341
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,080
They should have a bat for those type of people.

342
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,980
I got a big orange bat out in the car.

343
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,320
Seriously.

344
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,140
All right, let's get on to the FUs of the week

345
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,180
from the chat room.

346
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,420
And I haven't even read these yet,

347
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,940
so let's see what we've got.

348
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,860
Let's see, Twen gives a big fuck you

349
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,220
to the first mini-competition they had.

350
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,580
Four players, two basic, one trick, one maniac.

351
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,980
He was the maniac.

352
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,980
He got a frigging cata,

353
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,860
and the scoring was based off the triple-A score,

354
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,320
so he got last.

355
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,780
And they got Dynamite Rave hiring Mr. T,

356
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,300
and his cata was Orion78,

357
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:50,300
and he failed it, so he got one. So he basically got screwed in a tournament, so FU to that tournament the twin participated in.

358
00:24:50,300 --> 00:25:01,300
JB gives a big FU fuck you to the Saints Go Marching on 4th Plus, because he accidentally selected Maniac thinking it was trick somehow and failed it at the arcade.

359
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
That's not the machine's fault, dummy.

360
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,300
I have another FU after we're down here, too.

361
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Alright, go ahead with your FU.

362
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Okay, my FU goes to Country Club Plains in their fucking Max machine because it has a fucked up right arrow on the Player 1 side.

363
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,300
So I was playing doubles and I kept failing. I was like, why the hell am I failing?

364
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:26,300
You know what, I think one of RBGL's on Max 2 on the one player side, I think the left arrow is broken too.

365
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,300
So you just can't win anywhere. Anyway, back to chat room.

366
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,300
Joe Mama says, uh, big fuck you to school.

367
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Yeah, school's back in session. I hope you kids are enjoying it. Fuck you to school.

368
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,300
And, uh, SoCalKicks says, uh,

369
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,300
fuck you to life and its endless amount of questions because

370
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,300
I'm not sure if I want to do CG anymore.

371
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,300
I don't know what CG, I don't know if that means that's what he wanted to do when he got

372
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,300
out of school or what have you. Well, that was kind of deep.

373
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,300
The fuck you to life though.

374
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Dave says he's coming over to the show, that's not a fuck you.

375
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Don't send me those messages.

376
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Black Lab says fuck you to Neil, the CVGL tech guy for fucking up the fourth plus installation by not looking in the box for the flash card he needed.

377
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
So you gotta look for all the parts.

378
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Oh, I'm being corrected.

379
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Okay, okay. Computer graphics animation you bastard.

380
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Sorry, Jesus.

381
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:32,860
DCB says give a big fuck you to non-optical mouses, so he hates mouses with balls. He

382
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:42,100
prefers the female mouses, little holes with beams of light shooting out of them. That's

383
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,020
all the fuck yous of the week from this chat room. If you have any additional fuck yous,

384
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,980
just send them to me real quick over a private message. I'm in our chat room at Channel Pound

385
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,100
Orange Lounge over on IRC.eggheads.org.

386
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,340
Chat room's liking that, the lights, beams.

387
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,620
Little station updates to take care of.

388
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,180
There are some little housekeeping issues I need to

389
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,380
tell you guys about.

390
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,700
As you know, we rebroadcast this show.

391
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,820
The show we do tonight gets rebroadcast on Monday night at

392
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,100
7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

393
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,200
And then an old show, a classic show, is rebroadcast at

394
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,620
9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

395
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,940
And this week, it's going to be the show with the interviews from the Dallarmendy tournament,

396
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,320
that Mountain Mike's tournament that was a few weeks ago.

397
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,340
Those interviews are up in the old show rotation.

398
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,460
That'll be at 9 o'clock on Monday.

399
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,980
However, starting with this last week, we tested it this last week and it's a go.

400
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,380
Starting, we're going to also rebroadcast on Thursdays at 2 o'clock Pacific Standard

401
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,380
Time.

402
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,360
And that's more for the benefit of people on the East Coast or just people overseas

403
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,780
that want to try and catch the show at a different time.

404
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,780
Or are we?

405
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,020
Because we do 7 o'clock tonight, we do 7 o'clock on Mondays, so we'll take a five hours earlier

406
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
on Thursdays.

407
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,420
We can listen to it at work.

408
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,900
You can listen to it at work.

409
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Exactly.

410
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,340
You can thieve your line some more.

411
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,980
That's mostly for the benefit for the East Coast people.

412
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,600
I kind of tried to time it so it would come on right when they get home from school on

413
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,260
Thursday.

414
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,420
I'm being questioned on calling things a classic when it only happened three weeks ago for

415
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
that show.

416
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,800
Well, yeah okay.

417
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,080
But every episode of Orange Lounge is a classic right?

418
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Right?

419
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
Yeah.

420
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,160
Anyway, actually we will probably start the rotation of old shows again either next week

421
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,880
or the week after going all the way back to episode one so the old show rotation will

422
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
be like a couple months behind.

423
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,200
So it will really give you a chance to catch up at that point.

424
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,260
We should do one day where we just play every show back to back.

425
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,240
We are going to do the marathon, I just don't know when yet.

426
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,880
Probably in the next couple weeks, like maybe weekend after next, something like that.

427
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,680
it's gonna happen. I just gotta get the timing of it all worked out. But we will do back-to-back-to-back

428
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,640
episodes, so if you... It's gonna be like MTV re-running

429
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,440
Real World or Sorority Life. You can just catch everything that's happened in one day.

430
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,200
You don't even have to listen every night, but we'd like it if you do.

431
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,720
Speaking of which, have you seen the previews for Real World?

432
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,520
Was it Las Vegas? No, I don't watch crap.

433
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,120
Yeah. No, I'm just kidding. I used to watch the Real World, but I think the last one I

434
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,000
watched was

435
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,880
The one, it was Seattle, because you had the guy that bitch slapped the girl as she got

436
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
in the car.

437
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
That's the last real world I saw.

438
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,400
Let me just put it this way, they're getting really desperate.

439
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,360
I think every single person on there, their parents either died, got divorced, are druggies,

440
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,720
are gay, one or the other, they're all like that, and they're all messed up, and they're

441
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,040
all like horny and having sex with each other.

442
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Well that's ratings!

443
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,080
That's it, but it's not real at all, it's just like, let's get this big bunch of dysfunctional

444
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:46,080
people, throw them together in a little closet and hope that everything works out.

445
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:53,160
The one show I have been watching is Big Brother 3. I don't know why. I somehow just get gravitated

446
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,520
to this. You've got a lot of real fucked up people in that house too, but sometimes it's

447
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,980
like you enjoy watching things get set on fire. You like when things go bad and horribly

448
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,460
wrong on tv so

449
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,320
is another big f you've heard

450
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,820
you know the weekend actually for everything

451
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,340
is that you

452
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,260
is going to reality tv i hate reality tv is

453
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,080
section

454
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,640
except how is it an option because it's not really real it's not real at all it's

455
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,300
like retarded i mean

456
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,020
all these shows like okay survivor maybe that was an original idea all now

457
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,420
Now everyone is trying to copy Survivor.

458
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,700
I don't care what happens to these people.

459
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
I hope they all die.

460
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,400
I'm just waiting for Jetplane to come overhead and crash down into them.

461
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,480
You don't want to go on one of these shows to win a million dollars?

462
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
I'd go on the show.

463
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,920
What do you think, what do you think if they really, now remember there's a rumor a couple

464
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,520
months back, I don't know how, the truth behind it, but that they were going to do a game

465
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
show out of DDR.

466
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,520
What do you think about, a reality show based around, because you could consider a game

467
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,000
show a reality show, a reality show based on DDR, what do you think?

468
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah, that's about as good as the DDR movie.

469
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And while we're at it, let's have a DDR sitcom. It's a whole comedy set around DDR.

470
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I have to introduce Dave. Dave's in the house now, so big hello to Dave, who of course, five seconds into him getting here, he wants to say something, so let's...

471
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Well, first I was going to say what happened during the show, because I wasn't here.

472
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And then...

473
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's not our fault.

474
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Well, I was just, you know, like, five second recap, what happened?

475
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We talked about stuff.

476
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Let's see, Loki bitched about DDR Sims, Loki bitched about QZR, Loki bitched about reality TV shows, and...

477
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Sky bitched about Loki.

478
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yes, Sky bitched about Loki.

479
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That's about it.

480
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
When did people start talking about themselves in the third person? When did that start happening?

481
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't know.

482
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Okay.

483
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Just now, it's the cool thing to do.

484
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay, well Dave was wondering, about this DDR reality show, how would that work?

485
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's like, go to Survivor, uh-oh, the challenge, unless you get knocked off, you have to full-combo this catastrophic harm.

486
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I don't know what they would do.

487
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
All I heard about you talking earlier was Paranoia, God Mix, or something.

488
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Dance for immunity and throw people off the machines.

489
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm going to knock 20 Bamani freaks in the arcade in the middle of the night and, I don't know, throw things at them.

490
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Disney rave mad ownage stuff. Cool.

491
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes. Do you have any FUs of the week, Dave?

492
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
FU people who play Soul Calibur are against me because you're taking down my character.

493
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,960
Oh, I played Soulcalibur II for the first time, for the first time yesterday, and I

494
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,640
don't know how to play Soulcalibur at all.

495
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,040
I just kind of butt-mash, and I started on the Conquest, and I beat everybody.

496
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
I was so happy.

497
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,360
I joined the green people, and I whooped on the red people, and the funny thing is, is

498
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,400
that Will Slinky, if you're listening, we all picked his character to fight, because

499
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,480
we wanted to pick on him, because we found him.

500
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,920
Did you fight my character, because I was also in the red arm?

501
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
I don't remember.

502
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
I don't think so.

503
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,680
a lot of noobs and then Will was last and both me and Glen kicked his ass so we had

504
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
fun.

505
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Yeah.

506
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,120
Conquest mode is the best because you fight people who are basically the same level so

507
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,120
if you join in with a new character you'll basically fight all the easiest guys in that

508
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,880
army but once you get the good people you'll start fighting people.

509
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Ah, I see.

510
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,200
Well, I have to say, my Ivy, she rules.

511
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Ivy is the bomb.

512
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
So.

513
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,440
Isn't this a DDR show and we're here just talking about Soul Calibur?

514
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Oh well.

515
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,500
I know a lot of the people that play DDR also and other games.

516
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,500
you don't have to restrict yourself to just the music games

517
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,340
i got to play more dance maniacs this weekend

518
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,980
oh really how was that i love that game

519
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,380
what is it about dancing actually enjoyed it's just it's i don't know it's

520
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,980
you think there's a lot of possibility for freestyle and i did not realize

521
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,900
because actually i watched uh...

522
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,040
mister wendell and this other guy uh... doing freestyle in there and

523
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,020
quite amazing it's just fun i don't know what it is

524
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,820
It's like, why do people play popin' music?

525
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,020
I think people play popin' music for the big, round buttons.

526
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,300
Otherwise, they don't play DDS.

527
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Popin' music's pretty rad.

528
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,780
It's just, I don't know.

529
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,220
It's like, why are you drawn to play DDR for the first time?

530
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,660
Ooh, big flashing lights.

531
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,940
You go to play popin' music because, ooh, big buttons I

532
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,380
can push.

533
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,020
You know, I don't know.

534
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,220
That's what I liked about it.

535
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,420
Yeah, and about the maniacs.

536
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,660
You have to hit, like, four at once.

537
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,780
You have to hit them with your forearm.

538
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,500
It's crazy.

539
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,220
Yeah.

540
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,780
OK, anyway, back to Dave's topic.

541
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,780
About the Dance Maniacs, I really do not find that appealing at all.

542
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,780
Well, gee, why not?

543
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,780
It's like the Macarena mixed in with the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, or whatever it's called, and it's just moving your hands up.

544
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,780
It's Para, except that you're restricted to two buttons at different height levels. And that's no fun.

545
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,780
Para is, okay, not that good. DDR.

546
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Yeah, but they're different games.

547
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,780
It's not trying to be Para Para, it's just trying to be Dance Maniacs.

548
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,780
Yeah, and yeah.

549
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,780
And it's okay to play Dance Maniacs with your feet.

550
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:14,780
Yeah, I tried that and then I tried using my head and I hit it on the machine.

551
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,780
And it was pointy.

552
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Actually it's pretty funny, they had a bunch of spots where you had to hit both undersides and this guy kept doing this thing where he'd grab the bar on the machine and actually do a hip thrust into the machine.

553
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
the game.

554
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:33,360
You just kind of have to just mount one of those little sensors that's sticking out like

555
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,540
right on like a cowboy.

556
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:41,780
But it worked, it looked like really funny but it worked so, you know, whatever.

557
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,980
I'm getting some late submitted FUs of the week so let's have a look at them.

558
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,540
I'm going to just drive this bit into the ground the other night.

559
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,640
JB gives a big fuck you to regular DDR for not having the dance magic mode that Disney

560
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Mix has.

561
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Yeah, I mean, that's a given. Dance Magic's been needed in regular DVR for a long time.

562
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,640
23rd Magus says, a big fuck you to ZTNet and whoever else sells the Boom PSX to USB converters.

563
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I got seriously fucking stiff out of 20 bucks, so fuck you to ZTNet.

564
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Everyone will remember that more later on.

565
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,640
Yeah, well, let's talk about that. Talk about the USBs, because there's so many options here for going PlayStation to PC,

566
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,840
PC, and I don't know shit about it, so you gotta help me here, Logy.

567
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,940
Okay. Well, all these stupid converters that they have out there, they're meant for one thing,

568
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,640
is making the actual PlayStation controllers work with the PC.

569
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,240
Problem is, is that, you know, most people buy these

570
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,140
to use with, like, DDR SIMs and that kind of stuff. They're not meant for that.

571
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,240
I mean, the way DDR pads are set up, it's really funky, because,

572
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,140
you know, they have them mapped as buttons. So basically, the problem is, is

573
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,440
all these converters, they map the actual directional pad

574
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:23,240
not as buttons, but as axes. So, what the problem is, is you can't push, like, up and down at the same time, like where there might be a jump, or you can't push left and right. It's just you can only push, you know, one direction at one time. So that's the problem. Most people buy these pads, and especially, you know, big FV2 fries for putting the kiki joists next to the DDR PC, because people think, oh, it's going to work with, you know, the DDR PC. Nope, not at all.

575
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,240
And DCB wants to send a big fuck you to the Kiki Joys, by the way, because the software doesn't work on his computer.

576
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Yeah, that's another thing. I have two USB converters also that I bought a long time ago to try using with my SIM.

577
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,240
I ended up having to buy a parallel one, and trust me, that was the best move I ever made.

578
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:49,240
The parallel ones work great, and they work with the standard DirectPad Pro 5.0 or whatever, just the drivers that they have.

579
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,740
that they have. Works great, you can remap the buttons to whatever, and it's awesome.

580
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,540
So buy the parallel ones. They have, I forget what it's called, mine was like, it's compatible

581
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,300
with like DualShock or something like that, and it was a two player parallel one, so just

582
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:14,100
buy that one, it's like 20 bucks, it's the best way to go. Do not buy USB ones. USB controllers

583
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,260
or converters do not work with the DDR pads. There might be one out there, but you're

584
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,260
going to go through about...

585
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
Not that you've found yet.

586
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,140
Yeah, you're going to go through about 50 of them before you find, you know, one that

587
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:28,660
actually works. So, just, you know, buy the parallel ones, save yourself some time. Now,

588
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,580
if you're using them for, like, say, I don't know, BeatMania, you know, 2DX or something

589
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,020
like that, they'll work fine for that, but just not DDR.

590
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:41,100
All right. Speaking of things going over Dave's head, because he was sitting there going,

591
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,860
this whole chat is going over my head because I don't play DDR on the PC, chat room wants

592
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,060
to know how tall are you Dave? Because they're seeing you on the webcam right now. You didn't

593
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,540
even know we had a webcam up right now, yes we got a webcam. How tall are you? Freakishly

594
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:01,540
tall, I don't know, not that tall, 6'1". I'm taller, I'm 6'2". But I'm sitting down so

595
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,940
they can't tell. So, last fuck yous of the week, okay, I've got a couple more, so these

596
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,340
to the last Fuck You's of the Week. Black Lab says, Fuck you to sims that don't work

597
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,580
on Macs. I think that's a very valid Fuck You of the Week, because Macs are being neglected,

598
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,340
of course. You need to buy a real computer. I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

599
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,180
Yeah, I was just going to say. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

600
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
When you make a computer that...

601
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,240
Macs are cool. Macs are great for art stuff. I like Macs.

602
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,140
Yeah, they look like artsy computers that you'd find in an art gallery, because, let's

603
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,660
see, one looked like a toaster, worked like a toaster, pretty much was a toaster, and

604
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,040
now they have one that looks like a stupid little sphere with this thing sticking out

605
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,400
of it. You've got to hand it to Max for coming up with these really freaky dines, like the

606
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,520
clear speakers. That you can't upgrade. That's the thing that sucks about Max. Also, Gateway

607
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,520
made this really retarded looking computer that's trying to copy the iPod. I mean, I

608
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,100
hated Gateway to begin with, and this isn't really helping them. It just looks like crap.

609
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,340
I think we're about to start a war in the chat. We're on Max versus PC. So let me get

610
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,160
to the other F.U. of the week. Alright Dave, what do you want to say? I was just going

611
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,480
say that George Foreman Grill looks exactly like the iMac. Like, if you put them next

612
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,600
to each other, I thought that it was an iMac commercial. It's like, hamburger, hot dog.

613
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Did you try to cook a hot dog on an iPod? Well, it did look pretty appetizing, you know,

614
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,980
to just like put a hot dog in between the keys of the iMac. But, you know, they look

615
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,300
exactly like, and they both have the same transparent colors as well. But they do have...

616
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,600
your hot dogs off the keyboard! They do have, seriously though, for the G4, they really

617
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,800
have this kick-ass monitor for it. They have this, like, high-definition 24-inch monitor

618
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:48,160
out there for the Max and those kick-ass. But other than that, yeah. Yeah. Uh, fuck

619
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,360
you from Takeout Kid to UCB for not getting DDR Max 2 and making the current 5th Mix a

620
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:00,640
dollar. Wow. Well, at one point, the Metreon was charging $2 a game for 5th Mix, I believe,

621
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Yeah, it's two dollars a game for fifth mix, so that means four dollars for doubles.

622
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:14,640
Yeah, I remember when the Metreon charged like a buck fifty or two dollars for like first mix or one point five or something ridiculous.

623
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,960
ridiculous. Then you go right into the other room and they have the same thing for like

624
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,240
a quarter or fifty cents less if you do it.

625
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,640
Anywho, no more fuck yous of the week. You've got to save them until next week now. JB has

626
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,240
got a question for you, Loki. He wants to know if you know anything about DSE, the DDR

627
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,680
Sequence Editor, and what it is.

628
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,580
Yeah, the DDR Sequence Editor is an old editing, or it's an edit making program that's pretty

629
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:47,900
old it's like compatible you know fifth mix down it doesn't do free zeros or

630
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,220
anything like that it's pretty good it works on like older PCs and stuff if

631
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:58,100
you're actually going to use an actual editor for you know making edits on your

632
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:06,140
PC for DDR I'd recommend the was it's called DDR edit max 300 and it's

633
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,700
actually pretty cool it supports free zeros and everything like that the only

634
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,460
the problem is it doesn't really, some of the edits that are made with it aren't really

635
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,340
compatible, you have to go in and hex edit something so you kind of have to know what

636
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
you're doing.

637
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Okay.

638
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,580
But it's, you know, I've never used it yet because it's the only thing that will run

639
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,580
on my...

640
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,580
Quit breaking things!

641
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
What are you doing?

642
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,700
What the hell are you doing?

643
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,620
Dave's playing with a webcam, just ignore Dave.

644
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,420
Stop making animals in compromising positions here.

645
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Anyway.

646
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,980
So yeah, it's good for if you have an older computer like my crappy ass laptop that I

647
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:44,980
use for editing DDR songs at the arcade I go to, how sad is that, and so yeah, it's

648
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,660
the only thing that'll work, so give it a try, but you know, they're all Japanese, that's

649
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,780
hard to say.

650
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,780
Another question, what do you know about this new simulator, looks like it's coming out,

651
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,980
called Feet of Fury, you know anything about this at all?

652
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,380
This is the first I've heard of it.

653
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,380
Oh really?

654
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,820
Alright, well let's go to a break, we'll let you read up on this page, see what you think

655
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,580
of it, we'll go to a break here real fast, and we'll come back.

656
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,940
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and thanks for

657
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,400
tuning in, and we will be right back.

658
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,940
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the music of our show.

659
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,940
Can you hear the cheering?

660
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,940
Super performance!

661
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:40,940
Nice!

662
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:50,940
Perfect!

663
00:45:50,940 --> 00:46:18,820
Your dance showed us a dream for the future.

664
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,820
Tomorrow is another day.

665
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:27,820
You're the one who'll give us hope for the future!

666
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,700
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

667
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:33,860
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica, Saturdays, 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.

668
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:40,860
of civic standard time at understudationlive.org

669
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:47,300
And now it's time for Erotic Op Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

670
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,260
favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

671
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,260
Do it all night, do it with me.

672
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:58,580
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible, do you take vocal lessons, kill your teacher!

673
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,860
In the heat of the night.

674
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,260
Oh god, I think my ears are bleeding.

675
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,480
I liked it.

676
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,300
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next!

677
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,300
Ummm...

678
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,420
That was cool.

679
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:19,420
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic. Next!

680
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,480
Yes!

681
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,380
Yes, that's it!

682
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,300
We have a winner!

683
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:30,880
A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

684
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,400
yes the star is born here on orange lounge radio

685
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,560
they've told me i couldn't come back saying that as i always say it

686
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,440
uh... i figured though that's really the last time i'm going to be able to use

687
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,940
that i'm gonna have to take that out of rotation now because

688
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,840
american idols over it's done with

689
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,720
so the parity it doesn't work

690
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,120
people are going to forget about american aisle next week

691
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,200
that chick who won

692
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,680
people i get a care come next week

693
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,400
care now

694
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,520
leading care them

695
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,020
farewell to that little promo baby suggested i do something for the new

696
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,700
survivor that's debuting

697
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,160
do some kind of uh...

698
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,720
orange lounge survivor i have no idea how that works

699
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,620
they back in advertise like a big twist

700
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,240
who coming up a big new intro and then like

701
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,420
not do it like i did this week well

702
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,200
i was going to mention since does no sanchar and someone was listening to a

703
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,760
remix of what the move

704
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,880
yes which kai jar memory i remember reading something back on the dvd

705
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,400
armaniac sports

706
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,120
about eight actual

707
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:33,800
good version of let them move. Not possible, I say. I know, I know, I have my doubts too,

708
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:40,660
but they said it was the training song in Beatmania 3, and it was sung by a guy, not

709
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:46,260
some crazy ass chick that can't sing. Let them move! So I challenge people out there

710
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,900
to find the damn MP3 for that so we can listen to it and see if it's actually good or if

711
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,340
it just sucks or if it doesn't exist. Well, I think that you could make a good one if

712
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,760
You made an instrumental remix of it.

713
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,820
You know, you took out the...

714
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,820
and then you took out the music

715
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,400
and then you put in new music.

716
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,660
You know what they need to do is because a lot of times they'll take the old

717
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,980
I don't know, they'll take the Japanese songs, you know, sung by B4U

718
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,540
and they'll convert them into English. Well, let's just have them sing that in, you know, Japanese.

719
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,140
Or crash.

720
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,260
Which is a breakdown, basically.

721
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:25,420
well that's which is being requested in the chat room during the break and uh...

722
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,180
no

723
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,780
i don't like crash personally

724
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,060
so i'm gonna take it out of everybody uh...

725
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,460
maybe we'll see

726
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,180
if i get like money

727
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:40,100
or other kinds of favors and baes and pleading maybe we'll play it

728
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,140
or not but i thought about you haha

729
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,300
uh... what else we want to talk about

730
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,240
uh... here is that sam

731
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,680
uh... that we saw the other one we're looking at during the break and i

732
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,840
actually took it off the screen let me go back

733
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,140
it looks like somebody is developing something for dreamcast

734
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,700
and it's going to be a tdr simulator there

735
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,340
it sounds like they're being kind of careful not to call it like tdr but

736
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,120
they're saying it's

737
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:11,400
in the same being this tdr it's called feet of fury

738
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,720
you know theory special

739
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,720
Well, it's like, I don't know, it's sort of like, it looks like it's just all game's magic mode, that's pretty much what it is.

740
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:32,720
Hmm, I don't know, let's see, they're saying, I'm looking at their website, and if you're in our chatroom right now, our website address was posted, and maybe Twen will post it again for you, if you want to see this page.

741
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,720
It looks like DDR is going to be on the Dreamcast, basically, but it's more of a competitive

742
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
thing.

743
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,720
They're saying you want something a little more interesting or challenging and it doesn't

744
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,280
require yet still more speed.

745
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,480
So they've spent over a year building tools and developing what will give you a step in

746
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,760
the right direction for beat games.

747
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,800
And it's going to have a little bit of 3D.

748
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,200
You can use a standard controller.

749
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,520
You can use a DDR dance mat.

750
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,400
They've got 12 songs in it.

751
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,500
That looks like a demo of what's going on.

752
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,900
Some musicians, I'm trying to see what kind of, they're saying it's going to be a little

753
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,900
more competitive.

754
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,380
I can't find any more information about that.

755
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,260
Anyways, they're expecting a beta release of it's going to be this October, October

756
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,980
1st, and then the expected final release is going to be January 1st of next year.

757
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,780
So, looking forward to that.

758
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,780
Cool.

759
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,780
Well, that'll be interesting.

760
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,460
We'll review that as soon as there's a release, so.

761
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,820
And if anybody from that group is listening and wants to give us a sneak advance copy,

762
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,220
hey, I don't say no to that stuff either.

763
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,540
Right.

764
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,740
Okay.

765
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,460
Oh, big story since we're...

766
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,980
It's been two weeks since we've been here in the studio, quote unquote, because last

767
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,180
week, as you know, we taped an advance at Roseville Golf Land.

768
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,260
A lot of mixed reaction to that show.

769
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:54,140
Some people really liked it, some people thought it was ass, but what can you do, you know?

770
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,140
I wasn't there.

771
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,140
I was listening.

772
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,520
I thought it was the one part was cool where you were like, yeah,

773
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,600
we're from that school and doing an interview. Yeah.

774
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,480
And then the rest of it was kind of boring except for like brag on,

775
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,240
you know, that stuff. But it was okay. It wasn't that great.

776
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,760
Well, thank you for that honest opinion Cisco. I appreciate it.

777
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,600
Like Ebert Cisco. Maybe you're too young for that. I don't know.

778
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,680
He died a while ago. No, the fat one didn't die. A fat one still alive.

779
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,000
The fat one ate him, dammit.

780
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,240
Uh, we were actually secretly hoping we would get kicked out of Golf Land, because it would have been great radio.

781
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,680
You know, like, oh shit, what do we do now? We'll hitchhike our way over to...

782
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,480
Well, we wouldn't have to hitchhike to Brookfield's. We'd walk over there, hitchhike our way over to a nearby volcano.

783
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:47,680
Now broadcasting at the volcano on hole three.

784
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,160
Oh, shit. Alright.

785
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,520
But while we were gone, this big new story came out.

786
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,260
And I'm sure everybody's heard of it by now, but we want to

787
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,040
talk about it anyway, because we like to be

788
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,440
repetitive on the show.

789
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,680
Greece, the Isle of Greece banned electronic games,

790
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:10,400
period, meaning no DDR, no Game Boys, no Nintendos, no

791
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,120
arcade games, no Solitaire on your computer with Windows.

792
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,040
Why?

793
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:20,040
because they want to prevent gambling

794
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,520
what do you think of this

795
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,160
i think it's retarded

796
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,540
i bet you two bucks that it won't last ten days

797
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,320
i think it's been ten days hasn't it

798
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,800
yeah

799
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,800
i just gambled so

800
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,240
wherever you are

801
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,940
you are losing

802
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,980
i'm gambling over whether or not it works or not

803
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,120
and that

804
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,000
revokes the point of

805
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,640
gosh said i didn't

806
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,000
and being corrected it wasn't just the gambling it was the violence

807
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,720
in games to be as you know

808
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,040
solitaire and minesweeper can be a bloody fucking battle when you lose

809
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,560
did minesweeper i mean the bombs they want to keep that away from the kids

810
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,280
yet

811
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,240
flag

812
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,040
to get it wrong

813
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,480
and they're just bitter over the olympics

814
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,720
uh... also for those who don't know

815
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,400
i don't know they're just bitter

816
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,400
that they didn't get to host the-

817
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,880
Freakin' crazy Greeks and their damn mythology and their gods and stuff. Where's their gods

818
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,600
of irony and gods of stupidity? They must be working full swing now.

819
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,440
You can address those cards and letters to Loki in care of Orange Flown's radio.

820
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:33,160
I'm sorry, Rob. I've probably heard all of our listeners listening from Greece.

821
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,200
Actually, I believe we do have listeners from Greece. I'm going to have to check the statistics

822
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,880
really fast. Let's go check the stats.

823
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,820
of some interesting things though about the stats which surprised me

824
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,200
canada's no longer the number two country listening to this program you

825
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,400
know it is

826
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,160
japan

827
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,280
you know what's third

828
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,440
green

829
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,800
they agree to know that yeah we invite the greek to live vicariously through us

830
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,920
if you've had your video games robbed from you hey we'll tell you about what

831
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,040
you're missing out on

832
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,920
no way i'm i'm just

833
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,480
uh... no i i have my i think is right now

834
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,280
wait

835
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,280
Wait, how many people are listening?

836
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
Enough.

837
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,280
It's like, yeah, we got the number.

838
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,280
It's like coming in second place with two listeners

839
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,280
is Japan, and then tied for third is Canada, Korea, and the U.S.

840
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,280
No, no.

841
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
It's more than that.

842
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,280
We will be the new underground movement for computer games

843
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,280
and track track games.

844
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,280
Oh my god.

845
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,280
We will overcome.

846
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,280
We shall overcome.

847
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,280
See, this is what happens when you play

848
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,280
too much 2DX like Bradley.

849
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,280
Good job, Grace.

850
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,840
Greece, you stopped it at the root.

851
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,400
I'm looking for Greece.

852
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,680
No, nobody has listened to this show from Greece, unfortunately.

853
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,240
Hey, what's that there?

854
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,360
I see one stream from Greece.

855
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,480
The very, very bottom, Greece.

856
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,560
The very bottom.

857
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,840
One stream connected from Greece, not even for a full minute.

858
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,400
So that's somebody who connected and listened to that, you're listening to Orange Lounge

859
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,000
Radio, and then just like disconnected right there.

860
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,800
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

861
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,280
haha greases have electronic games

862
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,940
no i think i think they got that far and then like a little underground gestapo

863
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,700
grecian people came in and was like

864
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,940
what are you doing you can't be listening to something from out of

865
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,780
the country

866
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,780
and then they break it

867
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,940
i wonder if this show it would be illegal in greece

868
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:25,880
maybe you know especially we're like uh...

869
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,500
freaking out propaganda over there you know

870
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,100
and this is a weird thing it applies to tourists too so if you're going to go to greece

871
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,920
take your game boy gazelle for your ass in jail they don't care if you're stupid

872
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,600
american or what

873
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,760
i think that they just take the gameboy and then they've got like a secret ball

874
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,800
of all these game boys and stuff is that like the landfills of the three twenty

875
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,640
six hundred games like all the old copies of e t that no one bought this

876
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,520
little until somewhere no i don't i don't think it'd be like a landfill they

877
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,280
keep in mind

878
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,840
you know i don't know if it's a president of the king of greece or you

879
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,560
know and for the king of greece whatever the god of three years

880
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,360
because it was our or fertile mississippi

881
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,080
well i i think it's it's not triple up

882
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,600
what but i get

883
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,040
looks at the great

884
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,400
okay so anyway

885
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
john for all of the classes

886
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,320
is uh...

887
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,520
secretly made up this whole rule got a secret greeting to stop

888
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,040
going around taking all the games

889
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,480
just so he can play them

890
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,200
and then he makes a secret

891
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,240
black market

892
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,400
video sorry

893
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,820
uh... messing with uh...

894
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,660
Bradley's 2DX controller. He's taking out his aggressions on the Greek

895
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,900
on Bradley's controller, and Bradley doesn't like that.

896
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,460
Bradley, he's normally the quiet type, but then sometimes he does his little evil takeover

897
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:43,460
the world type C-Lab 2021 type thing. No, and anyway, back to my story on the Grecian

898
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:49,780
underworld takeover. And so after they steal all of the games from

899
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,780
everyone else

900
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,620
they'll make a secret black market

901
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:57,260
john travolta will be able to play all the games that why do you think it's a

902
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,500
good dancing

903
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,380
i mean he can do all those little special hip thrust move things like you

904
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,940
are on crack

905
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,580
now i'm being told i'm being told if we were to like gamble on this show

906
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,180
that it would be illegal in greece

907
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,440
so

908
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,160
i'd bet you a dollar low-key i bet you one dollar

909
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,780
that we're not going to get any higher than that we are now legal

910
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:20,980
that greece will forever be the last place country on our list what do you

911
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,620
say

912
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:26,260
take me up on that that will anybody tell them about uh... yes

913
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,820
yes building up on that okay therefore now we are gambling on the show and the

914
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,740
show is now a legal increase so if you're listening

915
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,640
the cops are coming for you lock the doors lock the windows

916
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,700
do they have doors windows agrees

917
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,620
i don't know of course it if you don't have video games that side

918
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:45,540
primitive cavemen without their video games haha

919
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:51,460
yes limited crappy olympics

920
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,940
who that's what the sound like i don't know

921
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,860
as i get every snobby british people

922
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:02,220
wait wait what's what's great and great

923
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,980
i said i'd like an hour

924
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,260
let's see okay

925
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,860
here's my nephews for the week here uh... we've got uh... f you degrees

926
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:16,860
FU to Denmark, FU to Belgium, Taiwan, Yugoslavia, Germany, Pakistan, Netherlands

927
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:21,420
Taiwan gets an excuse, because if you ever looked at a lot of the games you buy, they were made in Taiwan

928
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,820
so they don't have time to listen to the show, because they're all in slave labor making these games

929
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:28,820
Oh, and special FU to Yugoslavia for beating the USA team

930
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:33,500
No, the Taiwanese are in slave labor copying the games from Japan

931
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:39,500
Wow, look, I can't believe it, Sweden is actually up there

932
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:51,500
Wait, okay. I bet people that they can't guess what the number, wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven ranked is.

933
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,500
Like, I know.

934
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Yeah, because you're looking at the thing, of course you know, Rob. Anyway, since you can't see it, it's Venezuela.

935
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:05,500
People in Venezuela listening to us talking about DDR and I find that good.

936
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:09,500
DDRs that hit worldwide, what can you say? It's a big thing.

937
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,500
New Mexico, right above Venezuela. Somebody want to know where Mexico ranks?

938
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,500
The French. The French you're listing. The French? Now, didn't we make fun of the French a few shows back?

939
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,500
I seem to remember somebody went off on the French. It was probably a Brad thing.

940
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,500
I know I remember on our boards, I blame the French for the whole

941
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,500
getting rid of the games in Greece. There was no

942
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,500
correlation, but I blame the French. I think that was it.

943
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:38,380
I don't think that there was any public slander of the French on this radio.

944
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,380
Well, maybe we need some.

945
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,380
You know what?

946
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:45,260
I think that the French, personally, I really like French people.

947
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:50,420
They make good food, and they've got one of those chefs that are on the Iron Chef, along

948
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,900
with other countries that I don't see.

949
01:04:53,900 --> 01:05:00,420
Yes, we have every country that has an Iron Chef guy listening to this show.

950
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,620
I bet the stats are going off.

951
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:07,620
Alright, I'd like to give a shout-out to Salman Laden for listening to us from Pakistan.

952
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,620
So, uh, way to go.

953
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,620
Keep up the good work.

954
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,620
Yeah!

955
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,620
Yeah!

956
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,620
Okay.

957
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:17,180
Address those cards and letters once again to Loki because of views and opinions, views

958
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,100
based on this show, blah blah blah.

959
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,620
Now let's look at cities in the US.

960
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:26,200
Obviously, Sacramento ranked number one, no surprise, because we're all in Sacramento,

961
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,140
we all listen to this station, you know, they all come started here.

962
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:32,540
You know, I knew AOL was big, but I never knew that they were their own city.

963
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:35,540
Well, that's the weird thing is that AOL all goes through one thing, so they show up as

964
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,700
one city on here.

965
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,620
Anybody that's on AOL has their own city.

966
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,980
Look at this, San Francisco followed by Columbus, Ohio.

967
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,460
We've got fans in Columbus.

968
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,460
Word.

969
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:49,940
Well, I did a big shout out to us on the DDR East Coast Invasion boards and everything.

970
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,460
Let's see who's in last place.

971
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:55,180
Let's see who's in the last place and who we need to rough up some people.

972
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,860
You want to guess what city is in last place?

973
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,140
Wait, is this just National City?

974
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,980
This is just the US.

975
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,980
Just the US.

976
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:04,200
Now remember, this doesn't just count the live show, this is also the Bahmani Music

977
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
& More program.

978
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,200
Bismarck, North Dakota.

979
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
North Dakota.

980
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,200
You're saying Bismarck, North Dakota.

981
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,200
Bismarck.

982
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,200
Here we go.

983
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,200
Come on, Bismarck.

984
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,200
Come on, Bismarck.

985
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,200
It is Des Moines.

986
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,200
No!

987
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,200
It was close!

988
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,200
Damn it!

989
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,200
Des Moines is in last place.

990
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,200
Followed by Bakersfield.

991
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,600
Where the hell is that?

992
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
They have computers there.

993
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,880
Bakersfield's like, kind of by, like, it's a little poo town, right?

994
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,880
Between...

995
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,880
Is that like...

996
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,880
Cool?

997
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,880
Yes.

998
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,880
Sort of.

999
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,880
It's between here and LA, really.

1000
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Great, fine, if I'm not mistaken.

1001
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,880
Wait, what's the... hold on, scroll back up here for a second.

1002
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,880
No, don't scroll.

1003
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,880
Oh, yeah, that causes dropouts, but yeah.

1004
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,880
Okay, sorry.

1005
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:40,880
That's alright.

1006
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,880
I'm causing dropouts.

1007
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,880
Look out.

1008
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,880
And then Denver counts for one city for like six different states.

1009
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,880
That's pretty cool.

1010
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,880
They've got like Denver, Colorado, M.T., I don't know what that is.

1011
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,880
Montana.

1012
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
Nebraska, Nevada.

1013
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,880
Well, that's because theoretically anybody right on the borders could be connecting through

1014
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,880
a hub in Denver, so that would count.

1015
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,880
That would count.

1016
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,880
This is getting really boring.

1017
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,760
We need to go back to talking about Bomani.

1018
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,240
Let's check Sky's private messages in the chat room.

1019
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,960
This show sucks.

1020
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,240
Oh, gee, thank you.

1021
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,480
They want to have the webcam at a better angle.

1022
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,440
If you would mind adjusting that, that would be nice.

1023
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,440
Let's see what else I have.

1024
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,440
Dave, do not touch the webcam.

1025
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,200
Dave, you're not allowed to touch the webcam.

1026
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,160
Dave, you are the weakest webcam.

1027
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,160
Goodbye.

1028
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,160
Dave.

1029
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,160
Dave.

1030
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,160
Dave Dave

1031
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,800
Put it down no 2dx for you what the hell you're putting it like the way up

1032
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,400
There Dave making a microphone busy on our webcam

1033
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,420
And if you want to know where the webcams located you have to be in our chat room at IRC

1034
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,940
Eggheads org just join channel pound orange

1035
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,320
Yes, that's why I do on this show

1036
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,720
Okay, now we are going to talk about

1037
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,720
about what Rob wants to talk about.

1038
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:00,880
Yes. What I also have on the list. Okay, let's talk about this. Konami very soon is supposed

1039
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:07,600
to be announcing some kind of online Bahmani game. Don't know what it's going to be, but

1040
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,780
it's going to be an online music, actually I shouldn't say it's Bahmani, but if it's

1041
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:14,040
Konami and if it's a music game, it's probably going to be Bahmani, but it's going to be

1042
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:19,200
some kind of music game that's going to be playable online. What do you guys think it's

1043
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,320
going to be?

1044
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,800
We talked about this once before, I'm not sure if it was on the air or not, but I think

1045
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:30,000
that we basically all thought that it would be something around frequency or something

1046
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
like that with different players doing different instruments or combining to form a song or

1047
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,480
something of that sort, I don't know.

1048
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,280
So it's basically a rip-off of frequency, you think?

1049
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,840
It's Marshall Beat Online.

1050
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,600
partial b on like

1051
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,640
the new marshall be is so awesome because it's got can't touch this and

1052
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,080
that you can't touch this in marshall d

1053
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,880
you need to explain to me what what marshall beat is

1054
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,040
uh... marshall beat is what like para para except it's karate okay right i

1055
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,320
don't know how to explain it basically what it is is you've got like the

1056
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,720
sensors that are on your hands and on your feet they've got another sensor

1057
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,760
kind of pretty much like uh...

1058
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,480
uh... mambo gogo or uh... whatever

1059
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,480
some

1060
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,480
bowl

1061
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,480
whatever that is

1062
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,480
punchmania

1063
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,480
samba de amigo

1064
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,480
or whatever like that

1065
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,480
where it's got the sensors

1066
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,480
and it can kinda

1067
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,480
you know

1068
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,480
that kind of thing

1069
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,480
so anyways

1070
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
you're on there

1071
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,480
and they'll ask you to like

1072
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,480
to punch up

1073
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,480
punch down

1074
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,480
kick

1075
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,480
do whatever

1076
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,480
and you have to mimic stuff

1077
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,480
they also have a mode where you can fight

1078
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,480
like people and stuff

1079
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,480
and all at the same time

1080
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,480
they have really crappy music

1081
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,480
in the background

1082
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,480
I mean

1083
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,480
not to say that

1084
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,480
you know

1085
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,480
you can't touch this isn't bad

1086
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,480
but

1087
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,480
I mean

1088
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,240
men and petite love? I mean, that doesn't just sound like the action fighting music

1089
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,520
that you would normally expect. Wait, do they actually have, are you serious, they actually

1090
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:56,280
do have petite love? Jackie Chan stars in. Petite love! Oh my god, that's really bad.

1091
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:01,560
Childie on cutie chaser. It's raining men. Cutie chaser isn't there? That's pitiful.

1092
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:08,920
I mean, do you punch to the music? Does it go like on beat punching? Er, okay, it does.

1093
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:16,920
It's like Tybo, except that you pay by the minute instead of by the tape.

1094
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,760
Alright, someone finds me a place where I can get this.

1095
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,840
I will purchase this so that we can have it here.

1096
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,840
That would be the coolest thing ever.

1097
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,840
I would play that all day.

1098
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,840
All day.

1099
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,840
So if we can find where we can get this, I'll get it.

1100
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,840
Just because.

1101
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:43,840
Okay, it's now DaveTV. All Dave, all the time.

1102
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,840
Any other ideas what they could do for an online game? Maybe guitar freaks? Drummania

1103
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,840
type thing? What do you think about that?

1104
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,840
We need to add some more instruments to that, I think.

1105
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,840
Like keyboard mania? Maybe bring that back?

1106
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,840
Keyboard mania, drummania, let's get like...

1107
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,840
Singing mania, karaoke mania.

1108
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:09,000
I've discussed the karaoke thing before, but it's impossible to tell how you're singing.

1109
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,840
You can sync up noises to tell how much it is, but it's not like you can get a better

1110
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,840
singing voice.

1111
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,600
You can get more in tune and hit the right notes, but it's not like you have to hit with

1112
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,640
a certain amount of pressure or something.

1113
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,800
It's like, okay, fat people can't play because you have to hit one gram of pressure.

1114
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,120
konami presents american idol online

1115
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,280
oh my god bring back the demo

1116
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:38,280
well no no no no or whatever it's called living a pretty funny that she's uh...

1117
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,280
they have it as

1118
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,160
part of monster rancher three the playstations you

1119
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,680
you can actually capture your face and put it on the monster

1120
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:49,000
we have that the far right now i get you know we have a lot of three

1121
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,200
as well as that's where i thought uh... you can actually capture your face and

1122
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,040
put it on it

1123
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,840
i think you can capture faces become dancers

1124
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,000
there in the

1125
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,200
I think that you should capture a face and stick it on the crotch part of the dancer.

1126
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,220
You know, just have like...

1127
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:05,880
I can just see Rob's smiling face right over Rage's like...

1128
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,880
I don't know, didn't we... I forget what we said about him like a few shows ago.

1129
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,140
As Emmy's third tit.

1130
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:13,360
That would be cool too. Pantsless Rage.

1131
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,440
You know, that might have been funny if I was in junior high.

1132
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,600
We can have you like...

1133
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:24,600
the pantsless rage thing that we were talking about like three weeks ago. Okay! And then like censor it out with Rob's smiling head.

1134
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,800
Whee!

1135
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:39,800
I'm being told in the chatroom that they are making an American Idol game.

1136
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,680
Help Justin save the world from his big hair.

1137
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:46,960
I don't know what the hell would an American Idol game be.

1138
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,240
What are you doing in an American Idol game?

1139
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,800
How about like, press a button if you want Simon to use this bitch out.

1140
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,760
Press a button if you want Simon to use this.

1141
01:12:54,760 --> 01:13:10,200
I challenge you guys to make an American Idol sound basically, a promo would be good too,

1142
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:15,960
but I was thinking more along the lines of a sound theme for a DWI or something like

1143
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:42,760
I think we're going to go ahead and take another break, and when we come back, you want to

1144
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,760
do a list list?

1145
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:49,680
what do you guys think there's only four of us now the one topic I was thinking

1146
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:55,600
of we could do is a song we'd like to see a decent freestyle done to okay I

1147
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,280
don't know I don't what it what else you guys you guys have any ideas for time

1148
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,200
let's put the topics to the chat room was the chat room want us to decide

1149
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:06,080
tonight on listless I'm gonna put the question out to them so we'll see as

1150
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:11,680
soon as they respond to that no ideas from the peanut gallery here well I got

1151
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,280
We gotta wait because we have to do our listless thing during the break.

1152
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,680
Oh, people are sending them over private message. Let's see.

1153
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,480
Oh, they're sending me a request for songs. They're not sending me.

1154
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,680
Songs you would like to hear are Marshall Beatz.

1155
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:27,480
No, I'm surprised. It's Coming From Fighting wasn't on that.

1156
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,980
That's the best Jogas song.

1157
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,980
I think there's only like four songs to pick from, dummy.

1158
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:36,180
Like Damn Dare Ram, the remix of Damn Dare Ram,

1159
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,880
KCP remix, or another one.

1160
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,880
Damn Dari M. You say it like my dad would. Damn that Damn Dari M.

1161
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:51,880
I'm going to say Damn Dari M, Damn Dari M, KCP remix. There's No Nobody's Love and Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

1162
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,880
Or, oh, Chariot.

1163
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,880
Oh, Chariot's not giving me many good ideas here.

1164
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,880
Best Dance Maniac Song.

1165
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,880
Best Dance Maniac. I don't know enough Dance Maniac songs to be able to do that.

1166
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,320
Yeah, they all suck anyways.

1167
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,940
We did the Guitar Freak Stromania song already, right?

1168
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:14,440
Have we?

1169
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,280
I think so, yeah.

1170
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,080
No, we never did.

1171
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:17,560
OK.

1172
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,200
Want to do that?

1173
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,880
Well, it's Paul's fault for not being here.

1174
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,760
I asked Paul if he wanted to come, he said no.

1175
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,320
I'm so hurt.

1176
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,920
Well, if that's the case, then we're doing that tonight.

1177
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,220
We're going to do best Guitar Freak song without him here.

1178
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:35,480
So we're doing best Gita Dora song, I guess.

1179
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,320
Guitar Freak, Stromania, Keyboard Mania,

1180
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,720
All three of those kind of meshed into one.

1181
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,040
Best song out of those.

1182
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,780
We're gonna do that when we come back

1183
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:46,840
from this little break.

1184
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,720
We started out with a song that was requested a lot

1185
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,080
in the chat room during the last break.

1186
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,480
So here it is for you guys.

1187
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,840
No, not drop the biz-om.

1188
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:55,840
The music is loud

1189
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,840
Yeah, drop the ball

1190
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,840
Just drop the ball

1191
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,840
You can't do the both of my dreams

1192
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,840
Yes, you can try the fossil-like system

1193
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,840
Now and ever, it's the time to resist

1194
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,840
It's easy to blast you all away

1195
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,840
You still have trigger fixes for the same audio to today

1196
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:11,840
Don't get me wrong, I'm a pacifist

1197
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
The mind can't do more than this

1198
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,840
Explosives that are not what it takes

1199
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,840
You know that terrorists always make them mistakes

1200
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,840
What we got is a slow momentum

1201
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,840
If you need the right tools and methods

1202
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,840
Ride the wave time, count for the rhythm

1203
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,840
The marks that teach us, we can't get with them

1204
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,640
We can't get with them

1205
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,160
The brain is generate all mighty power

1206
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,920
We need to ignite your mass in an angle of power

1207
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,280
Yeah, so ready to take that fall

1208
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,520
It's up to you to make that call to drop the bomb

1209
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,720
Get off the bomb

1210
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,920
Let's drop the bomb

1211
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,120
Let me see that fall

1212
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,520
Hope you guys just feel momentum

1213
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,980
If you need the right tools, then vent it

1214
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,580
Ride the wave of time, come see the rhythm

1215
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,180
The Martian future's begun, get with it

1216
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:58,480
The rain is staring almighty

1217
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,420
Before we even do it now, you must be tangled in power

1218
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,820
Yeah, you're ready to take that ball

1219
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,780
And it's up to you to make that call

1220
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:06,180
And if it all works, make the real bet and wipe it out

1221
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,380
So drop the ball

1222
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,580
Yeah, drop the ball

1223
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,780
Yeah, drop the ball

1224
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:16,980
Yeah, drop that ball

1225
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,580
That ball

1226
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,180
That ball

1227
01:22:50,180 --> 01:23:19,420
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1228
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,420
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1229
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,420
No!

1230
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,420
Do we care what people think of us?

1231
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,420
No!

1232
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,420
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1233
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,420
Yeah!

1234
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1235
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:39,420
Extreme Babani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

1236
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:42,420
That is us! Orange Lounge Radio.

1237
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:46,420
I was just seeing if Dave had a negative reaction to me doing that too. I don't know.

1238
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:51,420
Dude, he saved the picture of me looking like I was sucking on some...

1239
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:58,420
Well, it was actually the end of that little furry talkie thing. Wait, hold on. Hold on.

1240
01:23:58,420 --> 01:23:59,420
That thing.

1241
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:03,420
And, wait, hold on. Get a picture on the webcam.

1242
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,420
Yeah, it sounds like it's orgasming half the time. No, but, um...

1243
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:08,920
And he saved it, so, um...

1244
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,920
I know he's gonna put it on, like, the main orange lounge.

1245
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,920
I'm not the only one that saved it, by the way. People in the chatroom saved it, too.

1246
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,800
Like, have you seen this man?

1247
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,800
He plays the DDR.

1248
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,280
He sucks the furry cock.

1249
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,440
Wait, I did not say that. No.

1250
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:30,420
Last week on Orange Loun- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1251
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,640
Don't pull that shit.

1252
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,400
Oh, yeah.

1253
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,640
Like you would be able to stop it.

1254
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:44,640
If I got Jamie doing the King of Iron Fingering, I can do anything I want.

1255
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,000
Anywho,

1256
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,600
let's get to the damn list list segment.

1257
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,560
We're talking about the best

1258
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:56,160
guitar freaks, drum mania, keyboard mania song. We're talking about the big session.

1259
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:00,400
Really, we're kind of focused here on guitar freaks and drum mania.

1260
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,600
Best song in Gitarora.

1261
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,360
We'll go ahead and start.

1262
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:08,600
type limits i find some game show music this week the listless

1263
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,080

1264
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,100

1265
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,000
game show music

1266
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,520
uh...

1267
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,260
i'm gonna have to go with uh...

1268
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:23,260
looks like primal soul

1269
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:28,400
primal soul okay

1270
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,400
i don't even know i finally honest but my bad

1271
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:39,400
Alright, uh, I don't like that song too. But I don't like the long verse, because that's the singing that doesn't do it very good.

1272
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,400
But, uh, most of the time this is just me dancing.

1273
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,400
Well, then let's hear if your choice is any better, Bradley. What's your number three choice?

1274
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:52,400
Bradley is somehow really hyper right now. He's all like, yeah, girl sounds really good, but the long verse...

1275
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,400
Hey, we're getting the talk on this show. Shut your mouth!

1276
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,400
Alright, yes.

1277
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,400
Alright.

1278
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,400
Yes, your number three choice.

1279
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,400
My number three choice would be Liar Liar.

1280
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:06,400
Liar Liar, that's a good one.

1281
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,400
Alright, Dave, what is your number three choice?

1282
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,400
I dropped my list on the ground.

1283
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:24,400
I guess my number three is Nami Nori Johnny, but it's on 7 Mix and 6 Mix,

1284
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:34,400
or guitar freaks from Romania, and it's actually in Japanese spelling, so you can't see Nanomori John, he doesn't say that.

1285
01:26:54,400 --> 01:27:00,880
our music stuff

1286
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,440
you're number two choice

1287
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:06,280
all right my number two choice has to be eraser engine

1288
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:12,280
eraser engine

1289
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,960

1290
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:20,040

uh... yes you're number two to receive

1294
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,120
my number two

1295
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:41,880

1297
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,240

1298
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:51,800
on anybody and that that was different

1299
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:58,800
double cheeseburger

1300
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,180
would be carnival

1301
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,560
i like the cardigans they're cool and i like that cover of it in guitar freaks

1302
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:12,560
with mix of carnivals one of the two choice

1303
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,460
which one here

1304
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:19,020
alright brownies correct my story to get

1305
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:27,040
Loki's number one choice for best guitar-free Stromania song. All right, this is easy. It's gonna be fireball fireball

1306
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,540
All right

1307
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,220
Fireball

1308
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:41,220
Your number one choice Bradley for best guitar-free Stromania song giant slug giant slug right on

1309
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:53,220
I went to MGL two weeks ago to go play that on 6th Mix, because it's not in 7th Mix on guitar freaks.

1310
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,220
They removed it for the next set.

1311
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,220
Doh!

1312
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:01,220
And lots of the old songs they removed, because it was cool time.

1313
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:04,220
Alright, and your number one choice, Dave?

1314
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:10,220
Um, I don't know, this one's kind of typical, but I said at least 100 seconds.

1315
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,220
It's a good song.

1316
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:17,220
The long version kicks so much more ass, but it's not, like, on the Drumanian guitar freaks.

1317
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,220
It's too bad.

1318
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,220
Bummer.

1319
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:22,220
My number one song, I can't believe none of you mentioned it, come on.

1320
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,220
It's the best song in Guitar Freaks.

1321
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:25,220
You know it.

1322
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,220
Don't say Venus.

1323
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,220
Don't say Venus.

1324
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:28,220
No, not Venus.

1325
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,220
Haru Spring.

1326
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,220
Come on, with the dancing panda?

1327
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:35,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1328
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:38,220
Come on, that's the best song. How could you forget that?

1329
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:41,220
We tried. Shut up.

1330
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:47,220
Anyway, the list, the full list is some notable exceptions that the chat list is pointing out.

1331
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:51,220
We didn't say Fire, Hand to Hold, Long Train Runnin'

1332
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,220
Okay, wait, hold on, hold on

1333
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,220
I said Long Train Runnin', I don't like the version of Guitareve

1334
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,300
fire

1335
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,420
overplay yet this one guy

1336
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,380
fuck you

1337
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,660
guy roosevelt golfing staff guide

1338
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,900
who plays this uh... oh sorry for listening

1339
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,860
uh... hypnotic also

1340
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,620
who played a song

1341
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,660
three songs in a row

1342
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,020
like he put in money

1343
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:12,900
fire

1344
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,980
do you know i forget a song goes

1345
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,420
but anyway i should remember it

1346
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:20,160
and then okay let's mix it up a little with fire

1347
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,900
okay i'm gonna challenge myself with fire

1348
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,900
I assume that he's playing three different games since there's only the long version in 7th mix.

1349
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:31,900
No, this was in the 5th mix, Guitar Freak 6.

1350
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,900
But now he just plays it in Burn, I think.

1351
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,900
It's like, Fire!

1352
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,900
Burn!

1353
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,900
Fire!

1354
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:44,900
Anyway, the full list we have so far, and now we get to do the elimination part. This'll be fun.

1355
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:52,060
Primal Soul, Liar Liar, Naminori Janna, Miss You, Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble,

1356
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:56,980
Carnival, Fireball, Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Hadu Spring.

1357
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:58,540
Your elimination choice, Loki.

1358
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:03,980
Well, because I can hardly pronounce that, it's going to be Naminori Janna.

1359
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,540
I can't say I blame you.

1360
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:06,540
It's not a great song, anyway.

1361
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,460
I don't know what Dave was thinking.

1362
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:11,300
That song rules, and it's Johnny, not Janna.

1363
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,300
Yeah, Johnny.

1364
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:18,220
The interesting thing is that when I was in SoCal to go to the Anime Expo, I went to the

1365
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:24,980
Mandaraki store that was closing, and I heard it on the radio. It was interesting.

1366
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,940
Your choice to eliminate from this lovely list we have, Bradley.

1367
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:32,700
It would be Miss You, because Right On Time is a lot better than that one.

1368
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,820
I'm so hurt. But okay. That's the way it works.

1369
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:36,820
I used to like Right On Time.

1370
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:37,820
Bradley's fired from the show.

1371
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:40,820
A small e. No, nevermind.

1372
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:49,820
But then it was overplayed partially by me, partially by these rocker people at Gulfland, and Rob, and everyone else.

1373
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:54,820
And you know one song I left off my list, and I'm really sad I had to leave those to the list?

1374
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,820
Actually I had two songs I had to leave off my list.

1375
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:59,820
I'm Gonna Get You, which I love, I love that song.

1376
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:00,820
Yeah, that song.

1377
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:01,820
And Mr. Moon, I like that song.

1378
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:04,820
I usually think of Keyboard Mania when I think of that song, so I dumped it.

1379
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:06,820
Okay, now I gotta pick one off, huh?

1380
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,820
Yes, you've got to pick one off, Dave.

1381
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,820
Okay, well, I can't pick my own off.

1382
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:13,820
So, I guess I'll take Primal Soul.

1383
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,820
Primal Soul.

1384
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:17,820
You bastard.

1385
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:18,820
Oh, my turn.

1386
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:22,820
It's a good song, but I thought it was the worst.

1387
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:23,820
This is hard.

1388
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:25,820
I actually like all of these.

1389
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,820
I'm going to take off...

1390
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:34,820
Oh, this is really hard.

1391
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:06,540
Can't vote for anything not on this list.

1392
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:07,340
That's the way it works.

1393
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,300
From this list of the eight songs we have,

1394
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:13,020
Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble, Carnival, Fireball,

1395
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:15,820
Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Haru Springs.

1396
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:18,820
Send me your vote for your favorite Guitar Freaks drum

1397

1398
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:21,060
Private message.

1399
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:22,500
And we're going to take a quick break.

1400
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,940
While you send those over private message,

1401
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:25,860
you're only going to have about three minutes.

1402
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:29,500
I'm going to play a quick song from the Dance Mania series.

1403
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,060
And that's all the time you get.

1404
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:36,780
So, let's play from the Dance Mania series.

1405
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:37,780
You want to do...

1406
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:38,780
No, that's Transparty.

1407
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,780
You're thinking...

1408
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,780
You're not...

1409
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,780
That's not Dance Mania.

1410
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:42,780
We're going to do...

1411
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,780
I don't know.

1412
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:45,780
I'm thinking.

1413
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:48,460
Let's do...

1414
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,460
Let's do Tears in May.

1415
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:52,260
You get three minutes while we listen to Missing Heart.

1416
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,700
These are the people that did Moonlight Shadow, by the way.

1417
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:55,700
This is Tears in May.

1418
01:33:55,700 --> 01:34:00,020
You got three minutes to vote in the chat room over private message.

1419
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:07,020
The List, Listless, here on Orange Laundry.

1420
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:46,020
Show my play, and wash my love away Light the way, tear to day

1421
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:53,020
Tell me why, would a cold dream come to die?

1422
01:34:53,020 --> 01:35:06,020
All in vain, tears in vain, tears in vain

1423
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:18,020
The secret world of our dreams is to wait my soul

1424
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:24,020
And when the moon is shining through the clouds, her love will take control.

1425
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:48,020
Tell me why was your dream born to die?

1426
01:35:48,020 --> 01:36:01,020
On the way, tears in my, tears in my head

1427
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:09,020
And I hear the soundtrack for you

1428
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:13,020
When the stars of faith are falling

1429
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:17,020
I'm slowly and I cry the tears

1430
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:35,020
Tears in my... Tears in my... Tears in my...

1431
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:42,020
Show my faith and wash my love away

1432
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:48,020
Like the way it feels to me

1433
01:36:48,020 --> 01:37:17,780

Alright.

1453
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,280
Fireball is the third place winner.

the microphone.

1461
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,920
Don't do that to Bradley's controller, he'll beat you up.

1462
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,240
I think I'd be more worried about the microphone.

1463
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:21,240
Whoa!

1464
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:26,040
What are you doing here, oh wait, are you doing the webcam?

1465
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,520
Thanks for the webcam.

01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:41,160
Same server that hosts a lot of big Bahmani chat rooms.

1469
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:45,760
So what else do we want to talk about? We've got 20 minutes left on the show. Jamie's not

1470
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:51,260
here to vent about anything this week because she's out of town. She's at a step squad convention

1471
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:55,460
or some kind of meeting for her team there, which includes some out of town folks that

1472
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,460
she's interviewing.

1473
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,740
I can do a preemptive fuck you over the week.

1474
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:59,740
Okay, go for it.

1475
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:00,740
You downloaded the music.

1476
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:05,740
Yeah, I haven't unpacked it though yet. You've got to wait for me to do that before you can

1477
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:06,740
go.

1478
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:07,740
Oh, then do that and we'll do the music.

1479
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:11,740
Oh, you got anything you want to talk about, Matt?

1480
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:15,740
Yes. What are you doing, Dave?

1481
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:19,740
One second. Webcam. Oh my god.

1482
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:23,740
Turn off your webcams. If you have a brain, you'll turn off the webcam for about a minute.

1483
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:27,740
Yeah, but see, now everyone will turn it on.

1484
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:31,740
We have a request for you to do the Black Mage, whatever that means.

1485
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:35,740
Dave. Well, what's the Black Mage? I really have no idea.

1486
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:37,460
tell dave to do the black mage

1487
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:40,700
i have a request

1488
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,100
black mage

1489
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,420
doo doo doo doo doo

1490
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:46,600
what am i doing

1491
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,740
this is what they saw by the way huh

1492
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:56,740
it looks like a crotch shot it looks like a gynecology appointment

1493
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:01,840
uh... which you just saw there was the official background

1494
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,380
for uh... dgr god mix

1495
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:12,380
don't inflate his ego any more than it needs to be.

1496
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:38,600
And black mage is the shit basically

1497
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:42,220
Yeah, so

1498
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:45,860
No, go hold it

1499
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,460
It's the black mage

1500
01:42:55,460 --> 01:43:00,200
uh...

1501
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,480
if you do it correctly

1502
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:03,080
twenty-third maggots

1503
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,120
i don't know you know

1504
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,280
buddy do you think buddy christ

1505
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,440
uh...

1506
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:11,580
dogma

1507
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,000
you okay

1508
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,280
he's not here i have to give a big week

1509
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,640
this is not your where did she

1510
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,100
there is a we have a jamie we file actually it's in one of the other promos

1511
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,080
it's uh...

1512
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:25,200
hold on we can see his way

1513
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,560
Dammit!

1514
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,080
Dammit!

1515
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:34,600
There it is! There's Jamie Doolery! That's one of the other promos.

1516
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:37,980
Matt has attached the

1517
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,480
cam to his head

1518
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,640
but since it only takes a picture like every twenty seconds

1519
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,960
it doesn't really work like one of those extreme

1520
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,200
sport people

1521
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,400
you know where you see it from their point of view

1522
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:53,360
it's just kind of like random cliff of what Matt might see if you were standing on top of his head.

1523
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,920
sports is falling off the cliff

1524
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:58,640
the employee of the cliff they see him

1525
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,160
you seem

1526
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,700
preparing to pull the cord

1527
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:03,920
and then you just kind of see

1528
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,560
scattered on the ground

1529
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:07,920
like what happened in those twenty seconds

1530
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,080
well you know i guess the court

1531
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:14,620
what the hell am i talking about

1532
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,280
shows his guys

1533
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:19,420
i know it's just got so stupid but people are still listening go figure

1534
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,900
i'm sorry

1535
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,180
i'm sorry

1536
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:25,180
It's the California Heat, we blame it on that.

1537
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:28,180
Oh my god, it got up to like 80 today.

1538
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:29,180
What's wrong?

1539
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:33,180
Yeah, people just look at us like...

1540
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:36,180
I have a Bomani-related topic we could discuss.

1541
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:38,180
Okay, how about this?

1542
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,180
Internet ranking.

1543
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:41,180
Do you think...

1544
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:45,180
Is there any way that you think internet ranking for the various games out there could be improved,

1545
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:49,180
besides having more than just a crappy USA internet ranking competition in the US?

1546
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:54,060
Like, you know how they have the Max 2 internet ranking for various songs you could do?

1547
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:58,020
There's the 2DX internet ranking, which is really popular right now for 6 style at home,

1548
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:02,460
which Dave is giving the thumbs down to, probably because he can't rank on it.

1549
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:06,260
The 6 style thing is cool because it's at home, and so you're already at home and stuff,

1550
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:11,100
but the Max 2 one, first of all you have to write down, I think it's 16 digits or numbers

1551
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,220
or letters or combined something.

1552
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:14,220
Numbers?

1553
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:15,220
No.

1554
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:21,220
It's not the fact that you have to have a pen and paper ready to be able to record it.

1555
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:24,220
Well hello, if you're playing internet ranking, would you think, gee, uh...

1556
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,220
Nope.

1557
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,220
Dave.

1558
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:34,220
All you gotta do on the PlayStation version, you go into records, and then you hit, I believe, the select key when it shows your scores, and it'll show you the internet ranking password.

1559
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:38,220
Oh, oh, you're talking about on, uh, home version.

1560
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:41,220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you were talking about the arcades. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dave. I'm sorry.

1561
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:45,220
But if you use a memory card, it'll save it, just so you know.

1562
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:49,220
I know it's awesome, is if you do it playing versus, it crashes the machine.

1563
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:51,220
Whoa, that is pretty cool.

1564
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:57,220
No, but first of all, it takes three great deals of unlaziness to do this.

1565
01:45:57,220 --> 01:46:02,220
First you have to have a pen and piece of paper and a pen or pencil ready.

1566
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:06,220
Then you have to waste three songs, well not necessarily waste,

1567
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:11,220
But play three songs that you wouldn't normally play, just so you can get the internet ranking.

1568
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:16,220
Play them on, probably, difficulty that you wouldn't want to, or, you know, whatever, I don't know.

1569
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,220
Then don't play internet ranking! Shit!

1570
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:23,220
And then you have to write them down quickly, and then go home.

1571
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:27,220
Wait, stop grabbing the mic. And then, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't talk.

1572
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:31,220
No, it's... God damn it, I'm one of the co-hosts of the show!

1573
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:34,220
You're the co-host. I'm the new host.

1574
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:40,220
And then you have to go home and actually go on the computer, which I really do not like using computers.

1575
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:47,220
By the way, we're on internet radio right now. You might want to keep the computer bashing a little light.

1576
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:54,220
No, I'm just saying, I cannot use computers. I try to go on the internet.

1577
01:46:54,220 --> 01:47:00,220
It's like, you have lost all the memory on your computer. Your computer is now shutting down.

1578
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:01,580
it's not our fault

1579
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:04,900
like a special email has been sent to a little midget who will come and kill you

1580
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:05,820
now

1581
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,180
haha

1582
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:09,060
they have gotten those messages before

1583
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:10,900
they're not sure

1584
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:12,080
i don't know i have

1585
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,480
have the midgets come yet

1586
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,700
i don't know those little kids have been threatening me they could have been midgets

1587
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:19,280
i don't know this

1588
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,900
no midgets you can

1589
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:23,020
sorry if there's any midgets out there

1590
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:24,240
midgets are awesome

1591
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:25,540
and they really are

1592
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:26,980
itty bitty gang man

1593
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:28,980
Oh, nasty!

1594
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:32,980
A special F.U. for all those Greek midgets out there.

1595
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:33,980
Oh yeah.

1596
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:34,980
Yeah, what was that all about?

1597
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:35,980
Greek midgets are awesome.

1598
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,980
That was so last hour.

1599
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:40,980
Anyway, what do you suggest they do then, Dave?

1600
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:42,980
Just have an internet ranking on your honor?

1601
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:45,980
You know, oh yeah, Eiffel combo'd Max Unlimited.

1602
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:46,980
No!

1603
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:47,980
Yes, I did!

1604
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:48,980
I'm number one in the world!

1605
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:49,980
That is crap.

1606
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:54,980
No, I think that they should hook all of the Max 2 arcade machines up to the internet

1607
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:58,980
So it kind of like tells you your ranking as you put it in.

1608
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:00,980
That and have a webcam that records your...

1609
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:06,980
You know, so it's like I say I pull perfect max unlimited three times and it somehow gets the...

1610
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:07,980
No! Stop driving the line!

1611
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:13,980
So you're suggesting that Roosevelt Golf Land spend or any Golf Land or any arcade with a Max 2 machine,

1612
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:20,980
which is just about everywhere these days, spend thousands of dollars to get a DSL brought in next to the machine

1613
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:25,900
machine, and just so you can have internet ranking so you can make a pathetic attempt

1614
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:29,060
at being the best DDR player in the nation.

1615
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:33,500
Well I know I'm not the best, but not any arcade, every arcade needs to do this.

1616
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:38,480
A, it shouldn't be like a specialty, it should be part of the machine, you know it should

1617
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,820
have like a...

1618
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:42,300
You're forgetting they're all illegal anyway, they're all bootlegs.

1619
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:46,460
So get the illegal bootleg DSL, whatever.

1620
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:47,460
And then um...

1621
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:48,460
Hold on.

1622
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:49,460
Illegal bootleg DSL.

1623
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:56,460
So let's say, you know, I full perfect everything and then it says, yay, you are number one, congratulations.

1624
01:48:56,460 --> 01:49:02,460
And then, you know, you see, it's kind of like a Soul Calibur II thing, you know, with your armies fighting against each other.

1625
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:05,460
Your DDR armies fighting against each other.

1626
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:12,460
I full perfect something and it's like, Corey already did this, you are Poser or something like that.

1627
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:17,460
Conquest mode in DDR would be stupid because everybody would pick on MGL and you know it.

1628
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:19,460
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool, though.

1629
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:22,460
MGL would be gone in five seconds.

1630
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:25,460
I'm not sure how long we'd last, though, because I'm not...

1631
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:29,460
Like, we've got a constant stream of people playing, but most of the people...

1632
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,460
Sorry if you're listening, I do this a lot...

1633
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:33,460
Are pretty bad.

1634
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:35,460
Except for, like, us.

1635
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:41,460
Us being sacramentals who know each other.

1636
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:42,460
Yeah...

1637
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:44,460
Because lots of these new sacramentals...

1638
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:47,980
Well, let's get off this rant because it's kind of boring.

1639
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,260
Give the mic back, Dave.

1640
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:51,580
Dave's pouting.

1641
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:57,420
Let's see, other things coming up that we should talk about, I guess I can give a little

1642
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:58,420
plug for me.

1643
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:00,060
It's my birthday on Wednesday!

1644
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,060
Yay!

1645
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:06,900
Wednesday, there was something about Wednesday that was important, something I was supposed

1646
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,540
to remember.

1647
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:10,980
Some other kind of anniversary, I forget.

1648
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,220
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

1649
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:16,860
How could I forget? If I turn on the TV, they keep reminding me. Your birthday happens to

1650
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,940
be on September 11th, huh?

1651
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:23,940
Another porn date is when my cable is supposed to be installed. Probably AT&T is going to

1652
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:26,660
fuck it up.

1653
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:31,220
Yes, and also, if you calculate the hours correctly, that's the time that I will be

1654
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:36,540
finished downloading the porn that I am starting to download now. It will be finished by September

1655
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:40,820
11th. No, I swear. It will take like a hundred, like four hundred hours or something.

1656
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:45,820
What are you planning to do to celebrate your birthday?

1657
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:49,820
I'm throwing a bimani party.

1658
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:52,820
That's right, you're throwing the big bimani party next weekend.

1659
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:56,820
Maybe we'll have to tape something for Orange Lounge there, I don't know what, but we'll do something.

1660
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:03,820
It'll be fun, I'll have my sim set up with the metal pads and all that fun stuff, and I'll be making burgers.

1661
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:05,820
Is it next weekend or Wednesday?

1662
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,820
It's on Saturday.

1663
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:11,700
Because, like, if it was the weekend, then I wouldn't, or the weekday, because I wouldn't

1664
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:12,700
be able to pass.

1665
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:13,700
Yes.

1666
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:14,700
Wednesday, I don't know.

1667
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,700
My parents are cool.

1668
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:16,700
My girlfriend.

1669
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:17,700
But, they're not.

1670
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:22,700
And, yeah, but, see, I can't go on weekdays, because I'm, like, trapped in my house.

1671
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:23,700
Yeah.

1672
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:28,220
Um, let's see, on Friday, we're going down to, um, the Winchester Mystery House to do

1673
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:31,820
a mid-light, uh, midnight tour, because that's on Friday the 13th.

1674
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:32,820
Right on.

1675
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:36,140
So we're going to do that, because that'll be fun, and then, uh, Saturday, yeah, my party

1676
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:41,580
and stuff and you know everyone's invited so come crash the party if you want and uh

1677
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:45,480
well obviously you need to know the directions are but remember this is a national show i

1678
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:50,300
don't think the people in uh you know uh columbus ohio give a crap about your party no offense

1679
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:58,800
fly in i'll i'll be working welcome international people in venezuela vamanos ah loki the microphone

1680
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:03,160
anyway uh i'm being reminded of something in the chat room is going on right now as

1681
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:07,760
As we speak, the King of the Hill episode that featured the DDR parody is replaying

1682
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:13,000
right now, and you missed it because you're listening to us!

1683
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,300
You know, it was first played on Mother's Day, which is pretty funny.

1684
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:20,860
I think the funny wore off the first time, but I actually didn't see it the first time,

1685
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:23,100
so I'm having the TiVo grab it right now so I can watch it.

1686
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:24,100
I didn't see it.

1687
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:25,100
Dansu?

1688
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:26,100
Dansu?

1689
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,100
Dansu?

1690
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,100
Dansu?

1691
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:29,100
What is...

1692
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:30,100
I don't...

1693
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:31,100
You have to explain this to me.

1694
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:59,100
The plot was they go to Japan to find Hank's, the main character's, half-brother or something, because there was some love grandfather thing, and anyway, they see DDR on this giant screen, you know, it's on one of the megascreens, broadcasting in basically a Times Square, or, yeah, type of place, and so, you know, the main character's son goes up there and starts playing, and, you know, busts out too, I think it was, was it Kung Fu fighting?

1695
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:06,100
it

1696
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:08,540
and then

1697
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:12,100
what happened was this girl comes up and it's kind of like

1698
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:15,180
funny romance

1699
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:16,740
and they've got the

1700
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:20,540
i forget the robot characters i forget them

1701
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:21,700

1702
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:23,460

1710

1711
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,480
that's an old british show called trigger happy t-v uh...

1712
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:50,140
things damn funny

1713
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:53,080
british interrelated the money

01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,520

1724
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:22,000
so they have it on there and it's cool

1725
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:30,160
In the chat room, 23rd Magus says he's going to come to your B Mani party to celebrate

1726
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,680
Konami's famous B Mani series.

1727
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:37,520
Hey, I'll actually get to meet him, because I've tried to meet him numerous times and

1728
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,520
never worked.

1729
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:41,200
Actually, I was in the same arcade once and I never saw him.

1730
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:43,200
It'll be a Kodak moment, I'm sure.

1731
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:44,200
I'm surprised.

1732
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,200
It was funny.

1733
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:48,400
I thought people had come to my Qzart trip since it was just me and that guy.

1734
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,400
I was broke.

1735
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,480
I really wanted to go, but I'm so broke.

1736
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:56,120
broke, I'm sorry. And then the Bomani party, it sounds like there's going to be tons of

1737
01:54:56,120 --> 01:55:01,440
people there, and I was expecting there to be like five people. Well, hey. So, yeah,

1738
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:05,720
more the merrier. I think I have an empty house that night, so hopefully we won't be

1739
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:10,540
waking anyone up, and my neighbors suck. I hate my neighbors. A special F-you to my freaking

1740
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:18,080
neighbors. Because this dumbass, I guess her boyfriend moved in next door, and he parks

1741
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:22,800
his truck, because we're in a court and instead of parking along the curb, he actually parks

1742
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:29,240
perpendicular to the curb, so his truck is taking up half of our driveway. And he's a

1743
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:30,240
bastard.

1744
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:34,280
Do you think Bahmani parties getting together and playing this, to make this more of a topic

1745
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:39,920
everybody can relate to than just people who are within driving distance of Loki's house,

1746
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,960
you think Bahmani parties are a cool thing to do once in a while, get together and just

1747
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:47,220
play all the home versions, or do you think maybe we ought to go to the arcade to play

1748
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:51,460
these things or is it more fun because at home you can drink and play DDR? Although

1749
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:55,960
if you go to Dave and Buster's you can drink and play DDR too, but just hypothetically.

1750
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:02,740
I think it's fun. Wait, does anyone else have Maimani parties? I'm sure. I'm sure. Friends

1751
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:08,100
get together and play Maimani. Shit man, people have LAN parties. I mean, come on. They have

1752
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:13,100
what? LAN parties, local area networks where you play network games like Quake 3 and that

1753
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:18,420
that kind of crap, and you hook computers up. Uh-oh, Quake 3, look out! We're going

1754
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:21,860
to- I don't know what the game's about. It doesn't matter, there's parties for everything,

1755
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:25,900
so I'm sure- It's point and shoot, that's all it is. People get together to watch, like,

1756
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:31,920
you know, I Love Lucy shows and that kind of shit. Dave with the stupid webcam. Anyways,

1757
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:35,540
so yeah, I think it's a good idea that people get together. Anything that'll bring people

1758
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:40,020
together to actually be able to enjoy something will be great, so, whether it be an arcade

1759
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:47,020
It's about time to close the show, but a closing thought. What would be the absolute worst thing that you could do at a Bimani party?

1760
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:52,020
Say you're going to a Bimani party for the first time as a newbie. Absolute worst thing you could do?

1761
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:53,020
Show up on the wrong day?

1762
01:56:53,020 --> 01:57:02,020
What do you think? Absolute worst thing you could do at a Bimani party your first time? Dave, do you have any ideas?

1763
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:12,020
The absolute worst thing, well first I could think about getting really drunk and playing naked, but I'm guessing that you could do worse stuff than that.

1764
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:20,020
Well I don't know, because I mean that party that you had a while back, it wasn't really a Bumani party, but all these people that played Bumani showed up, so it kind of turned into one.

1765
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:30,300
Where, I think, Ryan Samu-mangus, or magus or whatever, he put on his girlfriend's clothes

1766
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:32,860
and started pairing.

1767
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:34,340
That was really bad.

1768
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:37,860
It looked like a tutu slash.

1769
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:41,500
Like he looked very, very fruity.

1770
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,500
Sorry Rob.

1771
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:48,180
He said it's okay.

1772
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:49,180
Any ideas from Bradley?

1773
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:55,180
Hello, whoops, my bad. I'm sorry, yes. Any further ideas, Bradley?

1774
01:57:55,180 --> 01:58:05,180
Breaking people's machines or playing Let Them Move for the first time. Wow! Let Them Move! That's awesome!

1775
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:11,180
Actually, now that I've flashed back to my first Bimani party, what was it? My modded pad got broken.

1776
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:17,700
Yeah, I remember my first Bamani party, it was, oh wait, no I don't, well I remember

1777
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:22,660
one Bamani party, it involved people getting drunk and, you know, dressing up as, in their

1778
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:27,280
girlfriend's clothes, and playing Farah, and that was funny because it wasn't me.

1779
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:30,500
I'm going to have to agree with the chatroom that the absolute worst thing you could do

1780
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:33,580
at your first Bamani party is ParaNaked.

1781
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:35,960
there and they could be

1782
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:39,560
big whip across the thing or in the nose

1783
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:40,980
or um...

1784
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:43,580
another bad thing would be i try to play d r in the pool

1785
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:45,180
would be another bad idea

1786
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:49,060
you know don't take the you know i am full yes to the pool

1787
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,740
you'd like to hear on tonight

1788
01:58:51,740 --> 01:58:53,600
i'd love to see it on a game show

1789
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:55,780
here are nice to meet with you

1790
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:57,880
references before but on

1791
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,340
that game on stop

1792
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:00,820
i would have got like thirty seconds

1793
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:02,060
uh... the thing

1794
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:03,540
where you

1795
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:06,880
you get it wrong, and the floor drops out from under you, what's that show called?

1796
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:07,880
Russian Roulette.

1797
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:11,540
Russian Roulette, like DDR Russian Roulette, you hit a wrong note, and the floor just drops

1798
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:15,020
out from under you, so you're like, trying to step, and then the floor goes bye-bye.

1799
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:20,140
That's like, so Goonies, okay?

1800
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:23,140
Baby Moot?

1801
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:29,620
And Rob came up with a good idea for a new show, DDR on Ice, with, uh, Jon Tesh.

1802
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:31,620
Brian Boitano

1803
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:33,620
John Tesh announcing

1804
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:38,620
Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp to my beat, stomp to my beat, stomp to my beat

1805
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:42,620
This player of DDR, he has such a terrible youth

1806
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:44,620
He grew up in the slums

1807
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:47,620
And now he plays DDR and he gets money that way

1808
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:49,620
He's won tournaments

1809
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:53,620
And it just breaks my heart

1810
01:59:53,620 --> 01:59:57,620
For those who don't know, this is the most Bradley's ever talked

1811
01:59:57,620 --> 02:00:02,620
Like, cumulative in this two hours. He's talked more than he's ever talked in his entire life.

1812
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:04,620
You heard he here on Orange Lounge first.

1813
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:08,620
Uh-huh. And it's kind of funny to know that I actually had a radio show one time.

1814
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:09,620
Really?

1815
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:10,620
I have tapes of it.

1816
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:12,620
Oh, I gotta hear this stuff.

1817
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:13,620
I got really crazy on it.

1818
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:17,620
I used to have a college radio show too. But anyway, we're past nine o'clock. We gotta end the show.

1819
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:22,620
Big thank you to everybody listening. Big thanks to Loki, tonight's honorary co-host.

1820
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:24,620
Any final words, Loki?

1821
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:28,620
Logie?

1822
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:35,620
No, I wish Dave would stop playing with the webcam, but, yeah.

1823
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:37,620
Nothing really.

1824
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:40,620
Any final thoughts from Dave, the cam whore?

1825
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:43,620
Webcam is my friend.

1826
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:45,620
Any final thoughts from Bradley?

1827
02:00:45,620 --> 02:00:49,620
Tea lovers, go somewhere else to neck and play with each other.

1828
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:52,620
And my final thought of the day?

1829
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:53,900
do something

1830
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:56,340
my mom by the day

1831
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:57,360
okay that's it

1832
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,660

1835
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:09,840

1836

1837
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:14,780
you've been listening to orange lounge radio

1838
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:18,540
orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production

1839
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:26,540
The Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

1840
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:30,540
And now, here's your Fortune Cookie message of the day.

1841
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:36,540
Listen, pal, you've got to make it a little more sexy, you know, and don't just ram it in there like that.

1842
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:39,980
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
