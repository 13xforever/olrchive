00:00:01,728 --> 00:00:04,249
[SPEAKER_10]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:19,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Our live talk program begins now.

3
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:29,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:46,112
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn you, stop calling here.

5
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:47,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't it 4215, pussy whee?

6
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:48,033
[SPEAKER_12]: You bitch!

7
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:51,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Now let me check the zip code.

8
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:52,676
[SPEAKER_12]: 212, fuck you!

9
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:54,197
[SPEAKER_12]: You have no morals, darling.

10
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:59,339
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun, and it's a scorching case of curfews.

11
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss my grip, nooch.

12
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:04,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hidey ho.

13
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:06,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

14
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:07,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too!

15
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:08,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucker, yeah?

16
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:10,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working on it.

17
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:10,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Loser.

18
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:11,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Lame!

19
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:13,267
[SPEAKER_11]: On the side of my face.

20
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:18,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.

21
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:24,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

22
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:46,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I am your singing telegram Somewhere inside the state of California In the great nation of the United States of America On the planet Earth Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bimani My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me better as Sky

[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:02,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, also known as Loki.

25
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:03,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, everyone.

00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, as always, we're joined by some other in-studio friends.

27
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:09,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we're down to one tonight.

28
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,044
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Bradley in the house.

29
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:11,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello.

30
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:12,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, there.

31
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:21,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody else is busy this week, apparently, now that school's back in session, although most of the people on this show are out of high school already, with the exception of a couple.

32
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:27,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave and Paul are still in high school, but like Brad and Irene, they had a visitor coming in from out of town, and Jamie had to go to another event.

33
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:28,909
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into all that later.

34
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:32,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, this is episode number 11 for September the 8th of 2002.

35
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And we might get some more guests later.

36
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,212
[SPEAKER_05]: There's rumors that some people might show up later as the show goes on.

37
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:42,074
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

38
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And any other opening thoughts from the people in the room?

39
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:45,955
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

40
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:47,215
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fair enough.

00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:51,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get some music and we'll be right back with Orange Lounge Radio live.

44
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:21,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't cry, I don't even know what true solitude is I'm still holding a drop of tears in my pale petals

45
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:57,980
[SPEAKER_13]: From Step Squad to Orange Labs, this DDR sucks!

46
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:03,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Holla, Holla, Holla, Steppin'!

47
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:10,028
[SPEAKER_13]: T-T-P-O I have no idea what half those little acronyms mean.

48
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I just uncool?

49
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:12,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

50
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they mean either.

51
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:35,866
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So what else?

53
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,940
[SPEAKER_05]: What were we talking about during the break there?

54
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,541
[SPEAKER_05]: During the break we were kind of talking about songs that have been released for simulators lately.

55
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:12,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've been looking... Now for those that don't know Matt, also known as Loki, he's really big into the simulator.

56
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:17,983
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that don't know what a DDR simulator is, dance with intensity, step mania, things like that.

57
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Things that will emulate DDR on your computer basically.

58
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:21,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Or simulate, I should say.

59
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:25,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people get on my ass for not clarifying the difference between emulate and simulate.

60
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:26,985
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, whatever.

61
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It's DDR on your computer basically.

62
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:29,265
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

63
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:34,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki really big into this, likes to download every single freaking song he can find and play them all.

64
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:36,106
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

65
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:37,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a sim scene update.

66
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:39,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about some stuff you've been looking for recently.

67
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:40,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.

68
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:49,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, especially at my job, I suppose I should be actually doing real work at my job, but instead I exploit their T1 line.

69
00:11:49,737 --> 00:11:50,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.

70
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:56,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And so lately I've been actually searching some of the smaller Japanese sites.

71
00:11:56,282 --> 00:12:01,666
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the ones that you can't understand a thing that's on them, but you see, you know, song files with BMS stuff.

72
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, some of the stuff I've actually found...

73
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,609
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

74
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:40,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there's a, I forget which site I saw it on, but there's some guy that's actually doing basically like a mix, you know, with a bunch of different songs he's going to be releasing, and they're all Christian music.

75
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,583
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the comment there from the little stuffed ferret or whatever the heck this thing is?

76
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

77
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:57,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so there's going to be a DDR God mix coming out soon, basically.

78
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:58,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

79
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:02,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very scary, but... Jesus Christ, it's DDR!

80
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:06,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, well, I've already got that Paranoia Catholic, so there's the start.

81
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:07,492
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

82
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:09,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Paranoia Catholic?

83
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:10,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

84
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:16,939
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Paranoia Catholic... There's tons of Paranoia mixes out there that we don't even know about.

85
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:18,162
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there.

86
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:20,203
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have a list on there.

87
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:28,627
[SPEAKER_02]: If you actually search under Yahoo or something for Paranoia and then maybe DDR, they'll actually have a website that you can pull up a list of every single Paranoia ever made.

88
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:31,108
[SPEAKER_02]: All the remixes that people have done that are fan-made.

89
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,869
[SPEAKER_05]: As if you needed more Paranoias.

90
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:35,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have links to the actual step files, too.

91
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

92
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you can download them.

93
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:37,991
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of cool.

94
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you dance little crosses in the Christian mix?

95
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of like up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right.

96
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:47,355
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just instead of some of the orchestra hits, you have God, God, God, that kind of stuff.

97
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Madonna in a prayer going, God, God.

98
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,634
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not quite, but anyway.

99
00:13:54,115 --> 00:14:00,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things, Bimani Ruler, Dave, actually he had a few files, eight more files that he was releasing.

100
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:03,357
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some of his older stuff that look really awesome.

101
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:07,958
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done some of the Parapara music by Hero Beat and My Sweet Banana and that kind of stuff.

102
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:11,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, there's a few other ones that you can actually get right now.

103
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:13,499
[SPEAKER_02]: He has Max Enigma, which is in Tourney Mix 2.

104
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:16,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like Max mixed with Enigma music or something?

105
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,420
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

106
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,060
[SPEAKER_02]: By that band Enigma?

107
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,744
[SPEAKER_02]: He made it with the key sounds from Max 300 and 2DX Sims.

108
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I recognize most of it in there.

109
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it is just the key sounds from that.

110
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just made his own mix out of it.

111
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:38,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Something similar to what I was going to, but I got pissed off with it and decided not to.

112
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,372
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one he's also released.

113
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:44,454
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a link on DDR Maniacs in their boards.

114
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:45,735
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got one for Gravity.

115
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:49,798
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

116
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:11,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not make DDR 2DX.

117
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:14,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is pretty much what they're doing is making like 2DX.

118
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:16,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's how they're making it harder.

119
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:25,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how do you make DDR steps harder without getting just more convoluted and more like 2DX style step patterns?

120
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:26,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's getting hard.

121
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:34,860
[SPEAKER_05]: The freeze arrows are one way of doing it because the freeze arrows will screw you up on songs like Ordinary World where if you don't spin or do a little trick with your feet, you're not going to hit them all.

122
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, you know, they are hard, but they do go with the music.

123
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,370
[SPEAKER_02]: They go with the music perfectly, so I give them that.

124
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,291
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

125
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:46,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still trying to get the other six or so files I'm missing.

126
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:55,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a deal with the webmaster at DDR Mania X. I was going to send him some anime, and he was going to send me a burned copy, a CD with them on there.

127
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:59,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, there's been some problems with me sending it to him.

128
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:03,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear we have a lot of fans of the show in the DDR Mania X chatroom, so hello!

129
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:03,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all of you.

130
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:04,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Love ya!

131
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:05,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Big kisses.

132
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:07,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hear they hate the show.

133
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:10,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised.

134
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:10,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what can you do?

135
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't even know if they've listened, but whatever.

136
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:16,833
[SPEAKER_02]: They hate the show, so much for that.

137
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:18,994
[SPEAKER_05]: We all hate this show.

138
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:25,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, sim-wise, I mean, no updates as far as DWI goes.

139
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:29,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Step Mania, I heard there's a Beta 6 out there somewhere, but I haven't played it and don't really care to.

140
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given up on Step Mania.

141
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:40,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Step Mania personally, but, you know, I don't really play DDR Sims because I just can't do DDR on my fingers.

142
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make sense.

143
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, when I'm playing DDR at home, I'll do the official Konami one.

144
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:47,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you want to ask why the hell would I play that.

145
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:49,222
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I can play with the pirates.

146
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:49,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Arr!

147
00:16:50,863 --> 00:16:52,063
[SPEAKER_05]: The new DDR pirates.

148
00:16:54,292 --> 00:17:01,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and for those who didn't hear, the new DDRPC characters, they've been releasing characters every other week or so.

149
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:10,099
[SPEAKER_05]: The most recent characters they released, Elliot and, I forget the name of the other ones, started with C. I'm sure Charum will fill me in.

150
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,260
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pirates, they're two pirates.

151
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:19,003
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one were a couple of nightclubs, the second one were kind of, I don't know, dressed like cowboys.

152
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,405
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the cowboys are the hidden ones in the game.

153
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:27,675
[SPEAKER_05]: The other ones they released were kind of like, I don't know, they had a unique style to them.

154
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:31,478
[SPEAKER_05]: They wore those hats on their heads that cover your whole head type thing.

155
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they've got pirates out.

156
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,441
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to know, though, is when are we going to get pirate music in DDR?

157
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when are we going to have it?

158
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,545
[SPEAKER_05]: What exactly is pirate music?

159
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:44,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the theme from the Pirates of the Caribbean or something?

160
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

161
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:50,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo ho ho, argh, get off me pad, matey.

162
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:52,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, stuff like that.

163
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:54,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

164
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:58,840
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, sim file stuff, there is tons of it out there, you just gotta find it.

165
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:13,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I might, if time permits, one of these days, just actually link to all these sites that have really cool stuff on them, and, you know, throw that out there, but in the meantime, I'm trying to get the largest collection on the internet, and one person's beaten me so far, but that'll be, uh,

166
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:15,698
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

167
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Jack, you know, seriously, I've actually gotten a lot more of his music that's in there.

168
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:43,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the same.

169
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so is all of the erotic songs.

170
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:49,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, literally, I have a new erotic song that's just a copy of an old erotic song.

171
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:55,871
[SPEAKER_05]: An old erotic song from the first couple albums was called Sex on the Phone, which is a pretty well-known erotic song outside of DDR.

172
00:18:56,271 --> 00:19:01,394
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a new one on the latest album, or no, actually, I don't think it was the latest album, but the one before it, called Tempt Me on the Line.

173
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

174
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost the exact same melody, too, if you listen to it or something.

175
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:06,678
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still cheesy.

176
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got his... What was it?

177
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Take Me Out to the Ballgame.

178
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:12,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one that's School's Out.

179
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:13,765
[SPEAKER_02]: That one.

180
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:16,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Which isn't that School's Out for Summer.

181
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:17,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another one.

182
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:19,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've also got one called Secret Agent Man.

183
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:22,393
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not... It's not the Austin Powers Secret Agent Man.

184
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:23,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping it was.

185
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:25,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, that'd be sweet, but no.

186
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:27,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately not.

187
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:30,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Bus Stop would probably do a remix of Secret Agent Man.

188
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:32,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very good point.

189
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:34,208
[SPEAKER_05]: An artist that sounds the same all the time.

190
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:36,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Three words, or four words, Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

191
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Artists that sound the same all the time.

192
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

193
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:44,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

194
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:46,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the FU of the week.

195
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:50,066
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the big fuck you of the week that Jamie always likes to do when she's here.

196
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:52,587
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, she's not here this week.

197
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,728
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to fill in for her with our fuck yous of the week.

198
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:57,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And I allowed the chat room to participate this week.

199
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:00,769
[SPEAKER_05]: They sent me all their various fuck yous over private message.

200
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't even opened them up to read them yet.

201
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,611
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to read them live on air and see if they're stupid or what.

202
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:07,930
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

203
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck me, I'm an asshole for not finishing that intro, sorry.

204
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:38,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And also for not doing a damn thing on the webpage, that's my bad.

205
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:44,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping to get the webpage fixed up and all prettied and updated a lot, because it's kind of out of date.

206
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:51,589
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't get around to that either, so I'm sorry, and a big fuck you to me for messing that up.

207
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a fuck you of the week, Matt?

208
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:57,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know, because this is in my music, obviously, so...

209
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:01,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gee, that's better.

210
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:03,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.

211
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, FQ to the... Now, granted, I love QZAR.

212
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:12,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Entertainment Zone because it's QZAR that's relatively close.

213
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But goddamn, they're lazy.

214
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:15,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

215
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, they're very lazy.

216
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to work at QZAR, so I know how lazy you can be at that job.

217
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you used to be the guy that would stand there and read out the rules?

218
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:25,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was.

219
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted your job so bad when I was in high school.

220
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:29,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, okay.

221
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's basically what the job consists of at QZAR.

222
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:36,366
[SPEAKER_02]: You sit on your ass in the office talking to the manager while someone's doing a brief.

223
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:38,608
[SPEAKER_02]: When your brief comes up, you go do the brief.

224
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,011
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you go help people get in the arena.

225
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down, watch people play in the arena, make sure everyone gets out of the arena and go back and sit in the office.

226
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:45,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of sitting.

227
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:46,640
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

228
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:49,444
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't go out there and arrest players?

229
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:52,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well you can, but what's the point?

230
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:53,771
[SPEAKER_02]: No one really cares anyways.

231
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:56,791
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, because they wouldn't order me a pizza.

232
00:21:56,831 --> 00:22:01,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to walk around the corner to get a delicious pizza and go get pizza there.

233
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:02,496
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucked.

234
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:04,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So a big fuck you to Cusar?

235
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, to the Cusar employees.

236
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fair enough.

237
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:14,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a ton of chatroom FUs to get to, so I've got to get to the FUs in the chatroom.

238
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:24,593
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join our chatroom, just join any other side IRC server like irc.eggheads.org and join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

239
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:29,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the same server that a lot of the big Bomani channels are on, like DDR Freak and 2DX Style and all those.

240
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:31,540
[SPEAKER_05]: are also on that same server.

241
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,403
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.

242
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:36,229
[SPEAKER_02]: An FU to Nickelodeon for cancelling Invader Zim.

243
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:36,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Again?

244
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually gone for good now, I think.

245
00:22:39,254 --> 00:22:40,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on this morning.

246
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:42,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, damn it.

247
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:44,028
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep changing the time around.

248
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:46,408
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to them for changing the time around all the time.

249
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to stop the music because bless you to TiVo.

250
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:51,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Because thanks to TiVo, we just got a TiVo in the house.

251
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell it to record Invader Zim every time it's on, and it will.

252
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:59,252
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what time it's on, it'll find when Invader Zim's on and tape it for me.

253
00:22:59,292 --> 00:22:59,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

254
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you were saying?

255
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:03,293
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

256
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:04,113
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to them.

257
00:23:04,193 --> 00:23:07,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to me for missing the whole thing of...

258
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:10,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Trigger Happy TV, because that shit is awesome.

259
00:23:10,897 --> 00:23:11,217
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

260
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:11,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

261
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any, uh, FDs of the week, Bradley?

262
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you have, I'll let you have Jamie's music.

263
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, uh, I don't know how many bad things happened this week, but just, uh, general fuck you to teeny buffers that hang around RVGL on...

264
00:23:27,387 --> 00:23:32,272
[SPEAKER_15]: The local arcade on Friday nights and toward into Saturdays.

265
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:36,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, we manage to give a big fuck you to them every week on the show, but they deserve it, so go right ahead.

266
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:42,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they stand around looking stupid and get in the way and look at each other and everything.

267
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:43,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you hear that?

268
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:45,787
[SPEAKER_05]: All you ever do is get in the way, you damn kids.

269
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:46,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Get off our machine.

270
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:47,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Go away.

271
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:54,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you notice that it's interesting that this week, finally, they added a little sign that says, put your token here if you want to play next.

272
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:05,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Because since they got rid of USA, finally, and they have the fourth plus, now the veterans are taking over both machines, so there's no, like, newbie machine for people to stand in line for and not worry about tokens.

273
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:10,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you've got the token line on both machines, and some parents just don't understand the concept of a token line.

274
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it had to be explained.

275
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:14,173
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have a bat for those type of people.

276
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:16,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a big orange bat out in the car.

277
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:17,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

278
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get on to the FUs of the week from the chatroom.

279
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:23,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't even read these yet, so let's see what we've got.

280
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

281
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:30,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Twen gives a big fuck you to the first mini-competition they had.

282
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:33,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Four players, two basic, one trick, one maniac.

283
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:34,406
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the maniac.

284
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:38,889
[SPEAKER_05]: He got a friggin' kata and the scoring was based off the AAA score, so he got last.

285
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:45,281
[SPEAKER_05]: and they got Dynamite Rave hiring Mr. T and his cattle was Orion 7-8 and he failed it so he got one.

286
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:49,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So he basically got screwed in a tournament so FU to that tournament the twin partners have made it in.

287
00:24:50,764 --> 00:25:00,809
[SPEAKER_05]: JB gives a big FU, fuck you, to the Saints Go Marching on 4th Plus because he got a... he accidentally selected Maniac thinking it was Trick somehow and failed it at the arcade.

288
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the machine's fault, dummy.

289
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another FU after we're done here too.

290
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:05,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, go ahead with your FU.

291
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:16,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my FU goes to Country Club Lanes in their fucking Max machine because it has a fucked up right arrow on the player one side.

292
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was playing doubles and I kept failing.

293
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:19,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, why the hell am I failing?

294
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:26,132
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, I think one of RVGL's on Max 2 on the one player side, I think the left arrow is broken too.

295
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:27,713
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just can't win anywhere.

296
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, back to chat room.

297
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:33,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe Mama says, big fuck you to school.

298
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:34,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, school's back in session.

299
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:35,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you kids are enjoying it.

300
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:36,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to school.

301
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:47,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And SoCalKids says, fuck you to life and its endless amount of questions because I'm not sure if I want to do CG anymore.

302
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:54,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what CG, I don't know if that means that's what he wanted to do when he got out of school or what have you.

303
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:57,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was kind of deep.

304
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to life, though.

305
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave says he's coming over to the show.

306
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not a fuck you.

307
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:05,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't send me those messages.

308
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:14,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Lab says fuck you to Neil, the CBGL tech guy, for fucking up the 4th Plus installation by not looking in the box for the flash card he needed.

309
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:16,712
[SPEAKER_05]: So you gotta look for all the parts.

310
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:18,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm being corrected.

311
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Computer graphics animation, you bastard.

312
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:23,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Jesus.

313
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:29,326
[SPEAKER_05]: DCB says, give a big fuck you to non-optical mouses.

314
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:32,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So, he hates mouses with balls.

315
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:34,369
[SPEAKER_05]: He prefers the female mouses.

316
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:38,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Little holes with beams of light shooting out of them.

317
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:44,114
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the fuck yous of the week from the chat room.

318
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:48,055
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any additional fuck yous, just send them to me real quick over private message.

319
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:50,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in our chat room at Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

320
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:54,739
[SPEAKER_05]: over on irc.eggheads.org.

321
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat rooms like them at the lights, beams.

322
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Little station updates to take care of.

323
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:05,917
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some little housekeeping issues I need to tell you guys about.

324
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:08,658
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, we rebroadcast this show.

325
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:13,679
[SPEAKER_05]: The show we do tonight gets rebroadcast on Monday night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

326
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:18,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And then an old show, a classic show, is rebroadcast at 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

327
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And this week, it's going to be the show with the interviews from the Dollar Mendy Tournament, that Mountain Mike's tournament that was a few weeks ago.

328
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:27,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Those interviews are up in the old show rotation.

329
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:28,362
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be at 9 o'clock on Monday.

330
00:27:28,822 --> 00:27:29,202
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

331
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:33,735
[SPEAKER_05]: This, starting with this last week, we tested it this last week and it's a go.

332
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:38,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting, we're going to also rebroadcast on Thursdays at 2 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

333
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:45,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's more for the benefit of people on the East Coast or just people overseas that want to try and catch the show at a different time.

334
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're airing, because, you know, we do 7 o'clock tonight, we do 7 o'clock on Mondays.

335
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:50,702
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll take it five hours earlier on Thursdays.

336
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet, I can listen to it at work.

337
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:37,974
[SPEAKER_05]: either next week or the week after going all the way back to episode one so the old show rotation will be like a couple months behind so it'll really give you a chance to catch up at that point we should do one day where we just play every show back to back we are going to do the marathon I just don't know when yet

338
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably in the next couple weeks, like maybe weekend after next, something like that.

339
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:43,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to happen.

340
00:28:43,913 --> 00:28:45,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got to get the timing of it all worked out.

341
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:47,355
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will do back-to-back-to-back episodes.

342
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be like MTV rerunning Real World or Sorority Life.

343
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:54,319
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just catch everything that's happened in one day.

344
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even have to listen every night.

345
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:58,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'd like it if you do.

346
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:01,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, have you seen the previews for Real World?

347
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:03,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Las Vegas?

348
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:05,346
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't watch crap.

349
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:07,459
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

350
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:10,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to watch the real world, but I think the last one I watched was...

351
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:17,225
[SPEAKER_05]: The one, it was Seattle because you had the guy that bitch slapped the girl as she got in the car.

352
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,646
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the last real world I saw.

353
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:19,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just put it this way.

354
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,227
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting really desperate.

355
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:26,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I think every single person on there, their parents either died, got divorced, are druggies, are gay.

356
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:32,852
[SPEAKER_02]: One or the other, they're all like that and they're all messed up and they're all like horny and having sex with each other.

357
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:33,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's ratings.

358
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:34,773
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

359
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not real at all.

360
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:41,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, let's get this big bunch of dysfunctional people, throw them together in a little closet and

361
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:43,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope that everything works out.

362
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:45,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's retarded.

363
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:09,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another big FU for the week, and actually for everything.

364
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:09,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

365
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:13,762
[SPEAKER_02]: This FU is going to reality TV.

366
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate reality TV.

367
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:18,606
[SPEAKER_02]: It is such an oxymoron.

368
00:30:20,267 --> 00:30:20,667
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

369
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:23,518
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it inoxiable?

370
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:24,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not really real.

371
00:30:24,598 --> 00:30:25,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not real at all.

372
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:26,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like retarded.

373
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:30,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all these shows, like, okay, Survivor, maybe that was an original idea.

374
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:33,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now everyone's trying to copy Survivor.

375
00:30:33,502 --> 00:30:35,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what happens to these people.

376
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:36,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they all die.

377
00:30:36,964 --> 00:30:40,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for a jet plane to come overhead and crash down into them.

378
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:43,207
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to go on one of these shows to win a million dollars?

379
00:30:44,528 --> 00:30:45,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go on the show.

380
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:52,893
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, what do you think if they really, now remember there's a rumor a couple months back, I don't know how, the truth behind it, but that they were going to do a game show out of DDR.

381
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:59,577
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about a reality show based around, because you could consider a game show a reality show, a reality show based on DDR.

382
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:00,037
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

383
00:31:01,478 --> 00:31:03,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's about as good as the DDR movie.

384
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:07,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we're at it, let's have a DDR sitcom.

385
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:09,797
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole comedy set around DDR.

386
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:10,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to introduce Dave.

387
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:22,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave's in the house now, so a big hello to Dave, who, of course, five seconds in to him getting here, he wants to say something, so let's... Well, first I was going to say what happened during the show, because I wasn't here.

388
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,783
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't our fault.

389
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:27,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was just, you know, like, five second recap.

390
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:27,864
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

391
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about stuff.

392
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:31,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

393
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:35,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki bitched about DDR Sims.

394
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki bitched about QZAR.

395
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:40,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki bitched about reality TV shows.

396
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:42,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Sky bitched about Loki.

397
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:43,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Sky bitched about Loki.

398
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:44,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.

399
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:47,925
[SPEAKER_04]: When did people start talking about themselves in the third person?

400
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,005
[SPEAKER_04]: When did that start happening?

401
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

402
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

403
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:52,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's the cool thing to do.

404
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:58,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, Dave was wondering about this DDR reality show.

405
00:31:59,235 --> 00:31:59,995
[SPEAKER_04]: How would that work?

406
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:05,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, go to Survivor, uh-oh, the challenge, unless you get knocked off, you have to full combo this catastrophic heart.

407
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:07,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that would do.

408
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:11,360
[SPEAKER_04]: All I heard about you talking earlier was Paranoia, God Mix, or something.

409
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance for immunity and throw people off the machines.

410
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:20,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Lock 20 Bomani freaks in the arcade in the middle of the night, and...

411
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:22,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

412
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:23,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw things at them.

413
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:26,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney rave mad onage stuff.

414
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:27,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

415
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:30,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

416
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any FUs of the week, Dave?

417
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:40,177
[SPEAKER_04]: F you people who play Soul Calibur against me because you're taking down my character.

418
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:43,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I played Soul Calibur 2 for the first time.

419
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:45,299
[SPEAKER_05]: For the first time yesterday.

420
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know how to play Soul Calibur at all.

421
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of butt mash.

422
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:52,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started on the conquest and I beat everybody.

423
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:53,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so happy.

424
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:56,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I joined the green people and I whooped on the red people.

425
00:32:56,484 --> 00:33:02,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And the funny thing is, is that Will Slinky, if you're listening, we all picked his character to fight because we wanted to pick on him because we found him.

426
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you fight my character because I was also in the red arm?

427
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:06,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

428
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It fought a lot of noobs and then Will was last.

429
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:11,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And both me and Glenn kicked his ass, so we had fun.

430
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:17,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Conquest mode is the best because you fight people who are basically the same level.

431
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:21,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you join in with a new character, you'll basically fight all the easiest guys in that army.

432
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,861
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you get the good people, you'll start fighting me.

433
00:33:25,112 --> 00:33:25,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see.

434
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:28,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have to say, my Ivy, she rules.

435
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:30,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Ivy is the bomb.

436
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:33,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't this a DDR show and we're here just talking about Soul Calibur?

437
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:33,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.

438
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of the people that play DDR also in the other games.

439
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:39,284
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to restrict yourself to just the music games.

440
00:33:39,865 --> 00:33:41,026
[SPEAKER_05]: But, whatever.

441
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I got to play more Dance Maniacs this weekend.

442
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:44,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

443
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:45,449
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

444
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that game.

445
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:48,692
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it about Dance Maniacs that you enjoy?

446
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's, I don't know, it's...

447
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:53,889
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of possibility for freestyle in that.

448
00:33:53,909 --> 00:34:01,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not realize because I actually watched Mr. Wendell and this other guy doing freestyle in there and it was quite amazing.

449
00:34:01,713 --> 00:34:02,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fun.

450
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:03,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

451
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do people play poppin' music?

452
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:11,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people play poppin' music for the big round buttons.

453
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Poppin' music's pretty rad.

454
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:13,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

455
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:15,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

456
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:18,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, why are you drawn to play DDR for the first time?

457
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:19,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, big flashing lights.

458
00:34:19,697 --> 00:34:22,320
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to play poppin' music because, ooh, big buttons I can push.

459
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,961
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know.

460
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,163
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I liked about it.

461
00:34:24,223 --> 00:34:26,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and about the dance maniacs.

462
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:27,647
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to hit like four at once.

463
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:28,769
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to hit them with your forearm.

464
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:29,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

465
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

466
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:32,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyway, back to Dave's topic.

467
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:33,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry.

468
00:34:34,223 --> 00:34:38,066
[SPEAKER_04]: About the Dance Maniacs, I really do not find that appealing at all.

469
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:40,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, gee, why not?

470
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:44,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the Macarena mixed in with the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, or whatever it's called.

471
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:46,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just moving your hands.

472
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:50,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's para, except that you're restricted to two buttons at different height levels.

473
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's no fun.

474
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Para is okay, but not that good.

475
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:58,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they're different games.

476
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:02,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not trying to be ParaPara, it's just trying to be Dance Maniacs.

477
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:05,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and yeah.

478
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:07,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's okay to play Dance Maniacs with your feet.

479
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I tried that, and then...

480
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried using my head, and I hit it on the machine, and it was pointy.

481
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:16,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was pretty funny.

482
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:27,983
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a bunch of spots where you had to hit both undersides of the thing, and this guy kept doing this thing where he'd grab the bar on the machine and actually kind of do like a hip thrust into the machine.

483
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:35,324
[SPEAKER_05]: You just kind of have to just mount one of those little sensors that stick, and now like, right on like a cowboy.

484
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:36,904
[SPEAKER_02]: But it worked.

485
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:40,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like really funny, but it worked, so, you know.

486
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:41,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

487
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:45,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting some late submitted FUs of the week, so let's have a look at them.

488
00:35:46,997 --> 00:35:49,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to just drive this bit into the ground the other night.

489
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:55,161
[SPEAKER_05]: JB gives a big fuck you to regular DDR for not having the Dance Magic mode that Disney Mix has.

490
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean, that's a given.

491
00:35:58,062 --> 00:36:00,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Magic's been needed in regular DDR for a long time.

492
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:12,815
[SPEAKER_05]: 23rd Magus says a big fuck you to ZTNet and whoever else sells the Boom PSX to USB converters I got seriously fucking stiffed out of 20 bucks so fuck you to ZTNet

493
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:15,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll cover that more later on.

494
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:18,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, let's talk about that.

495
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:26,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about the USBs, because there's so many options here for going PlayStation to PC, and I don't know shit about it, so you've got to help me here, Loki.

496
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:34,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, all these stupid converters that they have out there, they're meant for one thing, is making the actual PlayStation controllers work with the PC.

497
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:40,634
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, is that, you know, most people buy these to use with like DDR SIMs and that kind of stuff.

498
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,015
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not meant for that.

499
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:47,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the way DDR pads are set up, it's really funky because they have them mapped as buttons.

500
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:55,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the problem is, is all these converters, they map the actual directional pad, not as buttons, but as axes.

501
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:58,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the problem is, is you can't...

502
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:03,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Push, like, up and down at the same time, like, where there might be a jump, or you can't push left and right.

503
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:07,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you can only push, you know, one direction at one time.

504
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:08,726
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the problem.

505
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:21,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people buy these pads, and especially, you know, big FU2 fries for putting the Kiki Joys next to the DDR PC, because people think, oh, it's going to work with, you know, the DDR PC.

506
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:23,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, not at all.

507
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:28,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And DCB wants to send a big fuck you to the Kiki Joys, by the way, because the software doesn't work on his computer.

508
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:29,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's another thing.

509
00:37:30,305 --> 00:37:35,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two USB converters also I bought a long time ago to try using with my sim.

510
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:37,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Ended up having to buy a parallel one.

511
00:37:37,768 --> 00:37:39,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And trust me, that was the best move I ever made.

512
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:44,729
[SPEAKER_02]: The parallel ones work great, and they work with the standard DirectPad Pro.

513
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not buy USB ones.

514
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,682
[SPEAKER_02]: All these controllers or converters do not work with the DDR pads.

515
00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:24,827
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be one out there, but you're going to go through about 50 of them before you find one that actually works.

516
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:28,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So just buy the parallel ones, save yourself some time.

517
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:35,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're using them for, say, Beatmania 2DX sim or something like that, they'll work fine for that, but just not DDR.

518
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:37,738
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

519
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:43,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things going over Dave's head, because he was sitting there going, this whole chat's going over my head because I don't play DDR on PC.

520
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat room wants to know, how tall are you, Dave?

521
00:38:46,382 --> 00:38:47,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're seeing you on the webcam right now.

522
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:50,544
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't even know we had a webcam up right now.

523
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:51,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we got a webcam.

524
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:52,905
[SPEAKER_05]: How tall are you?

525
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:54,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Freakishly tall.

526
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:56,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, not that tall.

527
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:57,208
[SPEAKER_04]: 6'1".

528
00:38:58,188 --> 00:38:58,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taller.

529
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm 6'2".

530
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:02,030
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm sitting down, so they can't tell.

531
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So, last fuck yous of the week, okay?

532
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:08,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten a couple more, so these are the last fuck yous of the week.

533
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Lab says, fuck you to sims that don't work on Macs.

534
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a very valid fuck you of the week, because Macs are being neglected, of course.

535
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,181
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to buy a real computer.

536
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:18,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

537
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:19,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just going to say.

538
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:20,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

539
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:21,461
[SPEAKER_05]: When you make a computer... Macs are cool.

540
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:22,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Macs are great for art stuff.

541
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:23,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Macs.

542
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:29,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they look like artsy computers that you'd find in an art gallery, because, let's see, one looked like a toaster...

543
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:32,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Worked like a toaster, pretty much was a toaster.

544
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:36,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have one that looks like a stupid little sphere with this thing sticking out of it.

545
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:40,867
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to hand it to Max for coming up with these really freaky dimes.

546
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:42,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the clear speakers.

547
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:43,467
[SPEAKER_02]: That you can't upgrade.

548
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,148
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing that sucks about Max.

549
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what was it?

550
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:52,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Gateway made this really retarded looking computer that's trying to copy the iPod.

551
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:53,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

552
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:57,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated Gateway to begin with, and this isn't really helping them.

553
00:39:58,111 --> 00:39:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks like crap.

554
00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:01,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're about to start a war in the chatroom, Macs versus PCs.

555
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me get to the other FU of the week.

556
00:40:03,216 --> 00:40:04,117
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Dave, what do you want to say?

557
00:40:04,697 --> 00:40:08,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say that George Foreman Grill looks exactly like the iMac.

558
00:40:09,422 --> 00:40:12,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you put them next to each other, I thought that it was an iMac commercial.

559
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:15,427
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, hamburger, hot dog.

560
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you try to cook a hot dog on an iPod?

561
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:24,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it did look pretty appetizing, you know, to just, like, put a hot dog in between the keys of the iMac.

562
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:29,715
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, you know, they look exactly like, and they both have the same transparent colors.

563
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:32,876
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do have... Get your hot dogs off the keyboard!

564
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:37,437
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have, you know, seriously, though, for the G4, they really have this kick-ass monitor for it.

565
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:44,039
[SPEAKER_02]: They have this, like, high-definition 24-inch monitor out there for the Macs, and those kick-ass.

566
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:44,919
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that...

567
00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:47,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

568
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:54,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you from Takeout Kid to UCB for not getting DDR Max 2 and making the current fifth mix a dollar.

569
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:56,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

570
00:40:56,569 --> 00:41:02,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at one point, the Metreon was charging $2 a game for 5th Mix, I believe, so it could be worse.

571
00:41:02,674 --> 00:41:05,796
[SPEAKER_02]: $2 a game for 5th Mix, so that means $4 for doubles.

572
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:07,257
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

573
00:41:07,497 --> 00:41:09,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on how many songs you're getting, I guess.

574
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:20,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when the Metreon charged like $1.50 or $2 for like 1st Mix or $1.50 or something ridiculous, and then you go right into the other room and they have the same thing for like a quarter or 50 cents less each year.

575
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:25,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, no more fuck you's of the week.

576
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:26,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to save them until next week now.

577
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:29,837
[SPEAKER_05]: JB has got a question for you, Loki.

578
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:35,420
[SPEAKER_05]: He wants to know if you know anything about DSE, the DDR Sequence Editor, and what it is.

579
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:41,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the DDR Sequence Editor is an old editing, or it's an edit-making program that's pretty old.

580
00:41:41,943 --> 00:41:44,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like compatible with, you know, fifth mix down.

581
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:48,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do freeze arrows or anything like that.

582
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:49,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.

583
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:51,547
[SPEAKER_02]: It works on older PCs and stuff.

584
00:41:52,167 --> 00:42:00,930
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're actually going to use an actual editor for making edits on your PC for DDR, I would recommend the...

585
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:24,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called DDR Edit Max 300 And it's actually pretty cool It supports freezeros and everything like that The only problem is it doesn't really Some of the edits that are made with it aren't really compatible You have to go in and hex edit something So you kind of have to know what you're doing Okay But it's No, I've never used it yet Because it's the only thing that will run on my Quit breaking things What are you doing?

586
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,526
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell are you doing?

587
00:42:26,607 --> 00:42:31,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave's playing with a webcam Just ignore Dave Stop making animals in compromising positions here

588
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:43,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, it's good for if you have an older computer, like my crappy ass laptop that I use for editing DDR songs at the arcade I go to, how sad is that?

589
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:50,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, it's the only thing that'll work, so give it a try, but they're all Japanese, so it's hard to say.

590
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question.

591
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,761
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you know about this new simulator?

592
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's coming out called Feet of Fury.

593
00:42:56,722 --> 00:42:57,842
[SPEAKER_05]: You know anything about this at all?

594
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,143
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first I've heard of it.

595
00:42:59,323 --> 00:42:59,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

596
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:00,003
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

597
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:01,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's go to a break.

598
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:03,085
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you read up on this page, see what you think of it.

599
00:43:03,765 --> 00:43:06,507
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to a break here real fast, and we'll come back.

600
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:13,230
[SPEAKER_05]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and thanks for tuning in, and we will be right back.

601
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:02,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear the cheering?

602
00:45:03,018 --> 00:45:03,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Performance!

603
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:46,619
Perfect!

604
00:46:15,928 --> 00:46:18,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Your dance showed us a dream for the future.

605
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow is another day.

606
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:22,874
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one who'll give us hope for the future.

607
00:48:20,803 --> 00:48:25,807
[SPEAKER_08]: After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.

608
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:30,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Undersedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.

609
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:37,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UndersedationLive.org.

610
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:43,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Babe, I got you babe.

611
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I got you babe.

612
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:54,085
Thanks for watching!

613
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:50,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's time for Erotic Op Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

614
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:51,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it all night.

615
00:50:51,857 --> 00:50:52,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it with me.

616
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,598
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, that was awful.

617
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:55,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Bloody terrible.

618
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:56,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you take vocal lessons?

619
00:50:57,019 --> 00:50:57,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill your teacher.

620
00:50:58,499 --> 00:50:59,499
[SPEAKER_05]: In the heat of the night.

621
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

622
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it.

623
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:06,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

624
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:06,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Next.

625
00:51:09,882 --> 00:51:11,003
[SPEAKER_13]: That was cool.

626
00:51:12,423 --> 00:51:14,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you even know why you're here?

627
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:15,944
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just bloody pathetic.

628
00:51:16,024 --> 00:51:16,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Next.

629
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:22,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes!

630
00:51:22,464 --> 00:51:23,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that's it!

631
00:51:23,466 --> 00:51:24,649
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a winner!

632
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,338
[SPEAKER_10]: A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

633
00:51:30,931 --> 00:51:34,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

634
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:39,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave told me I couldn't come back saying that because I always say it.

635
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:42,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured, though, that's really the last time I'm going to be able to use that.

636
00:51:42,674 --> 00:51:45,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to take that out of rotation now because American Idol's over.

637
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:46,454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done with.

638
00:51:46,915 --> 00:51:48,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So the parody, it doesn't work.

639
00:51:48,735 --> 00:51:50,755
[SPEAKER_05]: People are going to forget about American Idol next week.

640
00:51:51,135 --> 00:51:53,056
[SPEAKER_05]: That chick who won, people ain't going to care.

641
00:51:53,116 --> 00:51:53,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Come next week.

642
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:55,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care now.

643
00:51:56,437 --> 00:51:57,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you didn't care then.

644
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:57,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

645
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:00,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Farewell to that little promo.

646
00:52:00,288 --> 00:52:03,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Being suggested, I do something for the new Survivor that's debuting.

647
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Do some kind of Orange Lounge Survivor.

648
00:52:06,412 --> 00:52:07,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea how that works.

649
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:14,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can advertise a big twist, like, ooh, coming up, a big new intro, and then not do it like I did this week.

650
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:22,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to mention, since I was noticing in the chat room, someone was listening to a remix of Let Them Move, which kind of jogged my memory.

651
00:52:22,503 --> 00:52:25,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember reading something back on the DDR Maniacs boards,

652
00:52:26,526 --> 00:52:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Not possible, I say.

653
00:52:28,288 --> 00:52:28,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

654
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:52,346
[SPEAKER_02]: So I challenge people out there to find the damn MP3 for that so we can listen to it and see if it's actually good or if it just sucks or if it doesn't exist.

655
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:57,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that you could make a good one if you made an instrumental remix of it.

656
00:52:57,789 --> 00:53:04,032
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, took out the... And then you took out the music and then you put in new music.

657
00:53:04,312 --> 00:53:05,193
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need to do?

658
00:53:05,413 --> 00:53:13,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because a lot of times they'll take the old, I don't know, they'll take the Japanese songs, you know, sung by B4U, and they'll convert them into English.

659
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:16,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's just have them sing that in, you know, Japanese.

660
00:53:16,662 --> 00:53:19,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Crash, which is Breakdown.

661
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:20,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

662
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:20,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically.

663
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:25,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's still... Which was being requested in the chat room during the break, and no.

664
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like Crash personally.

665
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to take it out on everybody.

666
00:53:31,093 --> 00:53:31,614
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate that song.

667
00:53:32,134 --> 00:53:32,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

668
00:53:32,594 --> 00:53:33,075
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

669
00:53:33,515 --> 00:53:38,417
[SPEAKER_05]: If I get, like, money or other kinds of favors and begs and pleading, maybe we'll play it.

670
00:53:40,138 --> 00:53:40,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not.

671
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:41,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I just gotta fuck you.

672
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:43,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

673
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,561
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do we want to talk about?

674
00:53:48,182 --> 00:53:53,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, that sim that we saw... Yeah, the one we were looking at during the break, and I accidentally took it off the screen.

675
00:53:54,005 --> 00:53:54,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go back.

676
00:53:54,885 --> 00:54:00,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like somebody is developing something for Dreamcast, and it's gonna be a DDR simulator.

677
00:54:00,828 --> 00:54:01,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there...

678
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:06,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like they're being kind of careful not to call it like DDR, but they're saying it's in the same vein as DDR.

679
00:54:06,802 --> 00:54:08,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Feet of Fury.

680
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:13,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Feet of Fury, special!

681
00:54:14,727 --> 00:54:20,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like, I don't know, it's sort of like, um, it looks like it's just all dance magic mode.

682
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:21,332
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what it is.

683
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:23,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

684
00:54:23,724 --> 00:54:24,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

685
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:33,034
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying... I'm looking at their website, and if you're in our chat room right now, our website address was posted, and maybe Twin will post it again for you if you want to see this page.

686
00:54:33,055 --> 00:54:38,761
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like DDR is going to be on the Dreamcast, basically, but it's more of a competitive thing.

687
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:39,362
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying...

688
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:44,716
[SPEAKER_05]: You want something a little more interesting or challenging and it doesn't require yet still more speed.

689
00:54:45,196 --> 00:54:51,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've spent over a year building tools and developing what will give you a step in the right direction for beat games.

690
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to have a little bit of 3D.

691
00:54:56,742 --> 00:54:58,142
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use a standard controller.

692
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,583
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use a DDR dance mat.

693
00:55:00,443 --> 00:55:01,764
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got 12 songs in it.

694
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:04,605
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks like a demo of what's going on.

695
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Some musicians.

696
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:07,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to see...

697
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:11,648
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of... They're saying it's going to be a little more competitive.

698
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:15,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find any more information about that.

699
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they're expecting a beta release of it.

700
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be this October, October 1st.

701
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:22,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the expected final release is going to be January 1st of next year.

702
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:24,553
[SPEAKER_02]: So, looking forward to that.

703
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:25,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

704
00:55:25,153 --> 00:55:25,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that'll be interesting.

705
00:55:26,014 --> 00:55:27,634
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll review that as soon as it's released.

706
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:34,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anybody from that group is listening and wants to give us a sneak advance copy, hey, I don't say no to that stuff either.

707
00:55:35,397 --> 00:55:35,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

708
00:55:37,018 --> 00:55:37,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

709
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:37,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

710
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:48,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, big story, it's been two weeks since we've been here in the studio, quote unquote, because last week, as you know, we taped in advance at Roseville Golf Land.

711
00:55:48,352 --> 00:55:50,095
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of mixed reaction to that show.

712
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:53,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people really liked it, some people thought it was ass, but what can you do, you know?

713
00:55:54,524 --> 00:56:10,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there, I was listening, and I thought it was, the one part was cool, where you were like, yeah, we're from that school, and doing an interview, yeah, and then the rest of it was kind of boring, except for like, Brad going, and you know, that stuff, but it was okay, it wasn't that good.

714
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:13,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for that honest opinion, Siskel, I appreciate it.

715
00:56:15,398 --> 00:56:17,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Ebert, Siskel, maybe you're too young for that, I don't know.

716
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,261
[SPEAKER_05]: He died a while ago.

717
00:56:21,062 --> 00:56:22,643
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the fat one didn't die, the fat one's still alive.

718
00:56:22,663 --> 00:56:23,904
[SPEAKER_05]: The fat one ate him, dammit.

719
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,084
[SPEAKER_05]: We were actually secretly hoping we would get kicked out of Golf Land because it would have been great radio.

720
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:32,766
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, oh shit, what do we do now?

721
00:56:32,786 --> 00:56:37,170
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll hitchhike our way over to... Well, we wouldn't have to hitchhike to Brookfields.

722
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:41,754
[SPEAKER_05]: We could walk over there, hitchhike our way over to a nearby... Now broadcasting at the volcano on Hole 3...

723
00:56:47,828 --> 00:56:48,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit, alright.

724
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:52,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But while we were gone, this big news story came out.

725
00:56:52,693 --> 00:56:57,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure everybody's heard of it by now, but we want to talk about it anyway, because we like to be repetitive on this show.

726
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:05,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Greece, the Isle of Greece, banned electronic games, period.

727
00:57:05,645 --> 00:57:11,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning no DDR, no Game Boys, no Nintendos, no arcade games whatsoever.

728
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:14,844
[SPEAKER_05]: No solitaire on your computer with Windows.

729
00:57:15,184 --> 00:57:15,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

730
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they want to prevent gambling.

731
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:20,869
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of this?

732
00:57:21,529 --> 00:57:22,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's retarded.

733
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you two bucks that it won't last ten days.

734
00:57:26,673 --> 00:57:28,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's been ten days, hasn't it?

735
00:57:28,434 --> 00:57:28,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

736
00:57:30,236 --> 00:57:31,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I just gambled, so...

737
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever you are, you are losing!

738
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gambling over whether or not it works or not.

739
00:57:39,094 --> 00:57:44,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And that revokes the point of... Oh shit, I did it again.

740
00:57:44,698 --> 00:57:53,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being corrected, it wasn't just the gambling, it was the violence in games too, because you know, solitaire and Minesweeper can be a bloody fucking battle when you lose.

741
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:57,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Minesweeper, I mean the bombs, they want to keep that away from the kids.

742
00:57:57,387 --> 00:57:59,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, you have to place the flag...

743
00:58:00,285 --> 00:58:02,586
[SPEAKER_04]: You get it wrong, uh-oh, you lose.

744
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:04,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, they're just bitter over the Olympics.

745
00:58:06,907 --> 00:58:08,207
[SPEAKER_02]: How so, for those that don't know?

746
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:10,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, they're just bitter.

747
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:15,849
[SPEAKER_02]: That they didn't get to host the... Freaking crazy Greeks and their damn mythology and their gods and stuff.

748
00:58:16,049 --> 00:58:18,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's their gods of irony and gods of stupidity?

749
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:20,650
[SPEAKER_02]: They must be working full swing now.

750
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:25,471
[SPEAKER_05]: You can address those cards and letters to Loki, care of Orange Flown's radio.

751
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:28,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Rob.

752
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:31,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably heard all of our listeners listening from Greece.

753
00:58:32,938 --> 00:58:34,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I believe we do have listeners from Greece.

754
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to check the statistics really fast.

755
00:58:36,762 --> 00:58:37,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go check the stats.

756
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:41,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Some interesting things, though, about the stats, which surprised me.

757
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:45,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada is no longer the number two country listening to this program.

758
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:45,631
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what it is?

759
00:58:46,452 --> 00:58:46,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan.

760
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:47,894
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's third?

761
00:58:49,102 --> 00:58:49,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Korea.

762
00:58:50,243 --> 00:58:51,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Greece?

763
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:52,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Greece.

764
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:52,765
[SPEAKER_05]: No, then.

765
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:55,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we invite the Greek to live vicariously through us.

766
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:59,829
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've had your video games robbed from you, hey, we'll tell you about what you're missing out on.

767
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:04,052
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, I'm just... No, I have them like... Alright, thank you.

768
00:59:04,512 --> 00:59:05,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

769
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

770
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:07,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, how many people are listening?

771
00:59:07,802 --> 00:59:08,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean... Enough.

772
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:15,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, we got the number... It's like coming in second place with two listeners is Japan.

773
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And then tied for third is Canada, Korea, and the U.S.

774
00:59:17,532 --> 00:59:18,553
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it's more than that.

775
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:19,213
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more than that.

776
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:24,598
[SPEAKER_15]: We will be the new underground movement for our computer games and our cha-cha games.

777
00:59:25,419 --> 00:59:25,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God.

778
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,601
[SPEAKER_04]: We will overcome.

779
00:59:29,302 --> 00:59:31,464
[SPEAKER_04]: We shall overcome.

780
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:34,767
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is what happens when you play too much 2DX like Bradley.

781
00:59:34,807 --> 00:59:35,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Grease.

782
00:59:35,688 --> 00:59:38,691
[SPEAKER_04]: You stopped it at the root.

783
00:59:38,892 --> 00:59:39,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking for Grease.

784
00:59:40,853 --> 00:59:43,076
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nobody has listened to this show from Grease, unfortunately.

785
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:45,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's that there?

786
00:59:45,242 --> 00:59:46,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I see one stream from Greece.

787
00:59:46,723 --> 00:59:47,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there they are.

788
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:48,365
[SPEAKER_05]: The very, very bottom.

789
00:59:48,425 --> 00:59:48,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Greece.

790
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:50,246
[SPEAKER_05]: The very bottom.

791
00:59:50,506 --> 00:59:54,690
[SPEAKER_05]: One stream connected from Greece, not even for a full minute.

792
00:59:55,771 --> 00:59:58,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's somebody who connected and listened to that.

793
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:00,615
[SPEAKER_05]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

794
01:00:00,655 --> 01:00:01,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just like disconnected right there.

795
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

796
01:00:03,757 --> 01:00:06,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha, Greece doesn't have electronic games.

797
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:06,660
And then they...

798
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:14,165
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think they got that far, and then like the little underground Gestapo Grecian people came and was like, what are you doing?

799
01:00:14,205 --> 01:00:18,368
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be listening to something from out of, you know, the country, and then they break it.

800
01:00:18,808 --> 01:00:20,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if this show would be illegal in Greece.

801
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:27,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, you know, especially, we're like, you know, freaking propaganda over there, you know.

802
01:00:28,354 --> 01:00:35,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a weird thing, it applies to tourists too, so if you're going to go to Greece, don't take your Game Boy, because they'll throw your ass in jail, they don't care if you're a stupid American or what.

803
01:00:36,827 --> 01:00:42,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they just take the Game Boy and then they've got like the secret vault of all these Game Boys and stuff.

804
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:44,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like the landfills with Atari 2600 games?

805
01:00:44,492 --> 01:00:45,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all the old copies of E.T.

806
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:47,554
[SPEAKER_05]: that no one bought just in a landfill somewhere?

807
01:00:47,795 --> 01:00:49,456
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think it would be like a landfill.

808
01:00:49,476 --> 01:00:53,718
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep it in like, you know, I don't know if it's a president or the king of Greece or, you know, emperor or ruler.

809
01:00:53,758 --> 01:00:54,539
[SPEAKER_04]: The king of Greece.

810
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:55,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

811
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,360
[SPEAKER_04]: The god of Greece.

812
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:57,561
[SPEAKER_04]: The Grecian star.

813
01:00:57,781 --> 01:00:58,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Orpher to him is Zeus.

814
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:01,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I think that Zeus... John Travolta.

815
01:01:02,184 --> 01:01:03,085
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

816
01:01:03,105 --> 01:01:03,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

817
01:01:04,646 --> 01:01:05,947
[SPEAKER_04]: The Greece title.

818
01:01:07,048 --> 01:01:18,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so anyway, John Travolta slash Zeus is secretly made up this whole rule, got his secret Grecian Gestapo, just going around taking all the games just so he can play them.

819
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he makes a secret black market of...

820
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

821
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Messing with Bradley's 2DX controller.

822
01:01:26,063 --> 01:01:28,645
[SPEAKER_05]: He's taking out his aggressions on the Greek on Bradley's controller.

823
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:30,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley doesn't like that.

824
01:01:31,027 --> 01:01:39,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, he's normally the quiet type, but then sometimes he does his little evil takeover the world type C-Lab 2021 type thing.

825
01:01:40,736 --> 01:01:44,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, back to my story on the Grecian underworld takeover.

826
01:01:45,817 --> 01:01:55,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And so after they steal all of the games from everyone else, they'll make a secret black market and John Travolta will be able to play all the games.

827
01:01:56,465 --> 01:01:57,986
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think he gets so good at dancing?

828
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:02,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he can do all those little special hip thrust move things.

829
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:04,151
[SPEAKER_04]: You are on crack.

830
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:08,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm being told if we were to gamble on this show, then it would be illegal in Greece.

831
01:02:09,315 --> 01:02:09,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

832
01:02:10,587 --> 01:02:12,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you a dollar, Loki.

833
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:16,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you one dollar that we're not going to get any higher than that.

834
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:17,450
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now illegal.

835
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,731
[SPEAKER_05]: That Greece will forever be the last place country on our list.

836
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:21,231
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say?

837
01:02:22,631 --> 01:02:23,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Take me up on that bet?

838
01:02:23,392 --> 01:02:24,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Will anyone take me up on that bet?

839
01:02:25,252 --> 01:02:25,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

840
01:02:25,852 --> 01:02:26,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

841
01:02:26,293 --> 01:02:27,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will take you up on that bet.

842
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:31,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, therefore, now we are gambling on this show, and this show is now illegal in Greece.

843
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:33,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're listening, the cops are coming for you.

844
01:02:34,035 --> 01:02:34,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Lock the doors.

845
01:02:34,776 --> 01:02:35,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Lock the windows.

846
01:02:36,641 --> 01:02:37,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have doors and windows in Greece?

847
01:02:38,782 --> 01:02:39,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding, of course they do.

848
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:41,404
[SPEAKER_04]: They sure don't have video games, that sucks.

849
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Primitive cavemen without their video games, ha ha ha.

850
01:02:45,566 --> 01:02:47,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, them in the crappy Olympics.

851
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:50,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

852
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:52,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was that supposed to sound like?

853
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:53,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

854
01:02:53,992 --> 01:02:56,313
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, yeah, rich, snobby British people.

855
01:02:56,433 --> 01:02:56,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

856
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:58,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, what's Britain?

857
01:02:58,894 --> 01:03:00,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Britain's right about that.

858
01:03:00,415 --> 01:03:02,257
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not listing out much either, so.

859
01:03:02,317 --> 01:03:03,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, shit, that's like an hour.

860
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:04,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make fun of the British, I won't.

861
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:05,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see, okay.

862
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:07,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my FUs for the week here.

863
01:03:08,262 --> 01:03:16,368
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got FU to Greece, FU to Denmark, FU to Belgium, Taiwan, Yugoslavia, Germany, Pakistan, Netherlands.

864
01:03:17,008 --> 01:03:24,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Taiwan gets an excuse, because if you ever looked at a lot of the games you buy, they were made in Taiwan, so they don't have time to listen to the show, because they're all in slave labor making these games.

865
01:03:24,813 --> 01:03:28,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and special FU to Yugoslavia for beating the USA team.

866
01:03:28,216 --> 01:03:31,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that Taiwanese are in slave labor copying the games from Japan.

867
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:33,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, look!

868
01:03:34,281 --> 01:03:35,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it.

869
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:36,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweden is actually up there.

870
01:03:38,783 --> 01:03:39,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistan!

871
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:40,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that cool?

872
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:51,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet people that they can't guess what the number 7 ranked is.

873
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because you're looking at the thing.

874
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:56,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you know, Rob.

875
01:03:56,491 --> 01:03:58,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, since you can't see it, it's Venezuela.

876
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:04,587
[SPEAKER_04]: People in Venezuela listening to us talking about DDR.

877
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,609
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR is a hit worldwide.

878
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:08,249
[SPEAKER_05]: What can you say?

879
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:08,989
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big thing.

880
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexico, right above Venezuela.

881
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:13,112
[SPEAKER_05]: The French.

882
01:04:13,572 --> 01:04:15,393
[SPEAKER_02]: The French are listening.

883
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:17,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we make fun of the French a few shows back?

884
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:19,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember somebody went off on the French.

885
01:04:19,775 --> 01:04:21,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It was probably a Brad thing.

886
01:04:21,276 --> 01:04:28,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I remember on our boards, I blamed the French for the whole getting rid of the games in Greece.

887
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,482
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no correlation, but I blame the French.

888
01:04:32,362 --> 01:04:33,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was it.

889
01:04:33,823 --> 01:04:38,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that there was any public slander of the French on this radio.

890
01:04:38,346 --> 01:04:39,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe we need some.

891
01:04:39,827 --> 01:04:40,248
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

892
01:04:40,568 --> 01:04:44,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the French, personally, I really like French people.

893
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:50,835
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they make good food, and they've got one of those chefs that are on the Iron Chef, along with...

894
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Other countries that I don't see.

895
01:04:53,821 --> 01:05:00,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have every country that has an Iron Shaft guy is listening to this show.

896
01:05:00,544 --> 01:05:02,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet the stats are going off.

897
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:07,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'd like to give a shout out to Salman Bin Laden for listening to us from Pakistan.

898
01:05:07,847 --> 01:05:09,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So, way to go.

899
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:10,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah!

900
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:12,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

901
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:18,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Address those cards and letters once again to Loki because of views and opinions expressed on this show, blah, blah, blah.

902
01:05:19,071 --> 01:05:20,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's look at cities in the U.S.,

903
01:05:22,032 --> 01:05:27,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously Sacramento ranked number one, no surprise because we're all in Sacramento, we all listen to this station.

904
01:05:27,896 --> 01:05:32,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I knew AOL was big, but I never knew that they were their own city.

905
01:05:32,378 --> 01:05:36,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the weird thing is that AOL all goes through one thing, so they show up as one city on here.

906
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:38,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody that's on AOL has their own city.

907
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:41,807
[SPEAKER_05]: San Francisco, followed by Columbus, Ohio.

908
01:05:41,907 --> 01:05:43,088
[SPEAKER_05]: We got fans in Columbus.

909
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:43,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Word.

910
01:05:43,988 --> 01:05:48,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I did a big shout-out to us, you know, on the East Coast Invasion boards.

911
01:05:49,772 --> 01:05:50,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see who's in last place.

912
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:54,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see who's in last place and who we need to rough up some people.

913
01:05:55,096 --> 01:05:57,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to guess what city's in last place?

914
01:05:58,018 --> 01:05:59,399
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just the U.S.

915
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:00,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the U.S.

916
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, remember, this doesn't just count the live show.

917
01:06:02,901 --> 01:06:04,742
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also the Bomani Music and More program.

918
01:06:04,782 --> 01:06:06,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Bismarck, North Dakota.

919
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:07,244
[SPEAKER_05]: North Dakota.

920
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:08,505
[SPEAKER_05]: You're saying Bismarck, North Dakota.

921
01:06:08,525 --> 01:06:08,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Bismarck.

922
01:06:09,325 --> 01:06:09,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

923
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:10,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Bismarck.

924
01:06:10,707 --> 01:06:11,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Bismarck.

925
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:12,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Des Moines.

926
01:06:12,729 --> 01:06:12,990
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

927
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:13,891
[SPEAKER_05]: It was close!

928
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:15,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it!

929
01:06:15,432 --> 01:06:18,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Des Moines is in last place, followed by Bakersfield.

930
01:06:19,534 --> 01:06:20,394
[SPEAKER_05]: They have computers there.

931
01:06:20,414 --> 01:06:24,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Bakersfield's like, kind of by, like, it's a little poo town, right?

932
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:25,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like, cool?

933
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:27,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sorta.

934
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,776
[SPEAKER_05]: It's between here and L.A., really.

935
01:06:29,956 --> 01:06:31,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right before you go over the grapevine, if I'm not mistaken.

936
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what's the, hold on, scroll back up here for a second.

937
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,698
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, don't scroll.

938
01:06:37,018 --> 01:06:38,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that causes dropouts, but yeah.

939
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:40,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry.

940
01:06:40,399 --> 01:06:40,759
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

941
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:41,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm causing dropouts.

942
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:42,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Lookout.

943
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:47,323
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Denver counts for one city for like six different states.

944
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:48,624
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

945
01:06:48,664 --> 01:06:51,967
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got like Denver, Colorado, MT, I don't know what that is.

946
01:06:51,987 --> 01:06:52,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Montana.

947
01:06:52,447 --> 01:06:54,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevada.

948
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:55,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Nebraska, Nevada.

949
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:59,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's because theoretically anybody right on the borders could be connecting through a hub in Denver.

950
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:00,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would count.

951
01:07:00,514 --> 01:07:01,514
[SPEAKER_05]: This is getting really boring.

952
01:07:01,534 --> 01:07:03,096
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to go back to talking about Bumani.

953
01:07:03,636 --> 01:07:05,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's check Sky's private messages in the chat room.

954
01:07:06,662 --> 01:07:07,623
[SPEAKER_05]: This show sucks.

955
01:07:08,484 --> 01:07:09,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, gee, thank you.

956
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:13,508
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to have the webcam at a better angle.

957
01:07:13,568 --> 01:07:15,169
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wouldn't mind adjusting that, that would be nice.

958
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:17,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what else I have.

959
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:18,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, do not touch the webcam.

960
01:07:18,532 --> 01:07:19,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, you're not allowed to touch the webcam.

961
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:21,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, you are the weakest webcam.

962
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:21,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodbye.

963
01:07:25,537 --> 01:07:25,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave.

964
01:07:26,698 --> 01:07:27,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave.

965
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:32,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it down.

966
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:32,783
[SPEAKER_05]: No 2DX for you.

967
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:39,592
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making people dizzy on our webcam.

968
01:07:39,892 --> 01:07:44,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to know where the webcam is located, you have to be in our chat room at irc.eggheads.org.

969
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:46,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Just join Channel Pound to Orange Lodge.

970
01:07:46,436 --> 01:07:47,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Plug, plug, plug, plug.

971
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:48,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, plug, plug, plug, plug.

972
01:07:48,637 --> 01:07:49,418
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I do on this show.

973
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:55,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now we are going to talk about what Rob wants to talk about.

974
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:57,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, what I also have on the list.

975
01:07:57,422 --> 01:07:58,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's talk about this.

976
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:04,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami very soon is supposed to be announcing some kind of online Bomani game.

977
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:13,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know what it's going to be, but it's going to be an online music... Actually, I shouldn't say it's Bomani, but if it's Konami and if it's a music game, it's probably going to be Bomani.

978
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:17,776
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to be some kind of music game that's going to be playable online.

979
01:08:18,376 --> 01:08:19,618
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think it's going to be?

980
01:08:20,298 --> 01:08:21,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about this once before.

981
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it was on the air or not, but I think that...

982
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:38,230
[SPEAKER_04]: We basically all thought that it would be something around frequency or something like that with different players doing different instruments or combining to form a song or something of that sort.

983
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:41,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically a rip off of frequency you think?

984
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:43,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Marshall Beat Online.

985
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:46,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Marshall Beat Online.

986
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, the new Marshall Beat is so awesome because it's got Can't Touch This.

987
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:52,284
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't touch this in Marshall Beat.

988
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:56,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, you need to explain to me what Marshall Beat is because I don't know.

989
01:08:56,168 --> 01:08:57,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Marshall Beat is what?

990
01:08:57,329 --> 01:08:59,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Like para-para except it's karate.

991
01:08:59,250 --> 01:08:59,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

992
01:08:59,711 --> 01:08:59,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

993
01:09:00,071 --> 01:09:01,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how else to explain it.

994
01:09:01,452 --> 01:09:05,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what it is is you've got like these sensors that are on your hands and on your feet.

995
01:09:05,856 --> 01:09:07,697
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got another sensor kind of pretty much like...

996
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Mambo A Go Go or whatever that is.

997
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Mambo!

998
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,460
[SPEAKER_02]: No, whatever that is.

999
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:14,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Punch Mania.

1000
01:09:14,721 --> 01:09:16,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Samba de Amigo or whatever like that.

1001
01:09:16,382 --> 01:09:17,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1002
01:09:17,102 --> 01:09:20,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it's got the sensors and it can kind of, you know, that kind of thing.

1003
01:09:20,704 --> 01:09:26,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, you're on there and they'll ask you to punch up, punch down, kick, do whatever and you have to mimic stuff.

1004
01:09:26,407 --> 01:09:29,208
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have a mode where you can fight people and stuff.

1005
01:09:29,629 --> 01:09:32,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And all at the same time, they have really crappy music in the background.

1006
01:09:32,671 --> 01:09:33,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Raining Men and Petite Love

1007
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:04,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you punch to the music?

1008
01:10:04,272 --> 01:10:05,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it go like on beat punching?

1009
01:10:06,773 --> 01:10:07,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it does.

1010
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:09,854
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Taibo.

1011
01:10:10,614 --> 01:10:11,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom says.

1012
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:12,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like Taibo.

1013
01:10:12,495 --> 01:10:16,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Taibo, except that you pay by the minute instead of by the tape.

1014
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:17,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1015
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone finds me a place where I can get this.

1016
01:10:20,838 --> 01:10:24,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I will purchase this so that we can have it here.

1017
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,721
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the coolest thing ever.

1018
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:30,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play that all day.

1019
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:33,945
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can find where we can get this, I'll get it.

1020
01:10:34,405 --> 01:10:35,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just because.

1021
01:10:36,386 --> 01:10:37,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Move the webcam.

1022
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at a really bad point.

1023
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:41,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's now DaveTV.

1024
01:10:42,048 --> 01:10:43,069
[SPEAKER_02]: All Dave, all the time.

1025
01:10:43,929 --> 01:10:45,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other ideas what they could do for an online game?

1026
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:48,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania type thing?

1027
01:10:48,451 --> 01:10:49,152
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about that?

1028
01:10:49,272 --> 01:10:51,392
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to add some more instruments to that, I think.

1029
01:10:51,933 --> 01:10:53,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Keyboard Mania?

1030
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:54,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe bring that back?

1031
01:10:54,154 --> 01:10:59,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Keyboard Mania, Drum Mania, let's get like... Singing Mania, Karaoke Mania.

1032
01:11:00,442 --> 01:11:06,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Get, like, maybe even, uh... Yeah, I've discussed the karaoke thing before, but it's impossible to tell how you're singing.

1033
01:11:07,046 --> 01:11:16,051
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing that can really... I mean, you can sync up noises to tell how much it is, but it's not like you can get a better singing voice, you know?

1034
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:22,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can get more in tune and hit the right notes, but it's not like you have to hit with a certain amount of pressure or something.

1035
01:11:22,595 --> 01:11:27,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay, fat people can't play because you gotta hit it, you know, one gram of pressure.

1036
01:11:27,698 --> 01:11:30,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami presents American Idol Online!

1037
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:35,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, bring back the demo, or the promo, or whatever it's called.

1038
01:11:35,905 --> 01:11:44,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that's pretty funny that I actually saw, they have it as part of Monster Rancher 3 for the PlayStation 2, you can actually capture your face and put it on the monster.

1039
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:47,581
[SPEAKER_05]: We have that in the front room right now, I kid you not.

1040
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:49,121
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Monster Hunter 3.

1041
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:50,162
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I saw it.

1042
01:11:50,522 --> 01:11:52,583
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually capture your face and put it on there.

1043
01:11:52,803 --> 01:11:56,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be funny to capture your face and stick it on the dancers that are in the backgrounds.

1044
01:11:57,284 --> 01:12:00,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you should capture your face and stick it on the crotch part of the dancer.

1045
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:08,829
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just have like, I can just see Rob's smiling face right over Rage's like, I don't know, didn't we, I forget what we said about him like a few shows ago.

1046
01:12:08,969 --> 01:12:09,829
[SPEAKER_05]: As Emi's third tit?

1047
01:12:11,138 --> 01:12:11,918
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool, too.

1048
01:12:11,938 --> 01:12:12,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Pantsless Rage.

1049
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:17,361
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that might have been funny if I was in junior high.

1050
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:21,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have you, like, the Pantsless Rage thing that we were talking about, like, three weeks ago.

1051
01:12:21,182 --> 01:12:21,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay!

1052
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:25,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, like, censor it out with Rob's smiling head, being like, Whee!

1053
01:12:26,745 --> 01:12:28,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, this is, yeah.

1054
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:29,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm in Rage's pants!

1055
01:12:31,027 --> 01:12:31,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Whee!

1056
01:12:33,368 --> 01:12:36,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being told in the chatroom that they are making an American Idol game.

1057
01:12:39,082 --> 01:12:42,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Help Justin save the world from his big hair.

1058
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:43,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1059
01:12:43,146 --> 01:12:44,947
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell would an American Idol game be?

1060
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:48,511
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do in an American Idol game?

1061
01:12:49,191 --> 01:12:52,655
[SPEAKER_05]: How about, like, press a button if you want Simon to use this bitch out.

1062
01:12:52,675 --> 01:12:54,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Press a button if you want Simon to use this.

1063
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I challenge this.

1064
01:12:55,577 --> 01:12:56,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Press this button to bring out Paul.

1065
01:12:56,758 --> 01:13:04,506
[SPEAKER_02]: For our chat room here, I challenge you guys to make an American Idol sound basically...

1066
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:07,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Promo?

1067
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:16,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, no, well, a promo would be good too, but I was thinking more along the lines of a sound theme for DWI or something like that.

1068
01:13:16,724 --> 01:13:23,287
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, go back to, you know, you should, your music teacher should be shot or something like that, you know.

1069
01:13:24,896 --> 01:13:27,898
[SPEAKER_05]: You just want a sound file of somebody saying that?

1070
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:35,041
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just basically, you know, like DWI has sound themes where you have a bunch of different sound clips for like, you know, if you score an A, a combo, whatever.

1071
01:13:35,721 --> 01:13:37,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So something like that.

1072
01:13:38,443 --> 01:13:39,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to go ahead and take another break.

1073
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:43,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we come back, you want to do a listless?

1074
01:13:43,845 --> 01:13:44,406
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think?

1075
01:13:45,686 --> 01:13:46,507
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only four of us.

1076
01:13:47,987 --> 01:13:53,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the topic I was thinking of we could do is a song we'd like to see a decent freestyle done to.

1077
01:13:55,089 --> 01:13:55,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1078
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:55,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1079
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:57,831
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do you guys have any ideas?

1080
01:13:58,472 --> 01:13:59,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put the topics to the chatroom.

1081
01:13:59,793 --> 01:14:02,155
[SPEAKER_05]: What does the chatroom want us to decide tonight on Listless?

1082
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put the question out to them.

1083
01:14:04,897 --> 01:14:07,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see as soon as they respond to that.

1084
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:09,500
[SPEAKER_05]: No ideas from the peanut gallery here?

1085
01:14:11,342 --> 01:14:14,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've got to wait because we have to do our Listless thing during the break.

1086
01:14:14,744 --> 01:14:17,226
[SPEAKER_05]: People are sending them over private message.

1087
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:17,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1088
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:20,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're sending me a request for songs.

1089
01:14:20,869 --> 01:14:23,611
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not sending me... Songs you would like to hear on Marshall Beatz.

1090
01:14:25,356 --> 01:14:27,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised his Kung Fu Fighting wasn't on that.

1091
01:14:27,537 --> 01:14:28,918
[SPEAKER_05]: The best yoga song.

1092
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:32,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's only like four songs to pick from, dummy.

1093
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:39,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Damn Dare Ram, the remix of Damn Dare Ram, the KCP remix, or another one.

1094
01:14:40,503 --> 01:14:41,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn Dariam.

1095
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You say it like my dad would.

1096
01:14:42,684 --> 01:14:43,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn that Damn Dariam.

1097
01:14:44,004 --> 01:14:51,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say Damn Dariam, Damn Dariam, KCP remix, there's No Nobody's Love, and Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

1098
01:14:54,216 --> 01:14:57,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Charon's not giving me many good ideas here.

1099
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Dance Maniacs song.

1100
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:06,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Dance Maniacs?

1101
01:15:06,661 --> 01:15:09,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know enough Dance Maniacs songs to be able to do that.

1102
01:15:09,022 --> 01:15:10,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they all suck anyways.

1103
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:13,003
[SPEAKER_05]: We did the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania song already, right?

1104
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:14,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we?

1105
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:16,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.

1106
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:17,005
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we never did.

1107
01:15:17,085 --> 01:15:17,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, want to do that?

1108
01:15:20,206 --> 01:15:21,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's Paul's fault for not being here.

1109
01:15:23,866 --> 01:15:25,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked Paul if he wanted to come, he said no.

1110
01:15:27,767 --> 01:15:28,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so hurt.

1111
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:29,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if that's the case, then we're doing that tonight.

1112
01:15:29,868 --> 01:15:31,648
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do Best Guitar Freak Song without him here.

1113
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:35,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're doing Best Guitadora Song, I guess.

1114
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:38,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania.

1115
01:15:38,431 --> 01:15:40,291
[SPEAKER_05]: All three of those kind of meshed into one.

1116
01:15:40,731 --> 01:15:42,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Best song out of those.

1117
01:15:43,012 --> 01:15:46,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do that when we come back from this little break.

1118
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:51,035
[SPEAKER_05]: We started out with a song that was requested a lot in the chat room during the last break.

1119
01:15:51,075 --> 01:15:52,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is for you guys.

1120
01:15:53,673 --> 01:15:54,599
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not drop the Bizom.

1121
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:01,494
Thanks for watching!

1122

and the team.

1125
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:39,611
Sorry, could you make the music louder?

1126
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:40,631
Yeah, drop the bomb

1127
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:30,426

1128
01:19:51,175 --> 01:20:07,176
[SPEAKER_07]: What we gotta do is build momentum, if you need the right tools, invent them, ride the wave, time comes with the rhythm, the march of the future's begun, get with it, your brain is staring almighty, if I were you to do it now, your message can't go sour, yeah, if you're ready to take that fall, and it's up to you to make that call, and if it don't work, make the real thing, wipe it out, so drop the fall.

1129

Thanks for watching!

1130
01:23:15,442 --> 01:23:19,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1131
01:23:19,826 --> 01:23:21,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to be a staff member by Hollywood?

1132
01:23:21,588 --> 01:23:21,948
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

1133
01:23:22,069 --> 01:23:25,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we care what people think of us?

1134
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:28,195
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

1135
01:23:28,215 --> 01:23:29,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1136
01:23:30,116 --> 01:23:32,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

1137
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Extreme Babani Radio.

1138
01:23:36,282 --> 01:23:38,945
[SPEAKER_10]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1139
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:42,387
[SPEAKER_05]: That is us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1140
01:23:43,088 --> 01:23:45,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just seeing if Dave had a negative reaction to me doing that, too.

1141
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:46,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1142
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:54,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, he saved the picture of me looking like I was sucking on some... Well, it was actually the end of that little furry talkie thing.

1143
01:23:54,256 --> 01:23:54,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

1144
01:23:55,256 --> 01:23:55,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1145
01:23:58,419 --> 01:23:58,899
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing.

1146
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:00,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

1147
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a picture on the webcam.

1148
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:05,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds like it's orgasming half the time.

1149
01:24:05,571 --> 01:24:11,575
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but, um... And he saved it, so... I know he's gonna put it on, like, the main Orange Lounge.

1150
01:24:11,955 --> 01:24:13,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the only one that saved it, by the way.

1151
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:14,897
[SPEAKER_05]: People in the chatroom saved it, too.

1152
01:24:16,898 --> 01:24:18,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, have you seen this man?

1153
01:24:18,819 --> 01:24:20,220
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays the DDR.

1154
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,181
[SPEAKER_04]: He sucks the furry cock.

1155
01:24:23,282 --> 01:24:24,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I did not say that.

1156
01:24:25,303 --> 01:24:25,603
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1157
01:24:26,504 --> 01:24:29,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week on Orange Lounge... Oh, no, no, no, no.

1158
01:24:30,446 --> 01:24:31,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't pull that shit.

1159
01:24:32,107 --> 01:24:32,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1160
01:24:33,028 --> 01:24:33,148
Yeah.

1161
01:24:34,457 --> 01:24:35,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Song in Guitarora

1162
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:04,049
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go ahead and start.

1163
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:06,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I find some game show music this week for Listless?

1164
01:25:08,713 --> 01:25:09,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, why not?

1165
01:25:09,454 --> 01:25:11,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do some game show music, if I can find some.

1166
01:25:12,176 --> 01:25:15,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you go ahead and tell us your number three song, Loki, and we'll find the game show music.

1167
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to go with... Looks like Primal Soul.

1168
01:25:23,225 --> 01:25:24,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Primal Soul, okay.

1169
01:25:28,409 --> 01:25:30,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know that song, to be honest, but my bad.

1170
01:25:31,434 --> 01:25:45,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, uh... Well then let's hear if your choice is any better, Bradley.

1171
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,000
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your number three choice?

1172
01:25:46,881 --> 01:25:48,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley is somehow really hyper right now.

1173
01:25:48,782 --> 01:25:50,622
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all like, yeah, girl sounds really good.

1174
01:25:50,642 --> 01:25:54,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're getting him to talk on this show.

1175
01:25:54,644 --> 01:25:55,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut your mouth!

1176
01:25:55,345 --> 01:25:56,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, yes.

1177
01:25:57,831 --> 01:25:58,912
[SPEAKER_15]: My number three choice would be Liar Liar.

1178
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:32,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my number three is Naminori Johnny, but it's on 7Mix and 6Mix, Guitar Freaks Romania, and it's actually in Japanese, so you can't see Naminori Johnny.

1179
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:34,589
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't say that.

1180
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:39,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Spelled it out really bad, so you're just going to have to deal with me in the chat room.

1181
01:26:39,712 --> 01:26:41,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I just spelled that out best I could.

1182
01:26:41,873 --> 01:26:45,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, my number three choice was Miss You.

1183
01:26:46,152 --> 01:26:49,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is the long version of Ride on Time, but in Japanese, for those who don't know.

1184
01:26:49,994 --> 01:26:51,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was my number three choice.

1185
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:51,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

1186
01:26:51,914 --> 01:26:52,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to hell!

1187
01:26:54,536 --> 01:26:55,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Our music stopped.

1188
01:27:00,918 --> 01:27:01,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Your number two choice.

1189
01:27:02,519 --> 01:27:05,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, my number two choice has to be Eraser Engine.

1190
01:27:06,361 --> 01:27:07,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Eraser Engine.

1191
01:27:09,233 --> 01:27:10,174
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the older stuff.

1192
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:13,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going for... Getting a little old school.

1193
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the original Racer Moto Maximo.

1194
01:27:19,024 --> 01:27:19,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1195
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:21,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, your number two choice, Bradley?

1196
01:27:21,947 --> 01:27:23,909
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be Sanagi from Seven Spikes.

1197
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:28,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Good choice.

1198
01:27:28,855 --> 01:27:29,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, your number two choice, Dave.

1199
01:27:32,023 --> 01:27:34,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this one's really hard.

1200
01:27:35,705 --> 01:27:39,786
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two choice, I guess, is Double Trouble.

1201
01:27:39,926 --> 01:27:41,627
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great song.

1202
01:27:41,907 --> 01:27:47,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Paul Voltaire has his least favorite song on any Bomani game, but that was just for Guitar Freaks.

1203
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:49,250
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual song, Success.

1204
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:51,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have that really stuff.

1205
01:27:51,811 --> 01:27:52,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Double Cheeseburger!

1206
01:27:54,872 --> 01:27:55,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1207
01:27:55,593 --> 01:27:55,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1208
01:27:56,953 --> 01:28:00,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my number two choice would be Carnival.

1209
01:28:01,482 --> 01:28:07,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like the cardigans, they're cool, and I like that cover of it in Guitar Freak Smith Mix, so Carnival is my number two choice.

1210
01:28:07,765 --> 01:28:10,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Small hands smell like cabbage.

1211
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:11,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you're going to correct my spelling?

1212
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:12,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do.

1213
01:28:13,868 --> 01:28:14,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one?

1214
01:28:14,468 --> 01:28:14,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Here?

1215
01:28:16,469 --> 01:28:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Bradley's going to correct my spelling.

1216
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:23,332
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get Loki's number one choice for best Guitar Freak Strum Mania song.

1217
01:28:23,533 --> 01:28:24,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is easy.

1218
01:28:24,993 --> 01:28:26,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be Fireball.

1219
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:27,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireball.

1220
01:28:28,015 --> 01:28:28,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1221
01:28:28,415 --> 01:28:28,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1222
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:31,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireball.

1223
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:32,921
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good choice.

1224
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:35,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireball.

1225
01:28:35,903 --> 01:28:38,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Your number one choice, Bradley, for best Guitar Freaks drum media song.

1226
01:28:38,905 --> 01:28:39,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Giant Slug.

1227
01:28:39,826 --> 01:28:41,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Giant Slug, right on.

1228
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:52,915
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to MGL two weeks ago to go play that on 6th Mix, because it's not in 7th Mix on Guitar Freaks.

1229
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:54,817
[SPEAKER_15]: They removed it from the mix.

1230
01:28:55,857 --> 01:28:56,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Dope!

1231
01:28:56,818 --> 01:29:00,841
[SPEAKER_15]: And lots of the old songs they removed, because it was a cool time.

1232
01:29:02,318 --> 01:29:03,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and your number one choice, Dave?

1233
01:29:05,259 --> 01:29:10,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know, this one's kind of typical, but I said at least 100 seconds.

1234
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:11,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good song.

1235
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:17,001
[SPEAKER_04]: The long version kicks so much more ass, but it's not, like, on the Drum Mania or Guitar Freaks.

1236
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:17,761
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad.

1237
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:18,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Bummer.

1238
01:29:19,602 --> 01:29:22,542
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one song, I can't believe none of you mentioned it, come on.

1239
01:29:22,902 --> 01:29:25,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the best song in Guitar Freaks, you know it.

1240
01:29:25,603 --> 01:29:26,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say Venus.

1241
01:29:26,663 --> 01:29:27,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say Venus.

1242
01:29:27,243 --> 01:29:27,923
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not Venus.

1243
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:29,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Haru Spring.

1244
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:31,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, with the Dancing Panda?

1245
01:29:35,054 --> 01:29:35,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire, Overbite

1246
01:29:57,469 --> 01:29:58,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this one guy.

1247
01:29:59,449 --> 01:30:00,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

1248
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:04,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Guy at Roseville Golf Lane, staff guy, who plays this... Oh, sorry if you're listening.

1249
01:30:04,931 --> 01:30:06,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

1250
01:30:06,911 --> 01:30:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Who plays this song three songs in a row.

1251
01:30:10,712 --> 01:30:11,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, he puts in money.

1252
01:30:12,072 --> 01:30:12,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire!

1253
01:30:13,873 --> 01:30:16,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget how the song goes, but anyway, I should remember it.

1254
01:30:16,493 --> 01:30:19,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, okay, let's mix it up a little with fire!

1255
01:30:19,554 --> 01:30:19,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like...

1256
01:30:20,274 --> 01:30:21,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to challenge myself a little.

1257
01:30:21,796 --> 01:30:22,557
[SPEAKER_04]: FIRE!

1258
01:30:23,277 --> 01:30:27,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that he's playing three different games since there's only the long version in, uh, seventh mix.

1259
01:30:28,483 --> 01:30:31,046
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this was in, uh, the fifth mix, Guitar Freaks, I think.

1260
01:30:31,266 --> 01:30:31,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

1261
01:30:31,786 --> 01:30:34,009
[SPEAKER_04]: But now he just plays it burn, I think.

1262
01:30:34,369 --> 01:30:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, FIRE!

1263
01:30:36,251 --> 01:30:37,052
[SPEAKER_13]: BURN!

1264
01:30:37,853 --> 01:30:38,454
[SPEAKER_05]: FIRE!

1265
01:30:40,678 --> 01:30:42,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the full list we have so far.

1266
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we get to do the elimination part.

1267
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:44,641
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be fun.

1268
01:30:45,222 --> 01:30:56,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Primal Soul, Liar Liar, Nami Norijana, Miss You, Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble, Carnival, Fireball, Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Haru Spring.

1269
01:30:56,871 --> 01:30:58,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Your elimination choice, Loki.

1270
01:30:59,022 --> 01:31:02,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Your choice to eliminate from this lovely list we have, Bradley.

1271
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:32,120
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be Miss You, because Right on Time is a lot better than that one.

1272
01:31:32,721 --> 01:31:33,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so hurt.

1273
01:31:34,002 --> 01:31:35,423
[SPEAKER_05]: But okay, that's the way it works.

1274
01:31:35,884 --> 01:31:36,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to like Right on Time.

1275
01:31:36,785 --> 01:31:37,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley's fired from the show by the way.

1276
01:31:37,966 --> 01:31:38,787
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

1277
01:31:38,807 --> 01:31:41,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, small e. No, never mind.

1278
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:49,839
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it was overplayed partially by me, partially by these rocker people at Gulfland, and Rob, and everyone else.

1279
01:31:50,771 --> 01:32:08,054
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know one song I left off my list and I'm really sad I had to leave this list actually I had two songs I had to leave off my list I'm Gonna Get You which I love, I love that song and Mr. Moon, I like that song I usually think of Keyboard Mania when I think of that song so I dumped it yes, you gotta pick one off Dave

1280
01:32:08,607 --> 01:32:10,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I can't pick my own off.

1281
01:32:11,589 --> 01:32:14,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I guess I'll take Primal Soul off.

1282
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:15,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Primal Soul.

1283
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:18,072
[SPEAKER_05]: You bastard.

1284
01:32:18,372 --> 01:32:19,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my turn.

1285
01:32:19,093 --> 01:32:23,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good song, but I thought it was the worst.

1286
01:32:23,215 --> 01:32:24,096
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hard.

1287
01:32:24,156 --> 01:32:25,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually like all of these.

1288
01:32:30,699 --> 01:32:35,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take off... Oh, this is really hard.

1289
01:32:35,382 --> 01:32:36,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually kind of like all these songs.

1290
01:32:36,863 --> 01:32:37,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1291
01:32:37,043 --> 01:32:37,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1292
01:32:38,997 --> 01:32:39,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Liar Liar.

1293
01:32:39,758 --> 01:32:40,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take off Liar Liar.

1294
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:41,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1295
01:32:41,841 --> 01:32:44,324
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... Oh, Liar Liar.

1296
01:32:45,546 --> 01:32:50,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I just... Yeah, Liar Liar is... Out of that list is my least favorite, but those were all good choices.

1297
01:32:51,473 --> 01:32:51,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1298
01:32:52,538 --> 01:32:55,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're going to post the full list into the chat room.

1299
01:32:56,180 --> 01:33:02,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to send me your votes over private message in the chat room from the list that we have.

1300
01:33:02,642 --> 01:33:04,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So send me your choice from this list.

1301
01:33:04,683 --> 01:33:06,484
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't vote for anything not on this list.

1302
01:33:06,524 --> 01:33:07,204
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way it works.

1303
01:33:07,324 --> 01:33:15,767
[SPEAKER_05]: From this list of the eight songs we have, Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble, Carnival, Fireball, Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Haru Spring.

1304
01:33:15,807 --> 01:33:17,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Send me your vote for your favorite song.

1305
01:33:17,748 --> 01:33:20,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Song.

1306
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:20,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Private Message.

1307
01:33:20,931 --> 01:33:23,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to take a quick break while you send those over Private Message.

1308
01:33:23,873 --> 01:33:25,474
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only going to have about three minutes.

1309
01:33:25,514 --> 01:33:28,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to play a quick song from the Dance Mania series.

1310
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:30,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all the time you get.

1311
01:33:31,098 --> 01:33:34,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's play from the Dance Mania series.

1312
01:33:36,743 --> 01:33:39,184
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to do... No, that's Trans Party.

1313
01:33:39,945 --> 01:33:41,326
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not Dance Mania.

1314
01:33:41,346 --> 01:33:44,789
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do... I don't know.

1315
01:33:44,829 --> 01:33:45,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking.

1316
01:33:45,289 --> 01:33:45,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do...

1317
01:33:48,328 --> 01:33:49,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do Tears in May.

1318
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:52,150
[SPEAKER_05]: You get three minutes while we listen to Missing Heart.

1319
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:54,251
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the people that did Moonlight Shadow, by the way.

1320
01:33:54,591 --> 01:33:55,672
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Tears in May.

1321
01:33:55,692 --> 01:33:59,093
[SPEAKER_05]: You got three minutes to vote in the chat room over a private message.

1322
01:33:59,974 --> 01:34:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: The list, listless, here on Orange Laundry.

1323
01:34:34,087 --> 01:34:36,023
Thank you for watching!

1324
01:35:17,809 --> 01:35:20,668
[SPEAKER_13]: and when the moon is shined with clouds

1325
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:10,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1326
01:36:37,009 --> 01:36:38,733
And wash my love away

1327
01:37:15,905 --> 01:37:19,708
[SPEAKER_05]: One more song for you while we tabulate the scores real fast for our listless segment.

1328
01:37:20,348 --> 01:37:24,932
Five, two, three, two, one.

1329
01:37:24,952 --> 01:37:27,173
Five, two, three, two, one.

1330
01:37:51,353 --> 01:37:52,616
Thanks for watching!

1331
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:42,976
[SPEAKER_13]: With the ping pong ball

1332
01:38:55,450 --> 01:39:06,898
[SPEAKER_05]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we have tabulated the votes for our listless segment with the best guitar freak slash drum mania song ever.

1333
01:39:07,398 --> 01:39:08,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very close.

1334
01:39:08,519 --> 01:39:09,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Very scientific process.

1335
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:11,521
[SPEAKER_05]: You have some very, very close voting there.

1336
01:39:11,641 --> 01:39:16,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we kind of did... Oh, I need to go quickly.

1337
01:39:16,405 --> 01:39:17,846
[SPEAKER_04]: We did Rock Paper Scissors.

1338
01:39:18,246 --> 01:39:18,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so...

1339
01:39:20,171 --> 01:39:28,854
[SPEAKER_05]: The winner, no, third place winner, the third place best Guitar Freaks Drum Mania song ever is Fireball.

1340
01:39:29,934 --> 01:39:34,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1341
01:39:34,516 --> 01:39:36,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireball is the third place winner.

1342
01:39:36,897 --> 01:39:45,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Second place, which would be the first place loser, second place Guitar Freaks song, Drum Mania, Haru Spring.

1343
01:39:46,175 --> 01:39:47,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to beat this fanfare thing to the ground.

1344
01:39:47,897 --> 01:39:51,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's twice in like one minute.

1345
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:52,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, anyway.

1346
01:40:05,126 --> 01:40:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Least 100 seconds is the winner of bestest ever Guitar Freaks Drum Mania song.

1347
01:40:13,388 --> 01:40:13,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

1348
01:40:13,928 --> 01:40:16,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that to Bradley's controller.

1349
01:40:16,709 --> 01:40:17,249
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll beat you up.

1350
01:40:17,969 --> 01:40:19,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd be more worried about the microphone.

1351
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:20,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.

1352
01:40:24,171 --> 01:40:24,831
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?

1353
01:40:24,851 --> 01:40:26,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're doing the webcam.

1354
01:40:26,212 --> 01:40:27,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the webcam.

1355
01:40:28,486 --> 01:40:36,813
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to look at the webcam, the super secret location is only available in our chatroom at Channel Pound Orange Lounge on any other side IRC server.

1356
01:40:37,313 --> 01:40:40,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Same server that hosts a lot of the Big Bomani chatrooms.

1357
01:40:41,096 --> 01:40:41,417
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1358
01:40:42,432 --> 01:40:43,332
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do we want to talk about?

1359
01:40:43,352 --> 01:40:44,733
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got 20 minutes left on the show.

1360
01:40:45,253 --> 01:40:48,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's not here to vent about anything this week because she's out of town.

1361
01:40:48,775 --> 01:40:56,118
[SPEAKER_05]: She's at Step Squad convention or some kind of meeting for her team there, which includes some out of town folks that she's interviewing.

1362
01:40:56,518 --> 01:40:58,379
[SPEAKER_15]: I can do a preemptive fuck you over the week.

1363
01:40:58,579 --> 01:40:59,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, go for it.

1364
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:01,580
[SPEAKER_15]: You downloaded the music.

1365
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:02,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I haven't unpacked it though yet.

1366
01:41:03,441 --> 01:41:05,702
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to wait for me to do that before you can go.

1367
01:41:06,142 --> 01:41:07,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that and we'll do it.

1368
01:41:07,382 --> 01:41:09,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1369
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:10,904
[SPEAKER_05]: You got anything you want to talk about, Matt?

1370
01:41:11,758 --> 01:41:14,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, what are you doing, Dave?

1371
01:41:14,541 --> 01:41:16,622
[SPEAKER_13]: One second.

1372
01:41:16,662 --> 01:41:16,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Webcam.

1373
01:41:17,523 --> 01:41:18,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1374
01:41:18,424 --> 01:41:20,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn off your webcams.

1375
01:41:21,126 --> 01:41:23,769
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a brain, you'll turn off the webcam for about a minute.

1376
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:27,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but see, now everyone will turn it on.

1377
01:41:28,353 --> 01:41:31,135
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a request for you to do the Black Mage, whatever that means.

1378
01:41:33,137 --> 01:41:33,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave.

1379
01:41:33,598 --> 01:41:34,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's the Black Mage?

1380
01:41:34,879 --> 01:41:35,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I really have no idea.

1381
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell Dave to do the Black Mage.

1382
01:41:37,481 --> 01:41:38,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a request.

1383
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:45,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Maid, what am I doing?

1384
01:41:46,584 --> 01:41:47,964
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what they saw, by the way, huh?

1385
01:41:48,265 --> 01:41:49,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's too blurry!

1386
01:41:49,846 --> 01:41:51,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a crotch shot!

1387
01:41:51,126 --> 01:41:55,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a gynecology appointment!

1388
01:41:59,731 --> 01:42:03,594
[SPEAKER_02]: What you just saw there was the official background for DDR God Mix.

1389
01:42:05,395 --> 01:42:07,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't inflate your ego anymore.

1390
01:42:08,036 --> 01:42:08,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I am God.

1391
01:42:08,417 --> 01:42:09,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I am more than it needs to be.

1392
01:42:09,697 --> 01:42:10,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, what's up?

1393
01:42:13,928 --> 01:42:14,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, yes.

1394
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:16,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Glenn is clarifying.

1395
01:42:16,192 --> 01:42:18,116
[SPEAKER_05]: The Black Mage is this.

1396
01:42:19,259 --> 01:42:23,788
[SPEAKER_05]: If you ever read... Do you want to tell us about the story behind the Black Mage, Glenn, who's just joined us in the room?

1397
01:42:24,995 --> 01:42:34,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Mage is the most popular character on 8-bit theater, which is a Final Fantasy 1 sprite comic that's insanely, insanely funny.

1398
01:42:36,422 --> 01:42:38,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And Black Mage is the shit, basically.

1399
01:42:39,264 --> 01:42:42,666
[SPEAKER_15]: You gotta hold it for 12 seconds.

1400
01:42:42,786 --> 01:42:44,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so... No.

1401
01:42:44,727 --> 01:42:44,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Go.

1402
01:42:45,227 --> 01:42:45,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold it.

1403
01:42:45,508 --> 01:42:45,487
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

1404
01:42:53,896 --> 01:42:54,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Black Mage.

1405
01:43:00,199 --> 01:43:01,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we do it correctly?

1406
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,180
[SPEAKER_04]: 23rd Megas?

1407
01:43:03,121 --> 01:43:03,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1408
01:43:04,141 --> 01:43:05,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddy Jesus, it's Buddy Christ.

1409
01:43:08,444 --> 01:43:09,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Dogma reference.

1410
01:43:10,925 --> 01:43:11,786
[SPEAKER_05]: and Wee!

1411
01:43:11,986 --> 01:43:12,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1412
01:43:12,707 --> 01:43:14,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Since Jamie's not here, I have to give a big Wee!

1413
01:43:15,209 --> 01:43:15,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's not here.

1414
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:17,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did she... There is a Wee.

1415
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:18,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Jamie Wee file, actually.

1416
01:43:18,972 --> 01:43:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in one of the other promos.

1417
01:43:20,193 --> 01:43:22,195
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh... Hold on, let me get Jamie's Wee.

1418
01:43:23,396 --> 01:43:23,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

1419
01:43:24,197 --> 01:43:24,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

1420
01:43:25,218 --> 01:43:25,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Dammit.

1421
01:43:26,599 --> 01:43:26,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Dammit!

1422
01:43:30,142 --> 01:43:30,482
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

1423
01:43:30,882 --> 01:43:31,963
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Jamie doing Wee.

1424
01:43:32,043 --> 01:43:33,024
[SPEAKER_05]: That's in one of the other promos.

1425
01:43:35,662 --> 01:43:48,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt has attached the cam to his head, but since it only takes a picture like every 20 seconds, it doesn't really work like one of those extreme sport people, you know, where you see it from their point of view.

1426
01:43:48,488 --> 01:43:53,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of like random clip of what Matt might see if you were standing on top of his head.

1427
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:57,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Extreme sports, falling off the cliff, you see him falling off the cliff, then you see him dead on the ground.

1428
01:43:57,872 --> 01:43:59,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like you can see him clip...

1429
01:44:00,043 --> 01:44:05,065
[SPEAKER_04]: preparing to pull the cord, and then you just kind of see the cam scattered on the ground.

1430
01:44:05,446 --> 01:44:07,226
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what happened in those 20 seconds?

1431
01:44:07,907 --> 01:44:12,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I guess the cord kind of failed, and then the second... What the hell am I talking about?

1432
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:19,332
[SPEAKER_05]: The show has just gotten so much... I know, the show has gotten so stupid, but people are still listening, go figure.

1433
01:44:19,472 --> 01:44:19,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1434
01:44:20,913 --> 01:44:21,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1435
01:44:21,533 --> 01:44:22,934
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the terrible heat.

1436
01:44:23,114 --> 01:44:25,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the California heat, we blame it on that.

1437
01:44:25,255 --> 01:44:27,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, it got up to like 80 today.

1438
01:44:28,077 --> 01:44:28,657
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong?

1439
01:44:31,595 --> 01:44:35,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, people just look at us like... I have a Bomani-related topic we could discuss.

1440
01:44:36,166 --> 01:44:36,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, how about this?

1441
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:38,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Internet rankings.

1442
01:44:40,047 --> 01:44:45,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any way that you think internet ranking for the various games out there could be improved?

1443
01:44:45,528 --> 01:44:49,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides having more than just a crappy USA internet ranking competition in the US.

1444
01:44:49,649 --> 01:44:53,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know how they have the Max 2 internet ranking for various songs you could do?

1445
01:44:53,910 --> 01:45:01,532
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the 2DX internet ranking, which is really popular right now for Sixth Style at Home, which Dave is giving the thumbs down to because he can't rank on it.

1446
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:12,741
[SPEAKER_04]: The stick style thing is cool because it's at home, and so you're already at home and stuff, but the Max 2 one, first of all, you have to write down, I think it's 16 digits or numbers or letters or combine something.

1447
01:45:12,901 --> 01:45:13,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Numbers!

1448
01:45:14,703 --> 01:45:21,129
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not the fact that you have to have a pen and paper ready to be able to record it.

1449
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:24,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hello, if you're playing internet ranking, would you think, gee, uh...

1450
01:45:25,734 --> 01:45:34,118
[SPEAKER_05]: All you gotta do, on the PlayStation version, you go into Records, and then you hit, I believe, the Select key when it shows your scores, and it'll show you the internet ranking password.

1451
01:45:35,379 --> 01:45:38,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, you're talking about on Home version.

1452
01:45:38,601 --> 01:45:39,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1453
01:45:39,381 --> 01:45:40,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You were talking about the arcades.

1454
01:45:40,242 --> 01:45:40,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1455
01:45:40,662 --> 01:45:41,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Dave.

1456
01:45:41,743 --> 01:45:43,483
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you use a memory card, it'll save it.

1457
01:45:43,884 --> 01:45:44,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.

1458
01:45:45,064 --> 01:45:46,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what's awesome?

1459
01:45:46,905 --> 01:45:49,046
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it playing Versus, it crashes the machine.

1460
01:45:49,867 --> 01:45:50,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, that is pretty cool.

1461
01:45:51,067 --> 01:45:51,928
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but first of all...

1462
01:45:52,521 --> 01:45:56,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes three great fields of unlaziness to do this.

1463
01:45:57,065 --> 01:46:01,649
[SPEAKER_04]: First, you have to have a pen and piece of paper and a pen or pencil ready.

1464
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:04,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have to waste three songs.

1465
01:46:04,972 --> 01:46:11,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not necessarily waste, but play three songs that you wouldn't normally play just so you can get the internet ranking.

1466
01:46:11,757 --> 01:46:15,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Play them on probably a difficulty that you wouldn't want to or, you know, whatever.

1467
01:46:15,521 --> 01:46:15,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1468
01:46:16,941 --> 01:46:19,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't play internet ranking, shit.

1469
01:46:19,441 --> 01:46:22,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to write them down quickly, and then go home.

1470
01:46:23,402 --> 01:46:25,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, stop grabbing the mic.

1471
01:46:25,282 --> 01:46:26,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1472
01:46:26,983 --> 01:46:27,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't talk.

1473
01:46:28,903 --> 01:46:30,983
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it, I'm one of the co-hosts of the show.

1474
01:46:31,323 --> 01:46:32,284
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the co-host.

1475
01:46:32,384 --> 01:46:33,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the new host.

1476
01:46:34,204 --> 01:46:39,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to go home and actually go on the computer, which I really do not like using computers.

1477
01:46:41,365 --> 01:46:43,686
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, we're on internet radio right now.

1478
01:46:43,726 --> 01:46:46,066
[SPEAKER_05]: You might want to keep the computer bashing a little light.

1479
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have for days.

1480
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:51,861
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just saying, like, I cannot use computers.

1481
01:46:52,301 --> 01:46:53,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to go on the internet.

1482
01:46:54,002 --> 01:46:56,903
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you have lost all the memory on your computer.

1483
01:46:57,043 --> 01:46:58,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Your computer is now shutting down.

1484
01:46:59,403 --> 01:47:00,984
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not our fault.

1485
01:47:01,004 --> 01:47:05,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a special email has been sent to a little midget who will come and kill you now.

1486
01:47:05,465 --> 01:47:06,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1487
01:47:07,105 --> 01:47:08,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've gotten those messages before.

1488
01:47:08,966 --> 01:47:09,786
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not true, are they?

1489
01:47:11,114 --> 01:47:11,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1490
01:47:12,115 --> 01:47:12,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Have the midgets come yet?

1491
01:47:14,456 --> 01:47:14,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1492
01:47:14,876 --> 01:47:16,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little kids have been threatening me.

1493
01:47:16,337 --> 01:47:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have been midgets.

1494
01:47:17,717 --> 01:47:18,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know this.

1495
01:47:19,258 --> 01:47:23,940
[SPEAKER_04]: No, midgets you can... Sorry, if there's any midgets out there, midgets are awesome.

1496
01:47:24,241 --> 01:47:25,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And they really are.

1497
01:47:25,521 --> 01:47:26,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Itty bitty gang bang.

1498
01:47:27,362 --> 01:47:28,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nasty.

1499
01:47:28,723 --> 01:47:32,265
[SPEAKER_02]: A special F you for all those Greek midgets out there.

1500
01:47:32,865 --> 01:47:33,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1501
01:47:34,088 --> 01:47:35,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what was that all about?

1502
01:47:35,129 --> 01:47:36,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Greek midgets are awesome.

1503
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:37,651
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so last hour.

1504
01:47:37,711 --> 01:47:41,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, what do you suggest they do then, Dave?

1505
01:47:41,394 --> 01:47:43,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have an internet ranking on your honor?

1506
01:47:43,596 --> 01:47:46,499
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, oh yeah, Eiffel comboed Max Unlimited.

1507
01:47:46,699 --> 01:47:47,580
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not that.

1508
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:49,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm number one in the world.

1509
01:47:49,621 --> 01:47:50,282
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crap.

1510
01:47:50,662 --> 01:47:59,050
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that they should hook all the Max 2 arcade machines up to the internet so it kind of like tells you your ranking as you put it in.

1511
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:01,251
[SPEAKER_04]: That and have a webcam that records your...

1512
01:48:02,032 --> 01:48:07,316
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it's like, I say I full perfect max unlimited three times and somehow get to see it.

1513
01:48:07,577 --> 01:48:08,417
[SPEAKER_05]: No, stop grabbing the mic.

1514
01:48:08,718 --> 01:48:27,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're suggesting that Roosevelt Golf Land spend, or any golf land, or any arcade with a max two machine, which is just about everywhere these days, spend thousands of dollars to get a DSL brought in next to the machine, and just so you can have internet rankings, so you can make a pathetic attempt at being the best DDR player in the nation.

1515
01:48:28,948 --> 01:48:29,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know I'm not the best.

1516
01:48:30,229 --> 01:48:31,571
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, not any arcade.

1517
01:48:31,731 --> 01:48:33,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Every arcade needs to do this.

1518
01:48:33,693 --> 01:48:35,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be like a specialty.

1519
01:48:35,234 --> 01:48:37,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be part of the machine.

1520
01:48:38,057 --> 01:48:41,320
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it should have like a... You're forgetting they're all illegal anyway.

1521
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,180
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all bootlegs.

1522
01:48:43,241 --> 01:48:45,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So get the illegal bootleg DSL whatever.

1523
01:48:46,364 --> 01:48:46,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um...

1524
01:48:47,997 --> 01:48:49,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1525
01:48:49,759 --> 01:49:02,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's say, you know, I full perfect everything, and it says, yay, you are number one, congratulations, and then, you know, you see, it's kind of like the Soul Calibur 2 thing, you know, with your armies fighting against each other.

1526
01:49:03,213 --> 01:49:05,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Your DDR armies fighting against each other.

1527
01:49:06,297 --> 01:49:08,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I full perfect something, and it's like...

1528
01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:12,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Corey already did this, you are poser, or something like that.

1529
01:49:12,541 --> 01:49:19,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Conquest mode in DDR would be stupid because everybody would pick on MGL, and you know it.

1530
01:49:19,524 --> 01:49:21,725
[SPEAKER_05]: MGL would be gone in five seconds.

1531
01:49:22,706 --> 01:49:34,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how long we'd last though, because we've got a constant stream of people playing, but most of the people, sorry if you're listening, I do this a lot, are pretty bad, except for like us.

1532
01:49:36,048 --> 01:49:39,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Us being sacramentals who know each other.

1533
01:49:41,251 --> 01:49:41,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1534
01:49:41,931 --> 01:49:44,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Because lots of these new sacramentals don't know them.

1535
01:49:44,793 --> 01:49:47,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, let's get off this rant because it's kind of boring.

1536
01:49:48,535 --> 01:49:49,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Give the mic back, Dave.

1537
01:49:51,197 --> 01:49:51,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave's pouting.

1538
01:49:52,509 --> 01:49:55,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, other things coming up we should talk about.

1539
01:49:56,411 --> 01:49:58,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can give a little plug for me.

1540
01:49:58,291 --> 01:49:59,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my birthday on Wednesday!

1541
01:49:59,912 --> 01:50:00,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1542
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:04,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday, there was something about Wednesday that was important.

1543
01:50:06,295 --> 01:50:07,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I was supposed to remember.

1544
01:50:08,416 --> 01:50:10,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other kind of anniversary, I forget.

1545
01:50:11,277 --> 01:50:12,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1546
01:50:13,178 --> 01:50:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: How could I forget?

1547
01:50:13,938 --> 01:50:15,759
[SPEAKER_05]: If I turn on the TV, they keep reminding me.

1548
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:17,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Your birthday happens to be on September 11th, huh?

1549
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:22,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Another important data is that supposedly my cable is supposed to be installed.

1550
01:50:22,837 --> 01:50:24,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably AT&T is going to fuck it up.

1551
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:34,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and also, if you calculate the hours correctly, that's the time that I will be finished downloading the porn that I am starting to download now.

1552
01:50:34,737 --> 01:50:36,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be finished by September.

1553
01:50:36,818 --> 01:50:37,539
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I swear.

1554
01:50:37,999 --> 01:50:40,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It will take like 100, like 400 hours or something.

1555
01:50:40,862 --> 01:50:43,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares about the porn, Dave?

1556
01:50:43,824 --> 01:50:45,565
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you planning to do to celebrate your birthday?

1557
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:47,527
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you planning to do to celebrate your birthday?

1558
01:50:47,587 --> 01:50:49,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm throwing a Bomani party.

1559
01:50:50,349 --> 01:50:52,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you're throwing the Big Bomani Party next weekend.

1560
01:50:52,471 --> 01:50:52,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1561
01:50:53,011 --> 01:50:57,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll do something, we'll have to tape something for Orange Lounge there, I don't know what, but we'll do something.

1562
01:50:57,093 --> 01:51:04,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun, I'll have my sim set up with the metal pads and all that fun stuff, and I'll be making burgers.

1563
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:05,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it next weekend or Wednesday?

1564
01:51:05,759 --> 01:51:06,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Saturday.

1565
01:51:06,799 --> 01:51:07,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

1566
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:11,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, if it was the weekend, then I wouldn't, or the weekday, because I wouldn't be able to.

1567
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:13,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Wednesday, I don't know.

1568
01:51:13,424 --> 01:51:16,285
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents are cool in case they're listening, but they're not.

1569
01:51:17,006 --> 01:51:17,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1570
01:51:18,067 --> 01:51:22,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but see, I can't go on weekdays because I'm trapped in my house.

1571
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:23,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1572
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:30,374
[SPEAKER_02]: See, on Friday we're going down to the Winchester Mystery House to do a midnight tour.

1573
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:31,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds fun.

1574
01:51:31,075 --> 01:51:32,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday the 13th.

1575
01:51:32,395 --> 01:51:34,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do that because that'll be fun.

1576
01:51:34,557 --> 01:51:36,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Saturday at my party and stuff.

1577
01:51:37,198 --> 01:51:40,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone's invited, so come crash the party if you want.

1578
01:51:41,036 --> 01:51:44,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being reminded of something in the chat room that's going on right now as we speak.

1579
01:52:04,443 --> 01:52:04,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Dansu?

1580
01:52:04,663 --> 01:52:04,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Dansu?

1581
01:52:04,883 --> 01:52:04,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Dansu?

1582
01:52:05,004 --> 01:52:05,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Dansu?

1583
01:52:28,593 --> 01:52:29,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to explain this to me.

1584
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:38,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the plot was they go to Japan to find Hank's, the main character's, half-brother or something, because there was some love grandfather thing.

1585
01:52:38,863 --> 01:52:48,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyway, they see DDR on this giant screen, you know, it's on one of the mega screens, broadcasting in basically a Times Square type of place.

1586
01:52:49,313 --> 01:52:51,215
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, the...

1587
01:52:51,949 --> 01:52:59,234
[SPEAKER_04]: The main character's son goes up there and starts playing and busts out to, I think it was, was it Kung Fu Fighting?

1588
01:52:59,254 --> 01:52:59,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Shake Your Booty.

1589
01:53:00,275 --> 01:53:03,357
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't Shake... That's the way I like it.

1590
01:53:03,417 --> 01:53:04,218
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I like it.

1591
01:53:04,258 --> 01:53:04,898
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was later.

1592
01:53:04,918 --> 01:53:06,039
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the ceramic slot.

1593
01:53:06,099 --> 01:53:06,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Baby got back.

1594
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:14,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what happened was this girl comes up and it's kind of like funny romance off of DDR.

1595
01:53:15,305 --> 01:53:18,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got the, I forget, the robot characters.

1596
01:53:18,187 --> 01:53:18,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget their names.

1597
01:53:20,492 --> 01:53:22,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Casento, or whatever that is.

1598
01:53:22,794 --> 01:53:24,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just put Rob to sleep.

1599
01:53:25,595 --> 01:53:27,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, King of the Hill usually puts me to sleep.

1600
01:53:27,757 --> 01:53:28,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't find the show funny at all.

1601
01:53:29,078 --> 01:53:30,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you don't like propane?

1602
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:33,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to talk about this new... Yes, Matt?

1603
01:53:37,429 --> 01:53:38,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you finished?

1604
01:53:38,230 --> 01:53:38,950
[SPEAKER_02]: May I finish?

1605
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:39,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I finish?

1606
01:53:39,711 --> 01:53:40,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I finish?

1607
01:53:40,351 --> 01:53:40,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I finish?

1608
01:53:41,132 --> 01:53:47,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I'd like to talk about this new TV show that's actually on Comedy Central that's an old British show called Trigger Happy TV.

1609
01:53:48,337 --> 01:53:49,237
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is damn funny.

1610
01:53:49,658 --> 01:53:51,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, British... Is it related to Vimani?

1611
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:53,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be.

1612
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:54,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't watched the whole thing.

1613
01:53:54,701 --> 01:53:56,843
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got music in it.

1614
01:53:59,022 --> 01:54:00,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, just like DDR, they both have music.

1615
01:54:01,103 --> 01:54:01,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well done.

1616
01:54:01,764 --> 01:54:02,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, shit.

1617
01:54:02,564 --> 01:54:04,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, tell us more about this show.

1618
01:54:04,806 --> 01:54:05,687
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.

1619
01:54:05,807 --> 01:54:06,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1620
01:54:07,288 --> 01:54:08,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Betsy, you've worn it out of me.

1621
01:54:09,069 --> 01:54:10,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like talking about it anymore.

1622
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:12,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I wear you out, Matt?

1623
01:54:12,671 --> 01:54:13,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1624
01:54:13,192 --> 01:54:13,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.

1625
01:54:14,813 --> 01:54:15,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1626
01:54:16,154 --> 01:54:20,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, yeah, so they have it on there, and it's cool, and yeah.

1627
01:54:21,657 --> 01:54:22,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

1628
01:54:24,045 --> 01:54:28,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the chat room, 23rd Magus says he's going to come to your Be-Money party.

1629
01:54:29,207 --> 01:54:29,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

1630
01:54:29,667 --> 01:54:32,628
[SPEAKER_05]: To celebrate Konami's famous Be-Money series.

1631
01:54:33,328 --> 01:54:34,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'll actually get to meet him.

1632
01:54:34,469 --> 01:54:38,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've tried to meet him numerous times and it never worked.

1633
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:40,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was in the same arcade once and I never saw him again.

1634
01:54:41,181 --> 01:54:42,442
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a Kodak moment, I'm sure.

1635
01:54:42,462 --> 01:54:42,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised.

1636
01:54:43,002 --> 01:54:44,483
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was funny.

1637
01:54:44,503 --> 01:54:48,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought people would come to my QZAR trip since it was just me and that guy.

1638
01:54:48,525 --> 01:54:49,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I was broke.

1639
01:54:49,445 --> 01:54:51,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wanted to go, but I'm so broke.

1640
01:54:51,767 --> 01:54:52,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1641
01:54:52,507 --> 01:54:53,407
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it next time.

1642
01:54:53,488 --> 01:54:58,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Bomani party, it sounds like there's going to be tons of people there, and I was expecting there to be like five people.

1643
01:54:58,410 --> 01:54:58,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hey.

1644
01:55:00,649 --> 01:55:02,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the more the merrier.

1645
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:06,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have an empty house that night, so hopefully we won't be waking anyone up.

1646
01:55:07,011 --> 01:55:08,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And my neighbors suck.

1647
01:55:08,091 --> 01:55:08,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate my neighbors.

1648
01:55:09,092 --> 01:55:10,972
[SPEAKER_02]: A special F you to my freaking neighbors.

1649
01:55:12,092 --> 01:55:18,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this dumbass, I guess her boyfriend moved in next door, and he parks his truck.

1650
01:55:19,094 --> 01:55:24,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're in a court, and instead of parking along the curb, he actually parks perpendicular to the curb.

1651
01:55:24,236 --> 01:55:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So his truck is taking up half of our driveway.

1652
01:55:29,073 --> 01:55:29,654
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a bastard.

1653
01:55:29,894 --> 01:55:51,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think Bomani parties, getting together and playing, to make this more of a topic everybody can relate to than just people who are within driving distance of Loki's house, do you think Bomani parties are a cool thing to do once in a while, get together and just play all the home versions, or do you think maybe we ought to go to the arcade to play these things, or is it more fun because at home you can drink and play DDR?

1654
01:55:51,332 --> 01:55:55,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Although if you go to Dave & Buster's at home you can drink and play DDR too, but just hypothetically.

1655
01:55:56,056 --> 01:55:56,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fun.

1656
01:55:57,361 --> 01:55:59,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, does anyone else have Vimani parties?

1657
01:56:01,043 --> 01:56:01,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

1658
01:56:02,063 --> 01:56:02,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

1659
01:56:02,564 --> 01:56:03,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Friends get together, play Vimani.

1660
01:56:04,485 --> 01:56:06,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, man, people have LAN parties.

1661
01:56:06,485 --> 01:56:07,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

1662
01:56:07,926 --> 01:56:08,446
[SPEAKER_02]: They have what?

1663
01:56:08,967 --> 01:56:09,547
[SPEAKER_02]: LAN parties.

1664
01:56:09,627 --> 01:56:14,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Local Area Networks, where you play network games like Quake 3 and that kind of crap, and you hook computers up.

1665
01:56:14,569 --> 01:56:16,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, Quake 3.

1666
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:17,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Look out.

1667
01:56:17,951 --> 01:56:19,812
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to... I don't know what the game's about.

1668
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:27,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter, there's parties for everything It's point and shoot, that's all it is People get together to watch like, you know, I Love Lucy shows and that kind of shit

1669
01:56:29,497 --> 01:56:30,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave with the stupid webcam.

1670
01:56:30,958 --> 01:56:34,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so, yeah, I think it's a good idea that people get together.

1671
01:56:34,661 --> 01:56:38,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that will bring people together to actually be able to enjoy something will be great.

1672
01:56:38,584 --> 01:56:40,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whether it be an arcade or whatnot.

1673
01:56:41,205 --> 01:56:43,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's about time to close the show, but a closing thought.

1674
01:56:44,168 --> 01:56:47,590
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be the absolute worst thing that you could do at a Bomani party?

1675
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:50,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Say you're going to a Bomani party for the first time as a newbie.

1676
01:56:50,552 --> 01:56:51,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute worst thing you could do?

1677
01:56:52,233 --> 01:56:52,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Show up on the wrong day.

1678
01:56:55,543 --> 01:57:01,545
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, absolute worst thing you could do at a Bomani party your first time?

1679
01:57:01,585 --> 01:57:02,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, you have any ideas?

1680
01:57:03,205 --> 01:57:05,006
[SPEAKER_04]: The absolute worst thing?

1681
01:57:05,406 --> 01:57:11,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first I could think about getting really drunk and playing naked, but I'm guessing that you could do worse stuff than that.

1682
01:57:11,968 --> 01:57:20,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know, because I mean, that party that you had a while back, it wasn't really a Bomani party, but all these people that played Bomani showed up, and so it kind of turned into one.

1683
01:57:20,695 --> 01:57:31,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, where, uh, I think, Ryan Samumangus, or Magus, or whatever, um, he put on his girlfriend's clothes and started parrying.

1684
01:57:32,763 --> 01:57:34,084
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really bad.

1685
01:57:34,104 --> 01:57:41,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it looked like a tutu slash, like, he looked very, very fruity.

1686
01:57:41,588 --> 01:57:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Rob.

1687
01:57:42,549 --> 01:57:43,269
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it's okay.

1688
01:57:43,289 --> 01:57:43,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1689
01:57:43,670 --> 01:57:43,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1690
01:57:48,123 --> 01:57:49,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Any ideas from Bradley?

1691
01:57:51,484 --> 01:57:52,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, whoops, my bad.

1692
01:57:52,845 --> 01:57:53,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, yes.

1693
01:57:53,946 --> 01:57:55,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further ideas, Bradley?

1694
01:57:55,306 --> 01:58:01,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Like breaking people's machines or playing Let Them Move for the first time.

1695
01:58:01,509 --> 01:58:02,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow!

1696
01:58:02,929 --> 01:58:03,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Let Them Move!

1697
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

1698
01:58:04,910 --> 01:58:08,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, now that I flashback to my first Bimani party, what was it?

1699
01:58:08,352 --> 01:58:10,433
[SPEAKER_02]: My modded pad got broken.

1700
01:58:11,733 --> 01:58:12,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

1701
01:58:12,634 --> 01:58:14,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember my first Bimani party.

1702
01:58:14,895 --> 01:58:15,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It was...

1703
01:58:16,508 --> 01:58:17,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, no, I don't.

1704
01:58:17,229 --> 01:58:18,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember one Bomani party.

1705
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:24,636
[SPEAKER_04]: It involved people getting drunk and, you know, dressing up in their girlfriend's clothes and playing para.

1706
01:58:25,697 --> 01:58:26,918
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny because it wasn't me.

1707
01:58:27,379 --> 01:58:32,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to agree with the chat room that the absolute worst thing you could do at your first Bomani party is para naked.

1708
01:58:33,585 --> 01:58:34,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Para naked.

1709
01:58:34,626 --> 01:58:37,249
[SPEAKER_04]: You could, like, dick whip across the thing.

1710
01:58:37,349 --> 01:58:37,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, um...

1711
01:58:41,019 --> 01:58:43,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Another bad thing would be trying to play DDR in the pool.

1712
01:58:43,545 --> 01:58:44,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Would be another bad idea.

1713
01:58:45,429 --> 01:58:48,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't take your PS2 in the pool.

1714
01:58:48,997 --> 01:58:50,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play DDR on thin ice.

1715
01:58:51,998 --> 01:58:53,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to see that on a game show.

1716
01:58:53,559 --> 01:58:55,059
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR on Ice.

1717
01:58:55,219 --> 01:58:59,121
[SPEAKER_04]: You've referenced this before, but that game... Stomp, stomp.

1718
01:58:59,341 --> 01:59:00,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, I've got like 30 seconds.

1719
01:59:01,102 --> 01:59:06,744
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing where you get it wrong and the floor drops out from under you, what's that show called?

1720
01:59:06,764 --> 01:59:07,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Russian Roulette.

1721
01:59:07,404 --> 01:59:08,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Russian Roulette.

1722
01:59:08,244 --> 01:59:15,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Like DDR Russian, you hit a wrong note and the floor just drops out from under you, so you're like trying to step, and then the floor goes bye-bye.

1723
01:59:15,307 --> 01:59:16,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like So Goonies, okay?

1724
01:59:20,030 --> 01:59:37,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Baby Ruth And Rob came up with a good idea for a new show DDR on Ice With Ryan Boitano And John Tesh announcing Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp to my beat Stomp to my beat, stomp to my beat

1725
01:59:38,564 --> 01:59:39,565
[SPEAKER_14]: This player of DDR.

1726
01:59:39,905 --> 01:59:41,646
[SPEAKER_14]: He has such a terrible youth.

1727
01:59:42,146 --> 01:59:43,387
[SPEAKER_14]: He grew up in the slums.

1728
01:59:44,668 --> 01:59:47,410
[SPEAKER_14]: And now he plays DDR and he gets money that way.

1729
01:59:47,850 --> 01:59:48,911
[SPEAKER_14]: He's won tournaments.

1730
01:59:49,411 --> 01:59:51,192
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just breaks my heart.

1731
01:59:53,454 --> 01:59:56,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for those who don't know, this is the most Bradley's ever talked.

1732
01:59:57,496 --> 01:59:57,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

1733
01:59:58,057 --> 02:00:02,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, cumulative in this two hours, he's talked more than he's ever talked in his entire life.

1734
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:04,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard he here on Orange Lounge first.

1735
02:00:05,661 --> 02:00:05,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1736
02:00:06,986 --> 02:00:08,927
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of funny to know that I actually had a radio show one time.

1737
02:00:09,267 --> 02:00:09,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1738
02:00:10,287 --> 02:00:11,587
[SPEAKER_15]: I have tapes of it.

1739
02:00:11,767 --> 02:00:13,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I've got to hear this stuff.

1740
02:00:13,328 --> 02:00:14,308
[SPEAKER_15]: I got really crazy on it.

1741
02:00:14,468 --> 02:00:15,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have a college radio show, too.

1742
02:00:15,609 --> 02:00:17,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, we're past 9 o'clock.

1743
02:00:17,429 --> 02:00:18,149
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to end the show.

1744
02:00:18,749 --> 02:00:19,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Big thank you to everybody listening.

1745
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:23,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Big thanks to Loki, tonight's honorary co-host.

1746
02:00:23,751 --> 02:00:24,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Any final words, Loki?

1747
02:00:28,772 --> 02:00:29,072
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1748
02:00:29,673 --> 02:00:34,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Dave would stop playing at the webcam, but yeah.

1749
02:00:35,515 --> 02:00:36,336
