00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
It's a video tape! Put it in, put it in!

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Boring!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
This D.D.R. SUCKS!

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
D.D.R.S.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
The last Metroid is in captivity.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
The galaxy is at peace.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
One, warmer, he's good.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.840
Missed it by that much.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.600
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.480
How can you tell?

01:25.480 --> 01:26.840
I never forget a pussy.

01:27.480 --> 01:27.800
Cat.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.520
Thirty-seven.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.680
My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

01:30.680 --> 01:31.320
In a row?

01:31.320 --> 01:31.880
Shuh!

01:31.880 --> 01:33.720
And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.560
You are the weakest thing to bite.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.880
So you get nothing!

01:37.880 --> 01:38.600
You lose!

01:39.400 --> 01:40.600
Good day, sir!

01:40.600 --> 01:41.560
Dear diary,

01:42.280 --> 01:45.720
my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.600
I would like, if I may,

01:48.600 --> 01:54.280
to take you on a straight journey.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.280
Dark Sakura

01:55.280 --> 01:56.280
I hate nature!

01:56.280 --> 01:59.440
I just wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
Sky

02:00.440 --> 02:01.440
Do I look like the weather girl?

02:01.440 --> 02:02.440
Everything alright?

02:02.440 --> 02:04.120
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

02:04.120 --> 02:08.680
Orange Lounge Radio

02:08.680 --> 02:11.920
This is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 12.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.920
Unfortunately the original intro to this show was lost in an archiving failure, so we're

02:15.920 --> 02:19.680
We're going to simply kick off this rebroadcast of this episode by giving a big thanks to

02:19.680 --> 02:23.460
our special in-studio guests Mel B and Sharks Girl.

02:23.460 --> 02:30.460
We will now rejoin this encore presentation during the opening musical break.

02:53.460 --> 03:19.200
That last that ever she saw him Carried away by a moonlight shining, shining

03:19.200 --> 03:22.200
Dressed unwarried and mourning

03:22.200 --> 03:25.200
Carried away by a moonlight stretch

03:25.200 --> 03:29.200
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night

03:29.200 --> 03:32.200
Far away on the other side

03:32.200 --> 03:35.200
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight

03:35.200 --> 03:39.200
And she couldn't find how to push through

03:39.200 --> 03:42.200
The trees that whisper in the evening

03:42.200 --> 03:46.200
Carried away by a moonlight stretch

03:46.200 --> 03:49.600
Shown a song of sorrow and grieving

03:49.600 --> 03:53.300
Carried away by a moonlight, check, check

03:53.300 --> 03:56.700
All she saw was the feeling further gone

03:56.700 --> 03:59.700
Far away on the other side

03:59.700 --> 04:03.200
He was shot six times by a man on the run

04:03.200 --> 04:07.200
And she couldn't run, had to push through

04:07.200 --> 04:14.200
I stay, I pray to you in heaven far away

04:14.200 --> 04:24.200
I say, I pray to you in heaven, one day, 4 a.m. in the morning

04:24.200 --> 04:31.200
Carried away by a moonlight church, I watch the vision falling

04:31.200 --> 04:38.200
Carried away by a moonlight church, the sun goes slurring every night

04:38.200 --> 04:40.920
Far away on the other side

04:40.920 --> 04:44.520
Will you come to talk to me this night?

04:44.520 --> 04:48.520
But you couldn't find how to push through

04:48.520 --> 04:55.400
I stay, I praise you in heaven far away

04:55.400 --> 05:01.940
I say, I praise Thee, You in heaven one day

05:55.400 --> 06:08.400
Caught in the middle of a hundred fights The night was heavy and the air was the last

06:08.400 --> 06:19.400
But she couldn't find her first move Carried away by a moonlight charge

06:19.400 --> 06:26.400
Carry away, like a moonlight shadow

07:49.400 --> 08:09.380
Guns and drugs are the key.

08:10.100 --> 08:16.060
I've come to check on you

08:16.060 --> 08:18.540
and I'll be back here.

08:18.540 --> 08:25.540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.540
Orange Lounge Radio, we are live here.

08:32.540 --> 08:36.540
Oh, shut up, baby. The world's not that bad.

08:37.540 --> 08:39.540
How would you like it if I shoved you back in?

08:44.540 --> 08:46.540
So, hello to everybody. We've got a pretty full room here tonight.

08:46.540 --> 08:49.540
It's gonna get hot in here very fast. This is why we have the lights out.

08:49.540 --> 08:54.540
If you're viewing our webcam, which is at a top-secret location, which you can only get in our chat room,

08:54.540 --> 09:00.540
then it's gonna be very dark in here. All the images are dark because we don't want to start sweating in here.

09:00.540 --> 09:05.540
It's gonna turn into a sauna, and then we'll all have to take our clothes off, and that'll be the nudity.

09:05.540 --> 09:07.540
That'll be the nudity.

09:07.540 --> 09:10.540
Wah wah wah. Dork.

09:10.540 --> 09:16.720
I would like to apologize for anyone listening to this on the archives because I didn't start

09:16.720 --> 09:21.200
the archive recording until that break, so you missed the intro of the show, but all

09:21.200 --> 09:24.940
we were basically saying in the intro was that Mel B and Melody are here tonight, Sharks

09:54.940 --> 10:06.940
Last weekend I went to a gathering of a bunch of people, mostly a step squad, a few RTF.

10:06.940 --> 10:12.460
I'll talk about those, just a bunch of people, we went bowling.

10:12.460 --> 10:13.460
Bowling school.

10:13.460 --> 10:14.740
I sucked so bad.

10:14.740 --> 10:18.020
And then I got to see the crappiest machine in the universe.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.020
What's that?

10:19.020 --> 10:20.980
Stepping Sage.

10:20.980 --> 10:21.980
I've never heard of Stepping Sage.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.540
The most ghetto fabulous machine ever.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.780
I have never even heard of step aces.

10:25.780 --> 10:28.660
It ain't even ghetto fabulous, it's just ghetto.

10:28.660 --> 10:32.560
It's like ghetto ass.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.740
Okay.

10:33.740 --> 10:34.860
Imagine

10:34.860 --> 10:36.040
you have

10:36.040 --> 10:40.060
a machine consisting of one large monitor in the center and two smaller

10:40.060 --> 10:41.980
monitors on either side.

10:41.980 --> 10:42.960
You have

10:42.960 --> 10:45.960
a panel, like any normal dancing

10:45.960 --> 10:47.640
stage except you have

10:47.640 --> 10:48.940
two circles in the front,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.020
two on the side,

10:50.020 --> 10:53.540
and two in the back going making a sort of circle.

10:53.540 --> 10:57.500
And then you have two dots on the screen.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.460
And then whatever color goes up, you have to step on the corresponding color.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.820
You know, I think it's like red at the top, yellow in the middle,

11:02.820 --> 11:04.100
and blue in the back, or something like that.

11:04.100 --> 11:04.740
Weird, OK.

11:04.740 --> 11:08.900
And then you have the crappiest videos playing in the middle one.

11:08.900 --> 11:12.580
All it is is like, OK, you know at Great America, the karaoke,

11:12.580 --> 11:15.220
well, not the one that you actually sing with the make-your-own-video thing?

11:15.220 --> 11:16.020
Right, OK, yeah.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.900
Where you dance around in front of a blue screen or a green screen.

11:18.900 --> 11:21.900
with those like it's just really lame if I know what you're talking about, yep.

11:21.900 --> 11:25.860
Imagine this with like real people except the people think that they can dress

11:25.860 --> 11:26.820
cool and know how to dance.

11:26.820 --> 11:31.780
And they're the type of people who

11:31.780 --> 11:35.620
think that they're doing so well that you really don't have the heart to tell them that they suck.

11:35.620 --> 11:39.700
What kind of music is in this game? I never even played it.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.740
We have Saturday Night, we have The Hustle,

11:43.740 --> 11:47.560
we have Santa Maria, which I

11:47.560 --> 11:51.560
who nearly threw up. By Samantha Fox? Yes, but it's not Samantha Fox.

11:51.560 --> 11:55.560
Yeah, they have I should be so lucky by kind of the word.

11:55.560 --> 11:59.560
I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky. I know that one.

11:59.560 --> 12:03.560
That's awesome. And they had Macho Man.

12:03.560 --> 12:07.560
Which was the worst. Like Williams? And they had

12:07.560 --> 12:11.560
oh shoot, it was another something

12:11.560 --> 12:15.560
I don't remember off the top of my head, but this machine just sucked.

12:15.560 --> 12:20.560
it was sort of thrown away in the corner by the door, you know, like we really don't have

12:20.560 --> 12:25.560
this here, they just make us. And then, you know, we played with, you know, balls all

12:25.560 --> 12:33.040
day and then went back over for 2DX and I got to see my friend Liz, who I hadn't seen

12:33.040 --> 12:41.640
in two years. I knew her before I actually met her at Automate Expo 2000, which was also

12:41.640 --> 12:45.760
where I played my first EDR machine.

12:45.760 --> 12:49.060
You interviewed Kim in these interviews, right, that you did?

12:49.060 --> 12:50.060
I interviewed Liz.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.060
I interviewed a bunch of people.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.060
Oh, Liz did?

12:52.060 --> 12:53.060
Okay, cool.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.200
Liz is also, she's a San Toki on Steps Squad 4.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.600
Ah, right on.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
Cool.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.880
I want to talk to Mel and Mel for a minute here.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.720
They went to the big Disney's Rave tournament on Friday, which none of us were able to go

13:05.720 --> 13:10.080
to because we all have to work and then, you know, by the time, well at least I do.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.080
What's that?

13:11.080 --> 13:13.080
Oh, you went for that week? That's right. Oh, well you guys...

13:13.080 --> 13:15.080
I mock us unemployed people, why don't you?

13:15.080 --> 13:22.080
I'm sorry. Well, if I worked in Milpitas, then I could get to the tournament in time, but I work here in Sacramento in it.

13:22.080 --> 13:26.080
Hey, I'm unemployed, don't you know?

13:26.080 --> 13:29.080
But... Okay, I'll just shut up now then.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.080
Watch out before the unemployed rise up.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.080
I know, I think the unemployed are going to rise up and kill me.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.080
Smoke power!

13:36.080 --> 13:39.160
So tell us about the Disney's Rave Tournament. How did it go?

13:39.160 --> 13:41.280
What were some things that... You have to explain

13:41.280 --> 13:45.100
how a Disney's Rave Tournament worked for everybody out there who doesn't have a

13:45.100 --> 13:46.960
Disney's Rave machine near them.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.440
Okay, well, yeah,

13:48.440 --> 13:51.080
quick rundown. The tourney was on a

13:51.080 --> 13:52.920
dancing stage, Disney's Rave.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.800
It was at Milpitas, and it was hosted in one of the party rooms.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.400
And for the Perfect Attack tourney, it was all on doubles.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.520
And because

14:01.520 --> 14:03.840
Disney's Rave is a rather easy

14:03.840 --> 14:09.000
machine to perfect attack anything on, like SSSs are very commonplace, they had set the

14:09.000 --> 14:14.240
difficulty to eight. So it was like, you know, the good old third mix SSR days were four

14:14.240 --> 14:18.840
goods and you were out. And people did fail during the tourney.

14:18.840 --> 14:22.720
Oh, to fail a song on Disney's Rave, that's got to be the biggest heartbreaker.

14:22.720 --> 14:26.840
Not necessarily. Some of the songs are in PowerPoint, some of them were ten footers,

14:26.840 --> 14:29.760
like Twilight Zone and Ducking Hardcore, I mean.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.440
I can just imagine Mr. Bassman.

14:32.440 --> 14:36.440
The basement is actually relatively easy compared to some of the others.

14:36.440 --> 14:45.440
Wow. So, now, you came out of hiding, basically your freestyle retirement, and you did a freestyle at this tournament, correct?

14:45.440 --> 14:51.440
Yes, I did. I finally decided, hey, this is going to be a fun tourney, there's not that much pressure, what the heck.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.440
So, yeah, I did the bump.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.440
Right on.

14:55.440 --> 15:00.440
It's the most ghetto song out there, and I pretty much milked it for its ghetto factor.

15:00.440 --> 15:07.160
Now, the last time Mel B was here on Orange Lounge about six or seven weeks ago now, the

15:07.160 --> 15:10.840
last time he was here, we made an agreement that the next time he enters in the tournament,

15:10.840 --> 15:13.920
he needs to do a knee drop and a hand slap.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.920
Did those two things get done?

15:14.920 --> 15:15.920
Yes, they did.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.920
Oh, my God.

15:16.920 --> 15:22.360
And from what I understand, you got criticized by one of the judges for it, right?

15:22.360 --> 15:26.800
Yes, one of the judges was, I wasn't so sure about that hand slap knee drop somewhere in

15:26.800 --> 15:27.800
the game.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.800
I mean, I chained up pretty nicely.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.800
I kind of disguised it well.

15:29.800 --> 15:36.560
I thought I did it with class and style and all those good things freestyle you should

15:36.560 --> 15:39.920
be doing it with, but damn.

15:39.920 --> 15:44.280
So if anybody wants to blame the low points of Mel B's routine, that would be our fault

15:44.280 --> 15:45.280
here at Orange Lounge.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
So you're welcome.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.280
It was all in fun.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.360
For the turnout I had on a Friday night, there was probably about maybe 20 routines or so

15:53.360 --> 15:54.360
thereabouts.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.360
Not too bad.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.360
18, 19.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.360
Yeah, it's cool.

15:57.360 --> 16:01.360
And everyone was just having a good time more than anything.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.360
There was maybe a few dance-y routines, but for the most part everyone was just goofed around.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.360
It's Disney rave, you know? How seriously can you take it?

16:08.360 --> 16:11.360
Now, how many Macarena routines were there?

16:11.360 --> 16:12.360
One.

16:12.360 --> 16:16.360
Just one, really? Did they actually do the Macarena?

16:16.360 --> 16:21.360
Not really, not. In fact, the audience did, although the funny thing was

16:21.360 --> 16:24.360
it was Tigger, actually, of all people who did Macarena.

16:24.360 --> 16:30.360
And at the end, he pretty much turned it into love to Macarena, complete with hand slaps and all that good schmazz.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.360
Right on.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.360
That's awesome.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.360
So, good tournament?

16:34.360 --> 16:37.360
You think they need to do another Disney's Rave tournament in the future?

16:37.360 --> 16:41.360
Or was it just kind of a one-time, haha, that was funny, let's move on now?

16:41.360 --> 16:44.360
Maybe once in a blue moon, like once a year probably.

16:44.360 --> 16:53.360
I doubt you'd see anything twice because a lot of people were having trouble enough trying to memorize steps, trying to get it up really for maternity, who knows.

16:53.360 --> 17:01.360
Good times, good times. Any other tournaments coming up that you want to tell us all about? Any more appearances you'll be making that you want to plug?

17:01.360 --> 17:09.360
As far as I know, you'll probably catch me at a local 7-Eleven or something like that, you know, just catch me Thursday, I'm getting a vanilla coke Slurpee, yeah.

17:09.360 --> 17:14.360
I'll be at the one on Branham and Monterey, yeah, in San Jose. Bingo.

17:14.360 --> 17:19.960
But past that, as far as I know, I'm not too sure about any of the tourneys coming up.

17:19.960 --> 17:25.240
I know Scandids, who's probably one of the bigger ones coming up in December, as soon

17:25.240 --> 17:28.600
as I know more details about that, hey, I'll pass it on.

17:28.600 --> 17:32.440
There's going to be a Sacramento tournament in November.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.440
Shh.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.440
Yeah.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.440
To be determined.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.440
To be determined.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.440
In the works.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.560
Let's talk to Melody for a minute.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.560
How are you?

17:39.560 --> 17:40.560
I'm okay.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.280
Now, you were just here a couple weeks ago, weren't you?

17:43.280 --> 17:46.280
Yeah, because I needed donuts and Mongolian.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.280
And you got both those things today.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.280
And now I have pants and a jacket.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.280
Now I have clothes to go with the Mongolian.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.280
Explain why you had to come up to Sacramento this time.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.280
This time?

17:56.280 --> 17:57.280
Last time was for donuts.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.280
Last time was for donuts.

17:58.280 --> 18:03.280
This time, I was on a quest to get a pair of pants at Express that I absolutely adore.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.280
I called every single Express in Northern California.

18:07.280 --> 18:11.280
Only one had them in the right size, and it was here in Sacramento.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.600
well hey i have a really good excuse to come up here

18:13.600 --> 18:15.760
we're kicking around the idea anyway

18:15.760 --> 18:17.240
middle-term just happened

18:17.240 --> 18:19.480
we had to inform everyone that yes

18:19.480 --> 18:23.200
and finally dropping it and i don't know what you're going to come up here

18:23.200 --> 18:25.360
now waiting to see the video that's why can't wait for

18:25.360 --> 18:26.680
there

18:26.680 --> 18:29.400
three-minute video i think it's not just a three minutes

18:29.400 --> 18:31.320
uh...

18:31.320 --> 18:34.040
here comes rosie in jamaal

18:34.040 --> 18:36.040
but on it

18:36.040 --> 18:38.280
it's a wrestling video

18:38.280 --> 18:48.280
But if you go on DDR Freak and the Miggle Attorney thread, there is a link to a three-minute video on there that has some highlights from the Miggle Attorney until the actual videos come up.

18:48.280 --> 18:54.280
But I haven't been able to finish downloading it myself, considering my computer crashed IE in the middle of it, so...

18:54.280 --> 19:00.280
They're giving a link in the chat room. If you want to get that three-minute video, it's at evil.fukuk.org.

19:00.280 --> 19:05.280
And fukuk is spelled, by the way, F-C-U-K. I don't think that has anything to do with French Connection.

19:05.280 --> 19:11.920
an independent side of that. I think frenchconnections is fcuk.com. I have a fkuk shirt, fkuk games.

19:11.920 --> 19:16.640
I wear that to all the tournaments. I've seen that. Yeah. I didn't even. Oh yes. And anyone

19:16.640 --> 19:20.580
who downloaded the video, I make a brief one half second appearance in it. Nice. What are

19:20.580 --> 19:28.240
you doing? Are you talking? No, no, I'm like watching Cory play Drummania. Right on, right

19:28.240 --> 19:36.320
And then there's also, you can download it from oralseh.cx, oralseh.cx is another site

19:36.320 --> 19:37.760
you can get it.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.320
And everybody's sharing when they appear in the video.

19:40.320 --> 19:45.280
See, I have to get my computer to actually cooperate and download it without crashing

19:45.280 --> 19:48.440
my browser in the middle of it.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.960
Black Lab is in the chat room saying, I appear in it twice, I'm in it twice.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.520
I guess it must just be a really fast clip kind of thing where it just got everybody

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
in there.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.520
It's kind of cool, actually.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.520
I only saw half of it.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.920
Were you? Did you spot yourself?

19:58.920 --> 20:01.960
I have not seen myself yet. Well, maybe you're in the second half.

20:01.960 --> 20:06.480
It could be, but... One day we'll bring a video camera in here and we'll do a

20:06.480 --> 20:08.360
quick promo or something.

20:08.360 --> 20:13.640
But probably the greatest cameo we saw in the video that we did see from the tourney

20:13.640 --> 20:15.080
was a

20:15.080 --> 20:17.440
kneeling pad, of all things.

20:17.440 --> 20:21.300
It was a cow kneeling pad. True story. I mean, quick rundown for everyone out there. Sure, sure.

20:21.300 --> 20:25.360
Me and Melody, we were over at Target one night

20:25.360 --> 20:35.360
And then we was just checking out some stuff and then we see, I come by the gardening section, I see these things, they're butterfly knee pads, literally, knee pads with butterflies on them.

20:35.360 --> 20:44.360
And you know, I thought, dude, that must be like the greatest gift we could give at a tourney, like, we should give the worst freestyler, you know, a set of butterfly knee pads and just send them on their way.

20:44.360 --> 20:50.360
But right next to it, we saw a cow kneeling pad, and since one of our friends is big on cows, you know, we thought that'd be cool.

20:50.360 --> 20:56.280
and see that was a kneeling pad, we were already thinking the wrong things with that. So, we

20:56.280 --> 21:02.080
gave the gift to our friend over at the tourney and next thing you know everyone was abusing

21:02.080 --> 21:09.080
it and all sorts of... I think the cow saw more action than anyone else that night. Jamie

21:10.040 --> 21:13.960
just pissed her pants at something here, it just happened. She just read that the local

21:13.960 --> 21:20.960
off land here in Roselle, got a crane game! Explain your obsession with the crane game

21:21.000 --> 21:23.240
for a minute, I'm sorry to change the subject on your melody. First off, Jamie, I'm hiding

21:23.240 --> 21:28.200
my keys from you right now. Yeah, you are not, Jamie has to be rationed on how much

21:28.200 --> 21:32.200
money she can spend on the crane game. I rape the crane games. Now, it's not one of those,

21:32.200 --> 21:35.700
I need to talk to JB for a minute who's telling us about this, it's not one of those shitty

21:35.700 --> 21:40.120
cranes for candy type thing, is it? Cause that, that don't count. Yeah, that doesn't

21:40.120 --> 21:43.120
Give us a quarter so we can give you two cents worth of candy game.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.120
It needs to have the claw.

21:45.120 --> 21:51.120
Who will stay and who will go?

21:51.120 --> 21:55.120
What's the best thing you ever won on a crane game, Jamie?

21:55.120 --> 22:03.120
Well, there was Vegas in January when I won three Clifford dogs, three stuffed robo dogs, and seven bears.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.120
JB says it's shitty stuffed animals.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.120
I am all over shitty stuffed animals.

22:09.120 --> 22:13.120
There's not a crane game unless the animals are shitty. It just doesn't happen that way.

22:13.120 --> 22:18.120
It's always choose the worst looking ugliest piece of crap you see in there and you will get it first try.

22:18.120 --> 22:22.120
Don't make fun of my shitty animals! Damn Mongolians!

22:22.120 --> 22:28.120
The best thing I ever won, and of all places this was at Sviggle, I got Tyrone.

22:28.120 --> 22:32.120
Oh yeah, Tyrone. Tyrone was the best. Where is Tyrone?

22:32.120 --> 22:37.120
Tyrone is currently in lockup with his pussies and bitches.

22:37.120 --> 22:41.580
Tyrone, by the way, and maybe I'll find during the next week I'll find a link to a

22:41.580 --> 22:45.200
picture of Tyrone and put it in the chat room because I know I have one up.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.740
If anybody knows of my secret picture page, it's in there with Sunnyvale

22:48.740 --> 22:50.280
Tournament pictures.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.940
Tyrone is a little stuffed bear that wears like a little

22:51.940 --> 22:52.940
beanie bear.

22:52.940 --> 22:53.940
He's a real beanie bear.

22:53.940 --> 23:03.260
He's a brown bear wearing a deep maroon smoking jacket.

23:03.260 --> 23:10.780
his name literally is Tyrone. He is the coolest bear in the world. He has, he has bitches

23:10.780 --> 23:18.700
thanks to Melody. And he has pussies. You know how hard it is to find little tiny dogs

23:18.700 --> 23:23.020
and just to be wandering around Target saying, wow, I need to get some bitches around here

23:23.020 --> 23:26.940
somewhere and how, especially when you're in the toy section and all the kids are wandering

23:26.940 --> 23:31.940
I was just like, hmm, I need some bitches here.

23:31.940 --> 23:36.940
Um, yeah, could I get a price check on bitches in aisle three?

23:36.940 --> 23:41.940
Attention Kmart shoppers, we have a sale in the bitches department.

23:41.940 --> 23:46.940
Attention all Kmart shoppers, tampons and bitches half off.

23:46.940 --> 23:51.940
Excuse me, do you have any bitches here?

23:51.940 --> 23:56.000
is there a bitch in the house?

23:56.000 --> 24:01.500
remind me to never ever drink water at this show again

24:01.500 --> 24:05.920
i nearly choked up my vanilla coke

24:05.920 --> 24:08.940
yeah we have some

24:08.940 --> 24:13.140
some bitches made a mess on aisle three

24:13.140 --> 24:15.380
can we get the little pink powder

24:15.380 --> 24:21.660
we got a bitch in the line we need a price check on bitches

24:21.660 --> 24:25.860
so easily and he was here today? What's Bimani? I don't care about Bimani anymore. I just

24:25.860 --> 24:31.580
want to talk about Bitch as many times as I can on the show tonight. Bitchmania 2DX.

24:31.580 --> 24:35.780
New Songs Collection. Dude, Bimania. That's what the parents are doing to you while you're

24:35.780 --> 24:38.500
playing the game, you know, and like all their little kids are up there and you're trying

24:38.500 --> 24:41.340
to tell the little kids to get away and the parents come up to you and go, what do you

24:41.340 --> 24:43.980
think you're doing? Why is it not your game? You don't want to hear it? It's not their

24:43.980 --> 24:47.980
game either. Bitchmania, I know it's not their game either. Jamie is excellent at playing

24:47.980 --> 24:51.520
Bitchmania with the parents. It's like, what am I doing? I'm trying to keep your kid from

24:51.520 --> 24:55.920
getting killed that's what I'm doing did I had a chance to do it on Wednesday

24:55.920 --> 25:00.040
night I didn't tell you about that just another stupid stupid you know mom

25:00.040 --> 25:03.080
letting her child run rampant on the thing and I was like you need to control

25:03.080 --> 25:08.720
your little you know spawn there you actually referred to the child as spawn

25:08.720 --> 25:12.800
no I said their child but I was think well there was also the incident with

25:12.800 --> 25:18.560
the giggling idiots oh yeah if you ever seen the clerks cartoon yeah and the two

25:18.560 --> 25:20.360
giggling girls

25:20.360 --> 25:23.360
that's like what these chicks are like you know

25:23.360 --> 25:24.880
sitting over

25:24.880 --> 25:28.680
over uh... at the little tables and i was watching uh...

25:28.680 --> 25:30.200
i think

25:30.200 --> 25:32.240
who was this playing para para i think it was uh...

25:32.240 --> 25:34.480
sydney that was playing

25:34.480 --> 25:36.200
playing um...

25:36.200 --> 25:36.960
para para

25:36.960 --> 25:38.040
but they were like

25:38.040 --> 25:42.240
i was wearing okay i don't know if anyone watches digi kart but i had a black

25:42.240 --> 25:43.680
gamagemadon hat

25:43.680 --> 25:45.680
with the little pointy horns on it

25:45.680 --> 25:53.640
one of them came over and says, I like how you go, thank you, until she walks off. And

25:53.640 --> 25:57.720
then they like pointed to the African that was on my purse and goes, and one of them

25:57.720 --> 26:04.640
came over and I was like, she's like, would you eat your dog? Go away. No, no, no, tell

26:04.640 --> 26:12.140
me, would you eat your dog? Go away. Why won't you tell me? Do I have to have you removed?

26:12.140 --> 26:13.140
And she left.

26:13.140 --> 26:16.500
No, I wanted them all dead.

26:16.500 --> 26:17.500
You wanted to kill them all.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.860
You know what this is kind of turning into here, I think?

26:19.860 --> 26:21.100
I think we need to get into this.

26:21.100 --> 26:24.900
I think we need to get into the FU of the week.

26:24.900 --> 26:27.180
The fuck yous of the week.

26:27.180 --> 26:28.500
Let's have at it, shall we?

26:28.500 --> 26:31.100
Do you have another one you want to start us off with, Jamie?

26:31.100 --> 26:32.100
I'm sure I can think of one.

26:32.100 --> 26:34.660
Because I've been getting a lot in the chat room that I can talk about.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.340
I don't really have one myself, but let's hear it, Jamie.

26:37.340 --> 26:39.740
Let's hear your FU of the week.

26:39.740 --> 26:44.540
My first one of course goes towards those, you know, crappy, giggling, stupid, moron,

26:44.540 --> 26:46.780
stupid fucks that Rizzo got there.

26:46.780 --> 26:50.420
My other fuck you of the week goes towards idiots in general because I hate them.

26:50.420 --> 26:51.420
Especially idiots...

26:51.420 --> 26:52.420
What?

26:52.420 --> 27:00.060
That's rather vague in general, but I kind of like it.

27:00.060 --> 27:07.340
Well, no, there's the people who will fall for just about anything that you put in front

27:07.340 --> 27:08.340
of them.

27:08.340 --> 27:15.740
narrow down this level of idiocy to cheat, to the people who will blindly follow one

27:15.740 --> 27:22.980
voice and think that they are who all end all. There's nothing wrong with fanboys and

27:22.980 --> 27:27.540
fangirls. There's a thing with people who are fanboys and fangirls to the exception

27:27.540 --> 27:31.940
of all else, who will take anything that they hear on TV, anything on the radio, by the

27:31.940 --> 27:38.940
they do everything I say, anything that they read and acts like it is, you know, the absolute

27:39.740 --> 27:44.820
scripture that they need to live their lives by. Oh my God, I must buy this thing for the

27:44.820 --> 27:51.820
sake of my American pride. Oh my God, orange is the new red. Exactly. You ever saw Josie

27:52.520 --> 27:57.820
and the Pussycats, one of the rudest ever? But that is exactly the thing that I, and

27:57.820 --> 27:59.820
I think there's some people who think,

27:59.820 --> 28:02.820
oh well, you know, my life isn't very important,

28:02.820 --> 28:06.820
so I'm gonna make up something really stupid so I can get on CNN.

28:06.820 --> 28:10.820
But no, I'm not talking about, you know, about...

28:10.820 --> 28:14.820
Oh my god, I'm gonna tell a waitress at Shoney's that my van has a bomb in it

28:14.820 --> 28:15.820
and I'm gonna go blow something up.

28:15.820 --> 28:18.820
Oh my god!

28:18.820 --> 28:20.820
Boy, that killed the conversation, didn't it?

28:20.820 --> 28:22.820
Anybody else in here? Oh, are you done with your...?

28:22.820 --> 28:24.820
No, I just don't like stupid people.

28:24.820 --> 28:26.820
Okay, any other rants you have?

28:27.820 --> 28:31.820
Alright, then we've got, we've got Loki's got his rant, let's hear it, Loki.

28:31.820 --> 28:37.820
Alright, my first FU of the Week goes to, uh, the new version of DWI, which I'll go over that later.

28:37.820 --> 28:38.320
Yes.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.820
But that thing didn't work again.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.820
Not much of a surprise, they just can't program it right for some reason.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.820
I guess it's just incompatible with my computer.

28:45.820 --> 28:49.820
Uh, my second FU of the Week would have to go to...

28:49.820 --> 28:51.820
By the way, Loki, happy birthday.

28:51.820 --> 28:52.820
Yes, actually.

28:52.820 --> 28:55.940
little your little party you had last night was quite quite nice thank you for

28:55.940 --> 29:00.140
reminding me that's my second nephew of the week is to 9-11 god damn it I had

29:00.140 --> 29:06.460
that birthday 21 years before that it's not fair everyone's like everyone's like

29:06.460 --> 29:14.900
oh your birthday's on 9-11 I'm sorry I'm not fuck you

29:14.900 --> 29:19.340
yeah so pretty much every year from now on everyone at my work and all that stuff

29:19.340 --> 29:26.340
They actually forget my birthday because of 9-11 and the new version of D.W.I.

29:49.340 --> 29:51.340
moment of political uncorrectness.

29:51.340 --> 29:53.340
Speaking of political uncorrectness.

29:53.340 --> 29:55.340
Or correctness or whatever.

29:55.340 --> 29:57.340
My music please.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.340
I have a request for my song since you know

30:01.340 --> 30:03.340
if that Drop the Bomb doesn't really work with

30:03.340 --> 30:05.340
9-11, maybe you can change it to

30:05.340 --> 30:07.340
Crash. Anyway,

30:07.340 --> 30:09.340
you have to save me a few of the weeks.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.340
My other one

30:11.340 --> 30:13.340
is also directed in

30:13.340 --> 30:15.340
a similar fashion toward

30:15.340 --> 30:17.340
the whole 9-11 thing.

30:17.340 --> 30:21.180
and for people who saw my big rent my life journal

30:21.180 --> 30:24.100
it's actually directed toward consumerism in general

30:24.100 --> 30:28.220
right in the consumer or and how

30:28.220 --> 30:32.060
this goes toward all those people who are trying to make as you know quick

30:32.060 --> 30:33.380
bucks off a tragedy

30:33.380 --> 30:34.660
like you

30:34.660 --> 30:38.760
thank you thank you thank you go to hell and die there

30:38.760 --> 30:40.820
and um... you know just after that

30:40.820 --> 30:42.260
they needed a holiday

30:42.260 --> 30:43.940
it's now patriots day

30:43.940 --> 30:47.180
no longer will it be called nine eleven that's not like the greatest sale at

30:47.180 --> 30:49.100
JCPenney's

30:49.100 --> 30:51.360
Patriot's Day sale! Yay!

30:51.360 --> 30:58.360
But that's awesome, because I get that day off every year, hopefully.

31:00.920 --> 31:04.340
Any other FUs on anything in general?

31:04.340 --> 31:07.100
Aw, Melby's got one.

31:07.100 --> 31:11.780
I don't have Mel music, but I'll find Mel music really fast. Let's see, Mel music, Mel music.

31:11.780 --> 31:15.740
What would work for Mel music? Let's try...

31:15.740 --> 31:18.840
uh...

31:18.840 --> 31:24.300
i will

31:24.300 --> 31:29.180
excellent choice my man, anyway i got one big f you actually

31:29.180 --> 31:32.440
not just one person, not even out there, it's a whole damn city

31:32.440 --> 31:34.060
it's the city of milpitas

31:34.060 --> 31:36.680
i don't know most of you who have been out there in a while but

31:36.680 --> 31:40.400
apparently there was a problem about a month ago

31:40.400 --> 31:41.760
yeah a month and a half, two months ago

31:41.760 --> 31:46.760
or apparently a pipe that was a pump to pull from the site.

31:46.760 --> 31:53.760
Here, since I know the story, there's a saltwater pond apparently on the edge of Lopeda in San Jose.

31:53.760 --> 31:57.760
And it has lots of, it's like 650 acres, it's huge.

31:57.760 --> 32:03.760
And it's got lots of nice little organisms and crap in it, and the pump broke.

32:03.760 --> 32:10.760
And it's been very warm in the area, and lots of nice little organisms and stuff in there.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.760
Ha ha! Smells like poopy!

32:12.760 --> 32:16.760
Um, try, like, bad sushi. Constantly.

32:18.760 --> 32:22.760
Really horrible. It just smells all day long.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.760
That feels so bad for people who work at-

32:26.760 --> 32:29.760
Like, worse than the sushi place at the Metreon?

32:30.760 --> 32:32.760
I'm just kidding. I'd never heard that before.

32:32.760 --> 32:33.760
Yeah, seriously, I mean-

32:33.760 --> 32:35.760
I'm trying to think of an easy place to knock.

32:35.760 --> 32:43.760
I feel so bad for people who work at Dave & Buster's. They gotta sit out there all day long and inhale this and they just get headaches.

32:43.760 --> 32:48.760
You gotta wonder though, because I've been to Illuminations, the candle store, and I've asked the chicks that work there,

32:48.760 --> 32:52.760
doesn't it get annoying after a while smelling like candle, and they say they get used to it.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.760
So you gotta wonder if Dave & Buster's people get used to the raw sushi smell.

32:55.760 --> 33:00.760
I actually, since I'm the nice person that I am, I actually talk to the doormat when I go in at Dave & Buster's.

33:00.760 --> 33:05.560
how the hell do you live with this smell you know we get headaches all the time

33:05.560 --> 33:09.640
we can't stand it they actually still smell it believe me i will run from my

33:09.640 --> 33:12.280
car to the door and get in as fast as i can

33:12.280 --> 33:15.480
mel and i wear milk is getting gas he opened the window to my car i started

33:15.480 --> 33:19.480
screaming at him shut the damn window it's gonna smell like fucking fish in

33:19.480 --> 33:21.720
here

33:22.760 --> 33:25.640
but yeah so in general fucking milk pitas

33:25.640 --> 33:27.200
uh...

33:27.200 --> 33:29.240
i can't even continue

33:29.240 --> 33:31.200
uh...

33:31.200 --> 33:34.200
all right now we've got to get to the at least that we can the chat room is

33:34.200 --> 33:37.720
turning off the long segment every week but ok

33:37.720 --> 33:40.160
whatever will be pulled up to you

33:40.160 --> 33:43.020
it's that the people's choice the people's at the old

33:43.020 --> 33:47.520
uh... let's uh... go to be a piece of the chat

33:47.520 --> 33:51.040
uh... when says

33:51.040 --> 33:55.120
uh... if you to windows exp because it's crashed on again and it's making the

33:55.120 --> 33:57.560
format is drive again this week

33:57.560 --> 34:00.280
and ten society

34:00.280 --> 34:04.480
so-called kick says his nephew the week is child proof safety caps

34:04.480 --> 34:08.160
it took them seven tries to open the new bottle of pills that he got today in a

34:08.160 --> 34:09.960
new bottle

34:09.960 --> 34:10.760
out

34:10.760 --> 34:15.680
the telephone

34:15.680 --> 34:19.060
yep

34:19.060 --> 34:23.840
that's a crack put it back

34:23.840 --> 34:28.580
Uh, DCB has a Fuck You of the Week, and he says it's to his parents.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.380
Typical T-Necks there,

34:30.380 --> 34:34.760
for not letting him buy 2DX because it's too expensive.

34:34.760 --> 34:38.840
So now he's stuck with a 2DX controller and nothing to play except for five key games,

34:38.840 --> 34:41.400
which get boring fast.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.400
I recommend Sixth and Core, because it's almost just like 2DX.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.460
When I was your age, we didn't have this media stuff.

34:47.460 --> 34:51.280
We had to play on the power pad.

34:51.280 --> 35:00.280
It was Power Club, and all we had was Excitebike and Gyromite.

35:21.280 --> 35:25.040
attorney, thusly getting him in deep shit with the parents.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.040
Fuck Denny's.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.040
Oh.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.040
Eda Karras.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.360
Loki's got a, Loki's got an F.U. the week right behind him.

35:30.360 --> 35:35.400
Well, speaking of Denny's, uh, I don't know what it is about Denny's, but every time I

35:35.400 --> 35:40.480
go in there, they have to do one of two things, either A, forget something I ordered, or B,

35:40.480 --> 35:45.360
make fun of my shirt, because normally I have, normally I have a shirt on there, and it'll

35:45.360 --> 35:46.400
have like a phrase.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.200
One time I had one that said, I hear voices and they don't like it.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.200
Do you really hear voices?

35:50.200 --> 35:53.200
Why don't you like me?

35:53.200 --> 35:57.200
I hear one really annoying voice right now. Cram it!

35:57.200 --> 36:00.200
So, F you to Denny's, because they suck.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.200
Alright, fair enough. Carole's better anyway.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.200
If you ever go to the Carole's in Roseville, ask for Mary Lou, she's sweetie.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.200
Yes she is, and tip her well.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.200
Three more, three more F you's.

36:11.200 --> 36:15.200
23rd Magus says, oh, he wants two.

36:15.200 --> 36:20.320
he says a continued fuck you to boom PlayStation, oh PlayStation 2 USB

36:20.320 --> 36:24.720
converters, those controller converters, and also a good sized FU to the player

36:24.720 --> 36:29.400
one keys on RVGL's hip-hop mania. You know what I would have to second that

36:29.400 --> 36:32.200
except the way that I play I really don't have an issue with it.

36:32.200 --> 36:38.720
Joe mama says FU from school for being morons they gave him three detentions

36:38.720 --> 36:42.620
for nothing

36:42.620 --> 36:47.640
i somehow wonder if he really did nothing

36:47.640 --> 36:50.360
well i was only late a couple times that's not that

36:50.360 --> 36:53.040
i don't know what we got to know what do you really do it

36:53.040 --> 36:54.680
i really didn't think that i was bad

36:54.680 --> 36:58.000
yeah i really didn't anybody

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
jay-b says f you to carol's for being slow

37:02.000 --> 37:06.160
f you jay-b

37:06.160 --> 37:11.160
No, we have to add IHOP to that list because we had some slow-ass service there after making it all the other day.

37:11.160 --> 37:16.160
Joe Mama got detention because he quote-unquote missed a class.

37:16.160 --> 37:19.160
Oh yeah, and furthermore, from all I know, that's just stupid.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.160
Did he miss a class because he was out back smoking pot or what?

37:22.160 --> 37:29.160
I don't know, but to continue that IHOP thought, I'm just thinking that's just four reasons why we've got to have a rockfish and waffles up in NorCal.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.160
Please.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.160
A chicken and waffle!

37:32.160 --> 37:37.640
into that you know what yes and that's it just one day come to my house I will

37:37.640 --> 37:48.360
make you French toast because I will like that it's just not the same they

37:48.360 --> 37:52.320
add crack to their chicken and waffles I'm talking about I hopping caros and

37:52.320 --> 38:00.720
Denny's in those crappy places sorry we are we have to take this show down to

38:00.720 --> 38:04.600
SoCal sometime. We're going to tape a show in SoCal at some point, somehow.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.480
A.I. Chip, anyone?

38:06.480 --> 38:10.480
Do you guys want to take our recorder? If you guys live close by, I'd let you take the recorder and tape fun stuff.

38:10.480 --> 38:17.020
Well, we're going to A.I. for a while, but I don't know if we're going to see anyone entertaining. We could take it on rides at Disneyland and start screaming randomly or something.

38:17.020 --> 38:18.720
You know, cause

38:18.720 --> 38:21.920
now I'm thinking of how I could make this work. I might be able to let you guys borrow the

38:21.920 --> 38:25.800
remote unit for a while if you guys want to tape your adventures. Unfortunately, they won't let

38:25.800 --> 38:27.800
quarters or anything if the price is right.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.800
Well, I mean the rest of your vendors, you could go to AI or whatever.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.800
Oh, we're going to AI.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.800
A live review of Marshall B.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.800
A live review of Marshall B. complete with punching and sweating and all that good schman.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.800
And everybody was kung fu fighting.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.800
And everybody was kung fu fighting.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.800
And the moment in my head was kick punch.

38:41.800 --> 38:45.800
Well actually we should do a review for punch mania, they have it at Florin now.

38:45.800 --> 38:49.800
That's what I hear is that Florin Mall here in Sacramento got punch mania.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.800
That's the fist of the north star one.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.800
The fist of the north star one, yep.

38:53.800 --> 39:00.120
ass fucking mall got punch mania so the gang members can train I drove by there

39:00.120 --> 39:05.220
that place was scary it is very scary and desolate looking but they have pump

39:05.220 --> 39:10.680
it up you have pump it up ooh pump it up with me bounce with me bounce with me

39:10.680 --> 39:16.640
down yeah yes oh speaking of what a lot oh I see you're telling me to do a

39:16.640 --> 39:21.160
segue okay yes let's do this segue this is something we've actually talked about

39:21.160 --> 39:24.000
about on the show before, but this is interesting.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.920
I find this interesting only because this is a story

39:26.920 --> 39:30.380
that is actually posted on Konami's site in the UK.

39:30.380 --> 39:32.680
This is Konami Amusement of Europe.

39:32.680 --> 39:36.080
This is their stance on the Konami versus Anamiro,

39:36.080 --> 39:37.760
which is the company that makes Pump It Up.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.160
This is their words on that whole lawsuit,

39:40.160 --> 39:41.240
and this is why it's interesting.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.800
This is the first, I think this is the first real comment

39:43.800 --> 39:45.500
I've seen from Konami on this whole thing,

39:45.500 --> 39:47.800
so let's read this, shall we?

39:47.800 --> 39:49.000
This is from Konami's site.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.400
It says, Konami's legal eagles

39:50.400 --> 39:54.520
have always had their hands full defending Dance Dance Revolution's genre, spawning style

39:54.520 --> 39:58.560
from being copied all over the world, but this latest attempt by company Andamaro, they

39:58.560 --> 40:03.560
call it Andamaro, has evened them slightly taken aback.

40:03.560 --> 40:07.160
This time it appears the Korean company's strategy was to claim they actually invented

40:07.160 --> 40:12.960
DDR in the first place, despite the fact it took them almost two years to make their complaint.

40:12.960 --> 40:17.160
It's kind of interesting because they're kind of taking jabs then to Miro, which you don't

40:17.160 --> 40:20.580
usually see in company press releases, but of course in Europe everything's tabloid.

40:20.580 --> 40:24.440
It's all about, you know, at least from what I've seen.

40:24.440 --> 40:29.420
The parties have been involved in legal disputes since then in front of the Korean and the

40:29.420 --> 40:30.420
U.S. courts.

40:30.420 --> 40:34.100
Now that's interesting because I don't think we've ever heard before that this thing's

40:34.100 --> 40:37.880
been in the U.S. courts, but this says it has.

40:37.880 --> 40:41.800
Onomiro started manufacturing and distributing Pump It Up Dance Simulation Game, which was

40:41.800 --> 40:46.180
very similar to Konami's Dance Dance Revolution during September 1999.

40:46.180 --> 40:51.400
Konami filed a complaint with the Seoul District Court seeking an injunction against the production

40:51.400 --> 40:57.120
of Pump It Up as it integrated Konami's design, right, and violated unfair competition law.

40:57.120 --> 41:02.620
The court favored Konami's claim in June of 2001, but Andamuro appealed to the Seoul High

41:02.620 --> 41:05.240
Court, that would be in Korea.

41:05.240 --> 41:10.160
Then in August of 2000, Andamuro filed a complaint against Konami seeking an injunction to the

41:10.160 --> 41:14.080
distribution of Dance Dance Revolution in the United States.

41:14.080 --> 41:18.720
The reason was that Konami infringed the patent and Amuro had been assigned from a third party

41:18.720 --> 41:19.960
in the U.S.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.320
The case was scheduled for jury trial this month.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.400
So interesting.

41:23.400 --> 41:28.540
And Amuro filed a complaint against Konami seeking an injunction against the distribution

41:28.540 --> 41:31.120
of Dance's Revolution in the United States.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.120
No U.S. mixes lately.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
Hmm.

41:34.120 --> 41:38.920
However, at the last minute, and Amuro made a snap proposal to settle the dispute via

41:38.920 --> 41:43.600
negotiations and it has been confirmed that and Amuro would respect Konami's intellectual

41:43.600 --> 41:48.200
property rights and pay a settlement fee for their use. As a result, both parties agreed

41:48.200 --> 41:50.600
to withdraw the lawsuits in Korea and the U.S.

41:50.600 --> 41:54.400
So that opens the door.

41:54.400 --> 42:01.340
Yep. So that's that. That's an official word from Konami of the U.K. And it says some very

42:01.340 --> 42:03.980
interesting things in there that we might not have known before. Anybody want to comment

42:03.980 --> 42:06.300
on this story? Have anything to say about it? Yes, Loki.

42:06.300 --> 42:11.280
Does that mean we're going to see some U.S. pump-it-up machines?

42:11.280 --> 42:14.040
I think Pump It Up's already kind of been distributed in the U.S.

42:14.040 --> 42:17.760
I mean, I'm going to say, you seem to know about this, Mal, you know, if Animuro's kind of localized in the U.S.

42:17.760 --> 42:21.320
I know they've kind of been hawking the machines to U.S. arcades,

42:21.320 --> 42:27.560
but of course there's companies out there that hawk the Macs too, like, to U.S. arcades too, so I don't know if Animuro's necessarily

42:27.560 --> 42:29.840
launched in the U.S., but...

42:29.840 --> 42:33.320
Well, it has been targeted in the U.S. for a while. I mean, like, if you went to...

42:33.320 --> 42:35.400
I forget what the major arcade, uh,

42:35.400 --> 42:40.200
arcade game convention is in Vegas.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.200
Not E3, definitely.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.200
I think the arcade, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.200
Yeah, well yeah, Pump It Up was being demonstrated out there.

42:46.200 --> 42:51.200
So I think it was starting with the Premiere mix, the international one.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.200
The one that had like Britney songs and you know, Bye Bye Bye and all that stuff.

42:54.200 --> 43:01.200
That was targeted for the U.S. and that's why you started seeing it streaming in places like D&B or other types of arcades.

43:01.200 --> 43:07.200
And that's pretty much, and then they had Premiere 2 recently and that's been a big U.S. distribution type thing.

43:07.200 --> 43:13.200
Pretty much, I remember talking to Jason Nenos about a year ago when I did a big interview for DDR Spot.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.200
Right, I remember reading that.

43:14.200 --> 43:20.200
And kind of off the record, we were talking about, well, how come you would never see economics or anything in arcade yet?

43:20.200 --> 43:27.200
He had told us, basically, it would have been a really bad move to put out, like during this whole lawsuit, to put out a new US mix.

43:27.200 --> 43:32.200
So, Andy Merrill would be saying, you know, what kind of strategy is that?

43:32.200 --> 43:36.200
you're being sued for something and you're already putting out a new arcade mix, that's

43:36.200 --> 43:38.200
not right. It wouldn't look good.

43:38.200 --> 43:42.200
Right. But now this kind of opens the door here, it looks like, sounds like, so who knows

43:42.200 --> 43:43.200
what might happen.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.200
Yeah, I'm guessing probably someone else is going to distribute the Konami game since,

43:46.200 --> 43:49.200
yeah, I guess Konami shut down its coin-oppa division.

43:49.200 --> 43:54.200
Oh yeah, I think it's a given somebody's going to step in and fill in that void and we'll

43:54.200 --> 43:57.200
see something coming from Konami in the near future.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.200
Possibly.

43:58.200 --> 44:06.200
Well see, maybe in the future we can get Jason on this show. We've got to work on that. We've got to try and smooth him to get him on this program at some point.

44:06.200 --> 44:14.200
Well, I've got pretty good, you know, friends with him that are going to talk to us on the spot right now while we're going through our new workouts and launches.

44:14.200 --> 44:25.200
I was about to ask, what's going on? Do you want to update us on DDR Spot? I keep forgetting you're a major part of the DDR Spot group, so do you want to say any plugs for DDR Spot? What's going on there?

44:25.200 --> 44:30.200
Yeah, our site is down for more maybe because we're going for a new launch right now

44:30.200 --> 44:36.000
We're basically tweaking a few things on the back end. We're targeting something to probably late this week

44:36.000 --> 44:38.840
We're about to launch everything. It's going to have a new look new feel

44:38.880 --> 44:39.440
Oh

44:39.440 --> 44:44.520
It's gonna have quite a few new goodies and a lot of things that haven't been there before and haven't been on really on any

44:44.520 --> 44:48.560
Other GDR sites one thing I have to ask you can say no comment if you want forums

44:49.080 --> 44:54.400
And try that again. Uh, we're looking at something alternate to forums actually, okay, I

44:54.400 --> 45:05.400
I don't know if I'm necessarily at liberty to say it right now, but I will say there will be a way you can interact with all members without having forums.

45:05.400 --> 45:11.400
There's a way to interact one-on-one with either the members, the lurkers, or with the staff itself.

45:11.400 --> 45:14.400
Alright, don't want to get you in trouble, so we'll just say tune in to win. Wow.

45:14.400 --> 45:20.400
Alright, so ddrspot.com coming back very soon, keep an eye on it. I'm sure they'll announce that everywhere.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.400
We'll mention it on this show for sure once we see this back up.

45:23.400 --> 45:26.400
Yeah, wonderful, and maybe we'll have the staff here sometime as well, too.

45:53.400 --> 46:00.300
Instant Love. It was basically a training stage in Beatmania 3. Now, you're gonna hear

46:00.300 --> 46:04.020
a lot of the talking from DJ Konami telling you how to play Beatmania, but concentrate

46:04.020 --> 46:08.540
on the background. You'll actually hear the lyrics for Let the Move being sung by a guy,

46:08.540 --> 46:13.860
and it's actually good. Alright, we'll see. And there's no, Let the Move, that's not in

46:13.860 --> 46:19.820
this at all. So what I'm gonna try to do is actually find, I believe it's DJ, oh shit,

46:19.820 --> 46:33.820
I'm going to try to find his CD. I think he actually put out a CD because I was visiting his website, and we're trying to find that, import it, and maybe there will be a clean version of Instant Love we can listen to, but I have no guarantees on that.

46:33.820 --> 46:34.820
But just listen to the background.

46:34.820 --> 46:39.820
Okay, so this is the one time we're going to make an exception and actually play Let Them Move, because this is a good version.

46:39.820 --> 46:46.820
Yeah, just try not to be annoyed by DJ Konami telling you how to play Beatmania, but just listen to the background and...

46:46.820 --> 47:00.680
For any of the old-school hip-hop heads, I think DJ Kanami looks straight up like a broke-ass

47:00.680 --> 47:02.320
that five freddy

47:02.320 --> 47:03.280
yeah

47:03.280 --> 47:06.160
after that uh... jamie has a special request for song you wanna give a little

47:06.160 --> 47:09.400
background about the fast well for anyone who's ever played in the of the

47:09.400 --> 47:13.400
ddr club mixes uh... you might remember i think the flow jack

47:13.400 --> 47:14.280
by inflow

47:14.280 --> 47:16.100
this is the mister drunk remix

47:16.100 --> 47:17.980
who i like anything with or drunk in it

47:17.980 --> 47:20.140
my favorite version of the phone ever

47:20.140 --> 47:23.120
all right so we're gonna hear those right now here on the orange lounge

47:23.120 --> 47:27.240
radio

47:27.240 --> 47:30.240
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!

47:31.240 --> 47:36.240
I know you all know beatmania, but I wanna go back and teach you the basics.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.240
Listen carefully and try to follow.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.240
The object will come down from the top.

47:42.240 --> 47:45.240
When it hits the red line, push the button.

47:47.240 --> 47:50.240
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

47:51.240 --> 47:54.240
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.240
First, hit the white keys.

48:05.240 --> 48:08.240
Now, hit the black keys.

48:08.240 --> 48:23.240
Okay! Now a combination of both white and black keys!

48:23.240 --> 48:34.240
Easy, huh?

48:34.240 --> 48:37.240
Alright, let's go on to the Scratch Game!

48:37.240 --> 48:41.240
When the objects reach the red line, Scratch!

48:45.240 --> 48:49.240
With a fact note, the technique is to Scratch fast!

48:58.240 --> 49:01.240
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.240
It's hard, but you can do it!

49:23.240 --> 49:25.240
Okay, effector time!

49:25.240 --> 49:29.240
And here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

49:29.240 --> 49:33.240
Look, way below, do you see the foot switch?

49:33.240 --> 49:36.240
That's the effect on and on switch.

49:36.240 --> 49:40.240
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

49:40.240 --> 49:44.240
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

49:47.240 --> 49:51.240
Hey, did you hear the variety of effects?

49:51.240 --> 49:56.240
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

49:56.240 --> 50:01.240
This powerful sound system's whooping, everybody!

50:01.240 --> 50:02.240
Ha!

50:02.240 --> 50:03.240
All right, gotta go!

50:03.240 --> 50:16.240
Knock me out with your fabulous sounds on this very little version of the speed mania!

50:16.240 --> 50:21.240
Ladies and Gentlemen.

50:21.240 --> 50:23.240
LADIES AND JUTTURES

50:27.240 --> 50:29.240
I GOTTA GO FLIGHT FINGERS

50:43.240 --> 50:45.240
Tell me that tomorrow won't go so soon

50:45.240 --> 50:47.240
I gotta get through to you

50:47.240 --> 50:50.240
Show me that tomorrow won't go so soon

50:50.240 --> 50:52.240
I gotta make that move

50:52.240 --> 50:55.240
Ain't nothin' more, won't go so slow

50:55.240 --> 50:57.240
It's nothin' I gotta do

50:57.240 --> 51:00.240
Ain't nothin' more, won't go so slow

51:00.240 --> 51:03.240
I gotta get through you

51:03.240 --> 51:08.240
Many midnight runs, sometimes I feel so blue

51:08.240 --> 51:13.240
I passed 100 like I never knew

51:13.240 --> 51:17.240
I close my eyes, pretend that you are here

51:17.240 --> 51:23.080
Oh, yeah. Let me feel the workflow till you disappear.

51:23.160 --> 51:23.980
Ohh yeah.

51:24.060 --> 51:27.920
I established order in this sector, guardian angel reflect the light, lyrically I own the mic.

51:28.020 --> 51:33.080
You slept the devil take the put, you established order in this sector, guardian angel reflect the light, lyrically I own the mic.

51:33.180 --> 51:38.320
You established order in this sector, guardian angel reflect the light, lyrically I own the mic.

51:39.080 --> 51:43.240
You established order in this sector, guardian angel reflect the light, lyrically I own the mic.

51:43.240 --> 51:46.240
I left the devil tape that I threw at your order in this sector

51:46.240 --> 51:48.240
Guardian angel reflect the light lyrically I own the mic

51:48.240 --> 51:50.240
You slept the devil tape that you ejected

51:50.240 --> 51:51.240
Want you, return you want to

51:51.240 --> 51:53.240
Hang with the one you dissed before and slam the presently

51:53.240 --> 51:55.240
And conjure up some hallucination

51:55.240 --> 51:57.240
Identify them stations where my vocals heard

51:57.240 --> 52:00.240
Count the total verbs, be flippin' at the local words

52:00.240 --> 52:02.240
My destiny, separate a to leave

52:02.240 --> 52:04.240
Forget Maybelline, I got no babies

52:04.240 --> 52:06.240
One of my shows, then your nose without antihistamine

52:06.240 --> 52:09.240
I'm in the future, emcees who misdemean as left to be

52:09.240 --> 52:11.240
History's a hoocha, think you spittin' at

52:11.240 --> 52:13.600
Think you spittin' at, I represent a different map

52:13.600 --> 52:16.140
Hip-hop diplomat, I've already seen a tip of that

52:16.140 --> 52:18.340
D.R.I.D., yeah, I'm original flowjack

52:18.340 --> 52:21.140
God glorify it, for the spiritual elitist crack

52:21.140 --> 52:23.840
Remain anonymous, my lyrics sound pitch astronomer

52:23.840 --> 52:26.040
Ear-tied apparel, third commandment before I die

52:26.040 --> 52:28.740
When you know tomorrow won't come so soon

52:28.740 --> 52:31.040
I gotta get through to you, fool

52:31.040 --> 52:33.740
When you know tomorrow won't come so soon

52:33.740 --> 52:36.040
I gotta make that move

52:36.040 --> 52:39.040
When you know tomorrow won't come so soon

52:39.040 --> 52:41.040
It's not that I've got to do

52:41.040 --> 52:44.040
You know tomorrow won't come so soon

52:44.040 --> 52:46.040
I gotta get through you

52:46.040 --> 52:51.040
I've been wondering what's gotten into me

52:51.040 --> 52:56.040
Those sweet words are hard to believe

52:56.040 --> 53:01.040
Stop playing games and let me let you know

53:01.040 --> 53:05.040
It ain't just what you show by why you show this

53:05.040 --> 53:07.040
This world will flow like there's no tomorrow

53:07.040 --> 53:09.640
I pastelate any track or verbiage I extract

53:09.640 --> 53:12.340
Expect a less for maxi, mums and cats be done with this illness

53:12.340 --> 53:14.240
I contract, I commit to act of subtraction

53:14.240 --> 53:16.940
A whack run, even snatch crumbs are financially bad munch

53:16.940 --> 53:18.840
You be messing with the rare specimen

53:18.840 --> 53:20.240
Whose vision is a danger?

53:20.240 --> 53:22.940
Just get your action and tangent off the track while I be ever changing

53:22.940 --> 53:25.140
You wonder where all these thoughts come from

53:25.140 --> 53:27.640
Verbal, the mind-toucher, fallin' for you like point on

53:27.640 --> 53:29.640
As I mime it, like it was vomit profusely

53:29.640 --> 53:31.240
Fart on the language, not excuse me

53:31.240 --> 53:33.440
As I enter my archives, I choose these methods

53:33.440 --> 53:35.640
But wish to carry out, whether by land or aerial

53:35.640 --> 53:38.640
Cause this kid cannot be stereo, talk out with brothers that marry him

53:38.640 --> 53:40.640
Right for harvest, new jack, but not a novice

53:40.640 --> 53:43.640
Caught as a hip-hop fan, blowin' away emcees like artists

53:43.640 --> 53:45.640
I promise, I ain't your average artist

53:45.640 --> 53:47.640
My thought is, look into God's redirection

53:47.640 --> 53:48.640
And not the goddesses

53:48.640 --> 53:53.640
When you are not lazy, use this reality

53:53.640 --> 53:58.640
Believe and care will set you free, yeah

53:58.640 --> 54:01.640
One can be sold on my own

54:01.640 --> 54:04.240
Two problems, three divides

54:04.240 --> 54:07.840
Two endless issues, every so often

54:07.840 --> 54:08.840
How'd you know?

54:08.840 --> 54:11.640
Tomorrow won't go so soon

54:11.640 --> 54:13.640
I gotta get through to you

54:13.640 --> 54:16.640
Tomorrow won't go so soon

54:16.640 --> 54:18.840
I gotta make that move

54:18.840 --> 54:21.840
Tomorrow won't go so soon

54:21.840 --> 54:24.040
It's something I've gotta do

54:24.040 --> 54:26.840
Tomorrow won't go so soon

54:26.840 --> 54:29.040
I gotta get through you

54:29.040 --> 54:34.320
And yo, you know how we do, it's C that either on the B-A-L

54:34.320 --> 54:38.320
So don't represent the meteorite, no proof, you know what I'm sayin'?

54:38.320 --> 54:43.320
Yo, right around now, DJ Hoori's in the mix, keeping you in constant suspense

54:43.320 --> 54:48.320
Yo, you said Junin in the sound of SAKURES, you know what I'm sayin'?

54:48.320 --> 54:51.320
Yo, and it goes a little somethin' like this, yo

54:51.320 --> 55:00.560
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

55:00.560 --> 55:04.600
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

55:04.600 --> 55:11.000
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

55:11.000 --> 55:12.440
Just go up the street and take a left.

55:12.440 --> 55:15.320
No, anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

55:15.320 --> 55:17.000
Will you be my neighbor?

55:17.000 --> 55:18.840
Won't you be my neighbor?

55:18.840 --> 55:20.240
Didn't that guy retire finally?

55:20.240 --> 55:23.880
meow meow what? at least he didn't die but

55:23.880 --> 55:28.240
I'd say he didn't die that's not an o thing that's an oh good thing

55:28.240 --> 55:31.640
but eventually he is and you just brought up that thought in my head

55:31.640 --> 55:35.240
we're all gonna... Melanie I'm sorry but we're all gonna die

55:35.240 --> 55:38.800
everyone's still traumatized captain kangaroo is gone so

55:38.800 --> 55:41.920
I mean we're mister green jeans I mean

55:41.920 --> 55:44.920
I know people still coming up to me asking where the heck he is

55:44.920 --> 55:49.440
no mister rogers did not die he's not dead yet someone on sesame street really recently

55:49.440 --> 55:53.440
I think the guy who played Gordon, I think he just died very recently.

55:53.440 --> 55:57.440
Not Linda the Death Lady, I hope. She was my favorite.

55:57.440 --> 56:01.440
Gordon died? Why is it always the brother that always got to get killed first?

56:01.440 --> 56:05.440
Another instance of a man keeping you down.

56:09.440 --> 56:13.440
You can address those cards and letters to Mel B.

56:13.440 --> 56:17.440
Remember, if you want the proof, go to BurtIsEvil.com

56:17.440 --> 56:19.440
Yes, it exists.

56:19.440 --> 56:23.440
Oh, they're reminding us about the HIV-positive Muffet.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.440
Little Miss Muffet! Dad on a tuffet!

56:26.440 --> 56:27.440
Little Miss Muffet!

56:27.440 --> 56:29.440
It actually has HIV!

56:34.440 --> 56:37.440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was very bad of me.

56:41.440 --> 56:46.440
Well, Little Miss Muffet should be choosy on which tuffet she's sitting on now, shouldn't she?

56:46.440 --> 56:50.520
She can't just sit on any tuffet just walks down the street and treats her to a nice dinner

56:51.040 --> 56:54.800
And who knows how many seats have been on that tuffet?

56:56.600 --> 57:00.920
She should have had that tuffet tested. She's learned how to squat on that tuffet.

57:07.480 --> 57:09.480
I'm sorry

57:09.480 --> 57:16.800
Oh, shit, we all need to breathe. I think I've actually attempted to play a song.

57:16.800 --> 57:21.120
Well, now that the show has grown to a complete double halt.

57:21.120 --> 57:25.560
DJ Konami, which is actually DCB under a new name, wants to warn you all that goat say

57:25.560 --> 57:26.560
sat on that tuffet.

57:26.560 --> 57:37.120
For those who don't know goat say all I have to say, that's goat say. That was me bending

57:37.120 --> 57:38.120
over and pretending.

57:38.120 --> 57:44.120
I don't want to... keep your ass on the chair. You just sit on your tuffet there.

57:44.120 --> 57:48.120
Keep your tuffets to yourself, bitch.

57:48.120 --> 57:52.120
Yeah, yes. Where were we?

57:52.120 --> 57:53.120
Tuffets.

57:53.120 --> 57:55.120
AIDS. Something about... no, anyway.

57:55.120 --> 57:58.120
The Muppet with HIV.

57:58.120 --> 58:00.120
Oh yeah, the Muppet with HIV.

58:00.120 --> 58:03.120
I actually have a healing vision AIDS mix. HIV mix.

58:03.120 --> 58:06.120
What? That sounds very politically incorrect.

58:06.120 --> 58:13.620
Oh yeah, it says this DWI will give you AIDS, and it's just a really crappy remix of Healing Vision and Max 300.

58:13.620 --> 58:20.120
They purposely made it bad and made the SEV file impossible just because they're frustrated with all the remixes, so...

58:20.120 --> 58:22.620
Oh, they just, they don't like the Healing Vision remixes, so they just want...

58:22.620 --> 58:28.120
They just don't like any of the remixes, so they just got pissed off and made, you know, HIV mix.

58:28.120 --> 58:30.120
Okay.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.620
Riiiiight.

58:31.620 --> 58:33.120
Riiiiight.

58:33.120 --> 58:36.740
We've got to give our cams taking too long to adjust, so I'm going to restart that cam.

58:36.740 --> 58:39.620
But what I'm actually going to do now, I think now's a good time in the show, let's play

58:39.620 --> 58:41.580
those interviews that Jamie got from last week.

58:41.580 --> 58:42.580
How's that sound?

58:42.580 --> 58:43.580
Yay.

58:43.580 --> 58:47.620
Now, I haven't even listened to these at all myself yet, so we're going to be hearing these

58:47.620 --> 58:48.620
live.

58:48.620 --> 58:51.660
If anyone wants to comment, just raise your hand and I'll pause it and we can make a comment.

58:51.660 --> 58:54.180
Okay, well first of all- Yeah, you've got to demo the-

58:54.180 --> 58:59.740
I've recorded over old interviews, so I'm really not sure exactly, and I think I had

58:59.740 --> 59:00.740
the pause button off.

59:00.740 --> 59:01.740
I trimmed it up.

59:01.740 --> 59:02.740
I trimmed it up, so everything should be okay.

59:02.740 --> 59:05.740
You have to explain why you sound really stone in the thing.

59:05.740 --> 59:09.140
I think I was like going on four hours of sleep,

59:09.140 --> 59:10.700
and I was really tired, and then I

59:10.700 --> 59:12.620
was traumatized by Stepping State.

59:12.620 --> 59:14.380
OK, so Stepping State did this to you.

59:14.380 --> 59:15.500
So if you have any questions, OK, there.

59:15.500 --> 59:17.140
The cam should be better now, so.

59:17.140 --> 59:18.780
I sound really retarded.

59:18.780 --> 59:19.800
Oops, wait.

59:19.800 --> 59:21.640
Actually, you're going to see an old picture

59:21.640 --> 59:22.640
on the camera real fast.

59:22.640 --> 59:24.980
It'll probably update soon, so just sit tight.

59:24.980 --> 59:26.460
Cam's working.

59:26.460 --> 59:30.140
OK, let's play these interviews, all right?

59:30.140 --> 59:43.140
This is the Orange Challenge Interviews for Sunday, September 7th, 8th, 8th, 8th, 8th.

59:43.140 --> 59:45.140
Just remember, stepping stage. It's all about stepping stage.

59:45.140 --> 59:47.140
I was so tired.

59:49.140 --> 59:57.140
This is the first of the interviews for Orange Challenge Radio, which, you know, we had the battery case off of the recorder, so it's kind of messed up.

59:57.140 --> 01:00:02.380
so we're gonna go ahead and try this again so go ahead and do over you know

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:07.420
once again we have someone who's no stranger to orange lounge interviews so

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:14.140
go ahead and state your info kon kiyoki see you step squad family second

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:18.940
interview for orange lounge and completely sober this time yes that's

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:24.340
necessarily a good thing is it no not really I actually have Jenny here who

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:29.820
gave me my email gave me her he's sober but the question is were you yes okay

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:34.060
just checking on my arm when I was drunk she claimed she didn't draw me but my

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:41.060
hand was a little hazy you had a comment on that I was in the one who drew the

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:45.260
squid on the back of your forehead I mean I drew the eyes on the back of your

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:51.060
neck I remember that people are still wondering what the hell that was who

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.060
Who was it that beat you over the head with my bat, anyway?

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.060
I was wrong, Kitty. She did not make it today, but she's here in spirit.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.060
Ah, yes.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:07.060
So, um, go ahead and, uh, you know, give your daily recap for our, uh, fun event today with our first step squad and et cetera.

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.060
Hmm. Well, let me see.

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:18.060
Considering I was probably the first one up at six in the morning, lack of sleep, next thing to being high, uh, we, me and Jay actually had to clean up the house a little bit.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:25.060
But then after that, 12 o'clock rolls around, Step Squad, RTF, and Otaku Outpost rolled out to the Holiday Bowl.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:32.060
From there, good times. We actually rigged the machine, so the last round, everyone got a strike.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.060
That was cool, but it's something they shut everything off on?

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.060
Yes.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:42.060
Yeah, they ran out of pins. So everyone who bowled rolled a strike.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:46.060
On the last one.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:51.060
Is that like the most ghetto bowling alley around that they actually ran out of pins?

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.060
It's super ghetto.

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:58.060
Scott's stepping stage, I think there's nothing that can go lower than that.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:03.060
They want a clarification as to what exactly this event is that you were at.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:15.060
Basically we had Cece down visiting from SoCal and we had Liz visit, well she lives in California but she was going to school

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:21.620
in Washington State. So they were both in town and we had a big gathering. I think it

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:29.300
started off as just step squad, but it grew. Okay. Guys. I wasn't bowling so I really wouldn't

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.960
care about that, but that sucked. I would have loved to see the picture of everyone

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.400
last frame, triple strike each. They should have done that for ours because mine were

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.220
just like, oh, we're bowling and I sucked. My score sucked. Well, maybe. Well, the thing

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.220
They ran out of time, so, yeah.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.220
Oh, well, I can't score anyway.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.220
Sniff.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:55.220
Anyway, we have another couple people with us, so, yes, you.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:02.220
So go ahead and state your name, everything, for our lovely, brilliant listeners.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:07.220
Hi, I'm Hattori Hanzo, and I'm...

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.220
Yes, Mel, very fast.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:13.220
There's just nothing like buttoning up your listeners to brighten your day.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.220
Those lovely, wonderful people out there that we adore.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.220
Well, we do love our listeners.

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.220
It's one thing to love your listeners. It's another thing to love your listeners.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.220
They're brilliant to you.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:29.220
Mel B just sent sloppy, wet kisses to you all.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:32.220
Soda right now, and I'm feeling all right.

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.220
And I see that as a Valencia orange soda.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:40.220
It is, and it's very good. You should try one.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.220
Is it your tasty beverage?

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:49.220
Well, since, you know, there aren't no other beverages to choose from, I think I'll just stick with the orange soda.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.220
That was the sound of a whap on the head.

01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:03.220
So, um, go ahead and then if you'll state your name and everything for both of us.

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.220
Jamie, quick, there's a whap on your head.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:13.220
By the way, I need to explain. We were sitting outside in the backyard in lawn chairs, just lounging, going, I'm tired.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:14.220
With a 40?

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.220
I'm tired too.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:16.220
With a 40?

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.220
I didn't have 40.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.220
Oh.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.220
But, you know, Hanzo had orange soda.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.220
Was it 40?

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:22.220
I had milk tea.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:27.220
No, it was more like a 16 ounce.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.220
If you want to.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.220
Hello, my name is Jin.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.220
Ever, I'm not male. I'm a female.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.220
That was weird. The tape did a funny thing there.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.220
The guy with the watch.

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.220
Yes, don't you know Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game?

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.220
I don't know.

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.220
Is it?

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.220
I'm a fighter reference. Thank you.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.220
What happened there?

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.220
Hey, excuse me. This is coming from the person who had the screen.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:05:00.220
I made a reference that said, don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:05.780
one game, and people got the reference. Who plays Puzzle Fighter? Me. Who plays Devilot?

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:13.420
Me. Devilot Super 8. Yes, that was one of my old AOL names. I smell the D9, like, 3rd

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:22.420
mix Korean gates, you know? You got the failed screen, like, what Mel B has on his signature.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:27.540
Uh oh! Care to comment? Care to comment? Oh, run that by me again. Here we go, let's hear

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:35.540
I smell a de-night like 3rd Mix Korean Gates, you know?

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:40.540
You got the failed screen like what Mel B has on his signature.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.540
He doesn't have that anymore.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.540
Any comment?

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:45.540
Hey man, what can I say? The world revolves around me.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:50.540
You can take anything in the world, you can take six steps and it comes back to you.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.540
Oh, like Kevin Bacon?

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.540
Yeah, but kosher.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:06:10.100
I think after Disney tourney everyone thinks the B stands for bling.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:15.740
The gate was the best thing ever, I'm not kidding, it's a clank and you know your

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.260
thread is locked.

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:23.100
So does anyone have any comments for listeners, anything?

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.100
Yeah.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.700
Conzo, keep talking your shit.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:30.100
I'm going to jack you like I jacked that ice cream truck earlier with Jay Kinetic.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.100
I missed that.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:35.060
I don't want to know how you're going to jack Conzo.

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.060
There's pictures.

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.860
Gary from RTF has them.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:38.980
Yes.

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:42.840
I just have to say that half of everybody who was in that house did go and hump the

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.060
ice cream man.

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.060
Explain now.

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:51.060
I didn't even go out there. I was like, oh, I have milk tea and 2DX, I'm happy.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.060
So I didn't even go out there.

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.060
You didn't hump the ice cream in?

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.060
No! I had 2DX.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:04.060
I fear. I fear. Greatly.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.060
I don't know what the hell this idiot's talking about.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.060
You were doing the solar run when we did it.

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:18.060
Yeah, you weren't here. Everybody ran outside and decided to rape the ice cream man.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.060
Then what does that have to do with me?

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.060
You missed it. You didn't get to join in on the fun.

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.060
I was, you got here.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:29.060
The black sheep. He was the one that was left out.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:34.060
You're just saying that because I'm black.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:39.060
Why make me cornhole your hair, damn it.

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:44.620
And this is the love of Step Squad here, and he loves it.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:52.020
This is a comment from the chat room right now, mmm, raping and ice cream.

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.340
I hope not.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:01.660
We have this on tape.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.700
This is the real world, Step Squad edition.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:09.020
On a closing note, Jamie, I'm waiting for Jay's birthday so we can roll up to Sacramento

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.020
We're having rum jello.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:43.020
It's a nice little room. It's a breeze.

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:47.020
How? He doesn't have...

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:51.020
Look at it!

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:55.020
What was that?

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:59.020
Run away!

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:03.020
We have another absentee. Well, you heard it here first on Orange Odd Radio.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:07.020
That was weird.

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:17.500
What did you get when you get sleep deprived people?

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.060
I should have deleted out the silence, but I didn't.

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:25.060
This is the second interview for Orange Lounge Radio, and go ahead and state your name, no

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.060
nickname.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.380
I had someone come about to fall asleep.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.560
I had actually taken a nap outside.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.320
This is Jamie doing NPR Orange Lounge, that's what this is, this is the NPR edition of Orange

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.320
I had already taken like a ten minute nap outside in one of the lawn chairs.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.320
A ten whole minutes?

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.320
A little idea for our listeners.

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.320
Oh Liz, I usually go by San Toki on message boards and such.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.320
And you're visiting from where?

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:57.320
Oh actually I live in California but I'm on summer vacation from school in Seattle.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.320
And you've been with Step Squad for how long?

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.320
Since March of 2001.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:12.320
Before there was DDR, well before it was all over the place anyway, I guess.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.480
That's been like four years at least.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:21.720
It has to be more than that because I was living in Alabama when I first knew you online.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:26.680
Oh my God, memories.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.800
So do you have any words to say for listeners?

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.080
What's your DDR experience?

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:39.260
My DDR experience isn't really that much. I used to just play for fun, but I haven't

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:48.700
actually been on a machine in a year or so. I usually play for fun when friends are around.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:53.500
I haven't competed in tournaments or anything. Do you have any other favorite games?

01:10:53.500 --> 01:11:01.900
No, not really. Usually puzzle games, actually. Do you have any final words for the listeners?

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:04.900
No, not really. Sorry.

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.900
Go to college. All of you. You're illiterate.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.900
Get an education because it's very important.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.900
You can't spend your whole life playing games.

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.900
I can.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.900
That was the last interview.

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.900
What's all this stuff?

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.900
Just leftovers.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.900
Is there anything in here?

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.900
Yeah, no, this is everyone trying to say goodbye.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.900
Goodbye, ladies.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:34.900
It was nice meeting you.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.900
Yeah, this is the goodbye, so yeah.

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.900
That was absolutely cool.

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.900
Hi, Orange Lounge.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:45.900
Uh, yeah, Sapporo was good, and Orange Lounge kicks ass and you should listen to it.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:51.900
Uh, SSF, RTF, uh, uh, Mountain Mics, A.S.S., and fucking Ozzy.

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.900
Dude, don't stop.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:58.900
All I have to say is, if Orange Lounge starts playing Fosse, I'd have to hurt someone.

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.900
That will not happen.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.900
Thank the gods.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.900
There is a god.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.900
Hello Orange Lounge Radio! Play more Orange Lounge songs, like every day, all the time.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.900
Yeah, we do.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.900
Yes!

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.900
Oh, and that brings an end to Jamie's interviews.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.900
Very random, but very cool. Thank you for getting that for us, Jamie.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.900
You're welcome.

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.900
We appreciate it.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.900
I took a nice long nap, but I got home.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:31.900
She's okay now. If you're worried about Jamie, she's eating a couple donuts, she's got the sugar back in her, she's okay now.

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:37.900
It's too bad I didn't record Jessica and I singing absolute on the way home.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:42.900
We were in full katimu style.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.900
I was singing a little bit of Summer Vacation there when somebody on one of the tapes there mentioned Summer Vacation.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:22.900
I've got a great career in radio ahead of me, don't I?

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.900
Rob is very edumacated.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.900
I dropped out of college, look at me now, I'm a star!

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:32.900
So smart, SMRT.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:37.900
Team smart, SMRT for life, yo!

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.900
Hooked on phonics, worked for Rob.

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:50.020
Hey, SMRT, let me think, Sacramento Metro Office Radio Talent, there we go, Sacramento

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.940
Metro Office Radio Talent, smart.

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:53.940
SMRT.

01:13:53.940 --> 01:14:02.700
He's a real fart-spiller, I mean, fart-filler.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.860
Oh boy.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:05.860
We've got an...

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:06.860
Dad!

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.180
Yes, I mean...

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.580
Happy birthday, Brad.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:16.820
Brad, come here. Come here. Hold on, we're going to get to that in a minute. Who wants

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:21.940
to give Brad his birthday spankings? Irene, let's administer those birthday spankings,

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:37.580
you're on air. Bend over baby. And close your eyes, it might hurt a little bit. Beep, beep,

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:52.580
Why are we doing this again?

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:55.580
Because it's great radio, alright.

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.580
Ready?

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.580
Here we go.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.580
And number?

01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.580
Yes, he's 21.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.580
Is that all please?

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.580
Okay, here we go.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.580
One.

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:03.580
Two.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.580
One.

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:05.580
One.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:11.580
Oh, why? Why me? Oh, God, no.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.580
What?

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.580
You like it at home.

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.580
Yeah, I don't get it. You like it at home.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.580
We had a group in there.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.580
I thought we were at 21 by now.

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:22.580
No, there are 40 left.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.580
Okay, okay.

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:24.580
There's like a bunch to grow on.

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.580
And one million to grow on.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.580
All right, all right, all right.

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.580
I think Brad's starting to like this.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.580
I was so close. I was.

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:34.580
You can stop grabbing me yet.

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.580
She'll spank the monkey later.

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:10.420
Papadopoulos magazine, weren't those the neighbors on Three's Company?

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:15.420
No, it was Webster.

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.540
The Papadopoulos lie.

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.480
This show's never going to get on track, I'm sorry.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.300
I'm trying to find an actual Polteri song to play in the background.

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.580
Oh, I found one, yay.

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:31.540
We have an interview with Polteri, yes, and this is about life in Japan.

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:37.820
Yes, for those who don't know, Paula Terry, she's the singer that likes to torture us

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:38.820
all in her DDR music.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:43.460
She can't hold a key!

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.820
Let's hear, uh, where are you from, Paula Terry?

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:47.820
Sydney, Australia.

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.420
You want to be, do you want to be Paula's voice?

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.300
Oh, you're going to do, oh, okay.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.980
Loki's going to do Paula's voice, and we're going to have, like, a simulated interview

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.980
here.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.980
Okay, here we go.

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.980
Okay, wait, wait, what am I reading?

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:58.980
We're going to be right here.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.980
You're going to be reading the non-bold stuff.

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:00.980
I'll do the bold stuff.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.900
So Paula, where are you from?

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.660
Sydney, Australia.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.780
And what brought you to Japan?

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:12.820
When I was in Sydney, I had friends who lived here, and at the time I had to travel each.

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:17.220
When I was a child, I lived in France for four years, so at that stage of my life back

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.300
in Sydney, I felt I wanted to travel again.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.940
Also, I wanted to know anything about Japan.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:28.300
I met these girls who had worked holidays in Japan.

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:35.300
worked in clubs, and you come up to them and say, well, you're a singer, they have foreign

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:40.300
singers in these clubs, you can get me a visa and make money, why not work in Japan? So

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:44.300
I went out and took the risk, and I've been here ever since.

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:48.140
Wow, that's really nice, Paula. Okay, now doing Paula's voice, the next question will

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:53.340
be Jamie. Everybody can do Paula's voice on one question, I'll do this. Okay, Jamie, I'm

01:17:53.340 --> 01:18:02.540
sorry Paula. How long have you been singing? Well, my mother is an opera singer and my brother

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:09.020
is like a classical guitarist, so I've been in the musical family. I love singing for

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:14.660
being a little girl but I really only started out to learn it when I was 16 and I skipped

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:19.580
a line. No, you got it. And my mother sent me an opera singing teacher. I love opera

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.580
Uh, but it wasn't for me. Ew.

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.580
When I was twenty, I decided to study jazz singing.

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:26.580
I really love funky jazz music.

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.580
Aw, play that funky jazz music, white girl.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.580
I like other funky things, too.

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.580
Okay, without doing the voice of Paula, we'll be Mel B.

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:38.580
So, um, how long have you been boinking Naoki?

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.580
I'm just kidding. Anyway...

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.580
Wherever, baby.

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:46.580
Where do you sing, Paula?

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:50.580
I've got the permanent booking at the Intercontinental Hotel on Tokyo Bay

01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:54.580
on Thursdays and Fridays from 7.30 PM to 11 PM.

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:56.580
I sing accompanied by a penis.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.580
They're talking about the toucan.

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:02.580
It's great. We play everything.

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:06.580
Then on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I play a ginsa at a piano ball,

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.580
which is a totally different style, a slightly older audience.

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.580
Who's doing Paula's voice next?

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.580
I don't know.

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.580
Oh, Melody, you pooper.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:18.580
Okay, we're back to Matt. Okay. What sort of things do you sing, Paula?

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:22.580
My repertoire goes from 30s to the 90s.

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.580
I see you've been smoking, Paula.

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:37.580
I have to keep up with the times. Recently everywhere I worked, people were requesting some songs from Titanic.

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:42.580
So I had to buy the CD and learn it. I also sing to carpenters.

01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:48.580
But I don't try to imitate the originals. I try to sing them in a different style.

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.580
That would be key?

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:55.580
To keep myself interested. I also really sing the standard jazz tunes like Summertime.

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.580
You can do that in any number of styles.

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:02.580
Okay. Next, Jamie doing Paula's voice again.

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:05.580
Paula, are you planning to stay in Japan?

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.580
Uh...

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:10.580
Right here, yes.

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.580
Uh, yeah, uh, I guess.

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.580
No.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.580
Yes, I am.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:21.580
I just finished recording of my first CD!

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:25.580
Which comes out September 2-3.

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:28.580
It's called, uh...

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:30.580
Just Breakaway.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.580
Uh, what's that mean?

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:39.580
So, I'm going to wait around and see how well that does.

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:44.580
I'm very pleased with the difficult smell.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.580
Stay longer and do what I say.

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:50.580
Paula, what do you like about Japan most?

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.580
Anything is possible in Japan.

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:55.580
It's an incredible place.

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.580
I'll do the next one.

01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.580
What do you dislike about Japan most?

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.580
Waking up with a bit of a hangover, having a bad hair day,

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.580
and not being able to blend into the background.

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:13.580
I just can't seem to be inconspicuous. It may be half paranoia, but I often feel that

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:16.580
people are staring at me.

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:22.580
Oh my God, you sounded like Vera, like from In Living Color.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:23.580
Hi.

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:26.580
I'm so embarrassed.

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:31.580
Paula, do you organize your CDs alphabetically?

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:37.060
Definitely not. I favor the total disorder. They're all in piles on the floor. I have

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:42.220
a drawback full of CDs. I don't play them often, but the ones that I like best are the

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.220
ones in the piles.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.220
Are we actually going to do this whole interview here? Let's see if we can find some interesting

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:53.740
questions here. Let's do this one. Okay, it's like a game show. You have to spend the rest

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:58.460
of your life trapped on the Yamanote line. You're allowed to take one book, one CD, and

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:02.860
and one luxury item, what would they be?

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:05.940
First I need tampons!

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:10.940
I need Naoki's hat!

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:20.940
I'd like to record a CD of my favorite songs from Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, right

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:37.380
What's the weirdest thing you've ever seen or experienced in Japan, Polteri?

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:41.300
A lot of weird things have happened to me here, but one thing in particular comes to

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.300
mind.

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:46.260
I was told this story by a friend who worked in a hostess club where I was singing.

01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:51.060
The hostesses were all blonde-gauging, and they said that there was one man...

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.060
WHATEVER!

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:53.060
GO FUCK YOURSELF!

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:58.500
Anyways, so they were saying that there was this one man who used to come in and beg them

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:04.300
to sell a piece of their pubic hair for, well, 10,000 yen per piece, so these girls would

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:09.540
go in and use the toilets and pluck hair out of the heads and rub it until they were curly

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:12.820
and look authentic, and then they would come back and sell it.

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.300
Paula, you're so clever!

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:51.300
trying to find its life again.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.000
And another little fun song and we'll be right back

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:47.700
Say, you know you gotta try a little harder

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:51.200
So you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.000
Smile, a little smile, let's enjoy the moment now

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.500
And just have a good time

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.500
A good time

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.000
Try it, baby, good

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.800
A little bit of love and gonna feel so fine

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.300
Is it really true to feel the same way too?

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:10.000
And hope we'll be together

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.600
Now, you know that I love you

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.080
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.880
When I'm skating, sinking up

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.000
Honey, what we call love

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.960
I still won't think of you at first

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.240
My family still comes above

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.280
If you wanna capture me

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.360
It's as simple as can be

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.440
Mr. Lemon said it, all you needed

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:43.400
Mr. Line said it, all you needed

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.420
Mr. Line said it, all you needed

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:49.880
Love, my love, my love, my love, my love

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.900
My love, my love, my love, my love, my love

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.260

That's just my baby daddy, he burnin' through my baby's head

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.020
She said, your baby daddy was locked up, but why?

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.020
The first day y'all was at the mall

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.020
You a liar

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.020
You a liar? Okay then what is named?

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.020
L'O-V-I

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.020
Yesterday you said it's named with James and it's the same

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.020
It must be your new boyfriend

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:55.020
How come your best friends told me the dude's name was T?

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.020
You better get it together cause when you're locked

01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.020
I'm like Mary, I'm knocked on fire

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.020
What you get up and get this dope?

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:03.020

01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:04.020

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:05.020

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:06.020
Who that is?

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.020
This is my baby daddy

01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:08.020
Who that is?

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:09.020
This is my baby dad

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.060
Who that is?

01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.060
Who that is?

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.060
Who that is?

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.060
Who that is?

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:18.060

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.540
Who that is?

What's up, man? You ready to go?

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.060
We know we gotta go to the store.

01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:26.060
Let's see that's a perfect exactly.

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:28.060
You know you ain't gonna get no pepper.

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.060
Well, while you there, get some milk.

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.060
If you don't hurry back, I'ma bid a deal.

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.060
Oh, baby, you can save the drama.

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.060
Let's all finna go and see my baby mama.

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:38.060
Who that is?

01:30:38.060 --> 01:31:05.860
In the description below, if you had any view on this...

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.000
leave a like and subscribe...

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Hello.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.060
There is a regular alphabet soup there at the end, just all these random letters getting

01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.060
shouted out.

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.980
I have no idea what any of them stand for, but I guess that's the beauty of DDR.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:17.980
That was Megumi.

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:18.980
Ah, okay.

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:19.980
I won't leave.

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:23.380
The DDR community, just one big alphabet soup.

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:29.960
Okay, we were looking at the, somebody wanted to see the statistics for the station during

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.960
the break.

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.740
We were taking a look, a lot more listeners in Japan recently, so a big hello to our friends

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:38.900
overseas in Japan who started the addiction, and it looks like we're just finishing it

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:44.140
if there's any truth to those rumors that DDR is dying in Japan, but somebody must still

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:48.260
love it over there. I guess 2DX is a very big game over there, still, as well as Guitar

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:51.980
Freaks and Drummania, very big, still, from what we hear. Of course, I guess we don't

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:57.980
really know. But if anybody over there wants to email us, if you can write in English,

01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:59.980
because I don't know much Japanese, but if you do send in Japanese...

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.020
Many people in Japan know English very well. It's acquired learning, first of all.

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:08.680
if they're going to understand me giving the email address, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:12.000
Give us a holler about what DDR and the Balmani scene is like over there. We'd love to hear

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.600
about it. I'm being brought food. Isn't that lovely?

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.400
It is beautiful and stunning. Is that all for me or are we sharing it? Oh

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:25.400
my gosh, thank you. Where's for the rest of us? We deserve food

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:33.280
too. Yeah, Ho's got to eat too, like me. So anyways, since you're eating and you're

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:37.100
you're eating. I guess I could do the sim scene update.

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.100
Sim update.

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:43.860
Okay. All right. Well, actually, we actually have some new versions of stuff out there.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:50.760
As you probably remember from my FU message of the week, DWI 203. It's brand new. There

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:55.080
is one feature, though, I absolutely love in it. It's the fact that every time you rebuild

01:32:55.080 --> 01:33:00.460
your song list, it exports a HTML file with your entire song list. So now I can actually

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:04.800
update my song list and post it so people can see how many damn songs I actually have,

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:10.520
which is one thousand two hundred and eighteen right now.

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:14.640
The chat room is saying Slinky in the chat room says StepMania Max 3 is coming out tomorrow.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.800
I don't know if that's BS or what, but...

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.840
I don't... Why would Slinky lie to us? He loves us. I don't know, but I play... Actually,

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:27.360
though, I have to give props to StepMania because it saved my party last night, because

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:37.360
Since, for some reason, I don't know what it is, but some versions of DWI, they don't work my pads, and they don't work with my visualizations in the background.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:48.360
So, I had to find something to work with my pads, and luckily I had a beta 6 of StepMania 5, I believe, or 3, or whatever, and it worked, and it worked well. I was very pleased.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.360
So, we played on StepMania all last night, and it was awesome.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.360
Other than that, DDRPC, two new characters have been released.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.360
Our fourth set of new characters, it was Riko...

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.360
No Pantsless Rage?

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.360
No Pantsless Rage.

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.360
No!

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.360
No Three Tented Emmys.

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.360
It was Riko and...

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.360
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Duck.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.360
Ah, some chick, I don't know.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.360
Riko and some chick.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360
Riko and his hoe, okay.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:20.360
So, that was that.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:25.100
and they have like white hair and look stupid whatever so that's some new stuff

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:36.340
there other than that other than that let's see yeah whatever Sylvia is ho

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:46.180
that's the same thing but um see last night party that was very fun we got

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:50.000
tell us about your little party while I shove chicken strips in my mouth okay

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000
A little party last night for my birthday. I had a little bimani party there. I got to play on the sim.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Some of the popular songs there were Break Your Neck from Busta Rhymes.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Peanut Butter Jelly in a baseball band.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yeah, Peanut Butter Jelly. They loved that remix from Turn Remix 2.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
That was pretty good. No, wait. No, that's not Turn Remix 2. That was something else.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Anyways, it's out there. There was also...let's see, what other ones?

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.860
for some reason they're playing secret rendez-vous all the time

01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:21.840
i don't know why that

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.680
um... another one heaven

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.480
they liked heaven that was fun

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.000
the steps to heaven were ass

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.500
because i didn't play the hard one but i played the other one

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.280
and they didn't sing over the music at all

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.760
they were ass

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.280
that's all but i like the song that was in tourney mix 2 so

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.400
i voted up

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.040
a poop

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.240
i'll be on that

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.480
big pile of feces so i assume that since tourney mix 2 has been judging for about

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.640
uh... close to couple weeks now

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.920
pretty soon will have results of who won that i don't

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.920
no i guess look for that uh...

01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:58.720
jimmy won

01:35:58.720 --> 01:35:59.680
you can't do it

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.660
i have that i have that they from the other room

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.680
okay

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.760
i don't everybody in second

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.420
uh... we'll see what else though

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:13.100
now there's a pretty cool routine that someone did

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.080
for uh...

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.380
macho duck

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:20.220
because me being retarded put the long version song with the short version steps

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:22.260
and so there's a nice two minutes of no

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:25.740
no steps at all so there's this guy running around the room and jumping off

01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:27.300
stuff

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:30.280
it was kind of funny to watch big cans part two

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.220
yeah something like that yeah big cans part two

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.840
uh... see other than that some news

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.340
just some reminders

01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:41.020
looks like a team guilo their site's coming up october first so look for that

01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:42.900
i think

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:48.900
I'm not sure what their actual address is going to be, because Team Gwylo got bought up by some guy, I don't know.

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:52.900
There's nothing there, but they bought the domain name, so who knows for that.

01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:53.900
DWI Insan-

01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:57.900
Okay, that's my FU of the week. Fuck you to cyber squatters, I hate that shit.

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:03.900
Unless they've got a valid use for the name Team Gwylo, they shouldn't be allowed to buy that domain name.

01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:08.900
Julia Roberts needs to take them to court, because she got her domain name and she knows how to do it. That's all.

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:09.900
That's all.

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.900
Okay.

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:15.900
Anyways, um, DWI Insanity is gonna be coming back up probably later this week, they said

01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:21.720
one or two weeks about a week ago, so I guess we can look for that, and that's pretty much

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.720
it for now.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.720
Whee!

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.720
Alright, cool.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.720
Thank you.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:32.720
Um, do you have something else to add, Chad?

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.120
I was gonna say, this kinda brings out an idea, let's talk about, like, various ideas

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.420
forget togethers kind of things like to get people together and when do stuff

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:44.300
what are some fun like ideas about that because there's this new thing they're

01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:48.920
doing in Sacramento called the freestyle Fridays and I don't I don't freestyle

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.780
very well at all so I've been paying too much attention to this but I said I'd go

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:55.100
watch sometime but I guess a bunch of the good freestylers in town trying to

01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.560
get together and just have some fun little challenges and things like that

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.580
what are some some fun ways to get people together or is it does it have to

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.820
be scheduled things could just be everybody just kind of convening at one

01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:08.340
place like the bar cheers. We used to have our big gathering when we were

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:12.220
trying to unlock stuff on max 2 before they put in the code. Uh-huh true. You

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:16.060
know which pissed me and a bunch of people off but you know that was

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:19.300
something that got the community together was that common goal you know

01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:22.540
there's other max 2 machines where people don't know how the machines work

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:28.820
well enough to put in the code I guess if you're retarded. There's all kinds of

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:33.540
there's mini tourneys there's our you know every so often bidmani party that

01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:07.540
As far as get-togethers, I guess, I'm for people like RTF Steps.

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.540
We've gone to a point where we like doing stuff, not just in the money.

01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:19.540
We like doing sports stuff, like we either have to take a game of basketball or we'll have a big football game, which we are actually coming up, which is coming up soon, I think in early October.

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:24.540
No, it's a fun thing to just throw people around instead of stepping on arrows, you know?

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:29.540
I liked the whole bowling thing from last Sunday.

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:33.700
Cool any other fun get-togethers you guys have been doing that have been Bimani related

01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:39.260
Well, not last trip, but a couple trips ago doing the whole Cuzar thing

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.860
That was back in the day where we used to go down to

01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:46.900
You know to Milpitas and Sunnyvale to go play the other Bimani that we didn't have up here in Sallis

01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:50.420
Now we kind of have them all. Now it's like whatever and even though they're not the best ones

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:55.900
They're still you know, we got them. So yeah, so it's pretty much all the same stuff now except Disney Radio

01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:57.900
We don't have Disney Radio. Who cares?

01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:08.080
We definitely need to get people together, but we need to have another team sack attack

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.300
on a various Cuzar.

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:12.300
This is a national show.

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.120
We've got people listening from all over.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:19.220
It's really cool to get people together and just make sure there's no drama.

01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:21.900
Anybody that's going to cause drama in your group, get them out.

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:27.020
You know, why don't they just do like, that'd be pretty cool, is you know they have like

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.420
hacker conventions and conventions for everything?

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:31.420
What about BimaniCon?

01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:34.060
Okay, this is a good topic.

01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:37.740
Why hasn't there been a big national Bimani convention yet, do you think?

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:41.260
You think it's because the tournaments kind of take care of that on a smaller scale, so

01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:42.980
there's no need or desire for something national?

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:47.540
Do you think it's just because the Bimani audience is mostly, now I know just about

01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:51.420
all of us, in fact, yes, all of us in this room are exception, but the Bimani community

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.140
is largely a high school base, which can't really afford to take the time to travel out

01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:58.220
of town for a weekend. What do you think the reasons are behind that?

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:02.780
First and foremost, I've been going to conventions for seven years now. Longer than that, though,

01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:08.100
if you count some of the other stuff I've done. When you go to a convention, there are

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:13.540
major, especially like the ones I've been going to, sci-fi, fantasy, anime conventions,

01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:18.140
you have your costumers, you have your gamers, you have your dealer's room, and I don't think

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.640
there's enough, you know, Beymani-related merchandise.

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:21.640
Red Octane!

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:27.280
It would be, yeah, basically video game stores in there and you couldn't do, I think, a convention

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:34.240
on just Beymani alone without, you know, without having it Beymani Plus, you know, as far as

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.800
a convention setting goes.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.840
I mean, it's not like you can sit there and watch, you know, go to a room and watch, you

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.040
know, movies of people playing DDR or, you know, like you have movie rooms at anime sci-fi

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.040
conventions or...

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:52.080
You'd have a room that's like, oh my God, it's me, Jason, you know us, and Mel B.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:59.640
I think my importance level has just shot down 60 notches.

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:08.040
I don't think for Baymani alone, as far as a convention setting, that it would be enough.

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:12.320
You could maybe have your little, small get together.

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:18.320
If it was something associated with, say, the release of a new game, you know, something

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:23.480
press-related, that might draw a crowd, I think, but you couldn't have, like, Bimani

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.480
Con every year.

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.240
I don't think that it would be big enough.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.960
Okay, well then maybe they could, instead of just Bimani, have, like, a music gaming

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.960
convention or something like that, because then you have Bimani stuff, you've got, you

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:37.240
know, the Pump It Up, the Parappa frequency.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.120
Yeah, all the music games, you know, Parappa and all that.

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:47.120
Well, there is Classic Gaming Con that happens in Las Vegas.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.120
That's cool.

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.120
That's cool.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.960
I guess if Classic Gaming Con can get pulled off.

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:55.740
They also have the betas, the prototypes, you know, old games that were supposed to

01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:59.420
come out that never did come out, and I think that basically anything that was coming out

01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:07.120
for Beimani has come out except for, you know, S.M.A.M.I.X., the S.M.A.P. one.

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.980
There's a group called S.M.A.P.

01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:15.300
In Japan, there's basically like the Japanese version of Minuto, actually, and they had,

01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:21.180
I know very little about this, but there was supposed to be a DDR version or something

01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:22.180
featuring them.

01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.300
You know, like there's Dreams Come True and that, but it never goes away.

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:31.900
Which, by the way, the, not Dreams Come True, what's the other, True His Destination, that

01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:34.100
has to be the worst bimonium I've ever played.

01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:37.060
I mean, I like some of the music, don't get me wrong, but just the interface and everything,

01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:38.060
I didn't care for it.

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:39.060
I just want to share.

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:44.620
Since I do have all the Dreams Come True stuff and True Kiss Destination, I have to say,

01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:46.840
all of those suck.

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.840
They both suck.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.340
They're just awful.

01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:51.540
All their music is just very awful.

01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:58.700
I mean, aside from Sexy Planet and, like, Self-rated Night, they all suck.

01:43:58.700 --> 01:43:59.700
I liked Africa.

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.140
That's the one song I liked on True Kiss Destination.

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:02.140
That was a cool song.

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:04.420
Okay, but they've got one song called The Monster Song.

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:12.140
The monster is coming. It's just like so awful, but like, yeah, OHA is pretty fun. I mean,

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:18.100
but other than that, it's just crap. However, the meaning of Future Dreams Come True is

01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:23.600
pretty cool. You know, I don't know. I guess maybe you could, but I'm thinking in terms

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.820
of the broad spectrum of different conventions I've been to, you know, I don't think you'd

01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:34.060
have enough to make anything larger than, you know, a one day convention. I don't think

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.060
it would be anything.

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:37.660
So tournaments are pretty much as big as it's gonna get.

01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.780
I think so.

01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:42.500
And then we could go back to that national tournament talk, but I think we even talked

01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:43.500
about that.

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:47.180
Actually, I think that was the talk last time Elby was here, we talked about that.

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:50.180
Just probably wouldn't be big enough, unfortunately.

01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:54.620
You'd have to have huge prizes to entice people to want to fly all the way out to, you know,

01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:58.140
Las Vegas, Bay Area, wherever you would choose to hold the tournament.

01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:59.780
Just I don't know if it's possible.

01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:04.400
It's not so much about incentive and prizes, but it's also I mean thing a lot of people

01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:09.580
Overlook is that you need a lot of manpower everywhere people who are all on the same stage

01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:13.260
You know on the same level knowing about how to run attorney how to you know

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:18.420
Clean up with rules that are fair to you know, this region that region whatever and right now. I just don't think

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:24.760
We're quite at the level of networking where we can have a bunch of arcades all in sync all on the same page

01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:25.780
Getting it all together

01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:30.780
I'm not saying it can't happen, but there's just a lot more things people overlooked at

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:34.780
have to be taken into account for such a thing to happen.

01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:38.780
It would definitely take a lot of work, and I don't know that many people would be willing to do it.

01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:42.780
Twin's got a good idea for incentive. Have it a strip DDR competition.

01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:44.780
I'll judge.

01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:47.780
I'll judge, guys. I'll judge.

01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:54.780
Also, another suggestion to make the convention more popular is to be a Bomani slash hentai convention.

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:59.660
that would that would definitely well then again isn't that what that would be

01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:05.180
SSR strip strip revolution well you know I'm a Expo basically they had an arcade

01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:09.780
that was totally Bemani dominated you know in one of the little convention

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:13.460
rooms at the Hyatt you know the the I'm a conventions are almost turning into

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:17.060
pseudo Bemani convention suit because there's you know all these people in the

01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:23.460
dealer's room selling like I bought at least two of my I have at least three

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:28.540
Bimani related products that I've purchased at Anime Expo, one of them being my second

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:36.540
mixed stepbook and a dance pad and like one of my versions of DDR I think.

01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:40.380
I think it was one of them or the other, I don't know.

01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:43.380
I have like a ton now, so.

01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:47.260
Okay, well I think we're going to take a really quick break and then we're going to come back

01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:49.300
and we're going to wrap up the show.

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:50.300
So...

01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:51.300
Wrap it up and what?

01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:56.300
We're going to wrap it up and we'll be right back.

01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.300
What are we going to play in the break?

01:46:58.300 --> 01:46:59.300
Let's play one of your mixes.

01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:01.300
You want to tell me a mix you want to play?

01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.300
Or not one of your mixes, but one of the mixes you brought.

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:06.300
Tell me which one you want to have the listeners hear.

01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.300
Yeah, actually what I was going to do is introduce this one.

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.300
Back in Fifth Mix they had a competition, I guess.

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.300
I haven't really heard much about it, for a Paranoia remix.

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:18.300
And this guy who goes by the name STM won that competition.

01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:23.300
Well, I happened to find his website, and he has a piano ambient version of Max Unlimited.

01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:28.300
Now, you have to listen to the background there to fully get all of it, but you will catch some of what it is.

01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:33.300
But just listen to it, it doesn't sound anything like you've heard before for Max Unlimited.

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:40.300
All right. Enjoy. Here we go.

01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:35.300
You

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:10.300
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Bongo demands it!

01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:34.300
Polis Radio.

01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:35.300
I'm the co-host!

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:36.300
I can't shut up!

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.300
Smirt.

01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:46.980
Um, a lot of mixed reaction in the chatroom, um, kinda, mostly positive, kinda depressing

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:47.980
though, don't you think?

01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:50.340
That's almost kinda, I don't know, the way it was, it just kinda...

01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:51.340
I just feel like throwing myself off course.

01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:54.860
I mean, Max Unlimited is depressing enough as it is, because I can't pass it, but you

01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:55.860
know...

01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:56.860
I just couldn't stare at it.

01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:01.420
Well, I can on base if it hurts, but, even in the chatroom, they said, Orange Lounge

01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:07.120
made me sad today. We're sorry. We love you! Just remember Little Miss Muffet sat on the

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:14.120
tuffet. Where's my red? I was just commenting in the middle of the song. It was funny because

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:20.000
Mel B was sitting here reading scripture during that little passage. Would you like to share

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.600
a little bit of that with us here, Mel? Would you like to share some of your voiceover talent

01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:30.600
with uh... the max

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:37.920
she'll see

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:40.360
they'll be

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:43.720
nine o'clock i guess

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:44.920
very pretty thank you

01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:47.080
uh...

01:53:47.080 --> 01:54:00.240
That's kind of like the 5'9 piano version we have in Rotation on the Bahmani Music and

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:04.600
More program, which is always playing on the stage when we're not here.

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:06.360
Pretty sad remix of that, too.

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.400
So is Bahmani getting all depressed?

01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:10.800
Is it the angsty phase?

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:13.520
Is it the suicidal goth phase of Bahmani?

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:18.520
It will stay angsty as long as Polteri keeps singing.

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.420
Everybody will want to just slit their wrists after listening to her.

01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:25.520
At least we have Silhouette of My Mind, and that makes me happy in a sad,

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.400
MacGothy way.

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:29.520
Yeah, Silhouette of My Mind is another little slit-your-wrist song there from

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:34.080
Imani. That is a happy song if you listen to the lyrics. Yeah, it's a happy song, but it sounds really...

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:39.620
I'm happy being up by myself. I'm happy being sad.

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:46.620
I am quite enthusiastically upset.

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:50.700
I guess we're going to wrap up the show now.

01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:55.260
So, any final thoughts from everybody here in the room?

01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:56.360
I have donuts.

01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:57.620
You have donuts, right on.

01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.260
Matt, Logie?

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:02.180
I don't like Paula Terry.

01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.420
Neither do I, it's okay. She scares me.

01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:09.500
Bradley, do you have anything to say?

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:13.340
Special guest Mel B, anything you want to say?

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:16.380
I had no idea DJ Konami sounded like Dick Vitale.

01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:19.300
Either way, I think he's dope.

01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:19.900
Right on.

01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:23.140
And Sharks Girl, Mel D, anything you want to say to our listeners?

01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:23.980
Yawn.

01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:24.940
Yawn.

01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:29.060
I've driven like 280, 300 miles today so far.

01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:30.180
I just have to drive home.

01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:33.020
You've got two more hours to go.

01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:34.460
And I've got to drive tomorrow.

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:37.140
I get to drive to Frisco tomorrow, so that'll be fun.

01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:38.940
Whee!

01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:41.100
okay uh...

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:43.560
uh... what else out of those one other quick thing i want to say for the show

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.860
is over and now it's on my mind

01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:48.460
it's let your mind

01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:51.840
actually had a quick comment chara someone who wrote something about a

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.820
glow sticks and goes being in a

01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:56.940
freestyle routine yes funny enough i don't know if i mentioned this before

01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:00.940
but when i was an Omaha freestyle tourney uh... back in uh... april

01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:02.380
point of earlier this year

01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:05.460
someone did do a holistic routine with uh... goes in

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:07.960
funny enough to build within fifteen seconds

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:11.720
Somewhere I believe justice was served.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:15.560
That's kind of sad in a way. I'm still not sure that anything involving lights

01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.040
and DDR is going to top Fuzzy Hat with candles on, uh,

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.320
Healing Vision.

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:25.320
And the number 420 either.

01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:29.080
Oops, I gotta switch CDs here real fast. Somebody fill.

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:35.080
Fill, fill, fill-er, fill-er, fill-er, fill-er. Who's Phil?

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:40.360
Bimani is cool, keep playing, right?

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.000
This DDR sucks!

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.200
That really bugs me, I can't think of a better one to say. We are in joy, why aren't you?

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.360
We expect you and I to play again.

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:52.120
And now, new from Konami,

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:55.160
the Polteri sings the classics!

01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:56.600
Oh yes!

01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.040
Such wonderful...

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:06.040
Such wonderful songs.

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.520
Move!

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.480
Move!

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:13.540
Oh yes, that's

01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:16.460
Shine Get!

01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:19.980
I think that's an appropriate note to end the show on. Shine Get!

01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:24.460
