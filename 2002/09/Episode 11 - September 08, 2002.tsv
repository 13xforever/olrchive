121661	122721	Matt, also known as Loki.
123241	123802	Hey, everyone.
124402	127523	And, of course, as always, we're joined by some other in-studio friends.
127703	129263	Actually, we're down to one tonight.
129923	131044	We got Bradley in the house.
131104	131504	Say hello.
131604	132144	Hello, there.
132764	141847	And everybody else is busy this week, apparently, now that school's back in session, although most of the people on this show are out of high school already, with the exception of a couple.
141887	147989	Dave and Paul are still in high school, but like Brad and Irene, they had a visitor coming in from out of town, and Jamie had to go to another event.
148009	148909	We'll get into all that later.
149489	152230	Anyway, this is episode number 11 for September the 8th of 2002.
152690	154751	And we might get some more guests later.
154811	157212	There's rumors that some people might show up later as the show goes on.
158812	162074	We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
162754	164755	And any other opening thoughts from the people in the room?
165735	165955	No.
166415	167215	All right, fair enough.
167336	171277	Let's get some music and we'll be right back with Orange Lounge Radio live.

370075	381326	Don't cry, I don't even know what true solitude is I'm still holding a drop of tears in my pale petals
593237	597980	From Step Squad to Orange Labs, this DDR sucks!
598421	603844	Holla, Holla, Holla, Steppin'!
603864	610028	T-T-P-O I have no idea what half those little acronyms mean.
610609	611529	Am I just uncool?
612410	612490	Uh...
613379	614459	I don't know what they mean either.
634105	635866	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
660120	660620	So what else?
660640	661940	What were we talking about during the break there?
661980	666541	During the break we were kind of talking about songs that have been released for simulators lately.
666861	672722	And you've been looking... Now for those that don't know Matt, also known as Loki, he's really big into the simulator.
673222	677983	For those that don't know what a DDR simulator is, dance with intensity, step mania, things like that.
678083	680183	Things that will emulate DDR on your computer basically.
680223	681324	Or simulate, I should say.
681624	685544	Some people get on my ass for not clarifying the difference between emulate and simulate.
685944	686985	But, you know, whatever.
687025	688405	It's DDR on your computer basically.
689065	689265	But...
690094	694850	Loki really big into this, likes to download every single freaking song he can find and play them all.
695746	696106	What's going on?
696126	697307	Give us a sim scene update.
697347	699269	Tell us about some stuff you've been looking for recently.
699709	700370	Well, let's see.
700450	709377	Recently, especially at my job, I suppose I should be actually doing real work at my job, but instead I exploit their T1 line.
709737	710117	Right on.
710378	716022	And so lately I've been actually searching some of the smaller Japanese sites.
716282	721666	You know, the ones that you can't understand a thing that's on them, but you see, you know, song files with BMS stuff.
722347	724368	Anyways, some of the stuff I've actually found...
725269	725609	and so on.
748442	760055	Okay, there's a, I forget which site I saw it on, but there's some guy that's actually doing basically like a mix, you know, with a bunch of different songs he's going to be releasing, and they're all Christian music.
763078	767583	What was the comment there from the little stuffed ferret or whatever the heck this thing is?
768083	769024	I have no idea.
773061	777124	Anyway, so there's going to be a DDR God mix coming out soon, basically.
777264	778105	Yes, exactly.
779526	782228	It's very scary, but... Jesus Christ, it's DDR!
782869	786231	Hey, well, I've already got that Paranoia Catholic, so there's the start.
787172	787492	What else?
787892	789293	Paranoia Catholic?
789934	790234	Yes.
790714	796939	There's a Paranoia Catholic... There's tons of Paranoia mixes out there that we don't even know about.
797662	798162	They're out there.
798182	800203	They actually have a list on there.
800223	808627	If you actually search under Yahoo or something for Paranoia and then maybe DDR, they'll actually have a website that you can pull up a list of every single Paranoia ever made.
809127	811108	All the remixes that people have done that are fan-made.
811268	812869	As if you needed more Paranoias.
813169	815570	And they have links to the actual step files, too.
815830	816090	Really?
816130	816890	Where you can download them.
817211	817991	So that was kind of cool.
818311	820452	Do you dance little crosses in the Christian mix?
820472	822493	Just kind of like up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right.
822553	827355	No, it's just instead of some of the orchestra hits, you have God, God, God, that kind of stuff.
828083	830993	Like Madonna in a prayer going, God, God.
831914	833634	No, not quite, but anyway.
834115	840676	Other things, Bimani Ruler, Dave, actually he had a few files, eight more files that he was releasing.
840956	843357	There are some of his older stuff that look really awesome.
843697	847958	He's done some of the Parapara music by Hero Beat and My Sweet Banana and that kind of stuff.
848358	851118	Plus, there's a few other ones that you can actually get right now.
851178	853499	He has Max Enigma, which is in Tourney Mix 2.
854179	856860	Is that like Max mixed with Enigma music or something?
857260	857420	No.
857500	858060	By that band Enigma?
859100	865744	He made it with the key sounds from Max 300 and 2DX Sims.
866264	868506	And actually, I recognize most of it in there.
868726	870607	Most of it is just the key sounds from that.
870767	872448	And he just made his own mix out of it.
873888	878891	Something similar to what I was going to, but I got pissed off with it and decided not to.
878931	880372	There's another one he's also released.
880772	884454	There's a link on DDR Maniacs in their boards.
884494	885735	They've got one for Gravity.
886155	889798	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
909213	911274	Let's not make DDR 2DX.
911574	914715	I mean, this is pretty much what they're doing is making like 2DX.
914855	916595	Well, that's how they're making it harder.
916695	925138	I mean, how do you make DDR steps harder without getting just more convoluted and more like 2DX style step patterns?
925178	926218	I mean, it's getting hard.
926898	934860	The freeze arrows are one way of doing it because the freeze arrows will screw you up on songs like Ordinary World where if you don't spin or do a little trick with your feet, you're not going to hit them all.
935100	937321	Granted, you know, they are hard, but they do go with the music.
937810	940370	They go with the music perfectly, so I give them that.
940791	941291	That's cool.
942031	946132	I'm still trying to get the other six or so files I'm missing.
946152	955553	I actually have a deal with the webmaster at DDR Mania X. I was going to send him some anime, and he was going to send me a burned copy, a CD with them on there.
956253	959094	But unfortunately, there's been some problems with me sending it to him.
959734	963195	I hear we have a lot of fans of the show in the DDR Mania X chatroom, so hello!
963275	963935	It's all of you.
964075	964375	Love ya!
965407	965927	Big kisses.
966287	967668	Yeah, I hear they hate the show.
969629	970189	I'm surprised.
970210	970850	Yeah, what can you do?
971390	973511	I mean, I don't even know if they've listened, but whatever.
974192	976833	They hate the show, so much for that.
978214	978994	We all hate this show.
979334	985037	Other than that, sim-wise, I mean, no updates as far as DWI goes.
985397	989760	Step Mania, I heard there's a Beta 6 out there somewhere, but I haven't played it and don't really care to.
990900	992161	I've given up on Step Mania.
993056	1000079	I like Step Mania personally, but, you know, I don't really play DDR Sims because I just can't do DDR on my fingers.
1000099	1000659	It doesn't make sense.
1000899	1004741	And really, when I'm playing DDR at home, I'll do the official Konami one.
1004841	1007102	I know you want to ask why the hell would I play that.
1007682	1009222	That's why I can play with the pirates.
1009602	1009803	Arr!
1010863	1012063	The new DDR pirates.
1014292	1021435	Yeah, and for those who didn't hear, the new DDRPC characters, they've been releasing characters every other week or so.
1021775	1030099	The most recent characters they released, Elliot and, I forget the name of the other ones, started with C. I'm sure Charum will fill me in.
1030519	1032260	They're pirates, they're two pirates.
1033161	1039003	The first one were a couple of nightclubs, the second one were kind of, I don't know, dressed like cowboys.
1040204	1042405	No, the cowboys are the hidden ones in the game.
1043471	1047675	The other ones they released were kind of like, I don't know, they had a unique style to them.
1047695	1051478	They wore those hats on their heads that cover your whole head type thing.
1052138	1053279	Now they've got pirates out.
1053299	1056441	What I want to know, though, is when are we going to get pirate music in DDR?
1056622	1058403	I mean, when are we going to have it?
1059704	1061545	What exactly is pirate music?
1061585	1064107	Like the theme from the Pirates of the Caribbean or something?
1064628	1066629	Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
1068491	1070733	Yo ho ho, argh, get off me pad, matey.
1071633	1072394	Yeah, stuff like that.
1073775	1074215	I don't know.
1074756	1078840	But, um, yeah, sim file stuff, there is tons of it out there, you just gotta find it.
1079020	1093733	I might, if time permits, one of these days, just actually link to all these sites that have really cool stuff on them, and, you know, throw that out there, but in the meantime, I'm trying to get the largest collection on the internet, and one person's beaten me so far, but that'll be, uh,
1094997	1095698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1115560	1122584	Captain Jack, you know, seriously, I've actually gotten a lot more of his music that's in there.
1122724	1123384	It's all the same.
1124205	1125585	Well, so is all of the erotic songs.
1125606	1129227	Like, literally, I have a new erotic song that's just a copy of an old erotic song.
1129648	1135871	An old erotic song from the first couple albums was called Sex on the Phone, which is a pretty well-known erotic song outside of DDR.
1136271	1141394	They have a new one on the latest album, or no, actually, I don't think it was the latest album, but the one before it, called Tempt Me on the Line.
1141634	1142775	It's the same thing.
1143295	1145738	Almost the exact same melody, too, if you listen to it or something.
1145758	1146678	But it's still cheesy.
1146719	1149741	I've got his... What was it?
1149781	1150822	Not Take Me Out to the Ballgame.
1150862	1152584	I've got one that's School's Out.
1153325	1153765	That one.
1154546	1156348	Which isn't that School's Out for Summer.
1156368	1157108	It's just another one.
1157148	1159150	And I've also got one called Secret Agent Man.
1159971	1162393	But it's not... It's not the Austin Powers Secret Agent Man.
1162413	1163334	I was hoping it was.
1163354	1165636	I was like, oh, that'd be sweet, but no.
1166497	1167118	Unfortunately not.
1167178	1170463	Bus Stop would probably do a remix of Secret Agent Man.
1171224	1172045	Oh, very good point.
1172185	1174208	An artist that sounds the same all the time.
1174448	1176631	Three words, or four words, Bye Bye Baby Balloon.
1178574	1180036	Artists that sound the same all the time.
1180763	1183044	Yeah, yeah.
1183744	1184004	Anyways.
1184204	1186465	Let's go to the FU of the week.
1186505	1190066	This is the big fuck you of the week that Jamie always likes to do when she's here.
1190086	1192587	But unfortunately, she's not here this week.
1193007	1195728	So we have to fill in for her with our fuck yous of the week.
1195748	1197768	And I allowed the chat room to participate this week.
1198129	1200769	They sent me all their various fuck yous over private message.
1200789	1202330	And I haven't even opened them up to read them yet.
1202350	1205611	We're just going to read them live on air and see if they're stupid or what.
1206269	1207930	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1231772	1234715	Fuck me, I'm an asshole for not finishing that intro, sorry.
1235155	1238198	And also for not doing a damn thing on the webpage, that's my bad.
1238238	1244663	I was hoping to get the webpage fixed up and all prettied and updated a lot, because it's kind of out of date.
1245824	1251589	But I didn't get around to that either, so I'm sorry, and a big fuck you to me for messing that up.
1252210	1253671	Did you have a fuck you of the week, Matt?
1254552	1257354	Well, I don't know, because this is in my music, obviously, so...
1260575	1261757	Oh gee, that's better.
1262998	1263559	Let me see.
1264119	1268204	Yeah, FQ to the... Now, granted, I love QZAR.
1268965	1272109	I love the Entertainment Zone because it's QZAR that's relatively close.
1273271	1274412	But goddamn, they're lazy.
1274792	1275073	I mean...
1275928	1277930	Seriously, they're very lazy.
1278170	1281333	I used to work at QZAR, so I know how lazy you can be at that job.
1281873	1284576	Did you used to be the guy that would stand there and read out the rules?
1284856	1285997	Yes, I was.
1286357	1288659	I wanted your job so bad when I was in high school.
1288699	1289360	Seriously, okay.
1289780	1292582	Here's basically what the job consists of at QZAR.
1292903	1296366	You sit on your ass in the office talking to the manager while someone's doing a brief.
1296706	1298608	When your brief comes up, you go do the brief.
1299208	1301011	and then you go help people get in the arena.
1301051	1304917	Sit down, watch people play in the arena, make sure everyone gets out of the arena and go back and sit in the office.
1305117	1305979	It's a lot of sitting.
1306259	1306640	That's it.
1308082	1309444	You don't go out there and arrest players?
1310245	1312108	Oh, well you can, but what's the point?
1312509	1313771	No one really cares anyways.
1314369	1316791	But, yeah, because they wouldn't order me a pizza.
1316831	1321055	So I had to walk around the corner to get a delicious pizza and go get pizza there.
1322016	1322496	That sucked.
1323417	1324478	So a big fuck you to Cusar?
1325318	1327240	Uh, to the Cusar employees.
1327440	1328281	Alright, fair enough.
1329642	1334966	I've got a ton of chatroom FUs to get to, so I've got to get to the FUs in the chatroom.
1335687	1344593	If you want to join our chatroom, just join any other side IRC server like irc.eggheads.org and join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
1344613	1349677	And that's the same server that a lot of the big Bomani channels are on, like DDR Freak and 2DX Style and all those.
1350157	1351540	are also on that same server.
1351760	1353403	One more.
1353483	1356229	An FU to Nickelodeon for cancelling Invader Zim.
1356389	1356769	Again?
1357190	1359194	Well, it's actually gone for good now, I think.
1359254	1360076	It was on this morning.
1361107	1362007	Well, damn it.
1362287	1364028	They keep changing the time around.
1364148	1366408	F you to them for changing the time around all the time.
1366528	1369189	I have to stop the music because bless you to TiVo.
1369249	1371710	Because thanks to TiVo, we just got a TiVo in the house.
1371790	1374871	I can tell it to record Invader Zim every time it's on, and it will.
1375071	1379252	No matter what time it's on, it'll find when Invader Zim's on and tape it for me.
1379292	1379672	I love it.
1380352	1381092	I'm sorry, you were saying?
1382093	1383293	That's pretty much it.
1383473	1384113	F you to them.
1384193	1387074	And F you to me for missing the whole thing of...
1388736	1390577	Trigger Happy TV, because that shit is awesome.
1390897	1391217	That's it.
1391618	1391998	Alright.
1392358	1394319	Do you have any, uh, FDs of the week, Bradley?
1395480	1396980	I'll let you have, I'll let you have Jamie's music.
1397000	1405465	Okay, well, uh, I don't know how many bad things happened this week, but just, uh, general fuck you to teeny buffers that hang around RVGL on...
1407387	1412272	The local arcade on Friday nights and toward into Saturdays.
1412673	1416757	Boy, we manage to give a big fuck you to them every week on the show, but they deserve it, so go right ahead.
1416777	1422984	Yeah, they stand around looking stupid and get in the way and look at each other and everything.
1423084	1423605	Do you hear that?
1423685	1425787	All you ever do is get in the way, you damn kids.
1426028	1426708	Get off our machine.
1426728	1427069	Go away.
1427975	1434680	Did you notice that it's interesting that this week, finally, they added a little sign that says, put your token here if you want to play next.
1435240	1445567	Because since they got rid of USA, finally, and they have the fourth plus, now the veterans are taking over both machines, so there's no, like, newbie machine for people to stand in line for and not worry about tokens.
1446007	1450070	Now you've got the token line on both machines, and some parents just don't understand the concept of a token line.
1450870	1452351	So, it had to be explained.
1452391	1454173	They should have a bat for those type of people.
1455073	1456494	I've got a big orange bat out in the car.
1456954	1457395	Seriously.
1458295	1460837	Alright, let's get on to the FUs of the week from the chatroom.
1461157	1463699	And I haven't even read these yet, so let's see what we've got.
1465320	1465840	Let's see.
1466601	1470683	Twen gives a big fuck you to the first mini-competition they had.
1471204	1473505	Four players, two basic, one trick, one maniac.
1473545	1474406	He was the maniac.
1474966	1478889	He got a friggin' kata and the scoring was based off the AAA score, so he got last.
1480478	1485281	and they got Dynamite Rave hiring Mr. T and his cattle was Orion 7-8 and he failed it so he got one.
1485481	1489563	So he basically got screwed in a tournament so FU to that tournament the twin partners have made it in.
1490764	1500809	JB gives a big FU, fuck you, to the Saints Go Marching on 4th Plus because he got a... he accidentally selected Maniac thinking it was Trick somehow and failed it at the arcade.
1501250	1502390	That's not the machine's fault, dummy.
1502410	1503851	I have another FU after we're done here too.
1504331	1505292	Alright, go ahead with your FU.
1505859	1516206	Okay, my FU goes to Country Club Lanes in their fucking Max machine because it has a fucked up right arrow on the player one side.
1516246	1517827	So I was playing doubles and I kept failing.
1517887	1519508	I was like, why the hell am I failing?
1520188	1526132	You know what, I think one of RVGL's on Max 2 on the one player side, I think the left arrow is broken too.
1526152	1527713	So you just can't win anywhere.
1527893	1529114	Anyway, back to chat room.
1530754	1533135	Joe Mama says, big fuck you to school.
1533395	1534435	Yeah, school's back in session.
1534455	1535615	I hope you kids are enjoying it.
1536136	1536816	Fuck you to school.
1538536	1547819	And SoCalKids says, fuck you to life and its endless amount of questions because I'm not sure if I want to do CG anymore.
1547839	1554261	I don't know what CG, I don't know if that means that's what he wanted to do when he got out of school or what have you.
1555301	1557202	Well, that was kind of deep.
1558925	1560326	Fuck you to life, though.
1560366	1562707	Dave says he's coming over to the show.
1562727	1563647	Well, that's not a fuck you.
1564587	1565408	Don't send me those messages.
1565828	1574191	Black Lab says fuck you to Neil, the CBGL tech guy, for fucking up the 4th Plus installation by not looking in the box for the flash card he needed.
1575472	1576712	So you gotta look for all the parts.
1577432	1578653	Oh, I'm being corrected.
1578933	1580834	Computer graphics animation, you bastard.
1582503	1583424	Sorry, Jesus.
1584524	1589326	DCB says, give a big fuck you to non-optical mouses.
1590527	1592388	So, he hates mouses with balls.
1592788	1594369	He prefers the female mouses.
1595549	1598571	Little holes with beams of light shooting out of them.
1600452	1604114	That's all the fuck yous of the week from the chat room.
1604754	1608055	If you have any additional fuck yous, just send them to me real quick over private message.
1608115	1610757	I'm in our chat room at Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
1612251	1614739	over on irc.eggheads.org.
1615120	1618371	Chat rooms like them at the lights, beams.
1620416	1622616	Little station updates to take care of.
1622656	1625917	There's some little housekeeping issues I need to tell you guys about.
1626537	1628658	As you know, we rebroadcast this show.
1628758	1633679	The show we do tonight gets rebroadcast on Monday night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
1634199	1638600	And then an old show, a classic show, is rebroadcast at 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
1638640	1644881	And this week, it's going to be the show with the interviews from the Dollar Mendy Tournament, that Mountain Mike's tournament that was a few weeks ago.
1645221	1647262	Those interviews are up in the old show rotation.
1647282	1648362	That'll be at 9 o'clock on Monday.
1648822	1649202	However...
1650094	1653735	This, starting with this last week, we tested it this last week and it's a go.
1654236	1658717	Starting, we're going to also rebroadcast on Thursdays at 2 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
1658997	1665280	And that's more for the benefit of people on the East Coast or just people overseas that want to try and catch the show at a different time.
1665740	1668461	So we're airing, because, you know, we do 7 o'clock tonight, we do 7 o'clock on Mondays.
1668821	1670702	So we'll take it five hours earlier on Thursdays.
1670902	1672383	Sweet, I can listen to it at work.
1700439	1717974	either next week or the week after going all the way back to episode one so the old show rotation will be like a couple months behind so it'll really give you a chance to catch up at that point we should do one day where we just play every show back to back we are going to do the marathon I just don't know when yet
1718690	1722733	Probably in the next couple weeks, like maybe weekend after next, something like that.
1723013	1723873	It's going to happen.
1723913	1725394	I just got to get the timing of it all worked out.
1725414	1727355	But we will do back-to-back-to-back episodes.
1727856	1731898	It's going to be like MTV rerunning Real World or Sorority Life.
1731918	1734319	You can just catch everything that's happened in one day.
1735320	1736701	You don't even have to listen every night.
1736981	1738042	But we'd like it if you do.
1738562	1741323	Speaking of which, have you seen the previews for Real World?
1742284	1743965	Was it Las Vegas?
1744145	1745346	No, I don't watch crap.
1746796	1747459	No, I'm just kidding.
1747981	1750793	I used to watch the real world, but I think the last one I watched was...
1753083	1757225	The one, it was Seattle because you had the guy that bitch slapped the girl as she got in the car.
1757465	1758646	That's the last real world I saw.
1759106	1759906	Let me just put it this way.
1759926	1761227	They're getting really desperate.
1761447	1766829	I think every single person on there, their parents either died, got divorced, are druggies, are gay.
1767270	1772852	One or the other, they're all like that and they're all messed up and they're all like horny and having sex with each other.
1773032	1773793	Well, that's ratings.
1774193	1774773	That's it.
1775133	1776154	It's not real at all.
1776194	1781156	It's just like, let's get this big bunch of dysfunctional people, throw them together in a little closet and
1781716	1783077	Hope that everything works out.
1785179	1785539	It's retarded.
1805475	1809138	Here's another big FU for the week, and actually for everything.
1809378	1809618	Yes.
1810819	1813762	This FU is going to reality TV.
1814542	1815863	I hate reality TV.
1816104	1818606	It is such an oxymoron.
1820267	1820667	That's it.
1822757	1823518	How is it inoxiable?
1823538	1824358	Because it's not really real.
1824598	1825479	It's not real at all.
1825539	1826439	It's like retarded.
1826579	1830621	I mean, all these shows, like, okay, Survivor, maybe that was an original idea.
1830801	1833082	Oh, now everyone's trying to copy Survivor.
1833502	1835443	I don't care what happens to these people.
1835783	1836944	I hope they all die.
1836964	1840386	I'm just waiting for a jet plane to come overhead and crash down into them.
1841326	1843207	You don't want to go on one of these shows to win a million dollars?
1844528	1845208	I'd go on the show.
1845248	1852893	What do you think, what do you think if they really, now remember there's a rumor a couple months back, I don't know how, the truth behind it, but that they were going to do a game show out of DDR.
1852913	1859577	What do you think about a reality show based around, because you could consider a game show a reality show, a reality show based on DDR.
1859597	1860037	What do you think?
1861478	1863559	Yeah, that's about as good as the DDR movie.
1865455	1867476	And while we're at it, let's have a DDR sitcom.
1867636	1869797	It's a whole comedy set around DDR.
1869917	1870977	I have to introduce Dave.
1871017	1882422	Dave's in the house now, so a big hello to Dave, who, of course, five seconds in to him getting here, he wants to say something, so let's... Well, first I was going to say what happened during the show, because I wasn't here.
1882442	1884783	It wasn't our fault.
1884823	1887464	Well, I was just, you know, like, five second recap.
1887484	1887864	What happened?
1889500	1890801	We talked about stuff.
1891401	1891781	Let's see.
1892061	1895082	Loki bitched about DDR Sims.
1895682	1897102	Loki bitched about QZAR.
1897142	1900223	Loki bitched about reality TV shows.
1900743	1902223	Sky bitched about Loki.
1902544	1903944	Yes, Sky bitched about Loki.
1904084	1904544	That's about it.
1904664	1907925	When did people start talking about themselves in the third person?
1908005	1909005	When did that start happening?
1909345	1909705	I don't know.
1910325	1911046	Okay.
1911106	1912066	Now it's the cool thing to do.
1913072	1918454	Okay, well, Dave was wondering about this DDR reality show.
1919235	1919995	How would that work?
1920035	1925677	It's like, go to Survivor, uh-oh, the challenge, unless you get knocked off, you have to full combo this catastrophic heart.
1926018	1927238	I don't know what that would do.
1928178	1931360	All I heard about you talking earlier was Paranoia, God Mix, or something.
1932020	1934421	Dance for immunity and throw people off the machines.
1934821	1940164	Lock 20 Bomani freaks in the arcade in the middle of the night, and...
1941761	1942142	I don't know.
1942503	1943244	Throw things at them.
1943785	1946951	Disney rave mad onage stuff.
1947612	1947913	Cool.
1950397	1950598	Yes.
1951139	1952221	Do you have any FUs of the week, Dave?
1954634	1960177	F you people who play Soul Calibur against me because you're taking down my character.
1961037	1963898	Oh, I played Soul Calibur 2 for the first time.
1964038	1965299	For the first time yesterday.
1965679	1967620	And I don't know how to play Soul Calibur at all.
1967660	1968660	I just kind of butt mash.
1969161	1972982	And I started on the conquest and I beat everybody.
1973042	1973623	I was so happy.
1973663	1976244	I joined the green people and I whooped on the red people.
1976484	1982807	And the funny thing is, is that Will Slinky, if you're listening, we all picked his character to fight because we wanted to pick on him because we found him.
1983387	1985549	Did you fight my character because I was also in the red arm?
1986149	1986950	I don't remember.
1987030	1989651	It fought a lot of noobs and then Will was last.
1989691	1991973	And both me and Glenn kicked his ass, so we had fun.
1993314	1997056	Conquest mode is the best because you fight people who are basically the same level.
1997096	2001439	So if you join in with a new character, you'll basically fight all the easiest guys in that army.
2001940	2003861	But once you get the good people, you'll start fighting me.
2005112	2005533	Oh, I see.
2005573	2008815	Well, I have to say, my Ivy, she rules.
2009316	2010797	Ivy is the bomb.
2011317	2013419	Isn't this a DDR show and we're here just talking about Soul Calibur?
2013479	2013699	Oh, well.
2014100	2017423	I know a lot of the people that play DDR also in the other games.
2017463	2019284	You don't have to restrict yourself to just the music games.
2019865	2021026	But, whatever.
2021166	2023908	Yes, I got to play more Dance Maniacs this weekend.
2024469	2024909	Oh, really?
2024989	2025449	How was that?
2025690	2026370	I love that game.
2027031	2028692	What is it about Dance Maniacs that you enjoy?
2028992	2030454	It's just, it's, I don't know, it's...
2031668	2033889	There's a lot of possibility for freestyle in that.
2033909	2041593	I did not realize because I actually watched Mr. Wendell and this other guy doing freestyle in there and it was quite amazing.
2041713	2042313	It's just fun.
2042453	2043314	I don't know what it is.
2044835	2046075	Why do people play poppin' music?
2047856	2051378	I think people play poppin' music for the big round buttons.
2051458	2053299	Poppin' music's pretty rad.
2053439	2053819	It's just...
2055171	2055732	I don't know.
2055812	2058175	It's like, why are you drawn to play DDR for the first time?
2058255	2059397	Ooh, big flashing lights.
2059697	2062320	You go to play poppin' music because, ooh, big buttons I can push.
2062360	2062961	You know, I don't know.
2063021	2064163	That's what I liked about it.
2064223	2066265	Yeah, and about the dance maniacs.
2066486	2067647	You have to hit like four at once.
2067687	2068769	You have to hit them with your forearm.
2068829	2069269	It's crazy.
2069510	2069690	Yeah.
2070259	2072681	Okay, anyway, back to Dave's topic.
2072801	2073822	Yeah, sorry.
2074223	2078066	About the Dance Maniacs, I really do not find that appealing at all.
2078507	2080409	Well, gee, why not?
2080729	2084352	It's like the Macarena mixed in with the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, or whatever it's called.
2084673	2086034	It's just moving your hands.
2086414	2090738	It's para, except that you're restricted to two buttons at different height levels.
2091519	2092440	And that's no fun.
2093141	2095463	Para is okay, but not that good.
2095963	2098667	Yeah, but they're different games.
2099127	2102171	It's not trying to be ParaPara, it's just trying to be Dance Maniacs.
2104034	2105215	Yeah, and yeah.
2105816	2107838	And it's okay to play Dance Maniacs with your feet.
2109160	2110582	Yeah, I tried that, and then...
2111320	2115381	I tried using my head, and I hit it on the machine, and it was pointy.
2115561	2116481	Actually, it was pretty funny.
2116541	2127983	They had a bunch of spots where you had to hit both undersides of the thing, and this guy kept doing this thing where he'd grab the bar on the machine and actually kind of do like a hip thrust into the machine.
2129643	2135324	You just kind of have to just mount one of those little sensors that stick, and now like, right on like a cowboy.
2135904	2136904	But it worked.
2137044	2140245	It looked like really funny, but it worked, so, you know.
2141195	2141495	Whatever.
2141795	2145677	I'm getting some late submitted FUs of the week, so let's have a look at them.
2146997	2149198	I'm going to just drive this bit into the ground the other night.
2149538	2155161	JB gives a big fuck you to regular DDR for not having the Dance Magic mode that Disney Mix has.
2155221	2157802	Well, yeah, I mean, that's a given.
2158062	2160783	Dance Magic's been needed in regular DDR for a long time.
2162584	2172815	23rd Magus says a big fuck you to ZTNet and whoever else sells the Boom PSX to USB converters I got seriously fucking stiffed out of 20 bucks so fuck you to ZTNet
2174426	2175988	And we'll cover that more later on.
2176669	2178451	Yeah, well, let's talk about that.
2179412	2186800	Talk about the USBs, because there's so many options here for going PlayStation to PC, and I don't know shit about it, so you've got to help me here, Loki.
2186940	2194308	Okay, well, all these stupid converters that they have out there, they're meant for one thing, is making the actual PlayStation controllers work with the PC.
2195149	2200634	The problem is, is that, you know, most people buy these to use with like DDR SIMs and that kind of stuff.
2201074	2202015	They're not meant for that.
2202215	2207360	I mean, the way DDR pads are set up, it's really funky because they have them mapped as buttons.
2207500	2215547	So basically, the problem is, is all these converters, they map the actual directional pad, not as buttons, but as axes.
2215728	2218050	So what the problem is, is you can't...
2218763	2223945	Push, like, up and down at the same time, like, where there might be a jump, or you can't push left and right.
2224085	2227046	It's just, you can only push, you know, one direction at one time.
2227966	2228726	So that's the problem.
2228746	2241491	Most people buy these pads, and especially, you know, big FU2 fries for putting the Kiki Joys next to the DDR PC, because people think, oh, it's going to work with, you know, the DDR PC.
2242051	2243131	Nope, not at all.
2243811	2248173	And DCB wants to send a big fuck you to the Kiki Joys, by the way, because the software doesn't work on his computer.
2248945	2249825	Yeah, that's another thing.
2250305	2255447	I have two USB converters also I bought a long time ago to try using with my sim.
2255927	2257587	Ended up having to buy a parallel one.
2257768	2259928	And trust me, that was the best move I ever made.
2260268	2264729	The parallel ones work great, and they work with the standard DirectPad Pro.
2266830	2267890	Do not buy USB ones.
2293220	2296682	All these controllers or converters do not work with the DDR pads.
2297282	2304827	There might be one out there, but you're going to go through about 50 of them before you find one that actually works.
2305587	2308589	So just buy the parallel ones, save yourself some time.
2308649	2315934	Now, if you're using them for, say, Beatmania 2DX sim or something like that, they'll work fine for that, but just not DDR.
2317458	2317738	All right.
2318298	2323401	Speaking of things going over Dave's head, because he was sitting there going, this whole chat's going over my head because I don't play DDR on PC.
2324281	2326142	Chat room wants to know, how tall are you, Dave?
2326382	2327743	Because they're seeing you on the webcam right now.
2328844	2330544	You didn't even know we had a webcam up right now.
2330584	2331965	Yes, we got a webcam.
2332325	2332905	How tall are you?
2334066	2334866	Freakishly tall.
2335047	2336447	I don't know, not that tall.
2336727	2337208	6'1".
2338188	2338608	I'm taller.
2338628	2339008	I'm 6'2".
2340689	2342030	But I'm sitting down, so they can't tell.
2343158	2345638	So, last fuck yous of the week, okay?
2345678	2348339	I've gotten a couple more, so these are the last fuck yous of the week.
2348379	2351940	Black Lab says, fuck you to sims that don't work on Macs.
2351980	2355980	I think that's a very valid fuck you of the week, because Macs are being neglected, of course.
2356000	2357181	You need to buy a real computer.
2357201	2358421	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2358441	2359381	Yeah, I was just going to say.
2359461	2360181	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2360201	2361461	When you make a computer... Macs are cool.
2361481	2362742	Macs are great for art stuff.
2362782	2363222	I like Macs.
2363242	2369683	Yeah, they look like artsy computers that you'd find in an art gallery, because, let's see, one looked like a toaster...
2370303	2372364	Worked like a toaster, pretty much was a toaster.
2372604	2376925	Now they have one that looks like a stupid little sphere with this thing sticking out of it.
2377045	2380867	You've got to hand it to Max for coming up with these really freaky dimes.
2380927	2382247	Like the clear speakers.
2382287	2383467	That you can't upgrade.
2384648	2386148	That's the thing that sucks about Max.
2387209	2388149	Also, what was it?
2388209	2392651	Gateway made this really retarded looking computer that's trying to copy the iPod.
2393611	2393851	I mean...
2394628	2397631	I hated Gateway to begin with, and this isn't really helping them.
2398111	2399052	It just looks like crap.
2399172	2401875	I think we're about to start a war in the chatroom, Macs versus PCs.
2401935	2403196	So let me get to the other FU of the week.
2403216	2404117	All right, Dave, what do you want to say?
2404697	2408861	I was just going to say that George Foreman Grill looks exactly like the iMac.
2409422	2412625	Like, if you put them next to each other, I thought that it was an iMac commercial.
2412905	2415427	It's like, hamburger, hot dog.
2416548	2418250	Did you try to cook a hot dog on an iPod?
2419352	2424553	Well, it did look pretty appetizing, you know, to just, like, put a hot dog in between the keys of the iMac.
2425034	2429715	But, uh, you know, they look exactly like, and they both have the same transparent colors.
2429975	2432876	But they do have... Get your hot dogs off the keyboard!
2432996	2437437	They do have, you know, seriously, though, for the G4, they really have this kick-ass monitor for it.
2437477	2444039	They have this, like, high-definition 24-inch monitor out there for the Macs, and those kick-ass.
2444099	2444919	But other than that...
2445922	2447666	Yeah, yeah.
2447766	2454861	Fuck you from Takeout Kid to UCB for not getting DDR Max 2 and making the current fifth mix a dollar.
2455888	2456529	Wow.
2456569	2462413	Well, at one point, the Metreon was charging $2 a game for 5th Mix, I believe, so it could be worse.
2462674	2465796	$2 a game for 5th Mix, so that means $4 for doubles.
2466697	2467257	That's crazy.
2467497	2469019	It depends on how many songs you're getting, I guess.
2469219	2480608	I remember when the Metreon charged like $1.50 or $2 for like 1st Mix or $1.50 or something ridiculous, and then you go right into the other room and they have the same thing for like a quarter or 50 cents less each year.
2482173	2485155	Anywho, no more fuck you's of the week.
2485175	2486515	You've got to save them until next week now.
2487356	2489837	JB has got a question for you, Loki.
2489917	2495420	He wants to know if you know anything about DSE, the DDR Sequence Editor, and what it is.
2495700	2501903	Yeah, the DDR Sequence Editor is an old editing, or it's an edit-making program that's pretty old.
2501943	2504885	It's like compatible with, you know, fifth mix down.
2506465	2508566	It doesn't do freeze arrows or anything like that.
2508726	2509326	It's pretty good.
2509386	2511547	It works on older PCs and stuff.
2512167	2520930	If you're actually going to use an actual editor for making edits on your PC for DDR, I would recommend the...
2522589	2544545	It's called DDR Edit Max 300 And it's actually pretty cool It supports freezeros and everything like that The only problem is it doesn't really Some of the edits that are made with it aren't really compatible You have to go in and hex edit something So you kind of have to know what you're doing Okay But it's No, I've never used it yet Because it's the only thing that will run on my Quit breaking things What are you doing?
2544566	2545526	What the hell are you doing?
2546607	2551811	Dave's playing with a webcam Just ignore Dave Stop making animals in compromising positions here
2552688	2563117	Anyway, so yeah, it's good for if you have an older computer, like my crappy ass laptop that I use for editing DDR songs at the arcade I go to, how sad is that?
2563758	2570164	And so yeah, it's the only thing that'll work, so give it a try, but they're all Japanese, so it's hard to say.
2571359	2572400	Another question.
2572700	2574761	What do you know about this new simulator?
2574781	2576702	It looks like it's coming out called Feet of Fury.
2576722	2577842	You know anything about this at all?
2577942	2579143	This is the first I've heard of it.
2579323	2579703	Oh, really?
2579783	2580003	All right.
2580264	2581064	Well, let's go to a break.
2581084	2583085	We'll let you read up on this page, see what you think of it.
2583765	2586507	We'll go to a break here real fast, and we'll come back.
2586567	2593230	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and thanks for tuning in, and we will be right back.
2701697	2702978	Can you hear the cheering?
2703018	2703818	Super Performance!
2746239	2746619	Perfect!
2775928	2778370	Your dance showed us a dream for the future.
2778850	2780172	Tomorrow is another day.
2780672	2782874	You're the one who'll give us hope for the future.
2900803	2905807	After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.
2906607	2910410	Undersedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.
2910890	2917875	Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UndersedationLive.org.
2919856	2923859	Babe, I got you babe.
2926120	2927101	I got you babe.
2933563	2934085	Thanks for watching!
3041403	3050227	And now it's time for Erotic Op Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
3050717	3051617	Do it all night.
3051857	3052718	Do it with me.
3053178	3054598	No, no, that was awful.
3054678	3055558	Bloody terrible.
3055598	3056939	Do you take vocal lessons?
3057019	3057999	Kill your teacher.
3058499	3059499	In the heat of the night.
3059980	3062200	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
3063380	3064061	I liked it.
3064581	3066121	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
3066221	3066681	Next.
3069882	3071003	That was cool.
3072423	3074203	Do you even know why you're here?
3074283	3075944	That was just bloody pathetic.
3076024	3076364	Next.
3081843	3082064	Yes!
3082464	3083106	Yes, that's it!
3083466	3084649	We have a winner!
3085430	3089338	A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3090931	3094612	Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3096492	3099033	Dave told me I couldn't come back saying that because I always say it.
3099893	3102654	I figured, though, that's really the last time I'm going to be able to use that.
3102674	3105854	I'm going to have to take that out of rotation now because American Idol's over.
3105914	3106454	It's done with.
3106915	3108275	So the parody, it doesn't work.
3108735	3110755	People are going to forget about American Idol next week.
3111135	3113056	That chick who won, people ain't going to care.
3113116	3113716	Come next week.
3114476	3115196	I don't care now.
3116437	3117217	Well, you didn't care then.
3117697	3117857	So...
3118607	3120228	Farewell to that little promo.
3120288	3123390	Being suggested, I do something for the new Survivor that's debuting.
3123711	3126392	Do some kind of Orange Lounge Survivor.
3126412	3127493	I have no idea how that works.
3127733	3134758	Maybe I can advertise a big twist, like, ooh, coming up, a big new intro, and then not do it like I did this week.
3134918	3142343	Well, I was going to mention, since I was noticing in the chat room, someone was listening to a remix of Let Them Move, which kind of jogged my memory.
3142503	3145906	I remember reading something back on the DDR Maniacs boards,
3146526	3148268	Not possible, I say.
3148288	3148348	Oh.
3165083	3172346	So I challenge people out there to find the damn MP3 for that so we can listen to it and see if it's actually good or if it just sucks or if it doesn't exist.
3172627	3177349	Well, I think that you could make a good one if you made an instrumental remix of it.
3177789	3184032	You know, took out the... And then you took out the music and then you put in new music.
3184312	3185193	You know what they need to do?
3185413	3193519	It's because a lot of times they'll take the old, I don't know, they'll take the Japanese songs, you know, sung by B4U, and they'll convert them into English.
3193559	3196402	Well, let's just have them sing that in, you know, Japanese.
3196662	3199064	Or Crash, which is Breakdown.
3199764	3200185	Yeah.
3200405	3200905	Basically.
3201286	3205789	Well, that's still... Which was being requested in the chat room during the break, and no.
3207230	3208511	I don't like Crash personally.
3208852	3210233	So I'm going to take it out on everybody.
3211093	3211614	I hate that song.
3212134	3212534	Maybe.
3212594	3213075	We'll see.
3213515	3218417	If I get, like, money or other kinds of favors and begs and pleading, maybe we'll play it.
3220138	3220598	Or not.
3221138	3221859	I just gotta fuck you.
3222839	3223099	Anyway.
3225540	3226561	What else do we want to talk about?
3228182	3233985	Anyways, that sim that we saw... Yeah, the one we were looking at during the break, and I accidentally took it off the screen.
3234005	3234445	Let me go back.
3234885	3240808	It looks like somebody is developing something for Dreamcast, and it's gonna be a DDR simulator.
3240828	3241068	Are there...
3241738	3246762	It sounds like they're being kind of careful not to call it like DDR, but they're saying it's in the same vein as DDR.
3246802	3248323	It's called Feet of Fury.
3251365	3253346	Feet of Fury, special!
3254727	3260291	Well, it's like, I don't know, it's sort of like, um, it looks like it's just all dance magic mode.
3260311	3261332	That's pretty much what it is.
3263303	3263704	I don't know.
3263724	3264144	Let's see.
3264164	3273034	They're saying... I'm looking at their website, and if you're in our chat room right now, our website address was posted, and maybe Twin will post it again for you if you want to see this page.
3273055	3278761	It looks like DDR is going to be on the Dreamcast, basically, but it's more of a competitive thing.
3278781	3279362	They're saying...
3280454	3284716	You want something a little more interesting or challenging and it doesn't require yet still more speed.
3285196	3291719	So they've spent over a year building tools and developing what will give you a step in the right direction for beat games.
3292600	3296241	And it's going to have a little bit of 3D.
3296742	3298142	You can use a standard controller.
3298162	3299583	You can use a DDR dance mat.
3300443	3301764	They've got 12 songs in it.
3302264	3304605	That looks like a demo of what's going on.
3306386	3307046	Some musicians.
3307086	3307567	I'm trying to see...
3308807	3311648	What kind of... They're saying it's going to be a little more competitive.
3311688	3315190	I can't find any more information about that.
3315210	3316610	Anyway, they're expecting a beta release of it.
3316670	3318651	It's going to be this October, October 1st.
3318711	3322232	And then the expected final release is going to be January 1st of next year.
3323073	3324553	So, looking forward to that.
3324813	3325133	Cool.
3325153	3325974	Well, that'll be interesting.
3326014	3327634	We'll review that as soon as it's released.
3328375	3334117	And if anybody from that group is listening and wants to give us a sneak advance copy, hey, I don't say no to that stuff either.
3335397	3335617	Right.
3337018	3337298	Okay.
3337318	3337398	Okay.
3338980	3348132	Oh, big story, it's been two weeks since we've been here in the studio, quote unquote, because last week, as you know, we taped in advance at Roseville Golf Land.
3348352	3350095	A lot of mixed reaction to that show.
3350175	3353299	Some people really liked it, some people thought it was ass, but what can you do, you know?
3354524	3370455	I wasn't there, I was listening, and I thought it was, the one part was cool, where you were like, yeah, we're from that school, and doing an interview, yeah, and then the rest of it was kind of boring, except for like, Brad going, and you know, that stuff, but it was okay, it wasn't that good.
3371135	3373677	Well, thank you for that honest opinion, Siskel, I appreciate it.
3375398	3377580	Like Ebert, Siskel, maybe you're too young for that, I don't know.
3378300	3379261	He died a while ago.
3381062	3382643	No, the fat one didn't die, the fat one's still alive.
3382663	3383904	The fat one ate him, dammit.
3387200	3391084	We were actually secretly hoping we would get kicked out of Golf Land because it would have been great radio.
3391224	3392766	You know, like, oh shit, what do we do now?
3392786	3397170	We'll hitchhike our way over to... Well, we wouldn't have to hitchhike to Brookfields.
3397190	3401754	We could walk over there, hitchhike our way over to a nearby... Now broadcasting at the volcano on Hole 3...
3407828	3408689	Oh shit, alright.
3409210	3412032	But while we were gone, this big news story came out.
3412693	3417938	And I'm sure everybody's heard of it by now, but we want to talk about it anyway, because we like to be repetitive on this show.
3419479	3425184	Greece, the Isle of Greece, banned electronic games, period.
3425645	3431510	Meaning no DDR, no Game Boys, no Nintendos, no arcade games whatsoever.
3432222	3434844	No solitaire on your computer with Windows.
3435184	3435525	Why?
3436065	3438647	Because they want to prevent gambling.
3440128	3440869	What do you think of this?
3441529	3442390	I think it's retarded.
3443210	3445652	I bet you two bucks that it won't last ten days.
3446673	3448014	I think it's been ten days, hasn't it?
3448434	3448855	Yeah.
3450236	3451737	Yeah, well, I just gambled, so...
3452830	3455492	Wherever you are, you are losing!
3456052	3458554	I'm gambling over whether or not it works or not.
3459094	3464338	And that revokes the point of... Oh shit, I did it again.
3464698	3473464	I'm being corrected, it wasn't just the gambling, it was the violence in games too, because you know, solitaire and Minesweeper can be a bloody fucking battle when you lose.
3474045	3477167	Dude, Minesweeper, I mean the bombs, they want to keep that away from the kids.
3477387	3479709	I mean, you know, you have to place the flag...
3480285	3482586	You get it wrong, uh-oh, you lose.
3483166	3484846	Ah, they're just bitter over the Olympics.
3486907	3488207	How so, for those that don't know?
3488867	3490087	I don't know, they're just bitter.
3490407	3495849	That they didn't get to host the... Freaking crazy Greeks and their damn mythology and their gods and stuff.
3496049	3498729	Where's their gods of irony and gods of stupidity?
3498769	3500650	They must be working full swing now.
3501670	3505471	You can address those cards and letters to Loki, care of Orange Flown's radio.
3507752	3508894	I'm sorry, Rob.
3508934	3511837	I probably heard all of our listeners listening from Greece.
3512938	3514920	Actually, I believe we do have listeners from Greece.
3514940	3516742	I'm going to have to check the statistics really fast.
3516762	3517583	Let's go check the stats.
3518183	3521387	Some interesting things, though, about the stats, which surprised me.
3521867	3525131	Canada is no longer the number two country listening to this program.
3525151	3525631	You know what it is?
3526452	3526913	Japan.
3527233	3527894	You know what's third?
3529102	3529502	Korea.
3530243	3531584	Greece?
3531604	3532104	Yeah, Greece.
3532324	3532765	No, then.
3533005	3535847	Yeah, we invite the Greek to live vicariously through us.
3535927	3539829	If you've had your video games robbed from you, hey, we'll tell you about what you're missing out on.
3540069	3544052	No, wait, I'm just... No, I have them like... Alright, thank you.
3544512	3545193	Wait, hold on.
3545700	3546000	Hold on.
3546241	3547782	Wait, how many people are listening?
3547802	3548583	Because, I mean... Enough.
3549424	3555109	It's like, yeah, we got the number... It's like coming in second place with two listeners is Japan.
3555430	3557512	And then tied for third is Canada, Korea, and the U.S.
3557532	3558553	No, no, it's more than that.
3558633	3559213	It's more than that.
3560154	3564598	We will be the new underground movement for our computer games and our cha-cha games.
3565419	3565980	Oh, my God.
3567580	3568601	We will overcome.
3569302	3571464	We shall overcome.
3571484	3574767	See, this is what happens when you play too much 2DX like Bradley.
3574807	3575648	Good job, Grease.
3575688	3578691	You stopped it at the root.
3578892	3579913	I'm looking for Grease.
3580853	3583076	No, nobody has listened to this show from Grease, unfortunately.
3584201	3585202	Hey, what's that there?
3585242	3586663	I see one stream from Greece.
3586723	3587264	Oh, there they are.
3587304	3588365	The very, very bottom.
3588425	3588765	Greece.
3589425	3590246	The very bottom.
3590506	3594690	One stream connected from Greece, not even for a full minute.
3595771	3598093	So that's somebody who connected and listened to that.
3598533	3600615	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3600655	3601896	And then just like disconnected right there.
3601916	3603717	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3603757	3606079	Ha ha, Greece doesn't have electronic games.
3606380	3606660	And then they...
3607200	3614165	No, I think they got that far, and then like the little underground Gestapo Grecian people came and was like, what are you doing?
3614205	3618368	You can't be listening to something from out of, you know, the country, and then they break it.
3618808	3620629	I wonder if this show would be illegal in Greece.
3621650	3627574	Maybe, you know, especially, we're like, you know, freaking propaganda over there, you know.
3628354	3635719	And this is a weird thing, it applies to tourists too, so if you're going to go to Greece, don't take your Game Boy, because they'll throw your ass in jail, they don't care if you're a stupid American or what.
3636827	3642111	I think that they just take the Game Boy and then they've got like the secret vault of all these Game Boys and stuff.
3642291	3644452	Is that like the landfills with Atari 2600 games?
3644492	3645873	Like all the old copies of E.T.
3645913	3647554	that no one bought just in a landfill somewhere?
3647795	3649456	No, I don't think it would be like a landfill.
3649476	3653718	They keep it in like, you know, I don't know if it's a president or the king of Greece or, you know, emperor or ruler.
3653758	3654539	The king of Greece.
3654679	3655099	Whatever.
3655380	3656360	The god of Greece.
3656580	3657561	The Grecian star.
3657781	3658682	Orpher to him is Zeus.
3658702	3661624	Okay, so I think that Zeus... John Travolta.
3662184	3663085	What the fuck?
3663105	3663365	Okay.
3664646	3665947	The Greece title.
3667048	3678160	Okay, so anyway, John Travolta slash Zeus is secretly made up this whole rule, got his secret Grecian Gestapo, just going around taking all the games just so he can play them.
3678500	3681123	And then he makes a secret black market of...
3682679	3683160	Oh, sorry.
3683740	3686043	Messing with Bradley's 2DX controller.
3686063	3688645	He's taking out his aggressions on the Greek on Bradley's controller.
3689446	3690407	Bradley doesn't like that.
3691027	3699175	Bradley, he's normally the quiet type, but then sometimes he does his little evil takeover the world type C-Lab 2021 type thing.
3700736	3704760	Anyway, back to my story on the Grecian underworld takeover.
3705817	3715905	And so after they steal all of the games from everyone else, they'll make a secret black market and John Travolta will be able to play all the games.
3716465	3717986	How do you think he gets so good at dancing?
3718547	3722289	I mean, he can do all those little special hip thrust move things.
3722349	3724151	You are on crack.
3724271	3728874	Now, I'm being told if we were to gamble on this show, then it would be illegal in Greece.
3729315	3729595	So...
3730587	3732108	I bet you a dollar, Loki.
3732208	3736149	I bet you one dollar that we're not going to get any higher than that.
3736409	3737450	We are now illegal.
3737790	3740731	That Greece will forever be the last place country on our list.
3740771	3741231	What do you say?
3742631	3743372	Take me up on that bet?
3743392	3744512	Will anyone take me up on that bet?
3745252	3745472	Yes.
3745852	3746053	Yes.
3746293	3747573	Yes, I will take you up on that bet.
3747593	3751154	Okay, therefore, now we are gambling on this show, and this show is now illegal in Greece.
3751334	3753955	So if you're listening, the cops are coming for you.
3754035	3754696	Lock the doors.
3754776	3755496	Lock the windows.
3756641	3757942	Do they have doors and windows in Greece?
3758782	3759703	I'm just kidding, of course they do.
3759723	3761404	They sure don't have video games, that sucks.
3762625	3765186	Primitive cavemen without their video games, ha ha ha.
3765566	3767908	Yes, them in the crappy Olympics.
3770049	3770469	Anyways.
3771510	3772651	Who was that supposed to sound like?
3772851	3773291	I don't know.
3773992	3776313	It was like, yeah, rich, snobby British people.
3776433	3776693	Right.
3777874	3778854	Wait, wait, what's Britain?
3778894	3780395	Britain's right about that.
3780415	3782257	They're not listing out much either, so.
3782317	3783237	Ah, shit, that's like an hour.
3783257	3784538	I'll make fun of the British, I won't.
3784980	3785781	Well, let's see, okay.
3786281	3787722	Here's my FUs for the week here.
3788262	3796368	We've got FU to Greece, FU to Denmark, FU to Belgium, Taiwan, Yugoslavia, Germany, Pakistan, Netherlands.
3797008	3804313	Taiwan gets an excuse, because if you ever looked at a lot of the games you buy, they were made in Taiwan, so they don't have time to listen to the show, because they're all in slave labor making these games.
3804813	3808196	Oh, and special FU to Yugoslavia for beating the USA team.
3808216	3811478	I know that Taiwanese are in slave labor copying the games from Japan.
3813240	3813920	Wow, look!
3814281	3815061	I can't believe it.
3815161	3816842	Sweden is actually up there.
3818783	3819683	Pakistan!
3820103	3820804	Isn't that cool?
3822685	3831709	I bet people that they can't guess what the number 7 ranked is.
3833490	3835151	Yeah, because you're looking at the thing.
3835211	3836031	Of course you know, Rob.
3836491	3838792	Anyway, since you can't see it, it's Venezuela.
3841405	3844587	People in Venezuela listening to us talking about DDR.
3844807	3847609	DDR is a hit worldwide.
3847649	3848249	What can you say?
3848449	3848989	It's a big thing.
3849970	3851571	Mexico, right above Venezuela.
3852211	3853112	The French.
3853572	3855393	The French are listening.
3855833	3857794	Didn't we make fun of the French a few shows back?
3857834	3859695	I seem to remember somebody went off on the French.
3859775	3861056	It was probably a Brad thing.
3861276	3868300	I know I remember on our boards, I blamed the French for the whole getting rid of the games in Greece.
3869160	3871482	There was no correlation, but I blame the French.
3872362	3873263	I think that was it.
3873823	3878306	I don't think that there was any public slander of the French on this radio.
3878346	3879387	Well, maybe we need some.
3879827	3880248	You know what?
3880568	3884491	I think that the French, personally, I really like French people.
3884911	3890835	You know, they make good food, and they've got one of those chefs that are on the Iron Chef, along with...
3892080	3893561	Other countries that I don't see.
3893821	3900283	Yes, we have every country that has an Iron Shaft guy is listening to this show.
3900544	3902364	I bet the stats are going off.
3903125	3907646	Alright, I'd like to give a shout out to Salman Bin Laden for listening to us from Pakistan.
3907847	3909467	So, way to go.
3909767	3910228	Yeah!
3910248	3912709	Yeah, okay.
3913309	3918691	Address those cards and letters once again to Loki because of views and opinions expressed on this show, blah, blah, blah.
3919071	3920732	Now let's look at cities in the U.S.,
3922032	3927475	Obviously Sacramento ranked number one, no surprise because we're all in Sacramento, we all listen to this station.
3927896	3932058	You know, I knew AOL was big, but I never knew that they were their own city.
3932378	3936581	Well, that's the weird thing is that AOL all goes through one thing, so they show up as one city on here.
3936621	3938202	Anybody that's on AOL has their own city.
3939365	3941807	San Francisco, followed by Columbus, Ohio.
3941907	3943088	We got fans in Columbus.
3943568	3943908	Word.
3943988	3948972	Well, I did a big shout-out to us, you know, on the East Coast Invasion boards.
3949772	3950953	Let's see who's in last place.
3951313	3954796	Let's see who's in last place and who we need to rough up some people.
3955096	3957998	You want to guess what city's in last place?
3958018	3959399	This is just the U.S.
3959679	3960519	Just the U.S.
3960940	3962861	Now, remember, this doesn't just count the live show.
3962901	3964742	This is also the Bomani Music and More program.
3964782	3966303	Bismarck, North Dakota.
3966663	3967244	North Dakota.
3967264	3968505	You're saying Bismarck, North Dakota.
3968525	3968865	Bismarck.
3969325	3969726	Here we go.
3969766	3970447	Come on, Bismarck.
3970707	3971428	Come on, Bismarck.
3971448	3972589	It is Des Moines.
3972729	3972990	No!
3973110	3973891	It was close!
3974972	3975392	Damn it!
3975432	3978236	Des Moines is in last place, followed by Bakersfield.
3979534	3980394	They have computers there.
3980414	3984615	Bakersfield's like, kind of by, like, it's a little poo town, right?
3984875	3985816	Is that like, cool?
3986396	3987476	Yes, sorta.
3987516	3989776	It's between here and L.A., really.
3989956	3991937	It's right before you go over the grapevine, if I'm not mistaken.
3992517	3995338	Wait, what's the, hold on, scroll back up here for a second.
3995358	3996698	No, no, no, don't scroll.
3997018	3998978	Oh, yeah, that causes dropouts, but yeah.
3999278	4000179	Okay, sorry.
4000399	4000759	That's alright.
4000799	4001799	I'm causing dropouts.
4002159	4002539	Lookout.
4002639	4007323	And then Denver counts for one city for like six different states.
4007463	4008624	That's pretty cool.
4008664	4011967	They've got like Denver, Colorado, MT, I don't know what that is.
4011987	4012427	Montana.
4012447	4014189	Nevada.
4014369	4015169	Nebraska, Nevada.
4015350	4019473	Well, that's because theoretically anybody right on the borders could be connecting through a hub in Denver.
4019733	4020273	So that would count.
4020514	4021514	This is getting really boring.
4021534	4023096	We need to go back to talking about Bumani.
4023636	4025758	Let's check Sky's private messages in the chat room.
4026662	4027623	This show sucks.
4028484	4029364	Oh, gee, thank you.
4031166	4033508	They want to have the webcam at a better angle.
4033568	4035169	If you wouldn't mind adjusting that, that would be nice.
4036310	4037150	Let's see what else I have.
4037170	4038512	Dave, do not touch the webcam.
4038532	4039552	Dave, you're not allowed to touch the webcam.
4039592	4041594	Dave, you are the weakest webcam.
4041614	4041894	Goodbye.
4045537	4045837	Dave.
4046698	4047098	Dave.
4050721	4052042	Put it down.
4052082	4052783	No 2DX for you.
4053688	4059592	You're making people dizzy on our webcam.
4059892	4064575	And if you want to know where the webcam is located, you have to be in our chat room at irc.eggheads.org.
4064875	4066296	Just join Channel Pound to Orange Lodge.
4066436	4067376	Plug, plug, plug, plug.
4067416	4068337	Yes, plug, plug, plug, plug.
4068637	4069418	That's what I do on this show.
4070798	4075561	Okay, now we are going to talk about what Rob wants to talk about.
4075581	4077342	Yes, what I also have on the list.
4077422	4078123	Okay, let's talk about this.
4079479	4084504	Konami very soon is supposed to be announcing some kind of online Bomani game.
4085925	4093612	Don't know what it's going to be, but it's going to be an online music... Actually, I shouldn't say it's Bomani, but if it's Konami and if it's a music game, it's probably going to be Bomani.
4093632	4097776	But it's going to be some kind of music game that's going to be playable online.
4098376	4099618	What do you guys think it's going to be?
4100298	4101659	We talked about this once before.
4101679	4104022	I'm not sure if it was on the air or not, but I think that...
4104922	4118230	We basically all thought that it would be something around frequency or something like that with different players doing different instruments or combining to form a song or something of that sort.
4119430	4121632	So basically a rip off of frequency you think?
4122252	4123753	It's Marshall Beat Online.
4125839	4126900	Marshall Beat Online.
4127180	4130503	Dude, the new Marshall Beat is so awesome because it's got Can't Touch This.
4130783	4132284	You can't touch this in Marshall Beat.
4132685	4136108	Wait, you need to explain to me what Marshall Beat is because I don't know.
4136168	4137269	Marshall Beat is what?
4137329	4139190	Like para-para except it's karate.
4139250	4139571	Okay.
4139711	4139951	Right?
4140071	4141432	I don't know how else to explain it.
4141452	4145455	Basically what it is is you've got like these sensors that are on your hands and on your feet.
4145856	4147697	They've got another sensor kind of pretty much like...
4148978	4151019	Mambo A Go Go or whatever that is.
4151039	4152220	Mambo!
4152240	4153460	No, whatever that is.
4153521	4154041	Punch Mania.
4154721	4156282	Samba de Amigo or whatever like that.
4156382	4157002	Oh, okay.
4157102	4160404	Where it's got the sensors and it can kind of, you know, that kind of thing.
4160704	4166207	So anyways, you're on there and they'll ask you to punch up, punch down, kick, do whatever and you have to mimic stuff.
4166407	4169208	They also have a mode where you can fight people and stuff.
4169629	4172050	And all at the same time, they have really crappy music in the background.
4172671	4173712	It's Raining Men and Petite Love
4202871	4204132	Do you punch to the music?
4204272	4205712	Does it go like on beat punching?
4206773	4207333	Okay, it does.
4208793	4209854	It's like Taibo.
4210614	4211514	Chatroom says.
4211535	4212455	It sounds like Taibo.
4212495	4216376	Taibo, except that you pay by the minute instead of by the tape.
4216516	4217837	Alright.
4218757	4220638	Someone finds me a place where I can get this.
4220838	4224440	I will purchase this so that we can have it here.
4225620	4227721	That would be the coolest thing ever.
4228921	4230622	I would play that all day.
4231744	4233945	So if we can find where we can get this, I'll get it.
4234405	4235786	It's just because.
4236386	4237046	Move the webcam.
4237066	4238267	It's at a really bad point.
4239767	4241548	Okay, it's now DaveTV.
4242048	4243069	All Dave, all the time.
4243929	4245630	Any other ideas what they could do for an online game?
4246170	4248431	Maybe Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania type thing?
4248451	4249152	What do you think about that?
4249272	4251392	They need to add some more instruments to that, I think.
4251933	4253373	Like Keyboard Mania?
4253393	4254134	Maybe bring that back?
4254154	4259356	Keyboard Mania, Drum Mania, let's get like... Singing Mania, Karaoke Mania.
4260442	4266986	Get, like, maybe even, uh... Yeah, I've discussed the karaoke thing before, but it's impossible to tell how you're singing.
4267046	4276051	There's nothing that can really... I mean, you can sync up noises to tell how much it is, but it's not like you can get a better singing voice, you know?
4276551	4282535	I mean, you can get more in tune and hit the right notes, but it's not like you have to hit with a certain amount of pressure or something.
4282595	4287317	It's like, okay, fat people can't play because you gotta hit it, you know, one gram of pressure.
4287698	4290019	Konami presents American Idol Online!
4292059	4295865	Oh my god, bring back the demo, or the promo, or whatever it's called.
4295905	4304760	Another thing that's pretty funny that I actually saw, they have it as part of Monster Rancher 3 for the PlayStation 2, you can actually capture your face and put it on the monster.
4305580	4307581	We have that in the front room right now, I kid you not.
4307601	4309121	We have Monster Hunter 3.
4309321	4310162	That's where I saw it.
4310522	4312583	You can actually capture your face and put it on there.
4312803	4316944	I think it'd be funny to capture your face and stick it on the dancers that are in the backgrounds.
4317284	4320646	I think that you should capture your face and stick it on the crotch part of the dancer.
4321166	4328829	You know, just have like, I can just see Rob's smiling face right over Rage's like, I don't know, didn't we, I forget what we said about him like a few shows ago.
4328969	4329829	As Emi's third tit?
4331138	4331918	That would be cool, too.
4331938	4332839	Pantsless Rage.
4333299	4337361	You know, that might have been funny if I was in junior high.
4337441	4341082	We can have you, like, the Pantsless Rage thing that we were talking about, like, three weeks ago.
4341182	4341562	Okay!
4341603	4345964	And then, like, censor it out with Rob's smiling head, being like, Whee!
4346745	4348185	Wow, this is, yeah.
4348265	4349686	Look, I'm in Rage's pants!
4351027	4351527	Whee!
4353368	4356729	I'm being told in the chatroom that they are making an American Idol game.
4359082	4362605	Help Justin save the world from his big hair.
4362725	4363106	I don't know.
4363146	4364947	What the hell would an American Idol game be?
4366869	4368511	What do you do in an American Idol game?
4369191	4372655	How about, like, press a button if you want Simon to use this bitch out.
4372675	4374496	Press a button if you want Simon to use this.
4374536	4375557	Okay, I challenge this.
4375577	4376738	Press this button to bring out Paul.
4376758	4384506	For our chat room here, I challenge you guys to make an American Idol sound basically...
4386940	4387360	Promo?
4387800	4396264	Not, no, well, a promo would be good too, but I was thinking more along the lines of a sound theme for DWI or something like that.
4396724	4403287	You know, the, go back to, you know, you should, your music teacher should be shot or something like that, you know.
4404896	4407898	You just want a sound file of somebody saying that?
4407918	4415041	No, just basically, you know, like DWI has sound themes where you have a bunch of different sound clips for like, you know, if you score an A, a combo, whatever.
4415721	4417682	So something like that.
4418443	4419923	I think we're going to go ahead and take another break.
4420584	4423425	And when we come back, you want to do a listless?
4423845	4424406	What do you guys think?
4425686	4426507	There's only four of us.
4427987	4433070	Now, the topic I was thinking of we could do is a song we'd like to see a decent freestyle done to.
4435089	4435489	Okay.
4435570	4435910	I don't know.
4436190	4437831	What else do you guys have any ideas?
4438472	4439773	Let's put the topics to the chatroom.
4439793	4442155	What does the chatroom want us to decide tonight on Listless?
4442875	4444316	I'm going to put the question out to them.
4444897	4447318	So we'll see as soon as they respond to that.
4447979	4449500	No ideas from the peanut gallery here?
4451342	4454644	Well, we've got to wait because we have to do our Listless thing during the break.
4454744	4457226	People are sending them over private message.
4457286	4457646	Let's see.
4459488	4460849	Oh, they're sending me a request for songs.
4460869	4463611	They're not sending me... Songs you would like to hear on Marshall Beatz.
4465356	4467517	I'm surprised his Kung Fu Fighting wasn't on that.
4467537	4468918	The best yoga song.
4469958	4472859	I think there's only like four songs to pick from, dummy.
4473040	4479763	Like Damn Dare Ram, the remix of Damn Dare Ram, the KCP remix, or another one.
4480503	4481383	Damn Dariam.
4481523	4482624	You say it like my dad would.
4482684	4483864	Damn that Damn Dariam.
4484004	4491868	I'm going to say Damn Dariam, Damn Dariam, KCP remix, there's No Nobody's Love, and Bye Bye Baby Balloon.
4494216	4497517	Oh, Charon's not giving me many good ideas here.
4503560	4505060	Best Dance Maniacs song.
4505981	4506621	Best Dance Maniacs?
4506661	4509002	I don't know enough Dance Maniacs songs to be able to do that.
4509022	4510062	Yeah, they all suck anyways.
4510682	4513003	We did the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania song already, right?
4513924	4514224	Have we?
4514244	4516485	I think so, yeah.
4516525	4517005	No, we never did.
4517085	4517865	Okay, want to do that?
4520206	4521807	Well, it's Paul's fault for not being here.
4523866	4525847	I asked Paul if he wanted to come, he said no.
4527767	4528247	I'm so hurt.
4528267	4529848	Well, if that's the case, then we're doing that tonight.
4529868	4531648	We're going to do Best Guitar Freak Song without him here.
4531969	4535410	So we're doing Best Guitadora Song, I guess.
4535450	4538311	Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania.
4538431	4540291	All three of those kind of meshed into one.
4540731	4542952	Best song out of those.
4543012	4546553	We're going to do that when we come back from this little break.
4546893	4551035	We started out with a song that was requested a lot in the chat room during the last break.
4551075	4552035	So here it is for you guys.
4553673	4554599	No, not drop the Bizom.

4995442	4999606	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
4999826	5001548	Do you want to be a staff member by Hollywood?
5001588	5001948	No!
5002069	5005712	Do we care what people think of us?
5006333	5008195	No!
5008215	5009656	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
5010116	5012379	Yes!
5014200	5016022	Extreme Babani Radio.
5016282	5018945	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
5019645	5022387	That is us, Orange Lounge Radio.
5023088	5025669	I was just seeing if Dave had a negative reaction to me doing that, too.
5026050	5026410	I don't know.
5026970	5034236	Dude, he saved the picture of me looking like I was sucking on some... Well, it was actually the end of that little furry talkie thing.
5034256	5034716	Wait, hold on.
5035256	5035617	Hold on.
5038419	5038899	That thing.
5039980	5040460	Wait, hold on.
5040520	5041421	Get a picture on the webcam.
5043470	5045171	Yeah, it sounds like it's orgasming half the time.
5045571	5051575	No, but, um... And he saved it, so... I know he's gonna put it on, like, the main Orange Lounge.
5051955	5053556	I'm not the only one that saved it, by the way.
5053616	5054897	People in the chatroom saved it, too.
5056898	5058419	Like, have you seen this man?
5058819	5060220	He plays the DDR.
5060760	5062181	He sucks the furry cock.
5063282	5064503	Wait, I did not say that.
5065303	5065603	No.
5066504	5069386	Last week on Orange Lounge... Oh, no, no, no, no.
5070446	5071407	Don't pull that shit.
5072107	5072628	Oh, yeah.
5073028	5073148	Yeah.
5074457	5075338	Best Song in Guitarora
5103229	5104049	We'll go ahead and start.
5104369	5106972	Should I find some game show music this week for Listless?
5108713	5109374	Sure, why not?
5109454	5111836	Let's do some game show music, if I can find some.
5112176	5115759	Why don't you go ahead and tell us your number three song, Loki, and we'll find the game show music.
5117560	5121583	I'm going to have to go with... Looks like Primal Soul.
5123225	5124766	Primal Soul, okay.
5128409	5130671	I don't even know that song, to be honest, but my bad.
5131434	5145080	Alright, uh... Well then let's hear if your choice is any better, Bradley.
5145120	5146000	What's your number three choice?
5146881	5148762	Bradley is somehow really hyper right now.
5148782	5150622	He's all like, yeah, girl sounds really good.
5150642	5154224	Hey, we're getting him to talk on this show.
5154644	5155244	Shut your mouth!
5155345	5156105	Alright, yes.
5157831	5158912	My number three choice would be Liar Liar.
5176940	5192808	I guess my number three is Naminori Johnny, but it's on 7Mix and 6Mix, Guitar Freaks Romania, and it's actually in Japanese, so you can't see Naminori Johnny.
5192888	5194589	He doesn't say that.
5196030	5199692	Spelled it out really bad, so you're just going to have to deal with me in the chat room.
5199712	5201513	I just spelled that out best I could.
5201873	5205335	Anyway, my number three choice was Miss You.
5206152	5209874	Which is the long version of Ride on Time, but in Japanese, for those who don't know.
5209994	5211294	So that was my number three choice.
5211414	5211874	Shut up!
5211914	5212335	Go to hell!
5214536	5215496	Our music stopped.
5220918	5221799	Your number two choice.
5222519	5225920	Alright, my number two choice has to be Eraser Engine.
5226361	5227181	Eraser Engine.
5229233	5230174	and some of the older stuff.
5230875	5233438	I'm not going for... Getting a little old school.
5235120	5237903	Yes, the original Racer Moto Maximo.
5239024	5239424	I love it.
5240125	5241426	Alright, your number two choice, Bradley?
5241947	5243909	It would be Sanagi from Seven Spikes.
5244530	5248774	Good choice.
5248855	5249956	Yes, your number two choice, Dave.
5252023	5254464	Okay, this one's really hard.
5255705	5259786	My number two choice, I guess, is Double Trouble.
5259926	5261627	It's a great song.
5261907	5267890	I mean, Paul Voltaire has his least favorite song on any Bomani game, but that was just for Guitar Freaks.
5267950	5269250	The actual song, Success.
5269830	5271191	It doesn't have that really stuff.
5271811	5272692	Double Cheeseburger!
5274872	5275153	Sure.
5275593	5275953	Alright.
5276953	5280735	So, my number two choice would be Carnival.
5281482	5287305	Because I like the cardigans, they're cool, and I like that cover of it in Guitar Freak Smith Mix, so Carnival is my number two choice.
5287765	5290186	Small hands smell like cabbage.
5290206	5291627	Oh yeah, you're going to correct my spelling?
5292327	5292787	Please do.
5293868	5294308	Which one?
5294468	5294688	Here?
5296469	5297730	Alright, Bradley's going to correct my spelling.
5297750	5303332	We're going to get Loki's number one choice for best Guitar Freak Strum Mania song.
5303533	5304573	Alright, this is easy.
5304993	5306074	It's going to be Fireball.
5306534	5307234	Fireball.
5308015	5308395	Alright.
5308415	5308575	Alright.
5311260	5311860	Fireball.
5311900	5312921	That's a good choice.
5313261	5315883	Fireball.
5315903	5318425	Your number one choice, Bradley, for best Guitar Freaks drum media song.
5318905	5319646	Giant Slug.
5319826	5321327	Giant Slug, right on.
5325030	5332915	I went to MGL two weeks ago to go play that on 6th Mix, because it's not in 7th Mix on Guitar Freaks.
5333876	5334817	They removed it from the mix.
5335857	5336158	Dope!
5336818	5340841	And lots of the old songs they removed, because it was a cool time.
5342318	5343638	Alright, and your number one choice, Dave?
5345259	5350120	Um, I don't know, this one's kind of typical, but I said at least 100 seconds.
5350540	5351280	It's a good song.
5351660	5357001	The long version kicks so much more ass, but it's not, like, on the Drum Mania or Guitar Freaks.
5357041	5357761	It's too bad.
5358521	5358821	Bummer.
5359602	5362542	My number one song, I can't believe none of you mentioned it, come on.
5362902	5365183	It's the best song in Guitar Freaks, you know it.
5365603	5366363	Don't say Venus.
5366663	5367063	Don't say Venus.
5367243	5367923	No, not Venus.
5368643	5369484	Haru Spring.
5370164	5371404	Come on, with the Dancing Panda?
5375054	5375434	Fire, Overbite
5397469	5398969	Yeah, this one guy.
5399449	5400050	Fuck you.
5400450	5404651	Guy at Roseville Golf Lane, staff guy, who plays this... Oh, sorry if you're listening.
5404931	5406571	Fuck you.
5406911	5410412	Who plays this song three songs in a row.
5410712	5411652	Like, he puts in money.
5412072	5412532	Fire!
5413873	5416233	I forget how the song goes, but anyway, I should remember it.
5416493	5419154	And then, okay, let's mix it up a little with fire!
5419554	5419914	And it's like...
5420274	5421756	Okay, I'm going to challenge myself a little.
5421796	5422557	FIRE!
5423277	5427962	I assume that he's playing three different games since there's only the long version in, uh, seventh mix.
5428483	5431046	No, this was in, uh, the fifth mix, Guitar Freaks, I think.
5431266	5431366	Ah.
5431786	5434009	But now he just plays it burn, I think.
5434369	5435450	It's like, FIRE!
5436251	5437052	BURN!
5437853	5438454	FIRE!
5440678	5442419	Anyway, the full list we have so far.
5442480	5444101	And now we get to do the elimination part.
5444121	5444641	This will be fun.
5445222	5456250	Primal Soul, Liar Liar, Nami Norijana, Miss You, Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble, Carnival, Fireball, Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Haru Spring.
5456871	5458312	Your elimination choice, Loki.
5459022	5462884	Your choice to eliminate from this lovely list we have, Bradley.
5488496	5492120	It would be Miss You, because Right on Time is a lot better than that one.
5492721	5493481	I'm so hurt.
5494002	5495423	But okay, that's the way it works.
5495884	5496765	I used to like Right on Time.
5496785	5497946	Bradley's fired from the show by the way.
5497966	5498787	No, I'm just kidding.
5498807	5501290	Hey, small e. No, never mind.
5501810	5509839	But then it was overplayed partially by me, partially by these rocker people at Gulfland, and Rob, and everyone else.
5510771	5528054	and you know one song I left off my list and I'm really sad I had to leave this list actually I had two songs I had to leave off my list I'm Gonna Get You which I love, I love that song and Mr. Moon, I like that song I usually think of Keyboard Mania when I think of that song so I dumped it yes, you gotta pick one off Dave
5528607	5530488	Okay, well, I can't pick my own off.
5531589	5534310	So, I guess I'll take Primal Soul off.
5534370	5535531	Primal Soul.
5537032	5538072	You bastard.
5538372	5539073	Oh, my turn.
5539093	5543155	It's a good song, but I thought it was the worst.
5543215	5544096	This is hard.
5544156	5545376	I actually like all of these.
5550699	5555342	I'm going to take off... Oh, this is really hard.
5555382	5556823	I actually kind of like all these songs.
5556863	5557023	Yeah.
5557043	5557263	Yeah.
5558997	5559618	Liar Liar.
5559758	5560780	I'm going to take off Liar Liar.
5561200	5561741	I'm sorry.
5561841	5564324	It's just... Oh, Liar Liar.
5565546	5570772	I just... Yeah, Liar Liar is... Out of that list is my least favorite, but those were all good choices.
5571473	5571674	So...
5572538	5575539	Now we're going to post the full list into the chat room.
5576180	5582202	And you're going to send me your votes over private message in the chat room from the list that we have.
5582642	5584663	So send me your choice from this list.
5584683	5586484	You can't vote for anything not on this list.
5586524	5587204	That's the way it works.
5587324	5595767	From this list of the eight songs we have, Eraser Engine, Sanagi, Double Trouble, Carnival, Fireball, Giant Slug, Least 100 Seconds, and Haru Spring.
5595807	5597508	Send me your vote for your favorite song.
5597748	5600150	Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Song.
5600410	5600911	Private Message.
5600931	5603853	And we're going to take a quick break while you send those over Private Message.
5603873	5605474	You're only going to have about three minutes.
5605514	5608656	I'm going to play a quick song from the Dance Mania series.
5609837	5610998	And that's all the time you get.
5611098	5614641	So let's play from the Dance Mania series.
5616743	5619184	You want to do... No, that's Trans Party.
5619945	5621326	That's not Dance Mania.
5621346	5624789	We're going to do... I don't know.
5624829	5625249	I'm thinking.
5625289	5625809	Let's do...
5628328	5629409	Let's do Tears in May.
5630209	5632150	You get three minutes while we listen to Missing Heart.
5632170	5634251	These are the people that did Moonlight Shadow, by the way.
5634591	5635672	This is Tears in May.
5635692	5639093	You got three minutes to vote in the chat room over a private message.
5639974	5642775	The list, listless, here on Orange Laundry.
5674087	5676023	Thank you for watching!
5717809	5720668	and when the moon is shined with clouds
5768179	5770465	Thank you for watching!
5797009	5798733	And wash my love away
5835905	5839708	One more song for you while we tabulate the scores real fast for our listless segment.
5840348	5844932	Five, two, three, two, one.
5844952	5847173	Five, two, three, two, one.
5871353	5872616	Thanks for watching!
5918010	5922976	With the ping pong ball
5935450	5946898	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we have tabulated the votes for our listless segment with the best guitar freak slash drum mania song ever.
5947398	5948459	Very, very close.
5948519	5949700	Very scientific process.
5949720	5951521	You have some very, very close voting there.
5951641	5956365	Yeah, we kind of did... Oh, I need to go quickly.
5956405	5957846	We did Rock Paper Scissors.
5958246	5958826	Yes, so...
5960171	5968854	The winner, no, third place winner, the third place best Guitar Freaks Drum Mania song ever is Fireball.
5969934	5974036	Yay.
5974516	5976217	Fireball is the third place winner.
5976897	5985160	Second place, which would be the first place loser, second place Guitar Freaks song, Drum Mania, Haru Spring.
5986175	5987877	I have to beat this fanfare thing to the ground.
5987897	5991320	Okay, that's twice in like one minute.
5991421	5992161	Yeah, anyway.
6005126	6012928	Least 100 seconds is the winner of bestest ever Guitar Freaks Drum Mania song.
6013388	6013708	Hooray.
6013928	6016689	Don't do that to Bradley's controller.
6016709	6017249	He'll beat you up.
6017969	6019970	I think I'd be more worried about the microphone.
6020250	6020990	Whoa.
6024171	6024831	What are you doing?
6024851	6026032	Oh, you're doing the webcam.
6026212	6027132	Thanks for the webcam.
6028486	6036813	If you want to look at the webcam, the super secret location is only available in our chatroom at Channel Pound Orange Lounge on any other side IRC server.
6037313	6040136	Same server that hosts a lot of the Big Bomani chatrooms.
6041096	6041417	So...
6042432	6043332	What else do we want to talk about?
6043352	6044733	We've got 20 minutes left on the show.
6045253	6048695	Jamie's not here to vent about anything this week because she's out of town.
6048775	6056118	She's at Step Squad convention or some kind of meeting for her team there, which includes some out of town folks that she's interviewing.
6056518	6058379	I can do a preemptive fuck you over the week.
6058579	6059499	Okay, go for it.
6060860	6061580	You downloaded the music.
6061680	6062901	Yeah, I haven't unpacked it though yet.
6063441	6065702	You've got to wait for me to do that before you can go.
6066142	6067342	Do that and we'll do it.
6067382	6069403	Alright.
6069663	6070904	You got anything you want to talk about, Matt?
6071758	6074521	Yes, what are you doing, Dave?
6074541	6076622	One second.
6076662	6076963	Webcam.
6077523	6078404	Oh my god.
6078424	6080226	Turn off your webcams.
6081126	6083769	If you have a brain, you'll turn off the webcam for about a minute.
6085450	6087392	Yeah, but see, now everyone will turn it on.
6088353	6091135	We have a request for you to do the Black Mage, whatever that means.
6093137	6093377	Dave.
6093598	6094719	Well, what's the Black Mage?
6094879	6095900	I really have no idea.
6095920	6097121	Tell Dave to do the Black Mage.
6097481	6098062	I have a request.
6100720	6105563	Black Maid, what am I doing?
6106584	6107964	This is what they saw, by the way, huh?
6108265	6109245	Oh, it's too blurry!
6109846	6111106	It's a crotch shot!
6111126	6115329	It looks like a gynecology appointment!
6119731	6123594	What you just saw there was the official background for DDR God Mix.
6125395	6127356	Don't inflate your ego anymore.
6128036	6128397	I am God.
6128417	6129377	I am more than it needs to be.
6129697	6130358	Hi, what's up?
6133928	6134850	Oh, okay, yes.
6135150	6136152	Glenn is clarifying.
6136192	6138116	The Black Mage is this.
6139259	6143788	If you ever read... Do you want to tell us about the story behind the Black Mage, Glenn, who's just joined us in the room?
6144995	6154161	Black Mage is the most popular character on 8-bit theater, which is a Final Fantasy 1 sprite comic that's insanely, insanely funny.
6156422	6158643	And Black Mage is the shit, basically.
6159264	6162666	You gotta hold it for 12 seconds.
6162786	6164487	Yeah, so... No.
6164727	6164927	Go.
6165227	6165487	Hold it.
6165508	6165487	5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
6173896	6174637	It's the Black Mage.
6180199	6181100	Did we do it correctly?
6181780	6182180	23rd Megas?
6183121	6183561	I don't know.
6184141	6185762	Buddy Jesus, it's Buddy Christ.
6188444	6189184	Dogma reference.
6190925	6191786	and Wee!
6191986	6192386	Okay.
6192707	6194748	Since Jamie's not here, I have to give a big Wee!
6195209	6195769	Because she's not here.
6195990	6197331	Where did she... There is a Wee.
6197391	6198932	I have a Jamie Wee file, actually.
6198972	6200133	It's in one of the other promos.
6200193	6202195	It's, uh... Hold on, let me get Jamie's Wee.
6203396	6203596	Wait.
6204197	6204397	Wait.
6205218	6205518	Dammit.
6206599	6206899	Dammit!
6210142	6210482	There it is.
6210882	6211963	There's Jamie doing Wee.
6212043	6213024	That's in one of the other promos.
6215662	6228008	Matt has attached the cam to his head, but since it only takes a picture like every 20 seconds, it doesn't really work like one of those extreme sport people, you know, where you see it from their point of view.
6228488	6233490	It's just kind of like random clip of what Matt might see if you were standing on top of his head.
6233530	6237392	Extreme sports, falling off the cliff, you see him falling off the cliff, then you see him dead on the ground.
6237872	6239393	Yeah, it's like you can see him clip...
6240043	6245065	preparing to pull the cord, and then you just kind of see the cam scattered on the ground.
6245446	6247226	It's like, what happened in those 20 seconds?
6247907	6252709	Well, you know, I guess the cord kind of failed, and then the second... What the hell am I talking about?
6254570	6259332	The show has just gotten so much... I know, the show has gotten so stupid, but people are still listening, go figure.
6259472	6259933	I'm sorry.
6260913	6261513	I'm sorry.
6261533	6262934	It's the terrible heat.
6263114	6265235	It's the California heat, we blame it on that.
6265255	6267016	Oh my god, it got up to like 80 today.
6268077	6268657	What's wrong?
6271595	6275625	Yeah, people just look at us like... I have a Bomani-related topic we could discuss.
6276166	6276908	Okay, how about this?
6278211	6278973	Internet rankings.
6280047	6285428	Is there any way that you think internet ranking for the various games out there could be improved?
6285528	6289369	Besides having more than just a crappy USA internet ranking competition in the US.
6289649	6293170	Like, you know how they have the Max 2 internet ranking for various songs you could do?
6293910	6301532	There's the 2DX internet ranking, which is really popular right now for Sixth Style at Home, which Dave is giving the thumbs down to because he can't rank on it.
6302450	6312741	The stick style thing is cool because it's at home, and so you're already at home and stuff, but the Max 2 one, first of all, you have to write down, I think it's 16 digits or numbers or letters or combine something.
6312901	6313301	Numbers!
6314703	6321129	No, it's not the fact that you have to have a pen and paper ready to be able to record it.
6321149	6324632	Well, hello, if you're playing internet ranking, would you think, gee, uh...
6325734	6334118	All you gotta do, on the PlayStation version, you go into Records, and then you hit, I believe, the Select key when it shows your scores, and it'll show you the internet ranking password.
6335379	6338421	Oh, oh, you're talking about on Home version.
6338601	6339361	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
6339381	6340222	You were talking about the arcades.
6340242	6340582	I'm sorry.
6340662	6341582	I'm sorry, Dave.
6341743	6343483	But if you use a memory card, it'll save it.
6343884	6344344	Just so you know.
6345064	6346465	And you know what's awesome?
6346905	6349046	If you do it playing Versus, it crashes the machine.
6349867	6350767	Whoa, that is pretty cool.
6351067	6351928	No, but first of all...
6352521	6356424	It takes three great fields of unlaziness to do this.
6357065	6361649	First, you have to have a pen and piece of paper and a pen or pencil ready.
6362289	6364932	Then you have to waste three songs.
6364972	6371177	Well, not necessarily waste, but play three songs that you wouldn't normally play just so you can get the internet ranking.
6371757	6375460	Play them on probably a difficulty that you wouldn't want to or, you know, whatever.
6375521	6375861	I don't know.
6376941	6379381	Don't play internet ranking, shit.
6379441	6382642	And then you have to write them down quickly, and then go home.
6383402	6385162	Wait, stop grabbing the mic.
6385282	6386523	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
6386983	6387483	Don't talk.
6388903	6390983	God damn it, I'm one of the co-hosts of the show.
6391323	6392284	You're the co-host.
6392384	6393464	I'm the new host.
6394204	6399405	And then you have to go home and actually go on the computer, which I really do not like using computers.
6401365	6403686	By the way, we're on internet radio right now.
6403726	6406066	You might want to keep the computer bashing a little light.
6407000	6408000	Don't have for days.
6408100	6411861	No, I'm just saying, like, I cannot use computers.
6412301	6413662	I try to go on the internet.
6414002	6416903	It's like, you have lost all the memory on your computer.
6417043	6418803	Your computer is now shutting down.
6419403	6420984	That's not our fault.
6421004	6425185	It's like a special email has been sent to a little midget who will come and kill you now.
6425465	6426145	I don't know.
6427105	6428646	Yeah, I've gotten those messages before.
6428966	6429786	They're not true, are they?
6431114	6431514	I don't know.
6432115	6432995	Have the midgets come yet?
6434456	6434836	I don't know.
6434876	6436297	Those little kids have been threatening me.
6436337	6437337	They could have been midgets.
6437717	6438518	I don't know this.
6439258	6443940	No, midgets you can... Sorry, if there's any midgets out there, midgets are awesome.
6444241	6445061	And they really are.
6445521	6446322	Itty bitty gang bang.
6447362	6448683	Oh, nasty.
6448723	6452265	A special F you for all those Greek midgets out there.
6452865	6453105	Oh, yeah.
6454088	6455069	Yeah, what was that all about?
6455129	6456090	Greek midgets are awesome.
6456550	6457651	That was so last hour.
6457711	6461354	Anyway, what do you suggest they do then, Dave?
6461394	6463236	Just have an internet ranking on your honor?
6463596	6466499	You know, oh yeah, Eiffel comboed Max Unlimited.
6466699	6467580	No, not that.
6468120	6469601	I'm number one in the world.
6469621	6470282	That's crap.
6470662	6479050	No, I think that they should hook all the Max 2 arcade machines up to the internet so it kind of like tells you your ranking as you put it in.
6479410	6481251	That and have a webcam that records your...
6482032	6487316	You know, so it's like, I say I full perfect max unlimited three times and somehow get to see it.
6487577	6488417	No, stop grabbing the mic.
6488718	6507613	So you're suggesting that Roosevelt Golf Land spend, or any golf land, or any arcade with a max two machine, which is just about everywhere these days, spend thousands of dollars to get a DSL brought in next to the machine, and just so you can have internet rankings, so you can make a pathetic attempt at being the best DDR player in the nation.
6508948	6509949	Well, I know I'm not the best.
6510229	6511571	But, um, not any arcade.
6511731	6513092	Every arcade needs to do this.
6513693	6515154	It shouldn't be like a specialty.
6515234	6517716	It should be part of the machine.
6518057	6521320	You know, it should have like a... You're forgetting they're all illegal anyway.
6521360	6522180	They're all bootlegs.
6523241	6525684	So get the illegal bootleg DSL whatever.
6526364	6526965	And then, um...
6527997	6529499	Hold on.
6529759	6542353	So, let's say, you know, I full perfect everything, and it says, yay, you are number one, congratulations, and then, you know, you see, it's kind of like the Soul Calibur 2 thing, you know, with your armies fighting against each other.
6543213	6545516	Your DDR armies fighting against each other.
6546297	6548219	I full perfect something, and it's like...
6548699	6552081	Corey already did this, you are poser, or something like that.
6552541	6559204	Conquest mode in DDR would be stupid because everybody would pick on MGL, and you know it.
6559524	6561725	MGL would be gone in five seconds.
6562706	6574211	I'm not sure how long we'd last though, because we've got a constant stream of people playing, but most of the people, sorry if you're listening, I do this a lot, are pretty bad, except for like us.
6576048	6579730	Us being sacramentals who know each other.
6581251	6581731	Yeah.
6581931	6584613	Because lots of these new sacramentals don't know them.
6584793	6587935	Anyways, let's get off this rant because it's kind of boring.
6588535	6589235	Give the mic back, Dave.
6591197	6591737	Dave's pouting.
6592509	6595870	Let's see, other things coming up we should talk about.
6596411	6598011	I guess I can give a little plug for me.
6598291	6599672	It's my birthday on Wednesday!
6599912	6600653	Yay!
6601833	6604954	Wednesday, there was something about Wednesday that was important.
6606295	6607655	Something I was supposed to remember.
6608416	6610597	Some other kind of anniversary, I forget.
6611277	6612358	Oh, yes, yes, yes.
6613178	6613898	How could I forget?
6613938	6615759	If I turn on the TV, they keep reminding me.
6616079	6617580	Your birthday happens to be on September 11th, huh?
6618740	6622455	Another important data is that supposedly my cable is supposed to be installed.
6622837	6624302	Probably AT&T is going to fuck it up.
6626470	6634597	Yes, and also, if you calculate the hours correctly, that's the time that I will be finished downloading the porn that I am starting to download now.
6634737	6636578	It will be finished by September.
6636818	6637539	No, I swear.
6637999	6640842	It will take like 100, like 400 hours or something.
6640862	6643704	Who cares about the porn, Dave?
6643824	6645565	What are you planning to do to celebrate your birthday?
6645605	6647527	What are you planning to do to celebrate your birthday?
6647587	6649409	I'm throwing a Bomani party.
6650349	6652390	That's right, you're throwing the Big Bomani Party next weekend.
6652471	6652751	Yes.
6653011	6657013	Maybe we'll do something, we'll have to tape something for Orange Lounge there, I don't know what, but we'll do something.
6657093	6664178	It'll be fun, I'll have my sim set up with the metal pads and all that fun stuff, and I'll be making burgers.
6664238	6665579	Is it next weekend or Wednesday?
6665759	6666679	It's on Saturday.
6666799	6667360	Okay, good.
6667740	6671442	Because, like, if it was the weekend, then I wouldn't, or the weekday, because I wouldn't be able to.
6672083	6673404	Yeah, Wednesday, I don't know.
6673424	6676285	My parents are cool in case they're listening, but they're not.
6677006	6677106	And...
6678067	6682249	Yeah, but see, I can't go on weekdays because I'm trapped in my house.
6682310	6683770	Yeah.
6683790	6690374	See, on Friday we're going down to the Winchester Mystery House to do a midnight tour.
6690434	6691035	That sounds fun.
6691075	6692035	Friday the 13th.
6692395	6694276	So we're going to do that because that'll be fun.
6694557	6696658	And then Saturday at my party and stuff.
6697198	6700060	And everyone's invited, so come crash the party if you want.
6701036	6704298	I'm being reminded of something in the chat room that's going on right now as we speak.
6724443	6724583	Dansu?
6724663	6724863	Dansu?
6724883	6724984	Dansu?
6725004	6725104	Dansu?
6748593	6749854	You have to explain this to me.
6750494	6758482	Basically, the plot was they go to Japan to find Hank's, the main character's, half-brother or something, because there was some love grandfather thing.
6758863	6768572	And anyway, they see DDR on this giant screen, you know, it's on one of the mega screens, broadcasting in basically a Times Square type of place.
6769313	6771215	And so, you know, the...
6771949	6779234	The main character's son goes up there and starts playing and busts out to, I think it was, was it Kung Fu Fighting?
6779254	6779815	Shake Your Booty.
6780275	6783357	No, it wasn't Shake... That's the way I like it.
6783417	6784218	That's the way I like it.
6784258	6784898	No, that was later.
6784918	6786039	It was the ceramic slot.
6786099	6786659	Baby got back.
6787580	6794365	And then what happened was this girl comes up and it's kind of like funny romance off of DDR.
6795305	6798127	And they've got the, I forget, the robot characters.
6798187	6798828	I forget their names.
6800492	6802313	Casento, or whatever that is.
6802794	6804175	I think I just put Rob to sleep.
6805595	6807717	Well, King of the Hill usually puts me to sleep.
6807757	6808918	I don't find the show funny at all.
6809078	6810939	Anyway, you don't like propane?
6811399	6813501	I'd like to talk about this new... Yes, Matt?
6817429	6818029	Are you finished?
6818230	6818950	May I finish?
6819150	6819551	Can I finish?
6819711	6820331	Can I finish?
6820351	6820731	Can I finish?
6821132	6827616	Anyways, I'd like to talk about this new TV show that's actually on Comedy Central that's an old British show called Trigger Happy TV.
6828337	6829237	This thing is damn funny.
6829658	6831839	I mean, British... Is it related to Vimani?
6833100	6833540	It could be.
6833580	6834681	I haven't watched the whole thing.
6834701	6836843	It's got music in it.
6839022	6840963	Oh, okay, just like DDR, they both have music.
6841103	6841744	Okay, well done.
6841764	6842544	I don't know, shit.
6842564	6844146	Well, okay, tell us more about this show.
6844806	6845687	It's hilarious.
6845807	6846267	I don't know.
6847288	6848949	Betsy, you've worn it out of me.
6849069	6850550	I don't feel like talking about it anymore.
6851270	6852651	Do I wear you out, Matt?
6852671	6853132	I'm sorry.
6853192	6853752	Sometimes.
6854813	6855393	I don't know.
6856154	6860116	Anyways, yeah, so they have it on there, and it's cool, and yeah.
6861657	6862298	Anyways...
6864045	6868487	And in the chat room, 23rd Magus says he's going to come to your Be-Money party.
6869207	6869607	Alrighty.
6869667	6872628	To celebrate Konami's famous Be-Money series.
6873328	6874409	Hey, I'll actually get to meet him.
6874469	6878030	Because I've tried to meet him numerous times and it never worked.
6878110	6880691	Actually, it was in the same arcade once and I never saw him again.
6881181	6882442	It'll be a Kodak moment, I'm sure.
6882462	6882962	I'm surprised.
6883002	6884483	You know, it was funny.
6884503	6888385	I thought people would come to my QZAR trip since it was just me and that guy.
6888525	6889305	I was broke.
6889445	6891707	I really wanted to go, but I'm so broke.
6891767	6892287	I'm sorry.
6892507	6893407	We'll do it next time.
6893488	6898210	And then the Bomani party, it sounds like there's going to be tons of people there, and I was expecting there to be like five people.
6898410	6898790	Well, hey.
6900649	6902390	Yeah, the more the merrier.
6902750	6906571	I think I have an empty house that night, so hopefully we won't be waking anyone up.
6907011	6908011	And my neighbors suck.
6908091	6908831	I hate my neighbors.
6909092	6910972	A special F you to my freaking neighbors.
6912092	6918854	Because this dumbass, I guess her boyfriend moved in next door, and he parks his truck.
6919094	6924136	Because we're in a court, and instead of parking along the curb, he actually parks perpendicular to the curb.
6924236	6927377	So his truck is taking up half of our driveway.
6929073	6929654	He's a bastard.
6929894	6951112	Do you think Bomani parties, getting together and playing, to make this more of a topic everybody can relate to than just people who are within driving distance of Loki's house, do you think Bomani parties are a cool thing to do once in a while, get together and just play all the home versions, or do you think maybe we ought to go to the arcade to play these things, or is it more fun because at home you can drink and play DDR?
6951332	6955576	Although if you go to Dave & Buster's at home you can drink and play DDR too, but just hypothetically.
6956056	6956697	I think it's fun.
6957361	6959962	Wait, does anyone else have Vimani parties?
6961043	6961523	I'm sure.
6962063	6962524	I'm sure.
6962564	6963764	Friends get together, play Vimani.
6964485	6966385	Shit, man, people have LAN parties.
6966485	6967266	I mean, come on.
6967926	6968446	They have what?
6968967	6969547	LAN parties.
6969627	6974549	Local Area Networks, where you play network games like Quake 3 and that kind of crap, and you hook computers up.
6974569	6976270	Uh-oh, Quake 3.
6976750	6977551	Look out.
6977951	6979812	We're going to... I don't know what the game's about.
6980200	6987938	It doesn't matter, there's parties for everything It's point and shoot, that's all it is People get together to watch like, you know, I Love Lucy shows and that kind of shit
6989497	6990918	Dave with the stupid webcam.
6990958	6994581	Anyways, so, yeah, I think it's a good idea that people get together.
6994661	6998464	Anything that will bring people together to actually be able to enjoy something will be great.
6998584	7000965	So, whether it be an arcade or whatnot.
7001205	7003907	Okay, it's about time to close the show, but a closing thought.
7004168	7007590	What would be the absolute worst thing that you could do at a Bomani party?
7007630	7010152	Say you're going to a Bomani party for the first time as a newbie.
7010552	7011853	Absolute worst thing you could do?
7012233	7012914	Show up on the wrong day.
7015543	7021545	What do you think, absolute worst thing you could do at a Bomani party your first time?
7021585	7022285	Dave, you have any ideas?
7023205	7025006	The absolute worst thing?
7025406	7031748	Well, first I could think about getting really drunk and playing naked, but I'm guessing that you could do worse stuff than that.
7031968	7040030	Well, I don't know, because I mean, that party that you had a while back, it wasn't really a Bomani party, but all these people that played Bomani showed up, and so it kind of turned into one.
7040695	7051522	Um, where, uh, I think, Ryan Samumangus, or Magus, or whatever, um, he put on his girlfriend's clothes and started parrying.
7052763	7054084	That was really bad.
7054104	7061128	Like, it looked like a tutu slash, like, he looked very, very fruity.
7061588	7062149	Sorry, Rob.
7062549	7063269	He said it's okay.
7063289	7063570	Yeah.
7063670	7063810	Yeah.
7068123	7069063	Any ideas from Bradley?
7071484	7072605	Hello, whoops, my bad.
7072845	7073465	I'm sorry, yes.
7073946	7075146	Any further ideas, Bradley?
7075306	7081289	Like breaking people's machines or playing Let Them Move for the first time.
7081509	7082449	Wow!
7082929	7083730	Let Them Move!
7084310	7084750	Awesome!
7084910	7088312	Actually, now that I flashback to my first Bimani party, what was it?
7088352	7090433	My modded pad got broken.
7091733	7092274	Oh, shit.
7092634	7094294	I remember my first Bimani party.
7094895	7095275	It was...
7096508	7097149	Oh, wait, no, I don't.
7097229	7098730	Well, I remember one Bomani party.
7098810	7104636	It involved people getting drunk and, you know, dressing up in their girlfriend's clothes and playing para.
7105697	7106918	That was funny because it wasn't me.
7107379	7112504	I'm going to have to agree with the chat room that the absolute worst thing you could do at your first Bomani party is para naked.
7113585	7114466	Para naked.
7114626	7117249	You could, like, dick whip across the thing.
7117349	7117669	Or, um...
7121019	7123264	Another bad thing would be trying to play DDR in the pool.
7123545	7124707	Would be another bad idea.
7125429	7128175	Don't take your PS2 in the pool.
7128997	7130660	You can play DDR on thin ice.
7131998	7133339	I'd love to see that on a game show.
7133559	7135059	DDR on Ice.
7135219	7139121	You've referenced this before, but that game... Stomp, stomp.
7139341	7140541	Oh, wait, I've got like 30 seconds.
7141102	7146744	The thing where you get it wrong and the floor drops out from under you, what's that show called?
7146764	7147324	Russian Roulette.
7147404	7148024	Russian Roulette.
7148244	7155067	Like DDR Russian, you hit a wrong note and the floor just drops out from under you, so you're like trying to step, and then the floor goes bye-bye.
7155307	7156948	That's like So Goonies, okay?
7160030	7177365	Baby Ruth And Rob came up with a good idea for a new show DDR on Ice With Ryan Boitano And John Tesh announcing Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp to my beat Stomp to my beat, stomp to my beat
7178564	7179565	This player of DDR.
7179905	7181646	He has such a terrible youth.
7182146	7183387	He grew up in the slums.
7184668	7187410	And now he plays DDR and he gets money that way.
7187850	7188911	He's won tournaments.
7189411	7191192	And it just breaks my heart.
7193454	7196876	So, for those who don't know, this is the most Bradley's ever talked.
7197496	7197776	Ever.
7198057	7202920	Like, cumulative in this two hours, he's talked more than he's ever talked in his entire life.
7203340	7204881	You heard he here on Orange Lounge first.
7205661	7205762	And...
7206986	7208927	It's kind of funny to know that I actually had a radio show one time.
7209267	7209687	Really?
7210287	7211587	I have tapes of it.
7211767	7213148	Oh, I've got to hear this stuff.
7213328	7214308	I got really crazy on it.
7214468	7215589	I used to have a college radio show, too.
7215609	7217409	But anyway, we're past 9 o'clock.
7217429	7218149	We've got to end the show.
7218749	7219830	Big thank you to everybody listening.
7219870	7223211	Big thanks to Loki, tonight's honorary co-host.
7223751	7224871	Any final words, Loki?
7228772	7229072	No.
7229673	7234194	I wish Dave would stop playing at the webcam, but yeah.
7235515	7236336	No, nothing really.
7237397	7239499	Any final thoughts from Dave, the cam whore?
7240781	7243263	Webcam is my friend.
7243704	7244805	Any final thoughts from Bradley?
7245566	7248609	Team members, go somewhere else to neck and play with each other.
7249070	7249430	Alright.
7249830	7252173	And my final thought of the day...
7253877	7254818	My Mouth of the Day.
7255419	7256060	Whee!
7256360	7257101	Okay, that's it.
7257361	7257742	End of show.
