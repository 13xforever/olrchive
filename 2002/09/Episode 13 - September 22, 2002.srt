1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a video tape! Put it in, put it in!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Boring!

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This DDR SUCKS!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
She layed pins on her ass, eh?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The last Metroid is in captivity.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The galaxy is at peace.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My kind of people and assholes.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
One.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Warner.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He's good.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,640
fit by that much. That's Dr. Evil's cat. How can you tell? I never forget a pussy.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,360
37! My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks! In a row? And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,200
You are the weakest link to the fight. So you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:50,120
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count. I would like, if I may, to take you

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:59,120
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Sky. Do I look like the weather girl?

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Everything alright? Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Orange Lounge Radio.

25
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,120
We are live, and this is episode number 13 for September the 22nd of 2002.

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,120
You're tuned in to the Bamani Scene's most stupendous radio station of all things Bamane.

27
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,120
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skye.

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
This is 14?

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Where's 14?

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Are you sure?

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Yes.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
No, no, no, 10.5 was the one at Golf Land.

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
That wasn't really 11.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
And then 11 was the week that Jamie came back, and 12 was...

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
This is 14.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Well, then we're not going to have an episode 13.

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
We're skipping it like hotels do.

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,120
You want to make this episode 14?

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
13.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Okay, 13.

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
So lucky 13.

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
13.3? 13.2?

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:59,120
The voice you might hear in the background is always resident happy bunny.

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Please say hello to Jamie Summers.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
also known as Dark Secular?

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Hey, don't forget about Harvey, he has to know...

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Who's who?

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
He has to pick up...

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Your imaginary friend?

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Didn't you see that movie with Harvey?

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
No.

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Okay, I have to give him proper hi.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Okay.

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Hi, give me caffeine and money.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Now, please.

56
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,120
You are tuned in to the Bamani Scene's most stupendous radio station of all things Bamani.

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,120
It's a small intimate house tonight, but we're going to have fun with this anyway.

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,620
We are joined by a very large panel tonight, a panel of one. Say hello.

59
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Dark Sacral.

60
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,620
I hate nature!

61
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,120
Tonight's just a technical mess up show.

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,620
I hate nature! I wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell!

63
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,620
I'm really out of it going into tonight's show, by the way.

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,620
Say hello, everybody, to Loki.

65
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,620
Hello, everybody.

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,620
Say hi again.

67
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,620
Hello again.

68
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,120
Who's again?

69
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,120
Oh, we have a doorbell. Somebody else is here. I guess we'll see who that is.

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
We'll be talking to everybody...

71
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
They better have money. We will take bribes to be on the show.

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,120
You know what? Why don't we just say the hell with Orange Lounge? We'll almost be two hours of just us just kind of ranting about everything crappy.

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,120
It is Dave. Say hi to Dave.

74
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Say hello everybody to the...

75
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Hell, Victoria!

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,960
We'll be talking to everybody a little more a bit later, but first I'm going to take a

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
quick break.

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,560
So that people can go pee.

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,680
Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
What's our deal?

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
All right.

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,160
We'll get to those FUs of the week.

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,200
If you want to send me your FUs of the week, just join our chat room.

84
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,200
you're just going to join any other side IRC server, like IRC.Akeheads.org, and you're

85
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,480

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:00,480

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,800
bengals suck

96
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Let's start with some sauna shall we

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Tell me, was this true?

98
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,800
When you do leave the edge passing by

99
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,800
No one cares to stop

100
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Can you see me fall above?

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Do you share my frozen memories?

102
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Set it down

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Let it be alone

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Silent time

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,800
There ain't none of us

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Let us love the heat

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Please give me brand new star of mine

108
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Just a game

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Once more

110
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Let's not fake me

111
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Please give me brave one yesterday

112
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
It's not for me

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Take my hand

114
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:33,760
Let it snow face me

115
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,760
I know, I know, what you need is I know, I know, what you need is

116
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,760
I do, I do, what you want in crisis I know, I know

117
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,760
In my face, being just for you

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,760
You'll be the funny girl, happy when me down

119
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
And we'll meet in love before ever

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,760
You're such a lovely girl, this one is a girl

121
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Now this one is amazing, baby, see the baby

122
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,760
You're a lovely girl, lovely darling girl

123
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,760
I've been living on it for a long while

124
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,760
You'll be here, everywhere, in the air

125
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,960
Diggy diggy, how's your nigga?

126
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,260
I need a lovely girl, where's he when he can?

127
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,760
And when we don't love people there, I hope

128
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
That the lovely girl, be a quality girl

129
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,460
Not only for me, but really, hey, she's getting ready

130
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Need a lovely girl, lovely girl nigga

131
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,960
Flying and living, love, need a fly for a while

132
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,160
So be me anywhere, in the air

133
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm diggin', diggin', I'm goin' again

134
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,200
They kind of...

135
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,760
It was kind of like an abstraction of your voice. It was paint. It was modern art.

136
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,100
I like that.

137
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,280
Anywho...

138
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,300
I sound cooler than that.

139
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,160
That was cool though. It was like, you know, it was like you were swallowing...

140
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,920
You were swallowing a butterfly. Orange lounge.

141
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,580
Oh boy, oh boy.

142
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,600
Let's see. What do we want to talk about at the start of the show? Should we talk about DDR Max USA?

143
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,360
whole lot of news on DDR Max USA this week. Should we talk about some of that?

144
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,640
Obviously the most obvious news about the new mix, the Max USA, is that one of the new

145
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:11,000
licensed songs has been confirmed. So we do know that there will be a song, and I'm trying

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,100
to pull up the full name of the song here, I forgot it off the top of my head. Thank

147
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,500
you. Thank you. It's called Dark Black Forest Short Trip and it's by Steve Reiner. And this

148
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,540
This news was confirmed through his site.

149
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,500
He said on his official site, hey, I've got this song going on DDR Max soon.

150
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,620
Actually, it was like a Dutch site, though, so it was more like, you know, oh, it was

151
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,900
German, so it was like, ah, we've got DDR Max, ooh.

152
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
I know, for Wienerschmückel.

153
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,900
No.

154
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,300
You know what, that's, though, I think it's pretty cool.

155
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,100
I've heard a little bit of it, and the song is really cool.

156
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,940
We're going to play a demo version of that song for you in a little bit.

157
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,920
We got like a two-minute demo mix of that song we're going to play for you.

158
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,280
This probably isn't the four-minute real media file you've seen floating out the internet

159
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,900
elsewhere.

160
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,320
This is another take on the song.

161
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,120
So we don't know which version exactly is going to be in DDR, but we'll see.

162
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,760
We do know that this song, in one way or another, is going to show up in DDR Max.

163
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,280
Sorry for asking, but when exactly does Max USA get released?

164
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,440
I don't know.

165
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,700
I believe the release date tentatively right now is November 5th.

166
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,340
I had been hearing that it was supposed to be right after Thanksgiving for the first

167
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,300
day of the Christmas shopping season.

168
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,740
So we've heard everything in November.

169
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,660
However, I actually pulled up an article here.

170
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,880
This comes from SoCalKicks' site, available at SoCalKicks.com, and he actually had a chance

171
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,780
to talk with Jason Enos, who is the, if you're online on any of the forums, I'm sure you

172
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,380
know him as the Konami of America representative and they talked about a

173
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:49,020
few couple things about DDR Max USA including foot ratings will be in DDR

174
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,060
Max USA if you remember one big bitch about DDR Max the Japanese version when

175
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,340
it first came out hit arcades that they replaced it with that groove radar and

176
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,460
while that radar is cool it doesn't really tell you how hard a song is on a

177
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:08,300
scale you know the cadence and everything so but you know the the one

178
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,860
One good thing about the Groove Radar is that it does show you what type of song you're

179
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,780
going to play, if you're stronger at doing lots of jumps or if you're stronger at doing

180
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,420
running moves.

181
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,080
That is one good thing about the Groove Radar.

182
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,700
So you can still say, oh these are the 9-footers, these are the katas I have to pass.

183
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,620
It's going to make me run all over the place.

184
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,980
Next thing, it will append with DDR economics.

185
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,380
sure how this is going to work. I have a hard time fathoming this as being a disk change,

186
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,700
just like the kind of disk change you would see when third mix, the Japanese third mix,

187
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,180
you could put in second and first mix and play things on the new interface.

188
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,060
It actually is possible.

189
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,820
Maybe that is what they're going to do, but it seems kind of...

190
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,460
If you think about it...

191
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,660
Between a PlayStation 2 game and a PlayStation 1 game, it seems a little...

192
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,140
Well, if you think about it this way, all they have to do is actually load the game

193
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:07,740
engine itself into memory, and then have it run songs off of the disk.

194
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,940
maybe that's what they're gonna do is that would be very cool that was

195
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,500
actually something I said I remember getting on form saying hey that would be

196
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,380
awesome if they could do something like that at a pound especially I would have

197
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,220
liked to have seen it not only that but economics append the USA mix but I guess

198
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,740
we'll see it's a smart move it'll help them make more money for people who

199
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,740
don't have it unfortunately they're still keeping some of the same songs on

200
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,340
a DDR max USA that they had on economics and on

201
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:39,340
But not too many, and we do know that there's what, like 20 lysa songs and 20 konami, something

202
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
like that.

203
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,680
I don't know exactly how the breakdown of songs works, and we're probably not going

204
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,420
to know exactly for sure until we get a finalized song list, but it's going to be significant.

205
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,340
Will there be freeze arrows in edits?

206
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
I would think so.

207
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,860
Yeah, if it's based off the max Japanese, you can do freezes in the max Japanese editing,

208
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,680
I don't see why he wouldn't be able to do it in the US.

209
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,600
And one more thing, it probably won't be like Conomics, but will the edits be able to be

210
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,000
played on the machines in the arcade?

211
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,200
No, because they're region coded, so it ain't going to work.

212
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
There is one thing though...

213
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,560
I don't know, couldn't you take Conomics edits and play them on a fourth mix machine?

214
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
No, you couldn't.

215
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I don't remember, I never tried.

216
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,280
The only thing that I would think might even be possible, and this is what I'm wondering

217
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,700
if anyone's tried with Conomics, there's a little program for people who have a DEX drive.

218
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:40,940
There's two things for edits that kind of set them out to work in a machine or not.

219
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,500
You have region coding and then you also have it keeps track of what mix the actual thing

220
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
was on.

221
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,220
Like I took a economics edit and changed it to a Japanese so it would play but it didn't

222
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,540
work because it still detected that it was made from economics so it's not going to work.

223
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,700
rewrites its name on it so you can actually have max link data with the

224
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,420
songs like you know max to exclusive things like the whistle song have grades

225
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,860
for that so it looks very interesting just kind of looking for some feedback

226
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:46,660
in the chat room there is so Cal kicks wants to make it a point that there you

227
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,980
don't know if a new USA mix is going to come out or not yet it's still it's

228
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,380
still a possibility they may may be a new u.s. mix still and who knows what's

229
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,260
to happen with the arcade. Way better, I mean freaking Europe is starting to get a lead

230
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:06,420
on us so we can't have the Europeans beating us, come on. No way. I understand a bunch

231
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,820
of them aren't really that pleased with EuroMix 2. Unfortunately they are going to be releasing

232
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,580
another mix for EuroMix that's going to be kind of fixing everything that they don't

233
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,220
like about EuroMix 2. I wonder if that's going to be really going to happen or not. Yeah,

234
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:32,460
it's like, okay, EuroMix II versus DDR USA. True, true. Real contest there. One more thing

235
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,040
we should point out that arise from this interview between SoCal Kicks and Jason Enos, it will

236
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,320
have licensed tracks from already released Japanese DDR mixes, so there will be some

237
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,280
Dance Mania licensed tracks. Which ones? Don't know. And which games? Don't know. But I would

238
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,080
imagine there would be kinds of things you would expect to see in the U.S., like one

239
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,980
that comes to my mind would be Ordinary World. I would not be surprised one bit if that's

240
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
one of the songs that's going to be in there.

241
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
I would be perfectly happy if that song didn't make it in because that remix is a Travis

242
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,980
Stevens song.

243
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,960
I know, I know it's a Travis Stevens original, but it is a kind of popular techno hit here

244
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,500
in America. I would not be surprised at all if it turned up. That's kind of number one

245
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,280
on my list for expected Dance Mania licensed songs. I bet you that'll be one.

246
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Twilight Zone and...

247
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
Twilight Zone's probably, I bet you that'll happen too, yep.

248
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You need to put peanut butter jelly in there.

249
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Peanut butter jelly in a baseball bat!

250
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Shake what your mama gave you. Shake what your mama gave you.

251
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh yeah.

252
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Shake that ass! Show me what you're working with!

253
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I would like to make it clear to our listeners that I have nothing to do with that part of the conversation.

254
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sitting here.

255
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay, let's play this little demo.

256
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Loki, would you mind giving us a little background on where you found this little clip here?

257
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's only a minute thirty?

258
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I haven't heard this yet even.

259
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
Yeah, um, well here's what it is.

260
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,380
It's basically, I found it off of a site that was selling the vinyl version of Dark Black

261
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,960
Forest, and it's kind of, it really kind of splits it up a little bit.

262
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,520
It's kind of giving you an idea of what the whole song sounds like because it's like six

263
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,000
or seven minutes long.

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,360
So it cuts it up a little bit, so there are a little bit of spaces where it kind of comes

265
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,260
off beat, but I mean you kind of get the idea of what it's going to sound like.

266
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,980
I tried getting the original version of the MP3, but the stupid sight, their shop was

267
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,180
down, and so it wouldn't let me buy it.

268
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,900
So I would have had it, but it's all their fault.

269
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,900
Stupid company.

270
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Well, we'll see. Here's the demo here. This is Dark Forests on Orange Lounge Radio.

271
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:12,300
It's a long way to go, honey.

272
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:18,340
I know, but I'm afraid we'll be golden.

273
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,340
into the dark black forest.

274
00:19:48,340 --> 00:20:02,100
Okay, that was it.

275
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Kind of chopped up there, definitely, but somebody in the chat room offered us to send

276
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,580
us a longer one, so we'll see if we can get that by the end of the show.

277
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,340
Maybe we'll play the full five-minute version.

278
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,500
If we're desperate for things to do by the end of the show, we'll play that for you at

279
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
the end.

280
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
How's that sound?

281
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Sounds like a winner.

282
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
All right.

283
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
What other DDR USA Max news was there?

284
00:20:47,500 --> 00:21:03,500
I think that, you know, it'll really be a good mix compared to most of the other stuff because, well, first of all, it'll have all the modifiers like Max and Max2, and plus, I guess, 0.5 speed, which will be fun new challenging mode. I just wish that they'd put challenge mode back on there. That was the coolest.

285
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Rumor is that challenge mode might be back a lot, I mean these are all rumors of course, you know you could make up anything you want about DDR Max, also this being said is that.5 speed actually didn't end up making the final cut because they had some errors with it with some of the slower songs with like My Summer Lover and 7.8 were just messing it up too bad, so we don't know if that's even going to be in there for sure, so we'll see.

286
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Darn. They should put 64 speed. That would be cool.

287
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Pointless shit like that.

288
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,500
No, but I think it'll be pretty good, because DDR economics as far as actual...

289
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
That was just as good as SportsMix, I think.

290
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Besides not having challenge mode, which I really love.

291
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,500
You know, I have to ask Konami USA, I want my databank.

292
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Databank?

293
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
That was cool, but I mean...

294
00:21:50,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Yeah, I don't use it at all. For people like Loki, who use lots of edits and stuff, and go to Golf Land with their little laptop, Penny and One, and change it all around, yeah, that would be cool.

295
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:12,500
But I never looked at the databank. I mean, maybe once, if I need a little bit of a challenge or something.

296
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Yeah.

297
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:21,580
Oh, JB says, he wants to point out, my summer love is on Disney Mix and Disney has 0.5 speed.

298
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
So something's there.

299
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,620
But you notice that Disney Mix looks a lot different also.

300
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,460
But Disney Mix already is running at 1.5 speed anyway, so.

301
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,300
SoCalKick says he asked Enos about the data bank in DDR Max USA and because of technical

302
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,500
difficulties it ain't going to happen.

303
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Which is bummer.

304
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,780
It would have made a fine addition to economics for sure.

305
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,620
I would have had my stuff on there.

306
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,180
Hell yeah.

307
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,580
Maybe the next time.

308
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,420
Maybe Max USA will sell really good and then they'll make another one.

309
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,840
Then they can ask me.

310
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,900
And then they'll come to you and get a bunch of edits.

311
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,220
Sweet.

312
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,280
So...

313
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,640
ONI courses.

314
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,820
Wouldn't that be interesting to have at home?

315
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,580
It's not going to happen.

316
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm almost positive it's not going to happen because it's USA.

317
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,260
They're like, well, people aren't good enough. They don't even know what ONI means.

318
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,120
Maybe non-stops, then?

319
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I would honestly like them to put in, like,

320
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,000
a 2DX-style expert course.

321
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,080
Not do, like, an ONI, but, like, an actual expert course.

322
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,960
You think they're going to do something...

323
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,300
Well, you have a depreciating score bar.

324
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,160
Do you think they're going to have internet ranking

325
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,860
for USA?

326
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,640
I don't see why they wouldn't. It would be a good move on their part. It would also be advertising for their site, too.

327
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,880
the let them move on phony course

328
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,280
if let them move is in that game

329
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,380
then i will commit shop of course

330
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,120
the nearly one hundred reports

331
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,000
uh... all the facts on

332
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,900
well you know i mean

333
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,860
it could still be good i mean it

334
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,320
if he actually yes the price with a good let them know which instant love would

335
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,440
be awesome

336
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,960
now i don't know for ever see that

337
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,560
but we don't see any of them

338
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,280
Hi, I'm DJ Konami.

339
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,520
We actually have DJ Konami in the chat room right now.

340
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,800
He'll teach you how to play.

341
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,360
You know, I think that we should play that song again sometime during the show.

342
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,920
Maybe we will. Maybe right before the end of the show.

343
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,320
The instant love.

344
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,560
I agree with electro-tal in the chat room.

345
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,720
Basically, I think the non-stops will make it before the Oni courses will.

346
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,060
A la Euromix 2, kind of the way they do it.

347
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,100
And you can think of it like back to forth mix type thing.

348
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,780
And how stops were a great idea.

349
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,500
It all depends on what interface you're using.

350
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,580
Because if they're using a Max 2 interface, it's going to

351
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,900
be easy to do on eCourses.

352
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,940
So it'll be harder to program something just non-stops into

353
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,580
a Max 2 interface.

354
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,540
It sounds like they're taking a little bit of liberties by

355
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,180
changing some things around, especially with this whole

356
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,100
foot ranking being in it, for sure thing.

357
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,780
They're doing some changes to a Max interface.

358
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,620
I guess we'll know more once we see screenshots.

359
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,180
Now the rumor is that PlayStation Magazine is

360
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,740
supposed to have a playable demo of this October 8th I believe when their new

361
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,820
issue comes out so very soon now we're gonna see a new we're gonna be able to

362
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:17,940
see what it looks like because we'll be able to see the interface. I'll buy it so

363
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,220
well maybe I can make arrangements to get that magazine that particular store

364
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,620
get the particular shipment of it yes we'll have to arrange that so we can look

365
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,820
at the demo we'll look at that here on Orange Lounge unless you know what we

366
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,940
think of that cuz not everybody gets that magazine okay let's get into the

367
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,200
fun part of the show shall we let's talk about our F use of the week oh do I have

368
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,580
one or not or what cuz I've been getting a lot of them from the chat room here so

369
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,420
if you want to submit your F you the week just join channel pound orange

370
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:54,280
lounge on any other side IRC server like IRC dot eggheads org and in the

371
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,460
meantime we're gonna start with Jamie's F you the week I just have to cue her

372
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,380
music. I'm kind of slow tonight. It's been a long day.

373
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,660
Brad needs a nap.

374
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,660
I don't need a nap. I just need a vacation.

375
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:13,660
Okay, my nephew of the week goes for tonight. I'm halfway hate to say it. Roosevelt Golf

376
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Land. And this isn't because of the machines. This has to do with unprofessionalism. You

377
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,500
want to know about unprofessionalism? I will tell about unprofessionalism. When you're

378
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,500
I've sent close to nine emails and have had replies to three.

379
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,500
When you try to set up a meeting with somebody to arrange running a tournament that's going to be bringing in money for them,

380
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,500
and they don't even care enough about it to reply to you.

381
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Or, when you request a Saturday in the interest of having a large crowd and they go,

382
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,060
and they go, no, we won't have a Saturday.

383
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,060
Good luck with Scandia.

384
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,980
Little do they know, we've already got approval

385
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,780
with Scandia, so they can just go, you know,

386
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,340
fall into the creek for all I care.

387
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,540
Did they actually say that to you?

388
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,420
Good luck with Scandia?

389
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,620
That was the email I got.

390
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,900
Wow, I didn't know that.

391
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,500
I refused.

392
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,860
It said, I refuse to rent Saturday.

393
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,420
Good luck with Scandia.

394
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,700
So that's business we'll be taking from them that day.

395
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,340
Well, do you want to say anything about the new term?

396
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,820
I know the tournament's details have been finalized,

397
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,820
We'll say that for a future show.

398
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
Not for a future show, but I'll say something later.

399
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,820
That's not part of my Fuck You of the Week, because it's a pleasant thing.

400
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,820
Oh yeah, that's pleasant. You're right, yes. Sorry, this is all about fuck yous right now.

401
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:30,820
Scandi is so much better. Like, in terms of size, Scandi is not as good, but Roseville Golf Land?

402
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:39,820
Like, last time I went there, both Romania and keyboard mania were broken, and it's always crowded with tons of little kids, and it's dark, and, you know, bad stuff.

403
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Scandi, very nice people, good tech, and everything is cool.

404
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,820
We've got to try and keep this somewhat appealing to everybody out there, by the way. We don't want to talk about Sacramento politics all day, but...

405
00:27:49,820 --> 00:28:03,820
Well, where Roseville-Gotham does have more machines, the better quality arcade is Scandia, and I'm honestly even thinking about putting up a suggestion to everybody to change the Wednesday night location for the local meetings too.

406
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Interesting idea, we'll see.

407
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,820
You have your own Fuck You of the Week, Loki. Hold on, I gotta load your song.

408
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,820
I'm so out of it this week.

409
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Just go ahead and start with your Fuck You of the Week. Your song will kick in pretty soon.

410
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,820
It's like I said, better be out of it than to have your foot stuck in it.

411
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:29,820
Yeah, so my Fuck You of the Week goes to these really crappy winter movies that they're releasing right now.

412
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:36,820
What the hell are they thinking with, like, uh, fear.com.com and, uh, you know, all these other stupid movies.

413
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Like, today I saw Ballistic, X vs. Ever. That has to be one of the most pointless movies I've seen in a long time.

414
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:50,820
I mean, it had probably one of the slowest motorcycle chases I've ever seen, going a whopping 30 miles an hour through city streets.

415
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,820
It was just completely pointless and I lost interest about halfway through it.

416
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,820
But it's a free movie, so... Yay.

417
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,820
Wait. Dude, song changing.

418
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,820
Just start with your F.U. I'll give you a background song as soon as I can get to it.

419
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,820
My F.U. is towards the 49ers, because they suck!

420
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,820
And they beat Cade Matthews in the Redskins, and they are the best!

421
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,820
Go Redskins! Yay!

422
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,820
49ers suck.

423
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Jeff Garcia. I know you're listening. Okay, that's my fuck you. Football related.

424
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:37,100
Another fuck you. You do? Yes. You can leave Dave's music because it's happy. My fuck you

425
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,820
is not really directed toward anybody, it's toward the situation. I feel sorry for everybody

426
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,780
with long distance relationships because I was away from my dad for a whole five days

427
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:53,780
It sucked. It sucked, it sucked, it sucked, it sucked. So, whatever he went to. Except that I got free stuff from him.

428
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,780
You got a free Xbox out of it, so...

429
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,780
And free games, and tons of t-shirts, and a Capcom backpack, and other stuff.

430
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,780
Yeah, my FUs. I have an FU of the week. F Microsoft. Where's my free Xbox? Thanks, I'm done.

431
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,780
I don't have an FU, but this is something else.

432
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,780
I'd like to congratulate the makers of Duck Tape.

433
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,780
They've saved my life on numerous occasions, and it rocks.

434
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:25,780
I mean, they fixed my car with Duck Tape, and they fixed my pads with Duck Tape, so hooray for Duck Tape.

435
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,780
That's it. Hooray for Duck Tape.

436
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:34,780
Duck Tape has multiple uses, like, you know, taping small children in their car, and holding together computers.

437
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,780
or taping two people's buns together?

438
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,780
how appropriate I'm playing drop the bomb

439
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,780
on behalf of one of my friends who may or may not be listening

440
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,780
she would regale us with a tale of how at the mississippi school of math and science

441
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,780
they would hold together the school computer with duct tape and chicken wire

442
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:05,180
computer with duct tape and chicken wire. And it worked until the duct tape fell off.

443
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Actually, the duct tape didn't fall off, but I understand it was removed and the whole

444
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,180
thing fell apart.

445
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,140
Okay, I have another bitch. Now JB in the chat room, he's bragging that he got a free

446
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,020
Xbox as well through some other means. Did anybody around here not get a free Xbox? I

447
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,320
mean, I realize they're going to have to give that system away to get people to play it,

448
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,580
but I mean, honestly, where's my free Xbox?

449
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,580
I know none of this reacts well, but I wish that I had it.

450
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,580
There's some secret I'm not being told about, some secret cult, some Xbox.

451
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:43,580
I found a game that kicks just about any other racing game, but it's, oh god, President O.

452
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:49,580
It's something Redshift. No, it's not Orgasm Redshift.

453
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:56,580
It's done by Microsoft's programmers group. That game is absolutely awesome.

454
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,580
awesome. It's like Wipeout meets Hydro Thunder. It's kind of interesting. And I got to do

455
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,580
one of those too. Let's get to our chat rooms, bitches, shall we? I need to get an Xbox.

456
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:15,780
I'd like to add. Okay. 23rd Magus says, a big fuck you to Skrull. One Skrull in particular.

457
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,900
Johnson, Maine. What the fuck? Welcome to Trainwreck High. I asked for web author training.

458
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:26,900
I get choir. What the fuck is wrong with these fucking idiots?

459
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:37,100
You ask for web author training and you get choir? What the hell is that?

460
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,340
That's like making one of the Gauntlet Legends people get up and play DDR. There's some scary

461
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,260
people to play gauntlet legends

462
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,820
we talked about they don't play it they are gauntlet legends

463
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,020
b-one with the gauntlet legends watch out for the girl with the big metal

464
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,740
brothel in that game you know

465
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,740
it's pathetic when we have to sit here make fun of addicts to other games

466
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,060
hi pot this is kettle calling hi pot you're black you're black

467
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,020
anyway uh...

468
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,940
so-called kick says uh... what's the matter nothing nevermind fuck you all

469
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,940
have nothing to run about well

470
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,060
uh... deejay konami

471
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,100
in between teaching us all how to play it

472
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,120
the mania

473
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,260
he says f you to aaron hostile

474
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,460
because i get a hundred percent all the way throughout the song

475
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,340
and then at the end when it makes you hit a big succession of dual notes i

476
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,600
I drop it to 2%.

477
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,200
Amen to that!

478
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,320
That sucks.

479
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,080
JB featuring Jenny Rom says,

480
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,020
My F.U. is also to RVGL for not having the keys available to any games after the

481
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,980
morning is over.

482
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,740
Not even the guys in the jean colored shirts have access to them.

483
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,080
Now Jamie can't rape the crane game.

484
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,680
Did the crane game break?

485
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,020
If the crane game broke quiet, you have a chance to play it from RVGL again.

486
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,420
Except for them leaving, you know, Drummania on Freeplay for three weeks or something.

487
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
That was cool.

488
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,220
We are smart.

489
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,620
We're geniuses there.

490
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,720
It's like, it's getter-ific.

491
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,520
And JV featuring Jenny Rom would also like to say,

492
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,320
F you if you hate Jenny Rom for the zippers.

493
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,920
We're going to talk about Jenny Rom a little later.

494
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,420
We're going to talk about Jenny Rom after the next break.

495
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,720
Twen says,

496
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,620
f u to sharing a phone line with every freaking person in the house making me

497
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,600

498
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,540
during the day

499
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,760
and f u to me

500
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,600
sky for not putting up the news site or forum

501
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,400
and he also says f u to individuals i'm not gonna name

502
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,160
because that's not worth naming

503
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,080
that's not cool

504
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,800
uh...

505
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,880

516
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,240
Oh, who didn't see that joke coming a mile away?

517
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:34,240
I'm going to be sending you with money to buy my manga then when you're over there. Can you go to Toys and Choice for me?

518
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,480
A couple more, two more.

519
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,320
SoCalKick says, fuck you to every gaming store for delaying Kingdom Hearts' release,

520
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,000
but, yay, Kingdom Hearts owns.

521
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,600
Um, actually, my fiancé's store had Kingdom Hearts the day of release.

522
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
uh... paul paul

523
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,880

524
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,640

525
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,360

526
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,200

527
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,260
fuck you to his and by the way takeout kid is uh... joining us from berkeley

528
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,000
dot e two years old

529
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,320
fuck you to his college writing teacher for thinking he was an e-s-l student

530
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,400
but he's not even really here still

531
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:27,400
How the hell? You've got to elaborate on that. Please elaborate on that. Send me more about how the hell that happens to somebody. That sucks.

532
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Yes, JB, please send me that file. I'm not going to respond. I'm too lazy to type right now.

533
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Thank you to Dan for getting me this really neat 007 watch that clips on my belt and is upside down so I can look at it and has a compass.

534
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I've been playing with this thing all night. It's the coolest thing ever.

535
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,400
And F you to this upcoming movie I heard about called The Core.

536
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,400
It's the dumbest idea I've ever heard of.

537
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
The Earth's core stops.

538
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,400
And then these people have to go drill down to the core and detonate a nuke and that will fix everything.

539
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
It's the dumbest idea now.

540
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,400
It's like Austin Powers except that the goal is to let it work.

541
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,400
And here is us suspending our disbelief upon confession.

542
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:19,400
You know what? Movies today are getting retarded, as are most TV shows, which is why Jamie doesn't want TV anymore.

543
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,400
But, oh, and Dave's head hurts.

544
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:30,400
But, The Transporter's gonna kick ass. Go see The Transporter. Awesome movie. On Asian Girl, yeah.

545
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Um, yeah.

546
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,400
A special hello, by the way, out there to the Rice Princess, who's joining us in the chat room.

547
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Hi!

548
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,200
And uh, one more, one more FU, one more, this last one, no more, don't send me any more.

549
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,240
DarkTetsuya says, FU to his busted Knight's controller.

550
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,520
Is that like Sonic Knight's?

551
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Oh, okay.

552
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Oh, okay.

553
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,960
Which is the best controller ever invented.

554
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,480
And you cannot really get them anymore unless you know where to look.

555
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay, TakeOutKid is elaborating on the ESL story.

556
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,320
He says, she read my subject and she thought my writing was so bad that she thought I was

557
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:16,280
ESL, and the readers of his subject had evidence of ESL attributes, so that's why she thought

558
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
he was ESL.

559
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Go figure.

560
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,800
Okay, why don't we take a quick break?

561
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
You guys want to take a quick break?

562
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,000
We're going to come back and we're going to talk about Jenny Rom.

563
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,320
How's that sound?

564
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
Wee!

565
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,640
I'm going to start this off with, actually I can't find that route right now.

566
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,120
Maybe we'll hear something from Fantasia 3 in the next break.

567
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,120
I wanted to play you guys something from Fantasia 3, brand new, just came out, but I'm going to start this set off with...

568
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
How about something from...

569
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,120
Do you want to hear Papaya?

570
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Do you want to hear Supergirl?

571
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Of course Supergirl.

572
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,120
We're going to have happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy Papaya song.

573
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Where was I? Oh, there it is. Hello. Found it. I can't even tell how I have my own songs for you.

574
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,120
Everyone be prepared to be overloaded with sugar and brush your teeth when the song's over.

575
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,120
Alright, and we'll get something from Fantasia 3 in here too.

576
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,120
I'm gonna rule the world

577
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,120

578
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120

00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,320

I feel the night explode

639
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
When we're together

640
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,160
Together, emotional alone

641
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,160
In my heat of pleasure

642
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,160
Take me on your own, sin to your own

643
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Never let me go

644
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,160
Tonight I really need to know

645
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Tell it to my heart, tell me I'm the only one

646
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,160
Is this really love or just a game?

647
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Tell it to my heart and I can do my body right Every time you call my name

648
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:56,160
The passion's so complete, it's never-ending As long as I receive the message you send in

649
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,160
But it's about a soul to soul Oh, it feels so near

650
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:09,160
So say the words I long to hear

651
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Tell it to my heart Tell me I'm the only one

652
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Did you squeal in love or just a game?

653
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,160
Tell it to my heart I look to my body right

654
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,160
Every time you call my name

655
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Tell it to my heart, tell me I'm the only one

656
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Is it really love or just a game?

657
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,160
Tell it to my heart, I can feel my body rot

658
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Every time you call my name

659
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,160
Tell it to my heart, I can feel my body rot

660
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,160
Every time you call my name

661
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,160
Tell it to my heart

662
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Tell it to my heart

663
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,160
Mr. Random Person on the Street, what do you think of the Orange Dives Bay Money Music and More show?

664
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,160
Beautiful night, isn't it?

665
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,160
It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a bloodsucker.

666
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:33,160
What the hell was that look on her face when she was like, huh?

667
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Dude, I don't remember.

668
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
I haven't watched that thing in a long, long time.

669
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,160
I saw that once a while ago.

670
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
A long, long ago.

671
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,160
I haven't watched that fans of, like, Bobak.

672
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
Wow.

673
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Like, my N-PEGs on my computer.

674
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,340
I promised when we came back to the show we would talk about Jenny Rom, and this is very

675
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:53,180
interesting because JB in the chat room, huge Jenny Rom fan, sent me some pictures of Jenny

676
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,180
Rom.

677
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,180
Damn, she's ugly.

678
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:02,440
But this is the interesting thing, apparently Jenny Rom is not a real person, from what

679
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,440
I'm reading.

680
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
Gasp!

681
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,440
Gasp!

682
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:34,520
On the China MGL and ID Music, these two big music-related sites to talk about dance media,

683
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,260
this big message board and this guy who calls himself Alex from Italy came on to this board

684
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:46,280
and says that he was looking for stuff about dance mania and he found it and he's a member

685
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,860
of Jenny Rom's team. He produced the first single www.blondegirl.com for Saifam and he

686
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,840
saw that somebody was looking for the lyrics of Do You Want to Flirt and he posts them

687
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:04,340
on this site. Let's see. Let's read some of these earth shattering lyrics from Jenny Rom

688
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:12,440
shall we? Let's see. Boom boom, don't stop, love me babe. Boom boom, don't stop, kiss

689
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:20,160
me babe. Boom boom, don't stop, love me babe. Tonight with me so high. What is up with the

690
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:29,960
Japanese and boom boom? They put boom boom in everything. Yeah, but you know what? Here's

691
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,600
who Jenny Rom really is. I know, I've heard this a long time ago, it's

692
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,600
Politary! You think Jenny Rom is really Politary?

693
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:46,000
There's a difference, there's a difference. Jenny Rom can hold a tune.

694
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,240
Jenny Rom is just a Naoki. That's all it is. Naoki is everyone.

695
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,120
So really what this is, is that Jenny Rom is actually an Italian singer, who just kind

696
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,360
of, you know, comes in, the lady who does the voice, and also an Italian male singer,

697
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,560
and i'm guessing this picture that got sent to me was actually that italian

698
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,640
singer who poses as jenny rom

699
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,280
general mail

700
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,540
no no but you know that guy who does the voice like you know uh... you know

701
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,760
come on barbie let's go party or you know

702
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,060
i don't know why i don't want to do

703
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,160
he's there's an italian guy

704
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,300
you know what they all sound alike i swear to god aqua

705
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,040
you know

706
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,100
capping my seriously thought that guy was the guy from on what he sounds just

707
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,640
sound like the girl doesn't sound the same that guy sounds just like the guy

708
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
from aqua and aqua broke up a couple years ago from when I heard it.

709
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,800
It's funny, they also have, what was it, I think King Kong and the Jungle Girls, I thought

710
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,040
that was them, but they all sounded like two. And I've actually seen a video, not with aqua,

711
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,520
but this other one, shit, I can't remember what it was called, Tarzan and Jane or something

712
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:54,520
like that, and they look exactly like aqua. They're all aqua. Everyone is aqua.

713
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,960
And the world is square.

714
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,200
All bands are aqua and the world is square.

715
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Some more things that Alex says on this forum.

716
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,320
He's proud to see that so many people love his virtual daughter.

717
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,040
And he's got photos and a promotional video about Jenny Rom.

718
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,480
Jenny's not a real girl, but a virtual woman that lives in the fantasy and into the computer

719
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,480
world.

720
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,040
That was the original concept about her.

721
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,800
And he says, Do You Want to Flirt is his favorite song.

722
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,480
It hasn't been released on Dance Media Compilation.

723
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,480
I know somebody's got a copy of that, and maybe they'll send it to me so we can play it by the end of the show.

724
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,480
Wink wink nudge nudge.

725
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,480
I don't say any more.

726
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,480
Uh, and he says, uh, we chose the name Jenny Rom because they were looking for a perfect name for a digital woman.

727
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,480
And when Joe said, what do you think of Jenny Rom? He said, I love it.

728
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,480
Just like, kind of, kind of like when, uh, Jamie and I came up with Orange Lounge. Let's call this show Orange Lounge.

729
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,480
Oh, I love it!

730
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,480
Same thing.

731
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,480
I'll buy that for a dollar.

732
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,480
Except I don't think we were that excited. It was like, oh yay, finally, we thought of a title.

733
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,200
we're like tired and on the part i remember that i remember that we're on

734
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,640
part when we decided

735
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,400
call it that you know

736
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,360
paula terry

737
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,160
is now keys

738
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,760
second head

739
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,160
uh...

740
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,240
so it is

741
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,760
you know i love it

742
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,480
okay uh... what else

743
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,440
now he has many people

744
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,960
where the most popular solace in another one girl

745
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,880
and uh... will there be any more jenny ron indeed you are he says it depends on

746
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,920
a lot of the uh... business affair

747
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,240
however he says it's very probable

748
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,640
uh... at the moment he's no longer with the junior on production team but he

749
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,640
still has a good relationship with them so he doesn't know exactly what's going

750
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,140
on

751
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,840
that's that's a lot of story

752
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,360
uh...

753
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,280
it should be noted the reason he's not with their production team anymore is

754
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,840
because he made some uh... explicit photos of jenny ron

755
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,840
Yeah.

756
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,840
Anyway.

757
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,480
See if she was a natural blondie girl.

758
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:02,240
And we were all shocked to find out she wasn't a blonde girl all over.

759
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,560
They just forgot to render that part.

760
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:09,680
Oh no, the polygon count dropped.

761
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,440
For all we know it's www.shavedgirl.com.

762
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,640
Next in the money news.

763
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,480
so in the money news

764
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,960
meanwhile back

765
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,480
the curtains do not match the carpet which so mature here

766
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,120
uh...

767
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,960
they're talking about this is uh...

768
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,640
i've never thought i'd hear this little money so uh... they got delayed play

769
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,520
this game

770
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,520
No, but certain people would be guaranteed not to.

771
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,520
Like Paula Terry.

772
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,520
Anyway.

773
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Oh, they want to know if Jenny Rahm has three tits.

774
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
That can be programmed.

775
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:06,520
You know, it's like, I don't know.

776
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
I don't know how best to describe it.

777
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,520
She's like a vacuum cleaner.

778
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,520
She's got different attachments, you know.

779
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,520
But all of them suck.

780
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,520
She's gone from sun to blow!

781
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,520
Yeah.

782
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,520
And let's move on to something else, shall we?

783
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Something else.

784
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,520
Oh, did you know that they confirmed DDR Max 3?

785
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:32,520
Or I should say, not DDR Max 3 necessarily, but a new DDR is in production.

786
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,520
So there is definitely going to be a new DDR coming out.

787
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:43,520
And they're taking a poll over on the official website for this,

788
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,780
which is over on Konami's Bimani portal, you can find it no problem, they want to know

789
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,220
what kind of Konami original songs you want to see in this new DDR that haven't been there

790
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:56,800
yet but from any Bimani game. So like, if there's a keyboard mania song you think should

791
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,260
be in there, now I was an idiot when I first submitted it and I said, I want to see flotation

792
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:07,920
in DDR except that's not a Konami original so, I already fucked it up so, they're looking

793
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
for Konami originals.

794
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:14,200
Speaking of the home versions though, this is somewhat unconfirmed, although I'm not

795
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,560
doubting the reliability of my source.

796
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,560
I cannot describe it.

797
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,560
Dude, are those sirens picking up over the microphones?

798
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,560
They're just hella loud.

799
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,560
There's sirens going right by my house right now.

800
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,560
They found Loki.

801
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,560
Anyway.

802
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,560
Anyway.

803
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:31,400
There's been information given to me, again, this has not been officially confirmed by

804
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:38,480
me with any member of Konami, but that they were going to stop production of the peripherals,

805
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,480
like the dance pads.

806
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,040
So we're talking Konami in the US again.

807
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
Konami US.

808
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Konami USA.

809
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,320
And that though they did mention Red Octane by name, that they were supporting whatever

810
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,400
product that they would release.

811
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,880
I'll try to get that confirmed, but in the meantime, this is what my sources told me.

812
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,880
All right.

813
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,880
So your...

814
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,880
Inside sources.

815
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,880
...sources.

816
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,520
Start buying those dance pads while you can get them.

817
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,320
Yeah, so they're not going to be making the...

818
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,000
Maybe they're not going to be making those official Konami pads anymore, and Red Octane

819
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,360
is going to be the official Konami DDR pad dealer, basically.

820
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,360
Maybe.

821
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,280
If these sources are correct, that's what's happening.

822
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,280
We'll see.

823
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,280
Who knows?

824
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,940
Red Octane seems to own everything DDR online.

825
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:29,000
It's not that it was going to be necessarily official, it's just that they were going to,

826
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,440
I guess, vouch for the production of the Red Octane pads.

827
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,960
And the ignition pad was also mentioned by name.

828
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:44,840
Now this is interesting, over on BamaniStyle.com, a fine little site, they are making suggestions

829
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:52,480
for what kinds of things you should submit as songs to Konami for DDR Max 3 or whatever

830
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,560
it is, whatever it is in whatever shape or form they're going to call it, it's basically

831
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,160
DDR 8th Mix.

832
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,560
And basically these are all the Konami original songs that would pretty much be impossible

833
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,560
to dance to.

834
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,680
So I'm going to read off this list here of possible submissions.

835
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,840
If you can't think of anything you want to submit as a song that you think should be

836
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:15,840
an eighth mix. Here are some suggestions. From Beatmania, the DJ battle. Can you imagine

837
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:21,600
dancing to the DJ battle? Oh, I have one up on that. How about this? DJ battle, the yodeler

838
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:31,600
mix. From Beatmania, the yodeler mix. The cat song from Beatmania? Ink go meow. That

839
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:39,400
Ink go mam, that would be so lame to dance to, but it would be fun, it would be like

840
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,120
stupid fun.

841
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:49,440
From Keyboard Mania, morning music, which I think is about 15 BPM.

842
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,280
That would be so awful in DDR.

843
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,280
Threshold from Keyboard Mania is another suggestion.

844
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,960
Without you around from pop and music, I'm not up on my pop and music knowledge so I

845
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,760
I don't know what that song is, but from 2DX they suggest flowers for Albion.

846
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:14,760
I wonder if the steps would do the same thing that the notes do in the 7 key for flowers.

847
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:20,680
Okay, that part is ass, but it would be fun to do those.

848
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,880
Ah, I like Twin's suggestion, he says let's DDR to Orange Lounge episodes.

849
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,280
Talk about a long version, these things are what?

850
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,660
I think the shortest episode of Orange Lounge is like 118 minutes.

851
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,940
That would be marathon mode right there.

852
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:41,280
From 2DX also suggesting the safari.

853
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,000
You know, the safari would be fun.

854
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,800
I think that's a good idea, really.

855
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:50,020
The safari would be, but you know a song I would not, I mean I don't think it's an original,

856
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,280
but Get On Beat Wild Style, definitely not.

857
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,960
It is an original, actually.

858
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,960
Lion & Sashi.

859
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,640
Maybe, I don't know.

860
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:03,280
would actually be kind of fun. It wouldn't be a fast one, but it would be a fun one.

861
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:12,280
Okay, um, guitar freaks across the nightmare. That's been done, as a DWI at least.

862
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:22,120
Drummania with Waza. Waza. There you have it, Waza. MobileMoga being suggested in the

863
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:27,180
chat room. I believe I saw that on a preliminary list, but I don't know how trustworthy those

864
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:34,060
lists are, the ones that have been released today, and I don't think it's quite solid.

865
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,540
Twin suggests we can DDR to the sounds of the sirens outside my house, looking for Loki.

866
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:44,540
Just looped with you at the beginning of Farquaad.

867
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,580
Presto v...

868
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,580
What else are people suggesting in here?

869
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,580
Okay, Presto would be the pain in the butt.

870
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,580
How about...

871
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,580
Oh, I know.

872
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,580
1999.

873
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,580
No!

874
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,580
No!

875
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,580
Fifth Mix.

876
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,580
Saber Dance.

877
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:00,580
I think that would be fun.

878
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,580
Oh yeah.

879
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,580
Well, here's what I voted for.

880
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:07,580
I voted for Outer Limits and my other computer.

881
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,580
I don't care, okay?

882
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,580
I voted for it anyways.

883
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,580
It's all in Japanese.

884
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,580
I can't read their freaking Japanese language.

885
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,580
Actually, wait a minute.

886
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,580
Outer Limits, I believe, is the LED, isn't it?

887
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,580
Wasn't that the bonus trick?

888
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,580
Whatever.

889
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,580
Anyway.

890
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,580
And then I also voted for Instant Love.

891
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,580
With DJ Konami

892
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,980
Great that's what we're doing

893
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:40,460
I want everybody right now listening to the show to go vote for instant love for DDR with the DJ Konami's voice intact

894
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,420
I want that to be the new lesson mode

895
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:48,100
I swear to God if they release another DDR with let them move as the lesson mode background that old screeching woman

896
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,100
They need to do the new one

897
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,580
That's true we did

898
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,340
Alright, I'm doing my rant.

899
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,880
So that's all about this.

900
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,660
Also what they're going to start doing on this site, starting on the 25th, which is

901
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:09,860
in three days, so next week we'll be able to talk about this, Naoki's diary, how feminine

902
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,860
of him.

903
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:17,580
No, they said diary, not journal, not logbook, not hey what's going on, it's his diary.

904
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:33,580
I'm about ready. See, I put Naoki in the same category. I put Gakton, as in, you know, very, very pretty, you know, to look at, talented, but definitely on the flame side, on the burning heat side.

905
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:48,580
Dear Diary, I had the members of B4U over today. We went on my nice little Pirates of the Caribbean ride with my monkey, and I did my nails, and I made another song.

906
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:56,580
And I tried to think of another name for another band that I could become. I damned that Jenny Rump for stealing my idea.

907
01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:00,580
I will become her. She will not live!

908
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,580
Anyways.

909
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,500
This is kind of odd.

910
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,900
When they said everybody's getting a live journal these days, I didn't think now he

911
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,940
was getting it on it too.

912
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,700
I wonder if he'll have to have a separate journal for each of his alter egos, you know,

913
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,140
Revenge and Desire.

914
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:19,500
You know, I'm thinking if it's going to be a weekly update, I'm sure that I could probably,

915
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,060
with the proper payments, try to get somebody to translate it to put up or something, or

916
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:29,580
I could give highlights from it using my favorite translation program, NISTIA Global Games.

917
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,820
I can just see it now, weekend update with Naoki.

918
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:38,860
Maybe we'll take our own liberties with the translation, mwahaha.

919
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:44,100
Today I got the B4U girls together today, and we got together at my house and had a

920
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,140
naked spa party, and then we wrote another crappy song, and-

921
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,140
I said it down my hair!

922
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:53,140
No, I'm sorry, that's polytary.

923
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:57,720
I made polytary mount the B4U girls.

924
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,060
Today I dressed up like Emi.

925
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:03,060
I like her. She's kinda cute. Maybe I'll become her someday.

926
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,060
Yes, Emmy! Add it to the personalities.

927
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,060
Next!

928
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:16,060
I asked the chat room to submit me their funny Naoki diary entries. Did you hear this? Naoki's starting a diary on the 25th.

929
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:21,060
Naoki's diary. What kinds of things do you think Naoki's going to tell us about in his diary?

930
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:28,060
Well, I don't know. I don't know Naoki, but that's probably why he's making a diary.

931
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,060
Wait, is it a guy or a girl?

932
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,060
Yes, it's a guy.

933
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,060
Oh, okay.

934
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,060
I wasn't sure.

935
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,060
Just checking.

936
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:38,060
It's all encompassing, okay?

937
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,060
Deep thoughts with Naoki.

938
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,060
Naoki isn't hidden either.

939
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,060
Let's see.

940
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,060
Naoki's...

941
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,060
Do you ever see It's Pat?

942
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,060
That's Naoki.

943
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:48,060
No, no, no, because Naoki actually looks very pretty.

944
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,060
I would love to interview Naoki on this show.

945
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:52,060
I don't know who I have to blow to get that to happen, but come on.

946
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,060
Maybe him.

947
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,060
We gotta make...

948
01:02:54,060 --> 01:03:06,220
I asked the chat room to submit their funny Naoki diary entries, so if you want to send

949
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,780
me a PM with what you think Naoki might just write in his diary, I'm going to read those

950
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:15,580
aloud right now for you, but let's get some background music, shall we, for these lovely

951
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,780
Naoki diary entries.

952
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,780
Dynamite rave?

953
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,780
Alright.

954
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,500
I gotta find dynamite rave, hold on.

955
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,500
Dynamite Rave is not the worst song ever. Shut your mouth.

956
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,020
That's right, remember? Let them move and buy a bye baby balloon or worse than Dynamite

957
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:35,220
Rave. We already did that list list on this show.

958
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,660
Nobody can hear you if you don't talk into a microphone.

959
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:43,660
It's in the category of the worst songs ever folder, which encompasses like DDR USA.

960
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:50,660
I'm so good by Boyzone. Dynamite Rave is a good song. It's just overplayed.

961
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,660
Way, way, way, way, way overplayed.

962
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,660
But it's still a good song.

963
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,660
Way, way, way, way, way, way overplayed.

964
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,660
Did I mention it's over- okay, anyway.

965
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:03,660
Uh, I couldn't find any of those, so we're just gonna use Brilliant T-Orchestal Groove. How's that sound?

966
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,660
That's because, you know, it's my favorite song and everybody loves me.

967
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:07,660
No worries.

968
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,660
So, Naoki's Diary.

969
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,660
Uh, Chaos suggests,

970
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:22,660
Dear Diary, I made a remix to break down Reggae R&B version. It was really great. It has the Jamaican dude singing instead of the B4U girls.

971
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:30,660
I like how it's referred to as the Jamaican dude. It'll have Jamaican drums and the black people singing, because B4U sucks.

972
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,660
I don't know if Naoki would say his own band sucks. That was beautiful, thank you Chaos.

973
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:41,660
JB says Dear Diary, I saw Paula Terry and tried to move my hand down her pants.

974
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:45,660
That's kind of the obvious entry.

975
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,660
DJ Konami submits us not one but two. Here we go.

976
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:54,660
Dear Diary, I remixed Die for the 558th time today. Praise me.

977
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:59,660
The part that makes that funny is at the end. Praise me.

978
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:10,940
me. Dear Diary, I paid Paula and Kosaka to do some hot action today. Twentz says this.

979
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:17,900
Dear Diary, I had Paula Terry record Let Them Move. And that's it, because Naoki died after

980
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:26,340
hearing that. SoCalKick, so this is a long one. Dear Diary, I stumbled on an orange site

981
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,260
that plays songs from that one place I used to work for, and I listened to him and this

982
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,860
random white American asked, who would he have to blow to interview me? I am curious

983
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:38,860
and I'm going to have to pose as a random American hipster and get this blow.

984
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:44,860
That was the win. SoCal Kicks wins the diary competition. Oh,

985
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:49,260
we're getting more. 23rd Magus submits this one.

986
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:56,380
Dear Diary, I realize after doing 50,000 remixes of the same song that I have issues, one of

987
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,100
which is a major identity crisis.

988
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,100
No!

989
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:05,180
We didn't know that.

990
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:11,340
That's why I'll create Bop 2.0 to deal with that type of trauma.

991
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:15,180
I am too busy for that type of trauma, I need to make more songs.

992
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,220
Let's see, I can make a D for you.

993
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:21,540
Insert letter, number, letter.

994
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,500
Yeah.

995
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,460
A black lab in the chat room points out,

996
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:29,060
you know, admitting a problem is the first step to recovery.

997
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,380
He'll be going through, like, the million-step program.

998
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,300
Oh, our chat room people are hilarious tonight.

999
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,020
They're funny.

1000
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,300
How about another quick break?

1001
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:40,780
What do you guys think?

1002
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,820
You want to go on another subject?

1003
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,260
You want to take a break?

1004
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,260
What do you want to do?

1005
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:48,260
I think that before we go to the break, I'll go ahead and make a mention about Turney.

1006
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:52,760
We're going to have an official site be up hopefully by mid-next week.

1007
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:59,260
It will be linked from sacbemani.com, which is S-A-C-B-M-A-N-I dot com.

1008
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,260
Sacbemani.

1009
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:01,260
Just like it sounds.

1010
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,260
Sacbemani.

1011
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,260
If you don't know how to spell bemani, then you suck.

1012
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,260
Then you have no reason to listen to this.

1013
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,260
Why are you here?

1014
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,260
But we do have a date confirmed.

1015
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:16,260
It is November 9th at Scandia on, is it Hillsdale Road?

1016
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,260
I don't know.

1017
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,780
Scandia, Madison and I-80.

1018
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,780
You can't miss it.

1019
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:21,780
It's right by the freeway.

1020
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,380
We will have maps to the site.

1021
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:30,740
The tournament will be, it will be freestyle and it will be Perfect Attack in the morning.

1022
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,900
Sponsored by Orange Lounge Radio.

1023
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,540
Yes, Orange Lounge Radio.

1024
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,580
What about the A-Team?

1025
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:44,820
There will also be a team mode freestyle to be going on during normal freestyle tabulation,

1026
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:50,780
and there also may be another surprise there waiting for us in the form of another Bimani

1027
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:55,980
game, which is on the boat, on its way to come hang out with us.

1028
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:01,100
This is, we should point out, this is not the same Scandia tournament as the Scandia

1029
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,140
tournament in December, I think they're having one in the Bay Area.

1030
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,860
No, this is a different Scandia.

1031
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:09,780
the Sacramento Scandia, the tournament will not have Scandia in the name, the

1032
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,580
tournament name is still kind of being ironed out, but we think we know what it

1033
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:18,540
is, but we're gonna say it next week. We'll reveal the name

1034
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:22,660
next week. All we can say is shut your mouth. We'll reveal the name next week

1035
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:25,860
once we have our first meeting to get everything worked out, but we'll be

1036
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:30,100
posting all that information to just about every single freaking forum out

1037
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,900
there. You'd have to be blind to miss it, and I'll say that an Orange Lounge

1038
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:41,900
The Orange Lounge website will be an Orange Lounge new website, we'll have forums in it coming very soon, hopefully in the next couple of weeks.

1039
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,900
Wow, so much for that secret.

1040
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:52,900
We didn't confirm it, we're not going to confirm, we're not going to deny those, so there it goes.

1041
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:00,900
Let's see, Orange Lounge random meeting promoted in SoCal by SCK, that's what the tournament is called I guess.

1042
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,900
No. Thank you, drive-thru, please.

1043
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:10,900
I'm looking forward to this, because I'll be getting to get up there and emcee this tournament with my good buddy, Electro...

1044
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,900
God, I can never say... Tal!

1045
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:17,900
His name's a tongue twister. Tal will be up there, too, and we're gonna emcee this tournament. It'll be fun.

1046
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,900
And Jamie, you're gonna do a little emceeing, too, aren't you? You gonna get up there and maybe do a little emceeing?

1047
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,900
I'll be hanging out in the little party room over there going,

1048
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,900

For the people who have been giving me advice on this too, I want to thank Iguana Girl especially.

1059
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:12,260
I want to thank Maple, too, for a lot of the advice at 3am in the morning with information and stuff on how a lot of the tournaments are run.

1060
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:19,260
Okay, let's take a really quick break and we'll have much more information on the tournament next week.

1061
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:24,260
And that's all I have to say. Any other thoughts to take us out?

1062
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,260
Song.

1063
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:34,100
Okay, we'll do this. This is a popular song here. We're going to play Spooky for you here

1064
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,100
on Orange Lounge Radio.

1065
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:11,100
You must be, must be, knowing that you're lost

1066
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,100
Ooh, kick the next one with the beat

1067
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:39,100
I'm gonna make you feel that you're not in the screen

1068
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:46,100
I'm gonna make you feel that you're not in the screen

1069
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:19,100
We can't go around for a while

1070
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:26,100
We must be ahead of ourselves

1071
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,100
Are you ready?

1072
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,100
Let's see your energy!

1073
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,100
Yes!

1074
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,100
You're a dead animal!

1075
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,100
You are awesome!

1076
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,100
Awesome! Awesome!

1077
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,100
Wow! Great!

1078
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,100
I was moved!

1079
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,100
I'm always continuing!

1080
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,100
You are awesome!

1081
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:31,100
The crowd loves you!

1082
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:36,100
Yeah, do it!

1083
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:41,100
You're a dancing machine!

1084
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:46,100
Nice step!

1085
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:51,100
You surprised us all!

1086
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,100
You surprised us all!

1087
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,100
Wow, you are too cool!

1088
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,100
Come on, she's doing great!

1089
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,100
Hi!

1090
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,100
Do you really follow me into the light?

1091
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,100
Drilling structures on, drilling structures on my side

1092
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,100
Do you really recommend for dynamite?

Love in pieces, our fight, all for one Come together friends, we gotta take big chances tonight

1094
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:43,100
Drill instructor, tell me what to do I'm your man, I will follow only you

01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,600
We gotta take this chance tonight

1108
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,600
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1109
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,600
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1110
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:57,600
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1111
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:57,460
very cool

1112
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,420
let's talk about that i got some sad news to report on the show i thought

1113
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:04,500
though we need to talk about it because it is uh... the money related believe it

1114
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,620
or not

1115
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,400
no whole

1116
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,400
uh... however one of the uh... singers from the group rocks at

1117
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,260
uh... has a brain tumor

1118
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:17,960
uh... marie frederickson uh... singer with a swedish pop back rocks at best

1119
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,200
known uh... for india after cap contribution center of the heart

1120
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:29,200
And also, the look was circulating on some early Max 2 lists, however it appears it got cut or was just an outlight lie the whole time.

1121
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,200
She looks like Lucy Lawless.

1122
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,200
That's not her. This isn't her. This is somebody else.

1123
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,200
Okay, well that chick looks like Lucy Lawless.

1124
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,200
That's her out here. I'll get to it here. I'm on a site here.

1125
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:42,200
The 44-year-old singer fainted in her Stockholm home last week, and she's now in the hospital.

1126
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:49,200
Her record label, EMI Sweden, if you ever wondered how they ended up on Dance Mania, they were just part of EMI Sweden,

1127
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:53,440
said that medical tests showed the singer has a small tumor in the back of her head

1128
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,200
but that more tests were needed to determine proper treatment.

1129
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:02,040
Moroxet is a duo comprised of this young woman, well, older woman, Miss Fredrickson, and guitarist

1130
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,920
and singer Per Gessel, and they were just about to watch a new single called A Thing

1131
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:14,920
About You in three weeks, and they had plans to tour Europe tour that was going to start

1132
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,920
in late October, and the duo is one of the most successful musical exports Sweden has

1133
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:24,280
ever produced and the most successful ever in the US singles charts, which somewhat surprised

1134
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,280
me.

1135
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,520
I always thought ABBA was the bigger of the two bands, but whatever.

1136
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:33,560
Their first UK hit was The Look and a hit number seven on the UK singles charts in 1989.

1137
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,720
And they've had four more top 10 hits in the UK, including It Must Have Been Love, Joyride,

1138
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:43,440
which were both also big hits in the US, and Almost Unreal.

1139
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,880
Fredrickson had also enjoyed successes under her own name, hitting the Swedish charts in

1140
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,920
in 1999, with a duet, Wonderful World, with one of the singers from ABBA, and that picture

1141
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,440
the one you say looks like Lucy Lawless, that's the singer from ABBA.

1142
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,440
It should be noted that that small tumor is actually, uh, Polteri.

1143
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:05,680
No! Polteri put it there.

1144
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:11,680
It's an alien implant from Naoki so that he can control her, too. Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1145
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:22,240
Lastly, in November, the duo joined US singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, and Swedish royal

1146
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:34,960
dignitaries at the party for Lopez's European tour.

1147
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,100
That's some sad news.

1148
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,240
We don't like it when DDR people are going to die.

1149
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,240
Damn, it wasn't Paul-a-tary!

1150
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,240
Grrr!

1151
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,240
Why?

1152
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,240
You're gonna say this and then suddenly Paul-a-tary's gonna get hit by a bus?

1153
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,240
Yeah, suddenly Paul-a-tary's gonna get hit by a bus and you're gonna feel bad, aren't you?

1154
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,240
It's not like anything I ever say ever comes true.

1155
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,240
Oh wait.

1156
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,240
Yeah, it does. Damn.

1157
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,240
Speaking of, um...

1158
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,240
All my cock-naked chicks just fall from the sky every day now.

1159
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,240
Damn.

1160
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,240
Asian porn stars.

1161
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,240
No. Next, please.

1162
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:14,520
One quick little thing, I thought this would be a funny thing to bring up, for sale on

1163
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,600
amazon.com through Toys R Us, Barbie Dance Party, and I'm going to post this link in

1164
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,940
the chat room here, it's a dance pad, it's Barbie's official dance pad, so if you want

1165
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:30,700
to have the girls over for a night of dancing, you know, want to show off to Ken, it's actually

1166
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:35,420
a separate game that I don't think is affiliated with a certain sort of system, it looks like

1167
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,700
uh...

1168
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,740
as it is going to look like one but i don't know we are a rose on it

1169
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,900
i thought that

1170
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,980
uh... that's right

1171
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:48,380
diary i struck a deal with metall

1172
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,180
and with the talent and in the air

1173
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:55,180
to release this came to start subverting small children into the dvd are cold

1174
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:58,420
nobody like instead of a rose got little flowers

1175
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,780
all different

1176
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:02,540
each child that plays this game will get swift

1177
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:04,780
swift dose of nyoki isn't

1178
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:09,100
And pretty soon, Ann DiMuro is going to be releasing the Gemma dance pad.

1179
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,700
Actually, it should be noted that

1180
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,900
Pump It Up, that's just Naoki.

1181
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,540
Still Naoki.

1182
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:20,900
No, it's just like a cigarette trying to hook them while they're young.

1183
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:25,780
So instead of having the seven degrees of Kevin Bacon, we don't have the seven degrees of Naoki?

1184
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,980
Did you just compare DDR to smoking?

1185
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,340
No!

1186
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:36,100
Maybe smoking crack.

1187
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,100
I don't know if this is an actual game or not.

1188
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:42,080
I guess if I really wanted to I could look around Toys R Us's site some more, but I don't

1189
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,080
feel like it.

1190
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,080
So if you guys want to send me stuff, that's fine.

1191
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,900
Do you remember that auction on eBay for DDR Kids?

1192
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,940
Yeah, they're selling a DDR Ohasta machine.

1193
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:49,940
That's pretty rad.

1194
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:50,940
I don't think it's Ohasta.

1195
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:51,940
It's DDR Kids.

1196
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,940
I'm trying to find the link for that.

1197
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,980
Wow, and it's only $50!

1198
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,640
How cheap!

1199
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,920
i wonder if it's uh... padded though

1200
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,580
uh... okay refer fifty dollars uh... did jamie's uh... load up the computer

1201
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:07,060
here she's uh... gonna find something

1202
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,620
anyways sliver

1203
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:11,340
let's make fun of the barbie had some more uh...

1204
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,980
barbie and he could be a candidate

1205
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,880
you think there'd be a kid that too

1206
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,080
like blue

1207
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:21,660
so now we're going to have it that go with new party with uh... wonderful

1208
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:25,920
the party that gives protections in the front and back and also on the side got

1209
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,080
the wings

1210
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,760
That's the new barbie pad right there.

1211
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,920
Jamie found the link

1212
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,800
to the uh...

1213
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,600
Somebody just posted it in the chat room. They actually just beat you to it.

1214
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,980
Looks like Slinky made that post in the chat room here.

1215
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:44,480
Oh! SoCalKicks suggests it's the GI Joe March-a-thon.

1216
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,760
GI Joe March-a-thon.

1217
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,200
SoCalKicks is witty tonight. He's uh... He's on the ball. He's te-funny.

1218
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,260
But this machine, it's like...

1219
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,380
It would probably be as tall as me.

1220
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:54,940
Oh, wow.

1221
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:57,340
It is kind of more like a little kid's machine.

1222
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:58,420
It has this cutesy pad.

1223
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:01,140
It's like a solo, but it has like a flower shape

1224
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,100
with an up, down, left, right arrow.

1225
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,660
And it's just absolutely adorable.

1226
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:06,940
It has a little cheesy curve.

1227
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,540
It looks like it's a little loopy hair.

1228
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:10,580
I don't know if anybody knows Manders,

1229
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:15,100
but it looks about as tall as her, if anybody knows her.

1230
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,100
Only $800.

1231
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,300
What do you think, Jamie?

1232
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,180
Want to pool our money together and buy it?

1233
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:21,540
I think I have $10 on the couch.

1234
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:25,860
I think I've got about $50 in my collection bottle.

1235
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,100
We could sell Dave on the street.

1236
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,420
I think he could get us about $3.

1237
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:35,500
That thing is so cute.

1238
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,220
It is very cute.

1239
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:36,740
I like that.

1240
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,660
It's cute with a K.

1241
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:39,940
Somebody needs to buy this.

1242
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:42,340
We need to find some Sacramento arcade owner to buy that.

1243
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,340
Of course, how much would we play it?

1244
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,740
But this is the great thing.

1245
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:49,980
You could get a little kid away from the big DDR machines.

1246
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:53,980
You got this little machine. Get all the babies on that instead of trying to jump on our machine.

1247
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:58,980
Yeah, have it put out tickets. That's it. That's the cure-all. Have this machine put out tickets.

1248
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,980
It would never deal with small children again.

1249
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:04,980
Rob just said that the machine should put out.

1250
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,980
Thank you for clarifying. Thank you.

1251
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:13,980
Oh, that whole Jenny Rom talk, you know.

1252
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,980
The machine is adorable and people near us need to...

1253
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:24,980
What else am I being given? I'm being given all these other links. Let's see, this one's called Chat Room Sends Me Random Shit and I look it up.

1254
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,980
And...

1255
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,980
Rave Station! Ooh!

1256
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:30,980
Um, no.

1257
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,980
Have a rave in your house!

1258
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:35,980
E not included.

1259
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:39,980
Yeah, E not included.

1260
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:44,980
Oh, what's this? I think this is the Barbie dance pad again. I think somebody just posted that again for somebody who missed it the first time.

1261
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:52,860
oh no Harry Potter vibrating room oh my god that is the worst picture I've ever

1262
01:24:52,860 --> 01:25:01,100
seen look at the Nimbus 2000 toy broom and the thing vibrates and it's about

1263
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:10,540
the width look at how that little kid is holding his little broom and it vibrates

1264
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:15,540
Every little girl's dream. And he has the smile on his face.

1265
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:20,540
This has absolutely nothing to do with DDR, but it's fucking funny.

1266
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:25,540
You must hold the shaft of the broom. Everybody say, up!

1267
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:34,540
Dear diary, today I sold my design for the Memphis 2000 Broom to the hotel, and they bought it.

1268
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,000
And they bought it!

1269
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,240
So now my personal vibrating tool is going to be carried around by small children.

1270
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:43,120
Yet another insidious mauki plot, I rule.

1271
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:47,000
DJ Konami wants me to point out that it does have a warning label on it that says,

1272
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,140
Warning, this toy does not fly.

1273
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,280
That is cool.

1274
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,880
So don't go jumping off the roof.

1275
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,640
Little kids have done that, you know.

1276
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,800
Sat on their Aladdin magic carpet and jumped off the roof and fallen to their deaths and

1277
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:03,800
wondered why.

1278
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,680
Tommy, I was thinking happy thoughts.

1279
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:09,560
No, see, what you do is you're supposed to say, on fly ground,

1280
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,660
and it lifts off from the ground.

1281
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:13,560
It's not like it just kind of glides.

1282
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,960
It's not a glider.

1283
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,680
It flies.

1284
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,060
It doesn't glide.

1285
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,560
It flies off the ground.

1286
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,560
It doesn't glide from the top down.

1287
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,120
And Twen posts a nice little, you know how Amazon has the talk back.

1288
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,760
You can comment on these things.

1289
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,080
So a mother writes, my son has enjoyed zooming around,

1290
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,240
pretending he's flying, and it's important to stress to younger kids

1291
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:38,240
that they're only pretending and the brooms can't really fly, playing kiddich and so on.

1292
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:43,480
The motion-sensitive sound effects are apparently fun for him, but they do get kind of old.

1293
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:46,720
The fact that the broom looks just like the one in the movie doesn't hurt, as far as he's

1294
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,720
concerned too.

1295
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:54,720
Dear diary, children are stupid, they think that they can fly with a toy broom, ha ha

1296
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,720
ha ha.

1297
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,720
Maybe I should do a diary.

1298
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,600
Maybe we should make Naoki's diary.

1299
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,880
Let's get Naoki a dead journal.

1300
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,640
We should make the Orange Lounge dead journal.

1301
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,200
Maybe we'll have to look into that.

1302
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,200
I think so.

1303
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,480
Dear diary, we're taking over the world.

1304
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:17,160
We've kidnapped Stalki and picked his brain.

1305
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:23,600
Let's see, um, oh we want to do your sim update?

1306
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,520
Yes, let's do your sim update.

1307
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:32,460
And then, I also promised we'd plug one of Loki's other creations here, so we're going

1308
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:37,460
We're going to play one of your songs tonight, Loki. So, give us your sim update first, please.

1309
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:47,460
Okay, sim update. No new DWI versions. I really don't care. I've abandoned all hope for DWI since StepMania has surpassed them.

1310
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:56,460
I used to be a pro-DWI guy, but I'm sorry. I've found StepMania, and I love it. So, go StepMania!

1311
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:06,460
Anyways, supposedly a new version coming out pretty soon, Step Mania 6. For some reason, I already have Step Mania 6. I guess, you know, whatever, CBS Build version.

1312
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:10,460
No, didn't you say that Step Mania 6 was first comprised of, like, some other kind?

1313
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:14,460
It wasn't, like, the actual Step Mania thing, and now I guess they're doing an official one or something?

1314
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:22,460
Yeah, whatever I said. I don't know. Anyways, and then there's also a nice little Max 2 skin that's going to be released that's pretty funny.

1315
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:28,780
so that'll be coming out pretty soon, probably next week or so. No new DDR PC characters.

1316
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:33,580
Turning Mix 2, it's wrapping up as of tonight, so we'll have the results next week for you

1317
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:41,440
guys, see who won that, and that'll be fun. I didn't enter, don't care. And let's see,

1318
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:48,740
other news, it may be possible that I might be starting a file serve on the DDR Maniacs

1319
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:56,500
chat room. So all 1300 of my DWIs out there... You're going to give them away? Maybe. I don't

1320
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:00,360
know. I have to see, because I'm going to be doing this at work, so I have a T1 line

1321
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:04,320
constantly running for people to steal it, and I have to see how much hardware space

1322
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:10,780
I have at my computer at work and if the firewall will allow it. So, maybe, maybe not. It might

1323
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:14,980
not happen, but... Oh, somebody's suggesting you should do that file serve in Orange Lounge

1324
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,120
to get more people to come to the channel.

1325
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,120
I could.

1326
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,120
Mmm.

1327
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,120
Okay.

1328
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,120
Just a thought.

1329
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:25,620
See, other than that, there's a pretty cool thing I found about StepMania, it has a Super

1330
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:26,620
Shuffle mode.

1331
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:27,620
That's also very fun.

1332
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:28,620
Super Shuffle?

1333
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:29,620
Yeah.

1334
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,620
Super Duper Shuffle?

1335
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:34,540
Is that like all notes are completely randomized, not just all notes from up go to left or whatever?

1336
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:37,220
Does that make us even more of a Super Duper power?

1337
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:39,620
Uh, yeah.

1338
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,620
Basically what Dave said.

1339
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:46,620
DownUpLeftRight does Super Shuffle and StepMania Beta 6, which is fun.

1340
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:51,620
And yeah, that's about it. Tons of songs, 1300 songs.

1341
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:54,620
I have an addition for your sim update. I know this is one you haven't really been following,

1342
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:57,620
but remember when we talked a couple weeks ago about the Dreamcast one that's coming out?

1343
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:00,620
The Feet of Fury? The game that they're doing?

1344
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:02,620
No one plays the Dreamcast anymore.

1345
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:03,620
I do!

1346
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:05,620
Hey, I still play both of my Dreamcasts.

1347
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:08,620
I play the Nintendo emulator on the Dreamcast, that's about all I use it for.

1348
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:11,620
I played DDR the other day on the Dreamcast.

1349
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:41,860
They released an update on September 20th.

1350
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:45,340
They're saying the release size is only going to be about 28 megs.

1351
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:48,700
There's going to be seven songs in the beta they're going to release very soon.

1352
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:53,120
There's going to be eight characters in it. They're going to have a step editor

1353
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,940
which is going to be...

1354
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:59,300
They've used it to create the steps they've got so far.

1355
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:03,980
And they're going to have a swap CD capability where you can

1356
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:08,200
use the swap CD menu, open up CDs and play your own songs with the music

1357
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:20,520
in Ogg Vorbis format, whatever that is, and the steps in the standard Dance with Intensity

1358
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:25,440
format. So most of the basic stuff is supported but nothing forth, mix or above, like BPM

1359
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:31,280
changes, pauses, freeze arrows, triplets, etc. So it's going to be very basic sorts

1360
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:36,720
of edits. They'll post more about that, and tentatively they're going to have step files

1361
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:40,920
on the VMU, and it'll let you edit your steps for your own songs without having to burn

1362
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,240
a bunch of CDs. That'd be pretty cool.

1363
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,240
So we'll see about that.

1364
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,080
It's fun if you beat batteries in your VMU.

1365
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:52,600
Rumor is that's going to be released on October 1st, I guess. So keep an eye on CAGames.com,

1366
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:57,700
and as soon as we get our little hands on it, we'll give you a full review right here

1367
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:02,040
on Orange House Radio. What's the date today? The 22nd. So you got about, oh actually no,

1368
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,320
it won't be next week. It'll be in a couple weeks.

1369
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:11,920
We'll have it soon. We'll have it soon. When we get it, we'll tell you about it, as we

1370
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:16,600
always do here on Not Orange Long. We're going to take one more quick break and then come

1371
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:21,100
back and wrap up the show, but actually for this break, we've got a very special song.

1372
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:24,600
Loki, you want to tell us about this song? This is Night by Loki. You want us to play

1373
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,240
this song for us? Oh, this is one of my old songs. I thought you wanted me to play this

1374
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,520
one. You want to play one of the other ones instead? Can you play two? Can't play what?

1375
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,520
can we play two? Oh, they're kind of long, actually.

1376
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:35,520
Yeah, they're all kind of long, so I just want to do one, if that's cool.

1377
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,520
Let's play a newer one.

1378
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,520
I mean, Nightmare's pretty good.

1379
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,520
How about...

1380
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,520
Sorry, let me bring up your list.

1381
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,520
Let's see...

1382
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:50,520
Let's start with...

1383
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:54,520
How about we do the one I named after last week's show, Metro Apple.

1384
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,520
Great, yeah.

1385
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,520
An ode to my speaking skills here.

1386
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,120
Okay, we'll try that one.

1387
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,260
I made this a couple months ago. It's fun.

1388
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:08,040
So we're going to play this as Metroopolis. Any other stories behind the song you want to tell us about?

1389
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,520
No, I didn't really have a title for it until about last week.

1390
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,280
And people in chat were asking if I'm going to play that full version of

1391
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:19,040
Dark Forest and also another special

1392
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,440
Ginny Rom song.

1393
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:24,240
I'm going to try and get to those. If we don't get to them during the show,

1394
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,800
we'll do them during the afterbirth, okay? For sure.

1395
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,560
So here we go, this is a Loki with Metropolis here on

1396
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:37,560
orange lounge radio

1397
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:24,100
Oh, you could say.

1398
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:39,100
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1399
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:44,100
Let's go wrestle, let's go wrestle, let's go wrestle.

1400
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:15,400
of my old stuff on there. Pretty good one. Well, it sucks. My one song on there, I have

1401
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:21,120
two. I have one called Dark Side and My Nightmare. Unfortunately, stupidmp3.com copied over My

1402
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:25,480
Nightmare with Dark Side, so I have two copies of that song. And My Nightmare was really

1403
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:29,040
awesome. I love that song, so if we can get to play that maybe by the end of the show,

1404
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,720
maybe. Okay, that'd be cool. We'll get that worked in there somehow. If not, we'll do

1405
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:36,320
in the super-secret after birth.

1406
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,240
Now that's a super-secret.

1407
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:42,360
Twins putting a link in the chat room for everybody.

1408
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:46,880
Okay, one more topic I want to talk about for the end of the show.

1409
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,720
I want to talk about fair pricing for DDR.

1410
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:54,280
Because there's been some local arcades in the area that have kind of been wondering,

1411
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,240
you know, what's a fair price for us to be charging for DDR? So I thought I'd

1412
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,720
take your guys' suggestions.

1413
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:02,280
A lot of people bitch and bitch and bitch about the Metreon being on the high end

1414
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:07,420
of places. I believe it's either $1.50 or $2 a game for three songs. I think that's

1415
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:13,620
a little bit overpriced. Very excessive. But you could get on TV on that show, Extended

1416
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:24,620
Play. Ooh. It's worth the $2, man. Or not. Well, I think that places like Metreon, that's

1417
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:31,720
way too much. I mean, I can see for newer mixes, like Max II and maybe Max or Fifth

1418
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:40,360
Mix being four for three songs or something along that lines. Like I know the one Riptide

1419
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:47,620
Arcade is at the one at Pier 39. Yeah, that place has joint premium for Max II, but it's

1420
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:52,540
like eight quarters or something like that. But it's expensive, but it's joint premium,

1421
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:58,740
So what you're saying is that it costs $2 to play singles or doubles?

1422
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:05,620
Well, you just find someone to split it with because I never go to an arcade alone, if

1423
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:09,180
I know that I'm not going to meet anyone there, so that kind of stuff.

1424
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:13,260
I've gone to arcades alone, nobody loves me.

1425
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,540
I read the best to go to an arcade by myself.

1426
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:20,060
No, seriously, if I go to an arcade in Sacramento, I've never not seen anyone there, except that

1427
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:25,060
when they first got maxed, I went there at 11 o'clock in the morning and I didn't see

1428
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:26,060
anyone maxed.

1429
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:27,060
It's because they were asleep.

1430
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,060
I was like, okay, I must play max.

1431
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:33,740
Then I played Fantasy on reverse and I've now played reverse and I failed.

1432
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:36,380
You had an interesting comment, Jamie, about joint premium.

1433
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:37,380
Your thoughts on joint premium?

1434
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,900
Well, it makes sense to have older, if you've got multiple machines, have the older ones

1435
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,760
on joint premium.

1436
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,900
That way you will encourage people to make use of those older machines too while you've

1437
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:51,460
you've got people that are on the more expensive machines.

1438
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:54,660
That way, all your machines will stay in use.

1439
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:57,380
Good example is Scandia, who are Scandia.

1440
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:59,180
They've got the fourth mix.

1441
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:02,820
Two tokens for three songs, joint premium is on.

1442
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:04,700
So if two people want to play, it's

1443
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:07,220
one token for three songs, a piece.

1444
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:08,140
So that's really nice.

1445
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:11,260
And what's worked for me, I've gotten back

1446
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:12,540
into playing doubles, thanks to that.

1447
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:13,740
Because doubles are always expensive,

1448
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:15,820
and I always bitch about how expensive double are.

1449
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:19,780
for two tokens and joint premium being on, I can play three songs of doubles for two

1450
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:25,940
tokens. That's really nice. So, I like that. SoCalKicks is suggesting that you know what,

1451
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:29,700
DarkSecra, you ought to just win the lottery and run an arcade the right way.

1452
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:34,060
Hey, if I could, you know I would. And Scandiad rules because they have bumper

1453
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:38,380
boats. Scandiad does indeed have bumper boats and

1454
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:42,580
they have a batting cage. So joint premium is really cool.

1455
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:49,700
So you think a fair price, four tokens for three songs, let's say a dollar for three

1456
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:54,700
songs too much, I think 75 cents, a little more fair, I mean what's the most you will

1457
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:56,300
pay for DDR?

1458
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:59,300
Have any of you ever paid to play DDR at the Metreon?

1459
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:00,300
I have.

1460
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:03,700
I paid two dollars for three songs at Anime Expo my first year but it was the first DDR

1461
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:04,700
machine I had ever seen.

1462
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:05,700
It was a third mix.

1463
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:10,020
I played at the Metreon just because like, yay it's the Metreon and I didn't know about

1464
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:16,000
up here at 39 because that was stupid and so I paid way too much but yeah it's cool.

1465
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,560
I'm willing to pay a dollar for three songs, I've gotten used to it because I remember

1466
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:25,580
when at first Roseville Golf Land had gotten Guitar Freaks and there was all these people,

1467
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:30,300
everyone was bitching including me going, well it should be 75 cents for three songs

1468
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:36,100
or 50 cents for three songs because you know it's not DDR and DDR was a dollar for four

1469
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,140
back then because it was a fourth mix.

1470
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:42,140
And then they said, no, it's going to be a dollar for three. You'll get used to it. And everyone has.

1471
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:46,140
And that's basically just been the way of things now, like a dollar for three songs and this stuff.

1472
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:50,140
I paid three dollars to play doubles at Phantom of Khan on a fourth plus machine.

1473
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,140
Wow. Sucker.

1474
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,140
That's what I made two years ago. Was it two years ago?

1475
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:57,140
This year. Oh, they had it this year. I didn't realize.

1476
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:04,140
You know, the year before, I paid a dollar fifty to play, you know, each game of DDR because it was a fourth plus.

1477
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:09,180
Um, you know, like I said, my first anime expo, I paid $2 a game to, to play on my very

1478
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:16,260
first ever DDR machine, so, I mean, now we can afford to be picky.

1479
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:20,980
I, I paid the full price over at the Metron a couple times, just because I wanted to say

1480
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,760
I played DDR at the Metron.

1481
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,760
That's all it was.

1482
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,760
I just wanted to say, okay, you know.

1483
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:25,760
I was there that time.

1484
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:26,760
I played, I played one game.

1485
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:30,900
That was it for me because, you know, yay, Fifth Mix, I could have played that anywhere

1486
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,900
at the time.

1487
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:33,900
So.

1488
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,900
Fifth Mix is becoming a relic along with Fifth Mix.

1489
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:08,900
It's got the PlayStation, you know, sometimes it's just one game, you know.

1490
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:09,900
That machine was crappy though?

1491
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:12,900
And plus I got to play the old school 1.5 mix, and how often do you get to play that anymore?

1492
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:18,900
It was expensive, yes I was ripped off, but you know, it was fun, that's what it's all about, it was worth it.

1493
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:21,900
Well the thing about that particular machine, the one that was out in the hall outside the movie theater,

1494
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:27,900
is you get the glare from those big windows outside and half of the machine was faded in color.

1495
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:32,900
Oh yeah, I mean if I were a regular gamer living in San Francisco, I would not go to the Metreon on a regular basis.

1496
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:36,860
basis. In fact, I know someone who does, and I'm like, why don't you go over to Riptide

1497
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:39,740
Arcade? They've got more money and they've got a better deal on their games. Why don't

1498
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:43,180
you go over there? And it's just kind of like, oh, I don't feel like walking over there.

1499
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:46,700
I don't feel like taking bar to the bus. So it's just kind of like, well, if you really

1500
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:57,700
want to pay it, then go for it. So, I guess that does it for DDR at the Metron.

1501
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:03,700
So we think fair prices, typical standard is about what, 25 cents each song, pretty fair?

1502
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:06,700
I would probably say for max 2 fair is $1 for 3.

1503
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:13,700
For even for 5th mix I'd say $1 for 4, anything under.

1504
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:24,700
For 3rd mix, actually 4th mix and under, I would say 3 for 4 or 2 for 3 and leave it at that.

1505
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:28,700
You know, for 1.5, you know, 1 for 1.

1506
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:29,700
SoCalKicks suggests...

1507
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:31,700
Or maybe 1 for 3, I don't know.

1508
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:33,700
SoCalKicks suggests 30 cents for 5 songs on a max 2.

1509
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:35,700
Okay, it has to be something realistic,

1510
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:36,700
where the arcade owner is going to make their money back.

1511
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:40,700
If it's a nickel arcade, that's a whole different story.

1512
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:43,700
Okay, we're going to take one more quick break

1513
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,700
and then come back and wrap up the show.

1514
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:46,700
The reason why we're taking this break,

1515
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:48,700
there's some songs I really want to play for you guys.

1516
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:51,700
We've got Jenny Rom with a song called Do You Want to Flirt,

1517
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:53,700
which is one of the producer's favorite songs.

1518
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:58,040
songs and then we're gonna hear the full five-minute version of Steve Reiner with

1519
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:02,940
Dark Black Forest long trip so we're gonna play those and we're gonna come

1520
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:09,940
back, wrap things up, and that'll be a show. I'll see you in a little bit.

1521
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:35,020
Can you feel the sky?

1522
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:37,380
Here we are

1523
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:40,480
One moment don't stop and love me baby

1524
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:43,820
One moment don't stop and kiss me baby

1525
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:47,400
One moment don't stop and love me baby tonight

1526
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,340
With me so high

1527
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:53,420
One moment love is not forever

1528
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:56,440
One moment we'll just be together

1529
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:00,440
One moment don't stop and love me baby tonight

1530
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,500
The night will fly

1531
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:35,500
In the shadow of my life

1532
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:40,500
You can be my sunlight tonight

1533
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,500
And you wanna come with me

1534
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:48,500
Hey, do you wanna have a hug?

1535
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:51,500
Kiss me now, be my boy

1536
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:54,500
I'll see you until the sky

1537
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,500
You'll be mine

1538
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,500
One woman down south

1539
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,500
Love me baby

1540
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,500
It's not forever

1541
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,500
On the moon we'll best be together

1542
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:39,500
Woman woman dance like a lonely baby tonight

1543
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,500
Land or flight

1544
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,500
What do you want to die for?

1545
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,500
It's a long way to go, honey.

1546
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:18,500
I know. But I'm afraid. Where are we going?

1547
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:22,500
into the dark black forest.

1548
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:46,500
Into the dark, black forest.

1549
01:55:46,500 --> 01:56:12,660
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

1550
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:17,660
Stream Bobbani Radio. That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1551
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:21,660
Well, we're coming up on the end of the show here, Orange Lounge Radio episode number 13.

1552
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:24,660
Uh, we had a big debate about that in the beginning of the show, by the way.

1553
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:27,660
Uh, so I'm just going around the room collecting closing thoughts.

1554
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:29,660
Uh, Loki, any closing thoughts?

1555
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:31,660
Um...

1556
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:34,660
No, duct tape is cool.

1557
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:35,660
Duct tape is cool.

1558
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:40,660
Duct tape is cool. In fact, Naoki owns duct tape. He will become one of duct tape.

1559
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:45,820
Dear Diary, I've found many uses for duct tape. Sometimes I'll strip down Politarian

1560
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:46,820
t-anyway.

1561
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:52,940
I use it to attach my, uh, male members for when I want to change sexes. You know, switching

1562
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:54,580
me to playing Politarian Naoki.

1563
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:58,460
Did you ever see that one scene in Silence of the Lambs where it-nevermind.

1564
01:56:58,460 --> 01:56:59,460
No, I haven't.

1565
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,460
Never mind.

1566
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:02,460
And Dave, any thoughts from you?

1567
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:05,460
And Dave, any final thoughts from you?

1568
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:09,580
Um, football is cool. I hope DDR USA is.

1569
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:20,300
is, I need to get a Japanese PS2, yeah, 2DX rule. Any final thoughts from you, Jamie?

1570
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:24,980
I like fire. I like fire, too, and that's my final thought.

1571
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:31,040
So, thanks. We light my fire. We light my fire, baby. Thanks to everybody

And on that note, I believe we're going to end this show now.

1587
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:28,900
Let's end this on a high note.

1588
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:31,900
That was very good, Jamie. I'm impressed.

1589
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:34,060
