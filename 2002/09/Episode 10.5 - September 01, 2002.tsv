44042	46143	God damn you, stop calling here!
46323	47363	Isn't it 4215, pussywaves?
47403	48063	You bitch!
48424	52765	Now let me check this, it goes 212, fuck you!
52805	54446	You have no morals, darling.
54566	59428	I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching kiss of purpose.
59468	61829	Kiss my great nooch.
61869	64209	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.
64349	66630	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
66690	68051	Me too!
68091	68591	Fucker, yeah?
68791	69912	I'm working on it.
70512	70932	Loser.
71072	71632	Lame!
71812	73633	I'm the kind of my face...
74548	79112	Breathing breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.
79152	85257	Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.
85677	90741	I am your singing telegram.
90801	95886	Live, but not really, from Roseville Golf Land here.
96326	98288	This is Orange Lounge Radio.
98308	101170	This is a special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, I should say.
101270	102811	It's so special it rides the short bus.
103772	105093	It's episode number 10.5.
105193	107254	We're calling it 10 and a half.
107374	109195	Episode 10 and a half of Orange Lounge Radio.
109275	111096	Because this isn't Sunday, but we're fooling you.
111116	115418	This is our special Labor Day edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
115458	117740	Because we refuse to labor the day before Labor Day.
119207	121228	Yes, Jamie and I are going to be taking the weekend off.
121288	125729	So as you're listening to this right now, Jamie and I are off somewhere vacationing.
125749	127109	I don't want to know what you're off doing.
128470	129210	Somewhere sunny.
129250	131030	Since I know who you'll be with.
131330	138532	Well, actually, at the point that you're listening to this probably Sunday night at 7 o'clock, I'm probably going to be in Sunnyvale, actually.
138912	140753	So I might be getting interviews and things like that.
141313	144534	I wish I could, but I'm spending all weekend and, you know.
145194	146035	I'll just make Dan take me.
146175	147055	It's a private getaway.
147075	148396	Well, you should make Dan take you.
148576	150017	Now, Dan's going to be here tonight, correct?
150177	150617	Somewhere.
150677	152498	We're going to have to get an interview with him at some point.
152659	153159	Oh, God.
154320	164966	For those who are uninformed, Dan is my significant other, also known as the great and terrible DanmanX, also known as GunstarHero for people who have seen me mention that.
165146	165446	Right on.
165746	166207	So, yes.
166787	168389	Also known as Big Hater of Bimani.
168869	170331	He is not a Big Hater of Bimani.
170371	175016	He's the one who got all, you know, who, like, you know, creamed his pants when he played Guitar Freaks.
175877	176317	There you go.
176357	177378	Guitar Freaks is where it's at.
177759	178379	Visual.
179220	182264	No, nobody's allowed to vision dance with me.
182464	182944	I won't.
184206	185487	I'm sorry.
185507	185627	I just...
186974	190316	So, yeah, it's going to be a very experimental show tonight.
190416	192037	It might not even be two hours long.
192077	193298	It might be a weird kind of segment.
193458	195999	We're kind of trying to divvy this up into little segments.
196019	197640	So, Brad is our timekeeper right now.
197920	200381	He'll let me know when we hit 40 minutes for the first segment, right?
201802	202282	Yes, yes.
202322	204464	In fact, we are now at a minute and a half.
204844	205284	Right on.
205804	207865	So, I'm going to introduce everybody that's sitting out.
208586	210227	Now, I guess we should explain the layout.
210347	213649	I wish this was TV sometimes, but we're going to explain the layout of Roseville Golf Club a little bit.
213669	213949	Webcam, webcam.
214809	215530	No webcam tonight.
216090	218972	In fact, there hasn't been a webcam any week except the first week.
218992	219773	We've got to get that fixed.
219793	220193	But we will.
220233	220674	We promise.
221374	226878	Actually, episode 11 next week is going to be a very different show because we're going to have a new intro.
227058	228359	I've already got one planned out.
228919	230040	And hopefully a new site and everything.
230100	231321	Oh, you don't like the idea of a new intro?
231621	233022	No, I love the intro.
233102	234043	It has right now.
234483	237025	Well, we might dig it out of the archives occasionally.
237085	238086	We'll use it for tonight's show.
239487	240468	We get the look from Irene.
240488	240608	Fine.
241835	254723	Anyway, I'm going to introduce the people that are up here upstairs right now because we get some people here that we don't normally get on the show because when we tape at the quote-unquote studio, also known as my office, on Sundays we don't always get the same people.
255524	262468	But we do have some of your old favorites joining us tonight besides the lovely DarkSakura and I. We haven't even introduced ourselves like we do at the beginning of every show.
262488	263349	Dude, they know who we are.
263589	264129	You know what it is?
264149	266431	If they don't by now, then they must have been living under a rock.
267131	269031	I don't get to cheat tonight.
269051	273752	I don't have the computer screen in front of me with the script, the opening script, and what we're going to talk about.
273772	274833	So we still have to plug the chat room.
275333	277093	Yes, because there will be people in the chat room right now.
277113	278593	So they can talk about us while we're not paying attention.
278613	280494	Yes, talk shit about us behind our back right now.
280514	281394	Dude, Rick's playing with my wood.
282174	283014	You've got wood.
283834	284635	I like wood.
285375	286435	That was Rick.
286515	287275	He's playing with my wood.
287295	288895	Oh, you learn lots about Rick on this show tonight.
289155	290156	I'm going to introduce everybody.
290176	291176	I'm going to go around and introduce everybody.
291196	293216	We have Irene, lovely Irene, who's been on many, many shows.
293316	293896	Rice Princess.
293916	296617	Hi, I'm an old favorite.
298300	299641	I think you need to change your Depends, dear.
300202	304947	We have everybody's favorite DDRaholic say hi to Anita.
305607	306348	Hi, everybody.
306888	309091	Now, you don't even know what we're doing, right?
309171	310732	Have you heard Orange Lounge before?
310752	311153	Do you even know...
311915	312456	I've heard of it.
313837	317620	I've sat through about two or three episodes.
318380	319922	Biggest torture of your life, huh?
320962	323725	It was so terrible, I just couldn't tear myself from the computer.
324185	326607	A train wreck so bad you feel like you're in the middle of it.
328108	330310	And then of course we have the always awesome Rick.
330410	332532	Yes, this is Rick, also known on the boards as Rick.
333492	334453	Hi, I'm Rick.
335654	336155	Hi, Rick.
336415	336715	Is that so?
336735	338016	Do you have any words for our listeners?
338777	340038	I'd just like to say that I'm Rick.
341158	341358	He's Rick.
341398	342019	Yeah, I'm back again.
342059	342639	Read the dang thing.
366533	368535	Before I ask questions, read the dank back.
368856	370097	True words were never said.
370998	371779	Or else, fuck you.
372640	373341	Yeah, fuck you.
373461	375524	I'm a funny man tonight.
376325	377026	Motherfucker!
378367	380470	Say hello to our timekeeper tonight, Brad.
381171	383273	We are now at four minutes and a half.
383293	383614	Thank you.
383634	384294	Four and a half minutes.
385239	387021	We only have two more hours to go, basically
406497	410079	When we get tired of talking about Mimani, we do List List, and it's usually Mimani.
410099	411879	Yeah, I was going to say, wait, Mimani, what's that?
411899	412800	We have more people.
412880	414120	Oh, more people.
414240	416461	Come over to the microphones and introduce yourselves.
416742	417482	Introduce yourself.
418362	419203	Look in the microphone.
419683	420143	Say your name.
420183	420523	Hi.
421544	422444	And who are you, miss?
422544	423404	I'm Soonja.
423565	424265	Hello, Soonja.
424445	425185	Hi.
425826	426226	And you are?
426346	428067	Hi, I'm Rai Rai.
428167	428647	Hello, Rai Rai.
428667	429467	Are you an alcoholic, too?
430287	430508	No.
431448	432068	What was the question?
432488	433409	Are you an alcoholic?
435986	436847	I like Holic.
437627	439928	What games do you girls like to play here at Golfland?
441248	442909	I like to play DDR.
443669	445150	She likes to play DDR.
446250	446770	And what about you?
447430	448451	I like playing Para.
449364	450925	Ooh, she's a para goddess.
451585	452165	Paralist.
452365	454826	She's going to teach me some more because I don't know any.
455027	457307	I know a few, but I look dumb when I do them.
457348	457888	I need to know more.
457908	458648	And that's barely.
458708	460049	I clap and wave my hands.
460229	460929	And shake your butt.
461209	462570	And shake my butt to Deluxe.
462590	463070	I know Deluxe.
463090	464090	That was like the first one I learned.
464571	465491	No, actually the first one I learned.
465511	466451	That was like the fifth one I learned.
466812	469673	No, the first one I learned was Boom Boom Fire because that's everybody's first para.
469973	470953	And then Like a Virgin.
470973	471394	Not mine.
471994	474255	My first was Night of Fire.
474898	475899	Yeah, mine too.
476739	477279	Mine was 1-0-0.
477299	477440	1-0-0?
477460	477620	1-0-0-0.
478240	483563	One more whore.
483583	487386	1-0-1 is the upgraded version.
487406	489547	1-0-1 is the upgraded version to 1-0-0.
490568	492529	I still always thought it sounded like they were saying one more whore.
493309	494250	One more whore.
495934	498718	So you weren't at the show, the live show on Sunday.
498758	499719	I was in Vegas.
500881	501962	Tell us about Vegas.
501982	503604	That sounds like an awesome trip.
503644	504405	Tell us all about it.
504686	508831	Imagine 16 DDR Freak moderators sharing a room.
509690	510310	DarkSakura.com
539429	542370	But no, there would just be random comments.
542390	543550	Someone would go, oh, motherfucker.
543570	544811	And someone would go, oh, you got three points.
544851	545271	You flamed.
545991	546911	Or, you're post-whoring.
546931	547672	You're talking too much.
548432	550252	Now, does somebody walk around and filter people?
550352	552613	Like, if you're like, oh, shit, I messed up.
552633	553833	Someone would go, poopy.
555034	568258	No, but basically the first night when we got there, the first thing that happened is Evian, Colin, he came in, looked at Doreen, Miss Toy, and goes, oh, DarkSakura.
569884	574608	Yes, so once again, we get the, oh, I thought you were Asian for me, so.
575048	578491	For those out there that don't know, DarkSakura is a honker.
578511	581673	Oh, we're going to introduce Ted.
582234	584175	Ted doesn't even know what's going on here.
584195	586437	Hi, I'm Ted.
587078	588979	Do you have any idea what we're doing right now, Ted?
589099	590741	I have no idea what you guys are doing right now.
590921	592002	That's about as much as I know.
592382	593483	Okay.
593503	595424	You've got to talk into the mics more or else we don't hear you.
595444	596605	What?
596625	596886	I've got to...
597686	602027	What are you talking about?
602087	603087	He's a mushroom.
603127	604028	He's a fuck guy.
604088	604528	Ha ha.
604928	606328	Anyway, more for my Vegas story.
606368	606588	Yes.
606868	608729	Because I am the mic whore now.
608749	609929	I just want to warn the listeners out there.
609949	611569	Tonight's show, very different, very random.
611809	613250	Could be the best show we ever do.
613290	614090	Could be the fucking worst.
614110	614850	You can hear a burp.
615910	616270	Anyway.
616791	617111	Oh, yeah.
617151	618231	There's more about burp later.
618431	618691	Anyway.
620191	620391	No.
620972	625957	No, I won a dog in one of the crane games because, once again, I raped the crane game and I won a dog and named him Burp.
626337	628860	Now, did the crane game call the police?
628980	630441	Did it say... Oh, bye, Ry-Ry.
630581	631582	Later.
632163	632883	Bye.
632903	633264	She left.
633564	640371	You know who I feel... One of our regular listeners, Slinky, also known as Will, was here and, like, ready to be on the show and...
640931	643332	We were supposed to start taping at 7.30 tonight.
644132	647974	We got here and we thought, oh, we'll play one Bomani game and then we'll tape.
648114	649415	Then one kind of turned into five.
650735	653696	By the time we were ready to tape, Slinky's parents showed up and took him home.
653856	654777	I didn't last I saw him.
654797	657278	He was napping in the sumo game.
657418	658078	Oops.
658518	659038	Sorry, Slinky.
659058	659999	We'll get you on another show.
660458	661159	We love you.
661239	661779	Parents.
662860	663260	Maybe.
663280	664861	Take them away from the show.
665782	666643	Oh, you guys have to get going?
666823	668704	Well, wait, before... Okay, we'll take a break from the Vegas story.
668724	671507	You want to plug your new role-playing game that's coming out?
671527	672387	Because this is pretty cool.
672848	673408	You want to plug it?
673528	674449	Okay, I guess so.
674529	683716	My new game that I made after three years of work with me as the sole programmer, my friend Steve as the sole artist, is an epic-size role-playing game in 2D.
684276	686178	It's an epic computer game.
686378	687359	It's actually a...
687978	688859	Dragon Warrior, Bitchy
709017	717260	Actually, it's a lot like Earthbound as well, which wouldn't surprise me because Earthbound, as some may or may not know, is Rick's most godly RPG ever.
717361	718821	My favorite game of all time.
719081	721422	The battles really remind me of Earthbound battles.
721442	725324	Do you get a bat as a weapon?
726324	736161	you actually get several bats as a weapon you can have a rock as a weapon or you can have a stick with a little nail poked through it that's what it's called a stick with a nail poked through it as a weapon no orange bat of justice?
736682	739306	no but there's a hammer of justice that you get in the courthouse
740080	741521	The Deer Carcass The Double Chin
762509	764951	It's extremely powerful.
765191	766712	It is a very, very powerful item, yeah.
766752	771075	It's a gaga, because if you hit people with your gaga, that's embarrassing as well as... It makes you go gaga.
771395	771996	Exactly.
772696	773297	I wet myself.
773577	774658	I know, huh?
774698	774998	Daily.
775158	777860	Are there any Bamani references in the game?
777900	781783	Did you try at all to incorporate the DDR taking over my fucking life thing in there, or...
783944	784464	You know what?
784525	785946	There are so many jokes in there.
786026	795233	So many megabytes of just text jokes that I can't even imagine that I didn't stick a few Bomani jokes in there.
795333	795693	Right on.
795773	797895	So any expected time of release?
798215	800216	Like in time for Christmas to put under the tree?
800236	803499	Yeah, I'm hoping actually to be done with it by the end of September.
803899	805380	I'm thinking as far as that goes.
805400	806581	We're getting really close to done.
806781	807882	The bug counts.
808022	810024	We're not getting anything back at all.
810544	813186	Well, I haven't played the new one yet, so we'll see.
813246	815128	I'm the stickler on beta testing, so we'll see.
815148	825577	As soon as we're done with that, we're moving on to Cedric the Littlest Demon, where you fight the devil, then you fight Nietzsche in Limbo, and then you have to fight God in Heaven, and then you win the game when you can kill God.
826377	829260	And so we're hoping that killing the God game will be cool.
829600	831362	That's only on this Black Matrix-y, though.
831742	833083	Have you ever heard of Black Matrix?
833523	834104	No, uh-uh.
834444	840349	Black Matrix is an RPG where, in their universe, God and Satan fought, and Satan won.
840369	841470	Ooh, cool.
841810	843871	So you play as the slave of a dominatrix.
844592	845493	I'm down with that, yo.
847497	848917	Is it going to be something you have to pay for?
848937	850058	Is it going to be completely free?
850158	850658	Or what's the deal?
850818	852279	QDRPG is going to be totally free.
852580	858243	Depending on how many people we get playing it, we may or may not do Cedric free as well.
858603	863446	But QDRPG 2, which is going to be completely different, has absolutely nothing to do with QDRPG 1 whatsoever.
863886	866608	As most old Nintendo sequels did.
866988	868289	Like Castlevania 2.
868369	869229	Nothing like the first at all.
869269	870590	Yeah, and they're going to be completely different.
870610	871651	It's going to be a completely different idea.
871671	872972	We're definitely in charge for that.
873192	874493	And actually the game after that is going to be 3D.
875473	876535	But we still get free copies, right?
876876	878158	Always going to get free copies from all my friends.
878538	878919	Always.
879280	880241	But you guys listening have to pay.
880281	881003	Thanks for interviewing.
884702	888904	And we'll let all our listeners know when QDRPG is released and where you can get a copy of it.
889404	892606	If you like them RPG type games, you guys want to comment?
893206	895487	And before we change the subject, I don't think Rick brought it up.
895567	896928	I have to give some credit to Timmy.
897288	899729	Timmy did an awesome job on the soundtrack on this game.
899969	903390	If you like techno-ish type of music and stuff like that, it's great.
903410	904031	It's got good music.
904531	910133	And probably the best thing that I like about this game, it's just full of great jokes and cheesy shit like that.
910414	910914	You gotta play it.
911534	915718	It's not going to be like Diablo-style graphics or anything, if that's what you're expecting.
916118	919140	But it's 8-bit goodness.
919321	922083	It's a cross between Super Nintendo and Nintendo.
922183	923464	It's a little more than 8-bit.
923544	924805	Yeah, maybe like 10-bit.
926146	926947	Three and a half!
927968	929009	You wanted to say something, Irene?
929509	933891	Oh, did he say something about fighting Nietzsche on there?
934311	936012	The philosopher guy?
936052	937093	That's going to be in the next game.
937133	937873	Yeah, that's what I mean.
938093	938893	In the next game.
939894	941094	The philosopher guy or whatever?
941175	941895	I guess, yeah.
941955	942675	Knowing Rick, yeah.
943896	944296	Okay.
947077	950419	It would be rather wrong to fight him with the Bruce's Philosopher song in the background.
951624	954186	Ehh, Manuel Kett was real pissed that he was very ready, stable.
954566	960511	The armies, yeah, run by Jesus and Santa, the holodeus and such, stuff like that.
960591	963573	It's great, just different references throughout the entire game.
964636	965236	It's good stuff.
965736	967196	So, back to my Vegas thing.
967236	968797	So, yes, let's get back to the Vegas trip.
968817	971397	Well, we wanted to make sure we got Rick's plug on the air before he had to go, so.
971877	972357	Okay.
972897	975718	Well, anyway, I was in Vegas and y'all weren't, so.
976618	976818	So.
977998	983199	No, basically, when we first got there, it was basically all the moderators hanging out together.
983319	985239	Well, I mean, we were all of us moderators anyway.
985280	986540	We went to the food court to hang out.
987340	993401	I, like, played $10 worth of nickels and then won, like, five of it back on video poker, which I apparently own at.
994341	1015749	and then um yeah like my total winnings for the whole weekend was like two dollars and ninety five cents which is part of my cab fare um notable how much a foot long those those hot dogs i did not buy an elephant penis they were selling these hot dogs that were like two feet long and really fat so they were being referred to as elephant peni as the cock of the elephant anyway
1016960	1024084	So as it went on that night, we went to the Rio for the gigantic, humongous seafood buffet.
1024484	1030588	It's like 30 bucks, but you could get sashimi, Maine lobster, calamari, all kinds of cool, awesome seafood.
1031907	1043752	Um, and then, you know, that night at the Rio, there was this awesome Perfect Attack showdown between, um, uh, Potguy and, um, uh, Enoan, or Nor, as he's also known.
1043792	1053596	There's also, uh, uh, Blue was also showing off some pretty, pretty awesome, um, uh, double skills, you know, going up into the sixes and sevens on some of those.
1053776	1054076	Right on.
1054336	1054416	Um.
1054996	1058139	I, of course, raped the crane machine there and ended up giving up a lot of my stuff.
1058980	1063644	Walking back, we were going back inside of the hotel and all of a sudden I hear, DDR Freak!
1064585	1068708	And that's when our Stalker fanboys, DJ Bubbles and his friend, found us.
1069569	1073192	I guess apparently they came from out of town to find us.
1074613	1076934	and buy coffee for us or something.
1077474	1077814	Cool.
1077834	1082895	But the next day, well, I didn't fall asleep until after 7 a.m.
1082995	1084535	for some reason because I was really tired.
1085495	1087636	Too much excitement.
1087956	1090736	We went to the Game Land Arcade, which was freaking amazing.
1090836	1093637	That arcade, I played Mambo a Go-Go there.
1094157	1095277	Mambo!
1095477	1096277	No, forget this.
1096597	1098598	For two tokens a play.
1099418	1109809	DDR Max 2 for 2 tokens of play, Beat Mania 3 6-core for 2 tokens of play, Radiant Silver Gun.
1112440	1113560	We apologize to your speakers.
1114841	1116161	That was literally my reaction.
1116221	1120662	I got to play the photo game in Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, which was really amazing.
1121902	1137826	The arcade owned, and of course we were showing up the, well, I didn't, but the locals were sort of sitting there, you know, mouth open, watching as some of the more notable freestylers, namely Mel B, DJ 8-Ball.
1138446	1139846	Is the story making you excited over there?
1141860	1144686	Past memories of Boomtown in Reno.
1144706	1145227	It's great.
1145768	1149155	But, you know, they were showing their stuff, and...
1150595	1160480	And then everybody went back because some people wanted to go see O. No, I heard about, well, I heard about that I guess there was some kind of pump it up challenge going on.
1160921	1162001	That was Friday night.
1162822	1165103	Apparently one of the locals got really pissed off.
1165383	1168485	He's like, you're stealing my spotlight, those are my arrows.
1169946	1171607	And he was basically getting owned.
1171647	1173448	Hey, I found a Prop Cycle, so I was happy.
1174588	1177090	Because Prop Cycle is the best game ever by Namco.
1178871	1180472	Anyway, back to Saturday night.
1183154	1190060	Iguana Girl, Islander, and I all went to the Star Trek experience and met up with my friend Tiara and her man Rick.
1190260	1191962	Which you have to do if you ever go to Vegas.
1192002	1195525	Whether you're a fan of the show or not, it's just the coolest thing in Vegas, I think.
1197106	1197406	Shut up.
1197506	1198787	Well, we went sober once.
1199887	1202408	And then we had a warp core breach.
1203309	1214873	We basically, between the three of us, between me, Iguana Girl, and Islander, we had a large, they shared a large one and a small one, and then I had a small one all to myself.
1215574	1218895	And, ooh, okay, I just got given a tape.
1218975	1219795	Tal just showed up.
1219835	1220936	You want to say hello to everybody?
1220956	1221616	Your CD's in the car.
1222036	1223397	And what up, my niggers?
1226844	1231970	Anyway... You can address those cards and letters to Tal, courtesy of Tal's house.
1232171	1234093	I was telling a story!
1234433	1235474	Sorry, yes, finish your story.
1235795	1236095	Anyway...
1238726	1251357	So after my friends left, we had this drunken walk over to Circus Circus so Iguana Girl could play the old machine up in the Midway, which was ass on the right player side because half the buttons didn't work.
1251458	1254280	That's the same machine that I played DDR on for the very first time with Circus Circus.
1254300	1255141	Lost your DDR virginity.
1255381	1257163	Yes, lost my DDR virginity.
1257243	1258364	It's a USA machine now.
1258384	1260906	The 1.5 is downstairs and actually has a good pad.
1261166	1261827	Last time I played.
1262227	1263588	But anyway...
1264329	1274876	There was more, no we don't have 4th Plus yet, there was more staying up until all hours of the morning and playing Taboo, Drunken Taboo, which was like the absolute winner.
1275336	1286883	And that actually had the quote of the evening, which was, it's like a penguin, but it's in this place where the British used to send their criminals and that was trying to get them to say kangaroo.
1289750	1297333	Yes, this is... Because, you know, Taboo, you have a list of five words that, you know, you cannot use to describe your main word that's on the thing, and you have a timer.
1298093	1299654	Like, I used penguin twice.
1300194	1306557	I was using penguin for tuxedo, and I used penguin... It's like, it's colored like a penguin, but it's equine for a zebra.
1306997	1307377	What?
1307397	1308658	You know, mine made sense.
1308698	1310178	I don't know where you get, you know, kangaroo from.
1310198	1310558	Kangaroo?
1310839	1311339	I'm lost.
1311659	1313860	And the other best one, it's like...
1314760	1316601	I was trying to get someone to say the word blow.
1316621	1317821	Yeah, I read that one online.
1317901	1323063	And the quote was, it's like, if I wanted you to suck my cock, you would be giving me a blank job.
1324243	1326944	So... Did they get it?
1327484	1328444	Yes, actually, they got it.
1329144	1332085	And our team actually did get the kangaroo.
1332405	1338707	So that was... We just started listing off Australian animals like koala, kangaroo.
1339007	1340808	So... Anyway, um...
1342196	1354542	The next day was, you know, we all checked out and a bunch of people went to this other buffet and I went to All You Can Eat Sushi with my friend and hung out at Circus Circus and got to play Tsurugi, which is the best game ever.
1355122	1357523	It's basically, it's like mo-cap boxing and...
1359952	1364834	Police 911, only you have a sword with a light sensor and you get to, you know, cut people in half and cut off their head.
1364894	1365274	Cool.
1365314	1365594	The U.S.
1365734	1366654	name is Blade of Honor.
1367774	1371716	Apparently DJ Abba found a Tegno motion machine at Excalibur in the basement.
1372296	1372516	Ooh.
1372696	1374336	But I didn't get to play it, unfortunately.
1374897	1375017	Ah.
1377288	1382071	And I played Pump It Up Perfect, but it was a crappy, broken one.
1382852	1387255	And they had a great firefighters machine, Ferrari F9355, the full three monitor one.
1387275	1389456	New York had an awesome arcade for the casinos.
1395740	1397621	But the best arcade you went to would be that game.
1397882	1398742	Oh, Game Land.
1398782	1401344	GameWorks is ass, except they have Sonic Fighters there.
1402405	1406388	And Tekken 4 on a projection TV with a couch with controllers attached to it.
1406908	1407308	Oh, cool.
1407689	1410411	This is good for people to know, because Vegas is a big tourist spot.
1410431	1411932	Do not play Guitar Freaks there.
1411972	1412532	It sucks.
1412572	1415474	And the DVR is a USA machine, and they overprice everything.
1415514	1417376	It's like $1.50 for a play on a USA machine.
1417416	1418256	Oh, it's like the Metreon.
1418757	1420138	Yeah, but it's like ass.
1420378	1423200	At least it's, you know, the decor is better, and they play Good Trance in the background.
1424301	1424421	So...
1425762	1427004	How many places did you guys go?
1427725	1428866	All over the damn city.
1430168	1431690	Did you get to see any showgirls?
1432451	1435435	This one drag queen showgirl gave me a flyer.
1436537	1439921	And people were collecting pictures of the boobs.
1440422	1441323	Did you get any free prom?
1442893	1447075	I didn't want any free prawn because there was like... The free prawn in Vegas is stupid.
1447615	1453498	It was like they were all ugly and they were fake boobs and one of them was a man.
1453778	1455099	Because you could see the Adam's apple.
1456019	1457740	Ew!
1460842	1464924	Anyway, so this is actually starting to lead into my fuck you of the week.
1465902	1468803	Now we don't have the music backdrops tonight, so we'll just have to hum it.
1468823	1470443	So you can edit it in.
1470663	1472104	This is fucked up!
1472984	1474904	Okay, anyway, we can edit that in.
1475164	1488188	Anyway, so, my fuck you of the week starts off with us getting out, with Iguana Girl Jessica and I getting on the plane, and this like really rude asshole was on his cell phone, and...
1490177	1490677	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1511013	1516557	We, um, we, uh, I turned around and said, you know, excuse me, you need to watch what you're doing.
1516617	1517298	You know, I fussed at him.
1517318	1520380	He's like, oh, um, I'm having five conversations at once.
1520500	1521661	And then he just started walking off.
1522161	1527925	So, um, we were over there laughing at him when they told him to turn off his cell phone before takeoff because apparently he didn't hear that either.
1528966	1533127	And then there was this guy behind me whose kid kept kicking me in the back of the chair and I kept looking at the kid.
1533747	1539348	And I was just talking to Jessica, you know, my business was like, yeah, my fight was okay except I kept getting kicked in the butt.
1539368	1540448	And he's like, stop whining.
1540488	1545910	And apparently he kept bitching when I drafted him out listening to my, you know, Luna C compilation.
1546470	1547890	He was, you know, he was a fucktard.
1547930	1550150	So fuck him and fuck the guy on the cell phone.
1551431	1556572	And my other fuck you of the week goes to the unemployment development department.
1556832	1557192	Ha ha ha.
1557632	1563354	Which, okay, I didn't get any sleep last night, so forgive me for slurring a little bit and being tired and bitchy.
1563374	1564395	She just sounds a little drunk.
1564415	1565155	She's a little hungover.
1565255	1569076	And I'm PMS-y, so don't give me any bullshit.
1569817	1573258	Anyway, I tried to get out of it.
1573318	1574018	I couldn't get out of it.
1574098	1575519	So I hop on the bus at 10 a.m.
1577869	1586035	Go all over freaking Sacramento to try to get to... Basically, it's where Stockton Boulevard and Broadway meet, but it's like another block past that.
1586055	1587356	It's at 50th and Broadway.
1588857	1590579	I got down there, kept napping on the bus.
1590959	1593021	I got there at a quarter after 1.
1593721	1594862	This is from getting on the bus at 10.
1595723	1596083	Wow.
1596843	1598124	And I was there for 30 minutes.
1598144	1604009	The guy was so condescending and was talking down, and I probably had more brain in my butt than he did in all of his head.
1604729	1604969	So...
1606310	1619613	So, you know, basically I got out of there as fast as possible and got home at like a quarter after five o'clock and decided and just wolfed down all these espresso beans so I'm a combination of tired and hyper.
1619933	1621573	So, fuck EDD.
1621753	1623294	Fuck them right in their stupid ass.
1623654	1624994	Fuck the guy on the cell phone.
1625014	1627055	Fuck anybody who acts like that on their cell phone.
1627475	1631475	And fuck the stupid guy from Burbank who sat behind me.
1632396	1632816	Fuck him.
1633296	1633796	Fuck them all.
1634778	1635258	May they die.
1661414	1662275	So fuck Absolute.
1663876	1668399	And Matt, also known as Loki, who just showed up, has a fuck you of the week as well.
1670020	1673762	It goes to my fucking laptop because it won't read my card writer.
1674163	1677665	That's the whole reason I bought the damn laptop is to use my card writer on it.
1677725	1680507	And if it doesn't work, then what the hell did I get a crappy laptop for?
1680547	1681147	I'll buy it from you.
1681868	1682048	Okay.
1683576	1685117	That changes everything.
1685557	1686037	Never mind.
1686758	1687378	Scratch that from the list.
1688078	1690039	My fuck you of the week, I don't have one.
1690099	1691280	I can't think of anything.
1691360	1693121	If I think of one later in the show, I'll mention it.
1693321	1695162	My fuck you of the week is you don't have a fuck you of the week?
1695342	1695702	Fuck you.
1698843	1700684	Rob isn't being nice to this week.
1701204	1702825	The Penguin has a fuck of the week.
1703566	1706187	And I've played Max Unlimited so many fucking times.
1707850	1711773	I'm guessing over 30, I'm so pissed off, and so is my legs.
1712234	1715437	And he fails on the same note every fucking time.
1715897	1718640	Fails the same note every fucking time.
1718700	1721922	It's... Sorry.
1722123	1722803	A lot of anger here.
1722823	1723544	I'll kill you.
1723564	1723804	No, no, no.
1723924	1724465	I'll kill you.
1724485	1725546	Oh shit, he killed me.
1727928	1729189	No, we sympathize.
1729429	1730670	I mean, I've been there so many times.
1730710	1732171	I remember the first time I tried to beat Max 300.
1732251	1732311	Ah.
1734482	1735143	Thank you for watching!
1750154	1753697	And one more, fuck Brazil Golf Land for not having 4th Plus yet.
1753798	1757141	Even though we're here right now, just pretty much loitering is what we're doing.
1757181	1758222	We're just sitting upstairs.
1758602	1760244	We're in the party area right now.
1760584	1763927	There's a lot of partying going up on Yahoo.
1764388	1768491	This employee came by and looked at us funny earlier, like, uh, are they supposed to be here?
1769252	1770954	Apparently so, because we have the microphones.
1771174	1772475	And is that any different than usual?
1772495	1773416	They always look at us funny.
1774297	1774497	True.
1774557	1775298	That's when we're playing.
1776892	1778072	That's when Rob's playing Deluxe.
1778633	1780013	Let's go interview employees.
1780053	1780833	That sounds like fun.
1780933	1782374	Well, we could do that in a later segment.
1782394	1782894	That would be great.
1783294	1788355	I think actually what I want to do maybe next segment is maybe just be mobile.
1788455	1793257	Since we have a mobile unit here, maybe we'll walk around and tour Golfland and give our opinions on the games.
1793677	1795858	We'll talk about every single thing that is broken.
1796878	1797598	Like everything?
1798038	1798859	Yeah, like everything.
1800179	1801419	So it'll be a nice long segment.
1801439	1802440	Hey, we've got two hours to fill.
1802980	1803420	Wee!
1807153	1813518	Since we just kind of got off the whole Vegas thing, I was recently in Vegas, and I happened to come across a Dance Dance Revolution tournament.
1814339	1819402	They had a Perfect Attack and a Freestyle tournament, and they had 40 slots for each.
1819883	1823986	I got the 11th slot for Freestyle, so I was good there.
1824026	1824927	I definitely got to play.
1825207	1829630	But I got 41 on the Perfect Attack, and that pissed me off.
1830551	1833633	And somebody dropped out, so I got 40.
1833893	1835515	So I'm like, yes, but I played last.
1836394	1839736	So, you know, I was waiting for like, what, four hours to play, something like that?
1840156	1843378	So, you know, I get through and I play my freestyle, and I did great.
1843539	1843979	I loved it.
1844099	1844659	I had fun.
1844899	1846821	I did all three of the songs perfectly.
1847661	1854886	And then the guy that goes after me does a fucking backflip over the freaking rail and goes through and hits his... I don't know how he did it.
1855166	1857848	But I got second there, so I got a CD player.
1858328	1862370	And then in Perfect Attack I played last, and I triple-hit a couple of songs.
1863191	1864152	And that was, um...
1864992	1865573	Wow, you know.
1865993	1867555	So I got first place, 500 bucks.
1868015	1870918	And there's, um, you know, that's my story.
1871259	1871679	Sweet!
1872039	1872780	Congratulations.
1873061	1875423	I didn't know we had a local that owned the Vegas tournament.
1875503	1876024	That's news.
1876424	1880108	I've noticed that there's a different breed of freestyle in Vegas, you know.
1880128	1881029	Exosauce?
1882841	1883261	Hey there.
1883501	1884222	Well, you know.
1884722	1886103	The views and opinions of our guests.
1886463	1890185	Yeah, the Vegas freestylers suck.
1890245	1894768	I've noticed lots of A-Team action going on, so when I broke out, my new freestyle loved me.
1894808	1895408	I had a crowd.
1896089	1897790	I found a place for my freestyle.
1897910	1898970	Vegas, here I come.
1901332	1902172	Dynamite Rage.
1902192	1908276	Well, I'm making this announcement now when we have our tournament at, hopefully, you know, we're trying to get it at Folsom Game Room.
1908516	1908856	Wow.
1910245	1913366	because we may have a particular machine by then.
1913386	1916308	There may be a new machine coming in that we want to have another tournament on.
1916888	1917889	Can't say anything about it.
1918089	1919630	Can't say until it comes in.
1919710	1924572	But we're either going to have it here or there, here at Roseville Golf Land or there, if ever I hear back from management.
1925773	1928294	Anyway, I'm going to try to contact them again.
1928354	1934338	But back to what I was saying, one of the freestyle segments is going to be a team style freestyle.
1934358	1934598	Oh, God.
1935442	1942225	So you will be encouraged to pull out your best knee drops, hand plants, back flips, but no matrix walk.
1942425	1943645	Aw, no matrix walks.
1943985	1946326	It's pretty much going to be the replacement for improv freestyle.
1946346	1950628	Yes, because improv was where it was a novel idea, the novelty.
1951628	1954490	It was a novel idea, just a lot of shitty entrants.
1954530	1957071	And sorry to those of you that entered Improv Freestyle.
1957312	1960173	There were some good ones, but a lot of you got up there and PA'd.
1960313	1963275	It wasn't necessarily that the skill was bad, it's that they got some ass steps.
1964115	1969959	I don't know if it was ass steps or me, but mine really sucked.
1971428	1978192	Actually, part of the problem was that, you know, our bad, we picked, I should just say my bad, blame me, I was in freestyle.
1978272	1981835	I thought, oh, four to six feet songs, people can improv those, those aren't too bad.
1982335	1986017	Whoops, I probably should have done like two and three foot songs and one foot songs.
1986318	1991341	Actually, if I ever do another improv freestyle tournament, it's all going to be beginner songs on USA as far as I'm concerned.
1992502	1993923	I can only improv on Heavy.
1994343	1995444	I love improv.
1995564	1997025	And that's how I make all my freestyles.
1997085	1998766	It's improv over and over and over again.
1999606	2000887	Were you playing last October?
2001207	2002148	Were you playing in October?
2002408	2005430	No, I haven't gotten to play in any of the Sacbimani tournaments.
2005450	2008012	Well, there's going to be another one coming up by the end of the year.
2008272	2011494	Also, if it's at Folsom Game Room, I have no way to get there.
2011855	2012875	We'll find you a way.
2012895	2014676	Somebody here at the table will get you.
2014877	2015937	You're on the board, right?
2016297	2016538	I am.
2016618	2018099	Yeah, we'll get you there somehow.
2018599	2020881	I posted on the whole series.
2021201	2021501	Oh, yeah.
2021621	2023062	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2023082	2023242	Yeah.
2023703	2023963	So.
2024704	2024944	Well.
2025545	2029668	Oh, but I do want to say one improv freestyle that I liked a lot at the tournament was Bradley.
2030229	2030529	Yes.
2030689	2032170	For those who didn't see, he did Little Bitch.
2033431	2034713	And he just kind of got into it.
2034773	2036194	At the end, he was just like, rawr.
2037195	2037635	It was great.
2037675	2038056	I loved it.
2038216	2039597	And he didn't say hi, so I said hi.
2040318	2040478	Oh.
2040938	2041298	Whee!
2042079	2043420	The Little Bitch himself, Bradley.
2043460	2043821	Yes, sir.
2043841	2044021	Whee!
2045190	2045870	How was your move?
2045910	2048411	You just moved recently to get a little closer to Golfland.
2048812	2050072	Yes, it went good.
2050632	2053053	I'm still unpacking stuff, moving things around.
2053433	2059936	You had to move out of the town of sorority life and get into a little closer to Rosa Golfland.
2060156	2062737	Well, yeah, because he was in Davis where they film sorority life.
2064377	2065178	Whoa.
2065278	2065478	Yes.
2066661	2069482	Let's talk to Anita, because we haven't talked to her much during this show yet.
2069802	2071262	Spotlight's on you!
2071302	2072163	Spotlight's on you, girl.
2072683	2072943	Come here.
2073483	2074983	Tell us about where you're from.
2075023	2076784	You're from a little hick town up north.
2078884	2080225	Yes, I'm from Yuba City.
2080585	2082805	Yes!
2085366	2091008	Now you want to give a little plug, because I know Yuba City has a little team of regulars up there that play, and I love the name of this team, by the way.
2091308	2092388	So tell us about the team up there.
2093126	2096829	Okay, our team is called the Token Stealing Toddler Stompers.
2098310	2098990	Awesome name.
2099210	2100331	Best name ever.
2100571	2100832	Yes.
2101092	2106316	I hate Golf Land for the sole reason that you have to babysit your freaking tokens.
2106756	2107096	Yes.
2107616	2109598	Yes, we got sick and tired of doing that.
2109618	2113321	We actually inspired this new setup of plastic tokens.
2113821	2116723	But we don't use those anymore because there's not enough people.
2116743	2119405	Like, you know when you got like a thousand tokens up on the machine.
2119745	2121647	If everybody has their own color-coded token...
2122287	2123908	Then you can tell who's, you know, in line.
2124188	2127810	They were using licenses at GameWorks so that people wouldn't run off with their cards.
2128671	2128851	Oh!
2129331	2131292	You know, ID cards student IDs licenses.
2131633	2132013	Yeah.
2132994	2135335	And explain why, what do you mean by cards?
2135355	2137096	Because some people may not have been to GameWorks ever.
2137776	2145061	They use token, instead of tokens, they use those little credit cards like the Metreon uses.
2147327	2149189	So, you were saying about your team.
2149689	2150069	Oh, yeah.
2150109	2156455	Token Stealing Tyler Stompers was inspired by a little incident that happened at one of our arcades.
2157196	2167705	A little kid got into a little trouble, and we sort of, well, one of our girls, her name is May, and she ended up pushing the little kid a little bit.
2168185	2168926	Just a little bit.
2168946	2169326	Just a tiny bit.
2169546	2170687	Thanks for watching!
2187190	2194877	So how is the scene in a little, because for those who don't know, Yuba City is kind of one of those towns that's like, it's just kind of there on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere.
2195117	2200842	Actually, now it's getting bigger because it has the Sacramento Amphitheater in the town, so it's getting a little bit more notoriety that way.
2201202	2207928	But how is it playing DDR like in the middle of nowhere, where you've got to really drive a long way to get something outside of DDR?
2209851	2212632	Well, I work in Sacramento, so driving's not too bad for me.
2213433	2217094	But we do have a Max 2 now, so that is a lot of fun.
2217335	2218955	Everybody has a freaking Max 2 now.
2218995	2219756	What is up with that?
2220016	2220556	Illegal kids.
2220656	2223197	I mean, happy kids.
2223317	2224078	Oh, my boots.
2224518	2225378	My legs hurt.
2225398	2226559	My boots and my leg.
2226659	2227099	Boot leg.
2227239	2231081	Oh, yeah, same.
2232021	2236143	It's the... Hey, we like to think that we're legal kids.
2236243	2237303	Yeah.
2237343	2238204	They're the great pretender.
2240317	2242778	It's really not that bad in Yuba City altogether.
2243018	2248600	The folks, I mean, as DDR communities go, we've got a lot of really great people there.
2250601	2252281	We used to have two places to go.
2252302	2257003	Now we only have one, but the people who work there are really good to us.
2257023	2257723	They listen to us.
2258404	2262345	If we want the machine turned up, they're happy to do it, and we've never had problems there.
2262825	2263305	Awesome.
2263345	2264946	So it's really great, yeah.
2265206	2266567	That sounds like a dream come true.
2267347	2267647	In fact...
2269059	2270100	Yeah, what was that again?
2270981	2275145	It's unlike here at Golfland, where when we ask them to turn it up, they turn it down to half volume.
2275685	2276266	Exactly.
2276966	2281491	That's because they're backward ass here, but we're not complaining, are we?
2281651	2283833	Because we're getting 4th Plus.
2283853	2284814	I am complaining.
2285074	2286215	I am very much complaining.
2286255	2289098	Are we going to complain when they get 4th Plus, though, to replace USA?
2289178	2291140	USA will be gone, replaced with 4th Plus.
2291200	2291760	Isn't that wonderful?
2292401	2293582	Oh, somewhat, yes.
2293922	2294162	Yes.
2295203	2296845	You can play Konga, feel into your heart's content.
2296865	2299087	As far as I know, everything on USA is going to be on there.
2299107	2300208	This is my outlook on this.
2300528	2302630	Because USA is where the newbies go to play, right?
2302990	2304512	So they take USA, we got Max 2.
2305172	2308495	But we got 4th Plus, we're going to want to play Max 2 and 4th Plus.
2308515	2309356	Where are the newbies going to go?
2309456	2312259	Yeah, they're going to fail 4th Plus immediately and you get to play up next.
2312339	2314040	They're going to go to hell, that's where they're going to go.
2314061	2316122	No, they're going to go play Spider Stomp.
2317023	2318844	We'll just send them to play Spider Stomp.
2319504	2321765	No, but see, here's the other thing.
2321805	2331709	The people at Sunsplash are also very stupid in making it so you can't fail on your first song if it's on, you know, little, or not little, rather, you know, standard, the first note.
2331729	2332629	Yeah, standard, basic.
2332769	2339311	It's stupid, and so that's still one song where you have to wait and stuff, and watching them hurts, I swear.
2339892	2342573	It hurts to see them suck so bad, because...
2343954	2345736	I mean, some of them have the basic idea.
2345776	2347278	But we all started off somewhere.
2347298	2353225	Yeah, but we all... I'm going to say, I'm hoping that we all started off higher than some of the people that play here.
2353866	2356069	You know, just jumping around on the freaking pad.
2356490	2361336	I know none of us would be where we are today if we started there, because we would have given up long ago.
2361656	2363777	Well, no mercy with Ted, I guess.
2364238	2365258	I started off at home.
2365359	2367380	Do you think that's something the announcer should start saying?
2367420	2369361	Like, oh, my eyes are bleeding.
2371062	2372644	Your dance is like burning.
2373404	2375525	Your dance makes Captain Jack cry.
2375946	2379348	We have more intros to do, more people to show up.
2379368	2381950	Give us your name and your nickname and a little bit of your history.
2383995	2385196	Any history you want to give.
2385216	2386238	It doesn't have to be DDR.
2386278	2389461	If you want to give the black book history or your job history.
2390062	2391344	Surgical, medical history, whatever.
2392694	2393394	My name is Eric.
2393454	2394155	I'm Punk Knight.
2395355	2396736	I don't have a history.
2396916	2398617	I just kind of appeared here, you know.
2399458	2400378	Here, I'll do his history.
2400758	2404300	He's the leader of a... A cult?
2404700	2405501	No, not a cult.
2406241	2412084	Basically, not really a terrorist group, but let's just say they get jobs done.
2412525	2416867	Called the Triple F ETA, Former Fast Food Employees Turned Assassins.
2417727	2418188	And, um...
2419228	2429476	See, other than that, he does his own music, he's totally into punk rock and that kind of stuff, and metal, and that kind of cool shit.
2429997	2431338	Dude, you know me better than I do.
2432058	2432839	Okay, here, somebody else.
2432859	2435641	I need to make an announcement, Rob gave me a quarter, so I'm getting candy.
2437283	2439825	Speak, speak, I demand you.
2440525	2442847	If I give you two quarters, will you get me some candy too?
2443828	2444528	Oh, we have a shy one?
2447456	2448197	I'll speak for them.
2448537	2451598	Hi, I'm Melanie.
2452319	2454740	I used to go on the boards by Carefree Mel.
2455240	2457161	I'm very quiet, so I'm not going to say much.
2457602	2457962	That's it.
2459203	2460643	That voice sounds so familiar.
2461544	2463045	Wow, Mel, you sound really hot.
2463065	2464525	Oh, thank you.
2464726	2465886	This is radio, you know.
2466867	2467227	I know.
2468207	2469048	Isn't it cool?
2471249	2472930	Now, Mel, you're dating Punk Night, right?
2473710	2474751	He's so dreamy.
2479457	2481598	What is it that you like about Bunk Nye?
2481618	2482879	What is it that attracts you to him?
2483940	2484861	It's his one eye!
2494407	2495428	And your response to that?
2497569	2498169	It hurts.
2498910	2503153	Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, he's also into Invader Zim, because Invader Zim rocks.
2503473	2504834	Okay, that's it.
2505970	2506771	Yes.
2507011	2507371	Jonan.
2507431	2508172	Jonan altogether.
2508332	2509292	Not just Invader Zim.
2510133	2511074	Jonan Vasquez is a god.
2511474	2514817	Jonan Vasquez is the godliest god of all gods.
2516258	2528787	Alright, well, we're going to take a quick break here and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio episode 10 and a half semi-live from Roseville Golf Land here on Wednesday night.
2529007	2531028	We're taping a little early so we can have the weekend off.
2531048	2531309	Add candy.
2531329	2531649	Add candy.
2532569	2532850	Yummy.
2533470	2536252	We'll be right back after some songs.
2536512	2541455	If you want to join our chat room, the people who might be listening right now, join our chat room.
2541475	2549679	Just go to any other side IRC server, like irc.eggheads.org, and you're going to join Channel Pound's Orange Lounge.
2549700	2554322	I almost said Sakmamani, but you might find some of us in there, but actually the channel is Orange Lounge.
2554642	2555403	We'll be right back.
2608511	2609314	Thanks for watching!

2825372	2826314	Thanks for watching!
2866063	2870067	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
2922425	2926809	For the steps by the Orange Labs, this DDR sucks!
2926869	2929170	Holla Holla Holla Holla Holla Holla
2952080	2957924	Alright, we're back and we're coming back from break and Jamie is going to attempt 3-2-1 stars.
2957964	2959946	So this is 3-2-1 stars, the Jamie mix.
2967771	2968832	She had a 9 combo.
2971974	2972075	Oh, 11.
2972535	2973335	She got double digits.
2977939	2980741	She just lost about 70% of her bar in like 3 seconds.
2999031	2999592	There she goes.
2999712	3000572	Oh, not too bad.
3009020	3011022	You're not doing as bad as she said you were going to do, Jamie.
3014305	3015366	Uh-oh, she got danger.
3015386	3015806	Uh-oh.
3015966	3016467	Come on, Jamie.
3016507	3016967	Go, Jamie, go.
3021471	3023213	Oh, failed.
3024981	3025402	Sucks.
3025603	3030773	Anyway, we are back, and we're on the lower level now, where all the games are.
3030813	3032997	Can you start the clock for me, by the way?
3033257	3033979	Thank you, that's alright.
3035061	3036303	Hey, that's not bad for suck.
3037466	3038966	So we're walking around the bottom level.
3038986	3043007	Do we want to walk around and look at the various stuff that Golfland has here?
3043027	3044868	We can do that once I'm done putting my initials in.
3044948	3046088	Jamie's going to put her initials back in.
3046328	3048608	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3048648	3053069	This is a special edition because we decided to take Labor Day weekend off.
3053169	3055070	So we thought we'd tape the show a little early.
3055490	3056810	So it's actually Wednesday night.
3056850	3057730	We're at Golfland.
3058110	3059230	But we are taping live.
3059310	3060071	No do-overs.
3060591	3062111	It's just like it was a live show.
3062371	3063611	Except we have lots of toys here.
3064051	3066352	And Brad likes toys, right?
3067527	3068627	Mmm, toys.
3070008	3070688	So what do we want to do?
3070708	3072009	We want to walk around and give a little tour of Delphi?
3072029	3073269	I don't want to do anybody publicly.
3075410	3076730	I'm holding a bench of stuff.
3076770	3077751	Who wants to hold my wood?
3079371	3080692	Thank you for volunteering for that, Ted.
3080892	3081572	We just got a funny... Hi.
3081992	3084893	What are you guys exactly recording for?
3084933	3085954	Oh, we're doing a school project.
3085974	3087474	Okay.
3088435	3088695	Yeah.
3088795	3089635	For Oakmont High.
3093809	3095130	No, we're doing an online radio program.
3096190	3097310	We have an internet radio show.
3097330	3098731	Would you like to say some words for our listeners?
3100271	3108054	Actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys can go walking around recording stuff.
3108094	3109074	We're just recording ourselves.
3109414	3113696	Yeah, I mean, we actually do a show online that promotes the line of the music games.
3114136	3115496	And we advertise this place for free.
3115656	3120118	Yeah, so... And then the shit hits the fan.
3121454	3124895	Well, we could go outside, I guess, if you'd rather not us taping here.
3126295	3126895	I'm not sure.
3127055	3128756	You've got to talk to the manager.
3128936	3129196	Okay.
3130236	3130516	All right.
3131376	3132316	We're going to talk to the manager.
3132596	3133417	We might possibly.
3133437	3134237	We hate Golf Land.
3134377	3138458	We might possibly get kicked out of the show, have to end the show early because of this.
3138518	3140258	We'll have to see what's going to happen here.
3140958	3141938	We can fill up with music.
3142058	3143419	Yeah, we can fill up something.
3144059	3146659	I will play more Beatmania for your listening pleasure.
3146679	3147259	We can figure something out.
3147279	3148480	We'll listen to the Brad mix.
3148960	3149560	No.
3149620	3149720	No.
3156003	3160727	We might have to go to Folsom Game Room or someplace that would let us do a show there.
3160767	3161148	I don't know.
3161548	3161948	We'll see.
3165851	3171816	And he's going through the list and stopping on something tack.
3171836	3172797	You know what would really suck?
3172837	3173778	What if they took the tape?
3175799	3177641	Then that would make them buy us a new one.
3180327	3182367	So we're eagerly awaiting what's going to happen here.
3183468	3184728	Actually, this is somewhat funny.
3184908	3185608	We could run away.
3185628	3192530	I'm sorry, what were you saying?
3192710	3194090	I said, where's the fun in that, though?
3194250	3195290	Yeah, I know, where's the fun in that?
3195330	3196131	So we'll see what happens.
3196711	3202192	Because if they did throw us out for trying to do our show, I doubt we'd come here very much in the future.
3202792	3206773	So we'll see what's going to happen when Mr. Manager comes back.
3210640	3215411	So I don't know if there's anything interesting new or going on in the Mamani world right now, news-wise.
3215612	3217215	We haven't had Matt's sim update.
3217997	3219420	Oh yeah, I bet Matt has a Matt's sim update.
3219440	3220162	We should get him over here.
3221306	3223468	And we're being stared at by an employee.
3223548	3224128	Yep, are we?
3225209	3226070	Oh, is he waving?
3226210	3227591	Yeah, he waved and he walked off.
3227831	3229592	Alright, so we got the go ahead.
3229612	3230493	Let's go interview him.
3230993	3231333	Oh yeah?
3231614	3231934	What's that?
3232614	3234456	That manager looks like he's 16 years old.
3234956	3236577	I don't think that's the manager.
3236597	3242301	If the manager's some like 500 pound like sumo wrestler, I'm getting out of here.
3242341	3243662	I'm sorry, I gotta go.
3243802	3245283	Oh well, she's coming back.
3245323	3247265	I don't know if she's going to give us an update or what's going on.
3249409	3250210	Who was the manager?
3250410	3251592	Oh, we're going to see what's happening.
3251612	3252553	Let's step away from the machine.
3253875	3254756	Let's see what's going on.
3254776	3257860	Oh, okay.
3257900	3259281	Oh, we thought that guy was the manager.
3261544	3263026	That would be the day.
3263967	3265609	Can we get that on tape?
3267251	3268293	So you enjoy working at Golf Land?
3270656	3272977	She can't comment on tape or else she'd get into trouble.
3273218	3274818	But I'm sure she'd say nothing but good things.
3275258	3276619	Yes, Gothland is winner.
3276819	3279060	Except maybe the little kids who destroy things around here.
3279100	3279800	Who knows about that?
3280161	3280421	Yeah.
3280821	3282962	Is that a go for the taping or not?
3283102	3285223	No, we don't know because the manager's got to come downstairs.
3285303	3289325	I don't think he's going to decline you guys from taping.
3289345	3289605	Really?
3289885	3293506	Even though a lot of people film home videos and stuff here?
3295727	3296848	Same difference, only audio.
3297388	3297888	All right, all right.
3297908	3298489	She's not going to talk.
3298509	3299069	She's not going to talk.
3299089	3299209	Mm-hmm.
3300618	3301398	We'll see what happens.
3303419	3304059	This is interesting.
3304079	3305439	We weren't expecting this development.
3306039	3308519	Well, maybe we should take another quick break then.
3308579	3309360	Do we want to take a quick break?
3309380	3311640	Well, no, because I kind of want to get this on air, whatever happens.
3312100	3312620	So we'll see.
3313520	3314620	What, are we leaving?
3314661	3315521	No, we're going to see what happens.
3315541	3316441	The manager's coming down.
3319141	3319541	Or something.
3320442	3320642	True.
3320662	3323082	Yeah, we can finish up the show somewhere else.
3323102	3323722	We'll see what happens.
3326003	3327063	You're back here by freaking 10.
3328203	3328563	10 o'clock.
3329995	3334596	I think they're closing at 10 now, so... We have more of the Brad mix going on on Beatmania.
3336157	3337777	Do you want to go listen to Brad play on Beatmania?
3338177	3338637	Um, no.
3338737	3339138	What is he playing?
3339158	3339998	Because it's hurting my ears.
3340018	3340878	I don't even know that song.
3341958	3342559	It's Crimson.
3343559	3347700	Why are they allowed to tape us and use us for their commercials, but we're not allowed to tape them?
3349620	3351141	Maybe... I don't know.
3351901	3352261	I don't know.
3353982	3355022	Good answer.
3357193	3359114	They probably think we're profiting off of this.
3359714	3361555	No, we pay to do our show.
3362195	3367337	We pay out of pocket.
3367377	3368058	This is the guy.
3369038	3369818	We'll see what happens.
3370859	3371239	We think.
3375370	3376290	We don't know what's going to happen.
3376570	3378371	We're recording an internet radio show.
3379091	3379652	Just our group.
3379692	3388495	We run an internet radio show every Sunday night and we're basically taking the Sunday off so we decided to do a live show at our favorite Wednesday hangout because we come every Wednesday.
3389255	3392236	And we didn't think that there would be an issue with it.
3392276	3393236	If there is, we're sorry.
3395822	3397503	Right now, I'll go ahead and do it.
3397983	3400384	I thought you had a filming crew here.
3400745	3400965	No.
3401065	3403486	But usually we don't have a problem with it.
3403526	3405087	We just like to book in advance.
3405687	3410109	And so we can know what the interview's about and that kind of a thing.
3410870	3412951	Oh, we're just a bunch of dumb kids and we're not doing anything special.
3412971	3413931	This is spontaneous, really.
3414011	3417993	And also, I recognize your kids, you know, in the group.
3418013	3419794	So that's always a big plus.
3420354	3423296	So we want to promote, you know, a good hangout environment.
3423796	3424597	Well, cool.
3424617	3425718	You want to give a plug to Golfland?
3425738	3426898	Any specials going on right now?
3427699	3428960	Any specials going on right now?
3429000	3431942	We always have specials you can call in advance to find out what they are.
3432262	3434403	Family night special or laser tag specials.
3435064	3435984	Don't forget Arcade Mania.
3436425	3438706	Arcade Mania, yeah, Saturday mornings.
3439587	3440587	On this Saturday, by the way?
3441828	3442709	I'm not sure.
3442729	3444490	They canceled it last Saturday, didn't they?
3444630	3448753	This past Saturday, wasn't it something having to do with a private party?
3450189	3452670	Thanks for letting us do our crappy show.
3452710	3453190	We appreciate it.
3475333	3476474	Well, a near crisis.
3478015	3478896	You're just doing your job.
3480217	3481998	There's a promotion for you in the future, honey.
3484940	3486381	A near crisis averted.
3487021	3488562	I guess we ought to get out of people's way now.
3488582	3489703	Are we going to take this back upstairs?
3489923	3491424	Let's get back upstairs and get out of the way.
3491444	3492605	All right, let's get out of people's way.
3492665	3495867	So we're going back upstairs, so if any of the guests want to come back upstairs as well.
3496608	3497729	You want to fail GM's quiz?
3498429	3498750	Okay.
3499350	3500431	Wow, that was a great radio moment.
3500451	3500791	Are you my daddy?
3500811	3501471	Are you my daddy?
3502712	3507095	Apparently I'm one of your kids, Rob, as the manager pointed out.
3507215	3515341	Now, this is kind of interesting because we didn't think anything like that would happen, but I guess a true Orange Lounge spontaneous moment there.
3515701	3521305	Now, as I said, we were not going to stop tape tonight, no matter what happens, unless that guy came down the stairs yelling and screaming, Stop the tape!
3521545	3522086	Stop the tape!
3522106	3524587	Even if he kicked me in my ass, would you keep rolling?
3524627	3527389	Like, yeah, scream harder, Irene, come on, get some realism.
3527409	3528270	Possibly, quite possibly.
3528470	3528750	Yeah.
3529031	3534057	So it sounds like they like to know about these kind of things in advance because, well, they want to do their own little promotions with it.
3534097	3534458	I don't know.
3534678	3538784	We should call five minutes ahead and say, hey, we're going to come, you know, record and stuff.
3538804	3539284	So, yeah.
3542357	3543278	That's going on the best of.
3543338	3544459	I hope we picked up his audio.
3544499	3546960	I'm kind of afraid that we didn't get the Golfland employees' audio.
3547001	3548622	That might have come out kind of crappy for the listeners.
3549162	3549582	Yeah.
3549622	3551864	It's an experimental show tonight, as I promised.
3551944	3554586	It would be... You know what we could do?
3554926	3558549	We can just dub over voices if we didn't pick it up.
3558809	3562772	Maybe what we could do is come back and do that segment in a later show, like in a best of.
3562792	3564814	We'll do with voice dubbings by Irene.
3565154	3566875	No, you should put in stuff from Rejected.
3567135	3568737	I'm feeling fat and sassy.
3569577	3570938	You know what I'm kind of worried about, though?
3570958	3573140	What if this guy actually tunes in and listens, though?
3573180	3574221	Because what do we do?
3574261	3579726	We sit around and we say, Gothland never updates their machines, and they're all dirty, and things like that, and now, uh-oh.
3580366	3583309	Well, we come here and give our money anyway, so what the hell does he care?
3583329	3587132	We're a bunch of fat hypocrites because we bash Gothland, but we're here anyway.
3587152	3588333	Well, that's the thing.
3588353	3590996	We have the right to complain even if we do pay our money, goddammit.
3591736	3592737	Oh, they're all coming back.
3592897	3595439	Oh, Jamie's doing some PR work here.
3595819	3596540	Oh, boy.
3596640	3597440	Talking to the manager.
3597600	3598181	Yay.
3599181	3601563	Oh, she's trying to sell the tournament right now.
3601923	3602324	Oh, boy.
3602404	3602724	Hey.
3602784	3603104	Right on.
3603124	3603765	Yeah.
3603785	3605206	So, Jamie, is Jamie going?
3605894	3606194	All right.
3606214	3607175	Jamie's going bye-bye.
3607396	3609277	Irene will fill in as co-host while you're gone.
3609477	3609698	Yeah.
3609818	3612360	Well, hey, Jamie's going to go work things out.
3612380	3614822	Some promising news, maybe.
3614842	3616784	This guy is really awesome.
3616824	3617845	He's done so much stuff.
3617885	3619146	He turned up the Peripera machine.
3619366	3621408	Actually, I do recognize this guy.
3621528	3622149	I'll say it here.
3622509	3623330	This employee here.
3623730	3624731	Should I just say his name over the air?
3625071	3625251	Sure.
3625351	3625492	Sure.
3625512	3626292	We're saying good things about him.
3626312	3626513	Dwayne.
3627233	3628394	Very good employee here.
3628454	3632637	He's the one employee we've run into that will fix games when we ask them to be fixed.
3633297	3635379	As soon as they are broken, he fixes them.
3635759	3637000	Like, Pera Pera was turned down.
3637020	3639062	There's a game called Sumo next to it.
3639462	3646327	It was about five times as loud as the Pera Pera machine, so my thing was to go and turn off the Sumo machine, but now Pera Pera, you can hear it from upstairs.
3646427	3648168	It's insanely loud, and I love it.
3648909	3651330	And this guy has made all kinds of stuff happen.
3651350	3654793	He's letting us do this thing here, and it sucks, though.
3654973	3656154	He's leaving pretty soon.
3656394	3656914	Oh no!
3656954	3657535	Where's he going?
3658275	3658636	I don't know.
3659416	3671444	He's not going to be working here for too much longer, so what he's trying to do is get Jamie's name and number, possibly even the URL for the boards, into the right hand so that these tournaments will continue to happen on a regular basis.
3672225	3673005	Right on.
3673866	3675367	Oh, you made a spotting!
3675827	3676147	What?
3677168	3678850	How could I not recognize the mullet?
3678970	3680551	I had a feeling.
3681472	3685135	I was going to ask him, but I was like, I don't know, he might think I'm weird.
3685215	3688057	Did you hear that whole little crisis that was going on downstairs?
3688437	3688998	We were trying to do...
3689969	3690950	A group of people out there.
3690970	3691531	What was going on?
3691832	3701044	We were trying to do our little online schtick program that we do here, and we almost got stopped, but thanks to the nice employee, the Bomani appreciating employee, we lucked out tonight.
3701084	3703327	Good thing we didn't have one of the bad managers here.
3703647	3704268	It was great.
3704608	3706972	Yes, and Tal's doing all the introductions here.
3708328	3711509	We're meeting somebody new from the board for the first time, so this is exciting.
3711529	3715831	Yeah, hello.
3715871	3717312	Dark Tetsuya is his name on the board.
3717972	3718213	Yes.
3720193	3723215	Oh, you know Loki.
3723235	3723875	This is Loki.
3724215	3725456	And Linky style.
3725896	3727397	Wow, they were just introducing people.
3727557	3728177	This is odd.
3728237	3729718	I lost the co-host.
3730158	3731098	This is kind of weird, though.
3731259	3732799	No, this might be a good thing.
3732819	3734540	They went to the office and locked the door.
3734560	3736461	No, I don't know if they locked the door.
3737699	3740622	Jamie went off with Mr. Golfland Guy, and I haven't seen her yet.
3740643	3741884	Maybe they're getting a 4-plus for us.
3741904	3742845	We better not tell Dan.
3742885	3745148	I hope she didn't have to put out to keep the show going.
3745949	3746409	Oh, my God.
3746429	3747310	She's going to kill you.
3747410	3747691	I know.
3747711	3748532	She's going to kill me.
3749313	3749773	I'm kidding.
3749953	3750714	I'm kidding.
3750935	3752416	That was Brad making the noises.
3753057	3755139	Address those cards and letters to Lanky style.
3756201	3758903	We almost got kicked out of Golf Land for filming here.
3758923	3760064	Well, not filming, taping.
3760084	3760504	I call it filming.
3772435	3773855	We had an idea, Loki.
3774176	3780397	If we weren't going to pick up the audio from the employees here, we were going to dub it over with rejected lines.
3780477	3781318	We should anyway.
3782438	3784198	That's all up to Rob.
3784458	3784959	You know what, though?
3784979	3788860	That's too much work to do that kind of dubbing with the time I have to put this show on by Sunday.
3790000	3790921	I'll voiceover it.
3791141	3792202	I'll just voiceover it then.
3792402	3794744	Alright, well, I'm leaving pretty soon tomorrow.
3794764	3796025	I'm probably going to get all this done tonight.
3796065	3796446	We'll see.
3796886	3797407	I'm Bran.
3797487	3799008	I'm the biggest idiot ever.
3799368	3799608	I know.
3800269	3800769	Fuck you.
3801310	3801750	Ow.
3802171	3803091	My tooth.
3803992	3804473	Let's talk.
3805434	3806895	Do you have any sim news for us?
3806955	3807275	I don't know.
3807415	3811559	Dude, have you seen Loki's most ridiculously retarded edit for Max 300?
3811639	3811839	No.
3812360	3815442	After the freeze, the thing comes up with 50 fucking billion arrows.
3815803	3816083	Okay.
3816623	3818605	There's no way to do that ever!
3818765	3820187	First off, I didn't make the edit.
3820227	3821568	This guy Gatton made the edit.
3821728	3825592	Gatton actually was one of the ones that was in the databank on 5th Mix.
3826052	3830437	About 90% of the Naoki edits that Naoki picked are all done by him.
3830577	3834721	He's the same guy that made that edit, Swingman, that I love, that's so awesome.
3834761	3837243	Yeah, but dude, this Max edit is fucking off the hook.
3838104	3838825	It's insane.
3838845	3840266	This guy should write steps for DDR.
3840306	3843568	I mean, if he made steps for iFeel and all that shit, it'd actually be fun.
3843848	3844589	Anyway, sim news.
3845729	3847230	I got some good news, actually.
3847271	3850373	Team Guilo and the Melting Potter are coming back up October 1st.
3850413	3851533	They're redesigning the site.
3852314	3857278	What happened was they were switching servers or something, and when they did that, someone bought the domain name.
3858138	3858478	For who?
3858718	3863680	So someone bought TeamGuilo.com's name and so now they had to change it or something.
3863720	3864800	But they're actually still up.
3865020	3868642	You just have to type in their IP address in order to find it.
3869162	3873443	So they're still up and they said they're going to be done with the site and everything October 1st.
3874203	3874844	As far as...
3876264	3879206	Other sim news, really no new versions of anything.
3880786	3885269	Tourney Mix, I guess it's still going because their media section is down on DDR East Coast Invasion.
3886109	3889771	And yeah, I won't be entering this time because I'm busy with everything else.
3890131	3894554	I swear to God, I never have enough free time to actually sit down and make a decent step file.
3894954	3896455	Or I don't have the patience or just don't care.
3897635	3898055	One of those.
3898356	3900377	And also DDR PC, still no new characters.
3901297	3905338	That was interesting because we thought they were going to be doing them every Friday.
3905378	3909339	They released What's His Name and What's Her Face on the first week.
3909819	3911820	And then what, Valencia and Guy were the second?
3912100	3912360	Yes.
3913180	3914661	And then there were no third ones.
3915101	3918742	No, nothing.
3919482	3926144	I'm still kind of in shock over this interesting turn the show's taken where Jamie's gone into the office to talk about God knows what with the manager.
3927031	3928554	You know, I'm kind of getting worried.
3928995	3930698	Do you think we need to send a rescue mission?
3930839	3933384	No, you know, actually this might be good because they're talking for a long time.
3933404	3935107	Yeah, maybe they're talking about a tournament.
3935127	3935888	That could be good.
3935908	3936129	Yes, I know.
3937190	3938630	Actually, they are talking about the tournament.
3938731	3939071	Really?
3939291	3939531	Yes.
3940071	3942992	From when I was walking by him coming up here, I heard him talking about the tournament.
3943432	3944212	I heard the word tournament.
3944592	3945133	Interesting.
3945873	3946633	So we'll see what happens.
3947293	3950394	Did you hear the words... Stop it!
3950874	3953295	Jamie, you can hit Brad once you hear this.
3953355	3956136	Yeah, it's all Brad that's doing all of these funny noises.
3957036	3958157	My girlfriend's ratting me out.
3958177	3958597	How's that?
3960137	3960678	Hey, hey, hey.
3960698	3961478	Gosh.
3961518	3962498	You're going to get it later.
3962878	3963098	Yes.
3963338	3963819	Yes, Joe.
3964859	3965059	And if...
3965871	3968433	Man, if the what's-his-name bans us, I'm going to be pissed.
3970115	3972156	Imagine if we all get banned from Golfland for this.
3972316	3973337	Then they won't get any money.
3973698	3974098	Darn.
3974438	3974858	Shucks.
3974878	3977160	I'll just have to take my business elsewhere.
3977701	3981084	I'll be able to afford an apartment, move out, and actually get on with my life.
3981164	3985367	Maybe, you know, tune up my car and that kind of stuff.
3985387	3985868	That'd be cool.
3986528	3989352	This is like the addiction recovery thing.
3989372	3990734	They all ban us from Golf Land.
3991014	3994099	I'm going to cut you off.
3994359	3997603	Hey, there's plenty of other places to play DDR, okay?
3998745	3999005	Right?
3999446	3999906	Right, Ron?
3999967	4000387	I guess.
4000888	4001148	Sure.
4001449	4001809	Hello?
4002009	4002630	Is anybody there?
4005424	4006124	But see, that's the thing.
4006184	4008946	I don't really know if there would be a tournament here, seeing how anal they are.
4009566	4015068	I mean, every single encounter with Golfland employees has been anal, anal, anal.
4015328	4017429	Except for the nice manager who helps us out tonight.
4017529	4018110	Yes, he's very nice.
4018130	4018950	Except for him, okay?
4019090	4022252	He's pretty cool, but everyone else has been kind of anal and stupid.
4022412	4025453	Did you notice he looks kind of like an overweight Owen Wilson?
4027054	4027914	But he's very nice.
4028694	4030515	Yes, but he's got that face like Owen Wilson.
4030535	4033777	Do you think that Jamie might be telling him the date and time to listen to this very show?
4033797	4033837	No.
4035035	4035455	I hope not.
4035935	4037516	And I hope you're going to edit this out of the show.
4037536	4039917	Well, if that's the case, then all these comments have been made by Punk Night.
4039937	4041818	I didn't say anything wrong.
4043258	4044319	This is Punk Night talking.
4044399	4044759	Hey!
4045039	4045719	Hi, Mel!
4046079	4048640	Hi!
4048680	4050181	And this is now Loki talking.
4050721	4052862	Little kids are going to kick my ass.
4052942	4055423	Little kids love to kick my ass.
4055623	4058704	I get my ass kicked by little kids all the time.
4058744	4060665	They don't kick my ass, they just threaten to kick my ass.
4061696	4063697	I don't know why, I sound like I look like a little kid or something.
4063717	4064378	You know where we are?
4064398	4066339	We're in the upstairs part of Golf Land.
4066839	4070402	And we're surrounded, we're in the happy birthday section or the party section or whatever.
4070442	4074344	And there's all these drawings of dragons with really huge nostrils.
4075025	4075725	Like, what the hell?
4075745	4077246	Okay, what's up with that dragon right there?
4077306	4080188	I mean, he looks like there's a bulge coming out of his stomach.
4080248	4081589	They all look crazy.
4081629	4084911	They all look... He's having a very happy birthday.
4085591	4087653	It's a nostril-saurus or something.
4087693	4088914	God, it's like crazy.
4088934	4089474	Are you an impersonator?
4089754	4092215	That's one behind you with the shorts and burning cupcake.
4092835	4094096	Burning cupcake?
4094616	4096997	Look out, he's coming right for us!
4097877	4098757	That's burning heat, my friend.
4098777	4104819	See, now all those things that you would assume are like confetti, those are actually just spots he's seen because he's on acid.
4104859	4105760	I mean, look at his eyes.
4106320	4107881	Yeah, I kind of look like a telephone operator.
4108981	4111242	There's two conversations going on right now.
4111282	4112282	This show is in stereo.
4112322	4112582	Oh yeah?
4115171	4119952	Yeah, so I like Telephone Operator as I was continuing my conversation with Ted.
4119972	4120212	Yes.
4120493	4120713	Yes.
4121273	4121473	Yes.
4121673	4123954	So let's get interesting talk on.
4124134	4124574	I don't know.
4124614	4126014	Was that English or what?
4126474	4127235	I like ass.
4128535	4129555	Let's get our Bimani talk on.
4129575	4130395	That would be Brad again.
4130836	4131356	Ass is good.
4131676	4131996	Brad?
4133796	4134197	Bimani.
4135377	4137077	Bimani's neat and fun.
4137097	4139998	Yes, I think Bimani's super, but not laser knife.
4140018	4141079	You should have done this show drunk.
4141819	4142099	I know.
4143700	4151074	We should have gotten more people playing DDR, actually, and playing, you know, hip-hop mania and drum mania.
4151114	4152697	It's an audio thing.
4153879	4155042	Visual aids don't help.
4155806	4156787	Yes, but we could give reports.
4156807	4157567	Very good, Einstein.
4157587	4159088	We could undermine your intelligence and such.
4159108	4160269	Thank you, Ted.
4160849	4161189	What is it?
4161229	4163431	Your powers of observation are great.
4163931	4165172	I'm sorry, you have to read 8-bit theater.
4165252	4167013	Anyway, or maybe not.
4167553	4170595	Yeah, so anyway... It's probably too advanced for you.
4171356	4178200	So, let's start talking about... Yeah, you know, keyboard media is fixed and working, I noticed.
4178240	4179161	I went down there and played it.
4179201	4183223	Oh, the right side is... Yeah, the left side has this tendency to make new chords.
4183343	4183904	We need to tell...
4184784	4186586	Dwayne or whatever the hell his name is about it.
4187347	4188448	Dwayne the nice guy.
4188509	4189930	Dwayne the nice guy.
4190271	4190911	Dwayne the nice guy.
4190951	4191692	Dwayne the nice guy.
4191712	4192774	His name's Bob, okay.
4193154	4193575	It's Dwayne.
4193895	4194375	It's Bob.
4194636	4194916	Dwayne.
4195136	4195577	Bob.
4195597	4195837	Dwayne?
4196378	4197759	Damn it, it's Bob, okay.
4197780	4197900	Dwayne?
4199124	4199925	Bob, is it?
4200445	4201465	Bob.
4201705	4208789	You know, I hope we don't get sued for saying all these people on the radio, but we have no money and can't get blood out of turnips, so you'll never take me alive.
4208909	4210689	That was a cheesy saying.
4210810	4217332	You know, I come in and I saw that and I'm like, wow, it's on, it's working, and the keys are all intact.
4217432	4218093	Oh my god.
4218213	4220634	Keyboard mania is, I guess, okay.
4220874	4221815	Just wait one minute.
4221975	4225177	I mean, just wait one... Let me start over.
4225437	4226078	Just wait a second.
4226298	4228920	There'll be little kids pulling the keys off any minute now.
4229560	4230201	It's been working.
4230401	4230821	Oh, no.
4232222	4232943	Now... Oh, yeah?
4233443	4234864	For about a month, actually.
4235244	4235324	If...
4237146	4244597	I was just thinking, say if we ever got banned, how would they support themselves during the winter?
4244617	4246660	I mean, no one comes in here other than us.
4247061	4249905	Who would run this place?
4250125	4251888	How would they get the money to run this place?
4253311	4254552	I think something like that would happen.
4254612	4259615	We're their only source of income in the winter, except for maybe $3 off Pac-Man or something.
4260056	4262057	And that's like a week.
4262697	4267160	Okay, so what's going to happen is we get banned.
4267941	4272584	They're going to be going without us for about a couple of months and realize that they're in debt or something.
4272704	4274285	Well, let's just put it this way.
4274325	4282430	I mean, I spend unusual time coming here about $15 to $20 in tokens every time, which is why I don't like coming down here all the time
4283431	4285994	It's really hard on my account, yeah.
4286994	4287435	I'm poor.
4287895	4291379	But anyways, yeah, so if, you know, they just cut me off.
4291459	4291919	Shit, man.
4292319	4293280	Look at Qzar, man.
4293441	4297404	If I stop coming there, I'd like spend 15 grand there over four years.
4298185	4299146	Isn't that sad?
4299466	4304169	I have to say, though, I'm very dishonest when it comes to the ways I get my tokens.
4304349	4310233	I came here tonight, played a few games of DDR, maybe four, five, six of them, two of those being doubles.
4310393	4311253	I came with no money.
4311754	4313174	I'm a scrounger, as it were.
4313735	4318237	Okay, so they don't make any money off me, so banning me... How do you scrounge tokens, exactly?
4318297	4322260	You go around begging people, or you found them on the ground, or you hacked the machine, or what?
4322680	4325261	He asked me, you know, oh, some machine's broken tonight.
4325781	4326321	I don't tell him.
4326881	4330782	I tell him the ones that I want to play that are broken, not the ones that are broken that I get money out of.
4331382	4331522	Ah.
4331862	4332963	Sick.
4333003	4333843	Shame, shame.
4334163	4335663	I don't steal.
4336744	4337844	Oh, a donation.
4340085	4341985	Wait, wait, you're going to feed this?
4343245	4345646	Give the money to people who actually spend it.
4345706	4346286	I spend money.
4346666	4347367	Oh, wow, I see.
4350208	4351389	He stole his token.
4352330	4353131	Oh, gee.
4353591	4353851	Thanks.
4353871	4354272	There you go.
4354312	4356574	Wow, that's like giving to the Salvation Army.
4356594	4357374	That was incredible.
4357394	4357715	Thank you.
4357775	4358395	Ring, ring, ring.
4358435	4358956	Here's my bell.
4361198	4362138	Well, thanks for being on the show.
4362179	4364360	Any shout-outs you want to give here on our little program?
4365241	4366402	Well, it was good to meet everybody.
4366783	4367383	I do exist.
4367583	4368244	I am Vandalus.
4368884	4369205	Right on.
4369305	4369665	And I'm out.
4370546	4371367	Well, thanks for coming.
4371387	4371887	Nice seeing you.
4372447	4373148	Goodbye, Vandalus.
4373528	4373789	Later.
4375801	4377442	Yeah, the one person Anita's back.
4378022	4380363	Did you see anything that happened to us downstairs?
4382144	4383025	We got accosted by them.
4383125	4388088	No, the employee came up to us and said, I don't think you're supposed to be doing this show here.
4389008	4390389	I still don't believe that he exists.
4390429	4392090	I think it was just an elaborate hologram.
4392870	4393811	Okay, okay.
4395549	4401517	Anyway, as I was telling Anita, and finally the manager came out, but we got the cool manager tonight who likes the Bomani crowd and does things for us.
4401918	4406604	So, but Jamie's in his office right now, and we don't know what's going on.
4407545	4409088	She's been in there for quite a while.
4410505	4412366	There's been a recent plague of child reduction.
4413186	4414727	Jamie's not a child.
4415627	4418608	It's been in this community and stuff.
4419748	4423209	As we discovered on last week's Understation Live, she has the voice of a child.
4423790	4425530	But she's not a child.
4425590	4425930	Sorry, Jo.
4426030	4426911	That's scary.
4427611	4431292	So, we don't know what's going on, but we're just going to keep this show going.
4431332	4436294	We said it would be an experimental show, 10.5, and shit, boy.
4436314	4438875	This is train wreck radio live.
4439884	4441785	This show was brought to you by ass.
4441985	4442225	Here.
4443225	4444005	That's my ass.
4444845	4446026	God, I don't want to touch that microphone.
4446346	4446606	Ass.
4446986	4448806	Are you trying to... That's gross.
4449227	4450707	You're nasty on your ass.
4453368	4455588	And they're getting that rubbing noise on the air, by the way.
4458269	4460430	That's what it sounds like to be against my ass.
4460930	4461790	I hope you all enjoyed.
4461870	4463390	I don't ever want to go back there.
4464851	4466511	Don't blow into the microphone.
4466531	4467712	You know what's wrong with this show?
4467872	4468832	There's no donuts.
4469605	4470366	That's why!
4470446	4471567	None of us are hyper.
4471587	4474289	We could go downstairs and get overpriced cardboard pizza.
4474369	4474530	No.
4475490	4476151	I'm pretty hungry.
4476611	4476892	Maybe.
4477612	4479114	Not enough for cardboard pizza.
4479154	4482597	Sometimes though, if you go right before closing, you can get free cardboard pizza.
4482857	4483497	Wow!
4483818	4485179	It's like saying you get free shit.
4485699	4487541	God, I love free shit.
4487741	4491685	That's like when you're driving down the street and they have the big signs that say, you know, free dirt.
4492405	4492906	I know.
4493987	4494708	Free pie.
4494909	4496130	And the pie is also evil.
4496651	4497772	It's worse than cardboard pizza.
4497792	4498513	It's foam pizza.
4498533	4498813	Come on.
4499214	4500415	Fertilizer for sale.
4500836	4501517	Exactly.
4501637	4503499	Like, who gives a damn?
4504000	4504721	Yeah, exactly.
4507084	4508325	Oh, did we have a Jamie?
4508546	4509267	Oh, I see.
4510490	4511571	I thought we had a Jamie sighting.
4511691	4512252	Nope, not yet.
4512392	4513192	A Jamie sighting?
4513212	4514353	What is she, like an alien or something?
4514413	4514934	I don't know.
4515034	4516475	I'm starting to wonder what happened.
4517116	4517676	It's a Jamie.
4517696	4517936	Oh my gosh.
4517956	4520979	When we go into our next break, we won't come back from that break until Jamie's back.
4520999	4522120	Oh, somebody else is going into the office now.
4522260	4522400	Oh.
4522680	4523821	Oh my gosh.
4523861	4524482	A group thing.
4524862	4526103	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
4526784	4527684	Gosh, my gosh.
4527765	4528065	All right.
4528165	4528565	What is going on?
4528605	4530367	Take advantage of nobody being downstairs.
4530467	4531628	That's what I did earlier.
4531648	4531988	I was happy.
4532008	4532709	All right, take care.
4532729	4535291	Well, now we've got to keep this show going.
4535331	4536152	What to talk about now?
4537653	4541716	I could give one of our frequent listeners a call, because I said I would at some point tonight.
4541817	4542017	Okay.
4542157	4543318	Can you get it on the radio?
4543338	4544319	Yeah, we're going to do it on the radio.
4544579	4546861	But I don't know how well this is going to turn out, so we'll see.
4547041	4548663	And after that, we can play a game if you want.
4548963	4549303	We can.
4549383	4549683	Hold on.
4549744	4553487	I've got to find my phone, my super-duper phone unit.
4553907	4556029	Now, this is experimental radio, as I said.
4556129	4557390	I don't know how this is going to go.
4558251	4568016	But I did say at some point in the evening I would give one of our early listeners to the show, early supporter of the show Damn it, Brad, don't call me Hey, go on What?
4569096	4573878	Brad's calling me on my phone So, Rob, how you doing?
4573898	4574299	How you doing?
4574959	4577080	I'm good So how's the show going?
4577240	4582282	I heard you're doing a radio show Yes, and there's a delay on cell phones, did you know that?
4582382	4582963	Isn't that cool?
4583303	4585764	Maybe we can get some real funky echo thing out of this Yeah, let's do it
4591104	4594466	Talk into your cell phone, Rob.
4594586	4594986	Hello?
4595427	4595827	Hello?
4596928	4598549	That is so cool.
4598709	4602372	We're breaking people's speakers as we speak.
4602432	4603333	I said we'd call.
4603793	4605875	Yes, back to the track.
4605995	4608096	Let's see, we're going to give somebody a call here.
4608957	4610338	We're going to try calling...
4611380	4611880	I'm sorry, what?
4611900	4614301	She's got a backup topic if this doesn't work right away.
4614581	4616041	Okay, well, we're going to try making the phone call.
4616061	4617882	We'll go to the backup topic if we have to.
4618362	4623224	Now, I'm going to do my best to try to understand what the guy's saying, but I don't know how this is going to go.
4623364	4624764	He's dialing right now.
4625224	4627345	I'm going to get him on the phone first, so fill in for me.
4627625	4627905	Okay.
4628365	4630446	La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
4634496	4636457	I don't know, it's a cute bag, though.
4636997	4637518	I am here.
4637878	4638939	And my name is Chaos.
4639079	4640960	Rap is to me like music is to Amadeus.
4641180	4642841	Wolfgang, the famous composer.
4642901	4645422	It's telling me the number's not available.
4645943	4647183	Uh-oh.
4647303	4649485	Oh, well, that's experimental radio right there for you.
4649505	4650185	The number didn't work.
4650265	4650565	Damn it.
4650585	4651526	Okay, now what's on your mind?
4651546	4652026	All right, we'll go.
4652066	4653007	What's on your mind, Anita?
4653687	4654628	Well, I have a fuck you.
4655148	4655869	Oh, yes, okay.
4656329	4656929	Such language.
4656949	4658130	Fuck me or fuck... No, I'm just...
4659324	4662467	Well... I'd buy that for a dollar.
4662547	4663188	Yeah!
4663428	4664169	Fifty cents!
4665651	4668333	Oh, I got... Okay.
4668373	4672378	My fuck you of the week is... DVD region codes.
4674429	4677571	I don't know what you guys think about this, but I can't stand them.
4677631	4678812	I usually don't have a fucky.
4678872	4680613	I'm usually really mellow.
4681094	4682655	I really, usually things don't bother me.
4682695	4683916	She usually has a darn you.
4684456	4686798	I'm just kidding.
4687478	4688499	But for the past seven weeks.
4688519	4689820	Tell me, have you never been mellow?
4694623	4695684	Have you ever been lonely?
4696885	4699326	Have you ever tried?
4699346	4700067	Okay, okay, all right.
4702168	4703429	All right, anyway, I'm sorry to cut you off.
4703449	4711437	Okay, well, see, I don't understand region codes because I suppose they were invented to avoid piracy, correct?
4711677	4711857	Yes.
4712782	4713683	Well, they didn't do it.
4714143	4722969	Also, what they succeeded in doing is screwing over people like me who want to buy nice DVDs from other countries that don't have any English translations.
4723309	4731575	Well, you know, I have a Japanese PlayStation 2, so I can play DVDs with the Japanese region, and I bet if I hook things up right, I could do a dub.
4733036	4733777	You should give me a call.
4733797	4734197	We'll talk.
4736677	4737678	I'm sorry, copying.
4737718	4740139	Not like I'm going to actually talk and do the dub.
4740779	4744301	I'm going to put it in the VCR and hit record and dub that one.
4744341	4745441	I think you'd be a good dubber.
4747802	4750384	Life is a mystery.
4750444	4750804	Stop it!
4752965	4753625	If you don't get that joke.
4753645	4755106	We should start a dubbing company.
4755366	4756186	A dubbing company?
4756286	4757027	What would we call it?
4759168	4759848	The Dubbers?
4760428	4762509	Sacra Dubbers.
4762609	4763430	Sacra Dubbers.
4765697	4766537	Dubber Mentals.
4766717	4767938	Dubbers Incorporated.
4769498	4770658	Star Dubbers.
4771499	4772279	Yeah, Dubby Dub.
4772979	4773599	Rub-a-Dub.
4774619	4775360	Lame.
4775660	4775860	No.
4776280	4776900	Oh, that'd be good.
4777060	4778480	Rub-a-Dub.
4779881	4781241	Dub-a-Rub.
4781521	4781881	I don't know.
4782221	4785962	We should seriously all, you know, do dubbing for anime.
4786183	4786463	Yeah.
4786563	4789123	I would love to be an anime voice person thing.
4790104	4791244	Who would you want to do the voice for?
4792310	4794292	Akane, Tendo from Ranma.
4794873	4797075	Give us a sample of what your dub would sound like.
4798856	4800178	I don't know any of her lines.
4801559	4802920	I'm feeling fat and saucy.
4804021	4804462	You are?
4804482	4805623	I'm sorry, Ranma.
4805643	4807284	Say, would you like to go to a movie?
4807705	4808045	Ouch.
4808585	4808726	Ouch.
4808846	4809566	Yo!
4811068	4811468	I hate you.
4812849	4813770	I know what voice you'd like to do.
4814111	4816373	Who's the name of the main character from La Blue Girl?
4818299	4819480	That's their name?
4819660	4820160	It's La?
4820360	4821460	I thought it was LA?
4821620	4824962	Or I would do Ranma-chan, the girl side of Ranma.
4825282	4826122	I could do one from her.
4826942	4830124	I'm going back to China, so suck on that, old man.
4831284	4831664	Excellent.
4831744	4832865	Oh, thank you.
4833165	4834525	They're clapping in the background.
4834845	4835505	They love you.
4835866	4836806	They really love you.
4837066	4837286	Cowduken
4865745	4869648	Wait, that's... I'm gonna fry some Twinkies with this fireball here or something.
4869668	4870349	Like, what the hell?
4870429	4871089	I'm sorry.
4871329	4872650	From Texas, you know.
4872870	4874031	I'm over here in California.
4874171	4874572	Hire me.
4874952	4878295	Anyway, so any other, like, fuck yous of the week?
4879456	4879936	That's mine.
4879976	4880656	I'm done for now.
4881357	4881617	Oh, okay.
4881797	4884459	I can't... Where'd my fucking co-host go?
4884479	4885580	That's my question.
4885941	4886681	I guess we'll find out.
4886701	4890924	We will find out after the next break because we'll stop tape until we find out what happened to Jamie.
4891285	4892025	Yeah, I wanna know.
4892045	4892466	So stay tuned.
4892646	4893887	I mean, what are we paying her for anyway?
4893907	4895208	You're paying her?
4895848	4896468	Yeah, you didn't know?
4896528	4897309	We give favors.
4898009	4899249	I thought we had this discussion.
4899269	4900290	We're not getting paid.
4901170	4902290	You may not be, but she is.
4903751	4905611	She's like taking all of our money, you know.
4905651	4909533	She has these sponsors and she's getting all the money and not giving it to us.
4909673	4911613	Yeah, Jamie's a black hole and she takes all of our money.
4912113	4912474	There you go.
4913274	4914074	That was Brad.
4914094	4916435	Address those cards and letters to LankyStyle.
4916555	4917675	Care of... Anyway.
4918256	4919936	Care of what, Rob?
4919956	4921697	That's where I trail off and don't finish my thought.
4921717	4921897	Okay.
4923675	4926959	Let's talk about Bomani, since this is a Bomani show.
4926979	4928180	That's a good idea, yes.
4928520	4929882	So what about Bomani do you want to talk about?
4929902	4932645	I don't know, let's talk about, um, stuff.
4932745	4934166	Did you guys turn off the microphone on accident?
4934226	4934567	Okay, no.
4934667	4936809	I thought maybe the battery ran off for a minute or something.
4937330	4939832	Okay, that would be... We're okay, we're okay.
4939992	4942275	Oh shit, this thing's been on pause the whole time.
4942355	4942915	Darn.
4944083	4944764	No, no, no, no, no, no.
4945725	4946586	I'm not that stupid.
4947106	4949969	So about, like, if we do have a second tournament, let's talk about that.
4950709	4951450	So it would be SCAT 2?
4951770	4952291	No.
4952351	4955374	It would be STAB, Sacramento's Tournament and Bowling.
4955394	4956795	That was the idea.
4956855	4959758	If we did it at CCL, we'd do STAB, Sacramento's Tournament and Bowling.
4959798	4960578	I don't know what's going to happen.
4960818	4962160	Let's not give out all of our secrets.
4962180	4962360	Nope.
4964955	4966755	Oh, some stupid laser tag game thing.
4985220	4986381	L-A-N-K-Y.
4987101	4987601	K-Y.
4987841	4988842	Emphasis on the K-Y.
4989322	4995145	You know, I saw this license plate that said K-Y Lady.
4995785	4997886	Like, who wants to advertise that you're the K-Y Lady?
4997906	4999727	Oh, here's somebody who hasn't been on this show yet tonight.
5000167	5004749	Everybody say hello to Somnia Magus X, also known as Ryan.
5005149	5005589	Hello, Ryan.
5005869	5006370	What is this?
5006670	5007650	Like, live broadcast?
5007870	5009151	And Dan the Man's coming up, too.
5010871	5014133	Now this is going to be interesting because we're going to have to explain to Dan what happened to Jamie.
5014933	5016474	We don't know what happened to Jamie.
5018475	5021096	I don't know what happened to Jamie either.
5021236	5024958	We lost your fiance, Dan.
5024978	5025838	We lost Jamie.
5025878	5028759	Darren, come tell us the gossip on Jamie while she's not here.
5029320	5032041	She's in the office right now with the manager.
5032301	5033842	She's completely insane.
5035102	5035563	How so?
5036783	5037203	You know her.
5038871	5040272	That was Dan the Man, ladies and gentlemen.
5040292	5040732	This is true.
5041332	5042192	This is quite true.
5059491	5059892	Yeah.
5061113	5063496	Because that's the only school I know about.
5064297	5066440	Yeah, Rob's in gay charm school.
5067020	5070925	I'm the only one here that actually looks like I'm in high school because I am.
5071366	5072027	And what are we?
5072087	5073148	We're just your cousins?
5073969	5075531	Yes, you're all of my cousins.
5075551	5076372	That's what you are, Rob.
5078736	5079576	You're all my parents.
5079736	5080076	All of you.
5080517	5080837	All of you.
5081737	5082598	That's right, son.
5082618	5083878	Now wash my damn car.
5084999	5090282	So, long story short, manager came down, but it was the good manager, the nice manager that supports Mamani here at Golf Line.
5090302	5092683	The one employee that likes the Mamani players.
5092983	5094284	And now they're in the office right now.
5094364	5096185	We think they're talking about a tournament, possibly.
5096285	5096785	But we don't know.
5097305	5100487	Not to spread rumors prematurely, but yeah, it looks like we're going to have a tournament at Golf Line.
5100507	5104749	Not like we're on the radio and we're spreading rumors or anything like that.
5105089	5105269	Right.
5105289	5105549	That's okay.
5105569	5106429	No one listens to this show.
5106449	5106830	We're okay.
5106930	5107390	Oh, pa.
5108930	5109130	Yeah.
5109150	5112671	This show is on every Sunday night from 7 o'clock till 9 o'clock Pacific time.
5112711	5114572	You don't even know, you big putt.
5115232	5116432	Like, how do I listen to it?
5116673	5117293	How do you listen to it?
5117333	5120074	Well, this is kind of redundant for our listeners who are already listening.
5120314	5122134	But you're just going to go to our website.
5122174	5123114	They may not know the website.
5124795	5128416	If you look at my signature on Sack Bomani or DDR Freak, I'm Sky High.
5128436	5129156	Sky High?
5130397	5131077	Sky High.
5131357	5132537	No, kill me, please.
5132657	5134298	Not DJ Mako, please.
5136205	5143691	It's in my signature, but the website is orangelounge.sky.cx And that's the website.
5144612	5146093	Just like the old Sac of Imani.
5146173	5148515	Just like the old one, except it's orangelounge, not DDR.
5149036	5150497	Right, and no one commented on it.
5150677	5151398	And you know what?
5151618	5153559	Something maybe the listeners of this live show don't know.
5153860	5158463	When we're not on the air doing a live talk show, we've got Imani Music and More playing 24 hours a day.
5158563	5161486	Dance Mania tracks, 2DX, DDR.
5163064	5167732	You gotta give me a second of like an hour or two each day where I can just run to the next stop.
5167752	5169575	Do you want to say anything to our listeners?
5169595	5170437	You got an opportunity here.
5171890	5176192	Um, it's, yeah, as Irene jumps to unplug my mic.
5176532	5179573	Um, no, uh, I don't got to say that much.
5179613	5181793	I mean, the community doesn't know.
5181833	5184074	Remember, this is a nationwide show.
5184114	5184594	International.
5184614	5185675	We've got listeners in Japan.
5185975	5189376	I'd like to say hello to our listeners in Japan because I see there's people from Japan listening every week.
5189476	5189956	Yeah, I know.
5190176	5190716	That's really awesome.
5190756	5192977	I've seen a couple from Chile, apparently.
5193037	5193597	Yeah, Chile.
5194758	5198599	And just to remind everyone in Chile, your big gay representative is here today.
5200074	5200774	That's right.
5200895	5202516	Sky's up in the game.
5203836	5204297	Thank you.
5204397	5205197	Thank you very much.
5207258	5208179	No, I don't know any Japanese.
5208199	5208399	Jamie does.
5208419	5212281	I know a little bit, but it's like tourist Japanese and they'd probably get all pissed off and stuff.
5212582	5213362	Oh, Anita does.
5213422	5217985	Say something nice to our Japanese listeners.
5219386	5220726	Thank you for saying good evening.
5220787	5222207	She just told us to fuck off.
5222327	5222888	What's her problem?
5224764	5225544	Mexico is where it's at.
5251778	5253098	Mexicans kick ass.
5253458	5253918	Why is that?
5253938	5254799	Because they'll sell you liquor?
5254819	5255579	I'm Mexican.
5257639	5259640	I thought it was because of all the gas you got after you ate their food.
5261360	5261940	You know what?
5262600	5263361	Only if you eat it.
5264241	5266961	Only if you consider Taco Bell to be Mexican food.
5267101	5268442	If you want to get rid of the gas, drink the water.
5269942	5270222	What?
5270362	5271082	Okay, wait.
5272503	5273343	I tried that.
5273963	5274943	I tried that, Ted.
5275063	5276363	I don't think it worked for me.
5277524	5277824	Really?
5278524	5279004	That was a joke.
5280102	5280743	Play along, Ted.
5282444	5283805	Let's talk about Anita's tattoo.
5283825	5285226	Anita has a tattoo on her arm.
5285266	5286366	I never knew that.
5286467	5287607	She's a bad mama.
5287707	5288168	Oh, yeah.
5288888	5289829	That's a dragon, right?
5289969	5290529	Yes.
5290689	5291390	Okay, yeah.
5291810	5292911	That's awesome.
5292951	5295292	It's a three-toed dragon from Japan.
5295312	5296813	That's awesome, dude.
5296913	5298795	Actually, I got it in San Antonio, Texas.
5299835	5300776	It's balls or orange.
5300916	5301537	I mean ball.
5302217	5302617	Right.
5303938	5306440	And I've had it for, well, see...
5307959	5308259	11 years.
5308780	5309000	12 years.
5309240	5310480	Wow.
5311841	5312681	I'm sorry.
5312701	5313782	She's beep.
5313962	5315783	You never ask a lady her age.
5316343	5318584	Yeah, so don't ask Rob his age.
5324867	5326228	I can bleep it out if you want.
5326268	5328189	I'm trying to find a clever way to say how old I am.
5329369	5329890	Old enough.
5330090	5332171	Old enough to know better than to tell you.
5333206	5337492	The reflex is a... She's married, that's all you need to know.
5338713	5340295	It's more than you needed to know.
5340335	5341376	That was like a reflex.
5341477	5343459	I swear to God I did not want to ask you that.
5343780	5345402	The reflex is a...
5347145	5353811	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5369213	5370873	Oh, oh, she's coming out of the office now.
5371494	5372374	She's coming out.
5372514	5373574	She's drenched in sweat.
5373634	5374394	Where's the time at?
5374514	5375015	Where are we at?
5375415	5375995	Oh, you know what?
5376035	5376695	It's time for a break, Rob.
5376715	5377155	It's time for a break.
5377355	5380696	We're going to go to break, and when we come back from break... You're keeping us in suspense.
5380716	5384737	We're going to find out what happened with Jamie in the office.
5384797	5395060	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, semi-live here tonight at Roseville Golf Land, who is going to let us do the show here after all, as opposed to throwing our asses out on the street.
5395100	5395500	Thank you.
5396040	5396440	We'll be back.
5418932	5420076	I got metal to the metal
5459162	5460423	I'm gonna getcha!
5460443	5460983	It's great, man!
5498120	5504305	This recording is Volume 2 in a series of unintended decisions made before microphone and camera.
5584114	5584835	DarkSakura.com
5889299	5895107	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
5900598	5903879	All right, and we're back from that little break we took of music.
5903919	5904519	Hope you enjoyed it.
5905180	5907300	And Jamie is back.
5907320	5908201	Jamie has a headache.
5908241	5911582	Now, oh my gosh, what went on in there?
5912782	5915143	It was just being so enthusiastic.
5915863	5917024	Basically, we're a go.
5917284	5918264	We're going to have a tourney here.
5918704	5922926	That's what you're speculating out here, probably setting up some kind of tournament for Roseville Golf Line.
5922946	5923786	That's what we're working on.
5923866	5926687	I can't go into too much detail right now, but it's official.
5927167	5927567	Right on.
5928087	5928988	We're going to get this going.
5929708	5931889	Now you didn't have to do anything naughty to make that happen, right?
5932069	5932349	No.
5933610	5933830	No.
5933850	5934850	You know I had to ask.
5935310	5936951	Dude, my fiance's downstairs.
5937011	5937671	Yeah, I know.
5937712	5939412	He called you insane during the last break.
5939812	5941033	Don't you know it?
5942193	5942794	He lives with me.
5942814	5943014	He knows.
5943034	5944674	Do you have any retorts?
5944875	5947696	If I'm insane, Dan's like freaking retarded.
5947756	5948056	I don't know.
5948076	5952378	I think Brad and Irene are leaving now, so I'll use my little...
5953740	5956742	Yeah, so as soon as they close, we're going to end the show.
5957083	5959765	Golf Line's closing in a few minutes, so as soon as they close, we're going to end the show.
5960325	5963528	Do you guys have anything you want to say?
5964028	5965189	Goodbyes or anything like that?
5968072	5968772	Sayonara.
5970854	5975458	This has been quite the interesting show tonight, fellas, ladies, gentlemen.
5977136	5979939	I'm sure we can, you're just going to go home and put this on?
5980539	5982341	It's going to be on Sunday like every other show.
5982541	5982821	Okay.
5983002	5983222	Yeah.
5983422	5983602	Good.
5984143	5987666	We don't have time to edit some funny little things in there, like a little dubbing over?
5987726	5990408	Not really because I'm leaving, I'm skipping town tomorrow, so.
5990608	5990869	Oh, okay.
5990909	5991089	Yeah.
5991950	5992470	Lucky you.
5992670	5993231	Yeah, lucky me.
5993831	5994211	All right.
5994692	5996634	Have fun at work while I'm off, you know, in a bit.
5996654	5997034	Hey, fuck you.
5997194	5998255	That's my fuck you.
5999476	6002158	You go and have your fun five-day vacation.
6003570	6003790	Four.
6003930	6004291	Four days.
6005071	6005412	Monday's off.
6005432	6006412	Well, if you count Thursday night.
6007153	6007353	Oh, okay.
6007373	6008034	I'm only off Friday.
6008134	6009074	Oh, I didn't know you were not going to work.
6009095	6010496	You know, the listeners really want to know this crap.
6010516	6013458	No, no, the listeners, this is a little break from the Monotony Mountain.
6013478	6013798	That's true.
6013838	6014919	It's an experimental show tonight.
6014939	6018722	After what Jamie is going to tell us, they're not going to be able to contain themselves.
6019843	6020444	I'm moist.
6021044	6022265	I was moist.
6022846	6023626	I have to go clean up.
6024167	6025508	Okay, Jamie, here you go.
6028030	6028991	Irene's looking for me.
6029091	6030452	Are you getting ready to go, Irene?
6030472	6031412	Do you want to say any goodbyes?
6033598	6034078	Bye!
6034098	6035719	I'm going to miss everyone.
6036419	6036900	Yeah, okay, bye.
6037380	6039321	You're going to miss everyone with everything you throw?
6039381	6040121	Is your aim improving?
6042542	6042843	Yes.
6044163	6045244	Irene's aim is improving.
6045564	6046624	You heard it here first.
6047705	6048745	Anita, are you taking off too?
6049586	6052087	Any last shoutouts you want to give or anything you want to say?
6053008	6053828	Well, bye everybody.
6053848	6055289	It's been really fun doing the show.
6055709	6057850	And, um, but Monty all the way.
6058890	6059231	Loot.
6059331	6059731	Rock on.
6061087	6063168	Didn't you want to give a shout out to your friends?
6064629	6065710	This new shirt you're wearing here.
6066030	6070833	In honor of my Step Squad family, I need to go ahead and let you guys know I am wearing my shirt tonight.
6070853	6073395	Too bad it's not TV.
6073915	6076717	Iguana Girl and I both had a Heineken in your honor on the plane.
6077357	6080039	Of course, we were too broke on the way back to have one other one.
6080539	6083641	But we had one for our Step Squad homies.
6083881	6084481	So, yo.
6085242	6085582	Right on.
6085762	6086102	Holla.
6089102	6094285	I guess in reference to the promo that Step Squad did at Mt.
6094305	6094745	Mike's Journey.
6095646	6097367	So how are you liking this Wednesday night taping?
6097407	6098208	Ted loves it.
6098248	6100309	He wants us to do this more regularly, more often.
6100329	6102310	As long as we let him know in advance, I guess.
6103351	6104892	Who do we have to let know now?
6104932	6106152	Well, now that you have an in.
6107093	6107753	You have an in.
6109414	6111015	I guess we'll just let him know.
6111035	6112036	This is a burning question.
6112116	6114297	Loki says his name is Bob.
6114637	6114958	Dwayne.
6115258	6115598	Dwayne.
6116318	6116959	Loki's wrong.
6118474	6120355	Loki was just being an ass.
6122075	6122736	But I'm right.
6123836	6124816	Moral of the story, you're right.
6125136	6126497	Yes, exactly, as always.
6126557	6127017	I'm hungry.
6127337	6133639	Well, I suppose this is an idea we can continue to do in the future if, you know, we want to take another week off or whatever, because that happens sometimes.
6134039	6134900	Weeks off are nice.
6135020	6135780	Yep, weeks off rule.
6135800	6138961	I get to, like, sleep, go to bed early one night, I guess, or something.
6138981	6139101	Yep.
6140518	6148934	Maybe I can convince Dan to have a barbecue and I guess I can have, you know, barbecue tofu or something since I'm having, you know, barbecue up some shrimp for me or something.
6148974	6149896	Bye, everybody.
6149956	6150437	Thanks for coming.
6150537	6150938	Bye.
6153843	6160210	Of course, when we're doing this here at Golfland and pre-taping, we can't really interact with our chatroom right now.
6161031	6170021	We can't experience, like I'm sure SoCalKicks is in the chatroom right now and he's promoting USA and yelling at us when we're dissing Konami in any way.
6170601	6174786	And Twen probably has some new Hell remix that he's distributing amongst the folks.
6175106	6177128	And Slinky's probably just very bitter that he's not here.
6192003	6193244	We miss you, Slinky!
6195225	6195685	Ten more minutes.
6195725	6197366	I don't know what else is there to say right now.
6197466	6198967	Any other Bimani news going on?
6198987	6208612	I haven't eaten anything today except a cupcake and some chocolate-covered espresso beans and this, like, orange creamsicle Dutch ice drink thingy.
6209212	6209512	Yum.
6210313	6211293	I'm nutritious today.
6211313	6212494	That's probably why I have a headache.
6212514	6212914	My God.
6212934	6216856	I have Evangelion Redeath, though.
6216896	6217396	That's awesome.
6217416	6218737	I'm going to watch the hell out of that tonight.
6219858	6220258	Good stuff.
6221210	6221710	and Steve.
6222170	6232694	Apparently, though, I think that the lovely people at Gravity, who basically made Ragnarok Online, has blocked the servers.
6232774	6233775	I could not get on.
6233835	6234895	I'm going to try again.
6235455	6241518	I can only read the kana where it says, server, word, not works.
6242498	6246022	So, I need to, you know, figure out the rest of it out.
6246102	6250886	So, I'll have an update on my addiction online RPG.
6251006	6252808	So, yay.
6252848	6253229	Right on.
6253469	6255050	I'm sure everyone's so interested.
6256314	6261955	Well, you know, if people are online and they're not listening to our show and they're not listening to my music anymore, I don't know why they wouldn't be.
6262415	6264436	But, you know, those are fun things to do.
6264476	6266296	That's right.
6266436	6271817	See, this is one reason we are on a modem-friendly stream, even though we know a lot of people are on DSL these days.
6272097	6278439	We reach out to the folks still on modem, and those on DSL can still do other stuff.
6278479	6280159	Their bandwidth's not being sucked down.
6280339	6280940	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
6298456	6299997	As we get odd looks.
6300057	6306962	We were trying to, during the last segment when you were in the office, we were trying to say things to our Japanese listeners because we noticed that there are people in Japan listening every week.
6307262	6310364	So we wanted to say something, like a hello or something, but none of us knew Japanese.
6310684	6311585	So you have anything you want to say?
6314545	6319427	Nihonjin no minasan, domo arigatou gozaimashita.
6320428	6323149	She just told me to go to hell.
6323769	6333073	I think if I said it as properly as I could, I said everyone of our Japanese listeners, we thank you very much for listening and please keep listening.
6333493	6334914	And not just Japan, but worldwide.
6335154	6336274	Canada, we got a lot of listeners.
6336434	6337935	Unfortunately, I forgot my French.
6338735	6342537	Yeah, give a shout out to our Canadian moderators, yo, for DDR Freak.
6342817	6345778	And Europe, all sorts.
6345818	6346378	Chile, of course.
6346398	6347439	Can't forget Chile.
6347479	6350700	And to all of our moderators in Alabama and the Mideast.
6350840	6354062	And for all the people who didn't, you know, the moderators who didn't get to go, we missed you there.
6355802	6360044	I just have to say right now, mad love to my fellow DDR Freak moderators.
6360104	6361625	I had a wonderful time with you guys.
6363635	6368381	And Matt loved Melody for coming from out of town and entertaining me and being the guest on last week's show.
6368802	6372387	That was good that Melody came and I got to talk to her on the phone.
6372827	6373548	Oh yes, that's right.
6373728	6375731	We were in the mall and talked to Melody.
6375771	6378955	We were at a strip mall, in the cab on the way to the strip mall.
6379984	6398112	It was kind of a support group because her boyfriend was out of town and one of my best friends was out of town in Vegas so we had to have a support group of we're pouting because we're not in Vegas time but I'm going to get to Vegas at some point in the next few months so just a warning to you Vegas folk, I will take the tape recorder.
6398412	6398973	Unfortunately...
6399993	6409898	We didn't coordinate it, we just weren't thinking I guess and didn't get Jamie the tape recorder to take with her to Vegas so she could do some interviews down there like she did an awesome job on the Dollar Mini interviews a couple episodes back.
6411727	6416249	I did make a mention to a couple of my fellow moderators that I'd love to have them on the show.
6416509	6417169	Rad, good.
6417429	6419390	And, you know, of course, I always want to have Mel back on.
6419950	6425092	And there is a possibility in the future we'll have a few of the members from RTF on the show in the future.
6425112	6426093	It's going to be very cool.
6426113	6426953	I'm hoping so, too.
6427033	6428314	I would love to get Rain on.
6428534	6435817	I would love to get, you know, I would love to just have an RTF show, have the guys there, have, like, you know, my Step Squad people here.
6435837	6436177	Right.
6436617	6439118	And even if we can't get you guys here, you know what?
6439158	6439939	We travel too.
6440259	6442820	As is shown from Jamie going out of town last week, going to Vegas.
6443441	6444701	We might go out to SoCal.
6444881	6446422	I might be going to SoCal in a few weeks.
6446922	6448603	So we'll be doing some taping down there.
6448663	6453166	I'll be sneaking off in Rob's trunk a la, you know, Spritle from, you know...
6454082	6455923	Speed Racer Anybody want to be Jim Jim?
6455943	6459064	I'm the number one guest there Excuse me, I have hiccups Semi-live radio, ladies and gentlemen Vanilla Ice
6482014	6483034	I'm dying, I'm dying.
6487555	6493317	Myself, Melody, and Mel B, and my boyfriend Glenn, we're all going to try and go down to the Price is Right.
6493897	6495917	So, we'll see what happens.
6495937	6497938	Because I've been there before and I had a blast.
6497958	6501359	The Price is Right factored into the trip to Vegas.
6502259	6507725	It has to do with Monday morning with all of us piled up in J-Dog's room watching The Price is Right.
6508405	6509707	Hollering at this one woman.
6509727	6512409	We're like, lose, lose, you stupid bitch, lose, lose.
6512549	6513791	Let me guess, she won the showcase.
6513951	6514592	Two cars.
6515653	6516954	Well, one car in her normal round.
6516974	6519536	She got a dollar on the wheel.
6520817	6522137	And then came in again.
6522757	6527599	She won the showcase, which was another car, a motorcycle, and kitchen appliances.
6527619	6528899	And this woman was just stupid.
6528979	6530319	That's what you get for yelling at her.
6530339	6530819	That's what you get.
6530859	6531399	That's karma.
6531720	6532320	We're laughing.
6532340	6533240	Karma.
6533260	6536561	Taxes, taxes, taxes, taxes.
6537321	6541162	So, that was just the funniest thing hearing, you know, shouts from the bed.
6541442	6542802	Lose you stupid bitch, I hope you die.
6543662	6546223	You know what's funny is that I can hear somebody playing Kakumei from here.
6547219	6553823	I've heard that song so damn many times I can hear it from here.
6553923	6555904	Did you hear how loud Power Power is here now?
6556305	6557065	Yeah, I love it.
6557085	6558386	You can hear it like way up here.
6558426	6560387	It's like 10 times as much as it used to be.
6560587	6562228	I'm just happy as long as I don't hear D2R.
6563249	6564470	I heard Night of Fire earlier.
6565911	6566951	Look, I hear Made of Fire.
6567432	6569632	Made of Fire, I'm made of fire.
6569732	6571833	I want to tell you a story about Pear Pear.
6571853	6572353	Yes.
6572413	6577555	I was sitting down across from it, and normally the way they had it, they had it solo, you could barely hear it when you're playing.
6578296	6581337	And I'm sitting there, and I'm singing along to Eurobeat, and I don't even notice this.
6581877	6587199	And at the end of the song, I go up there and I play it, and I'm like, I come back, and I sit down, and I'm like, you guys, it's really loud.
6587799	6588680	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
6605376	6606316	I didn't play Guitar Freak, so.
6607577	6610197	One thing, that video right there, the Evangelion, it is an anime.
6610217	6612358	It reminds me of something I just got about two weeks ago.
6612978	6617459	Okay, you might want to check your local grocery outlet, as I do every now and then.
6617499	6618139	Grocery outlet.
6618339	6620620	I found the entire series of Bubblegum Crisis there for $2.
6620800	6623261	Dub or sub?
6624241	6624481	Both.
6625201	6625521	Awesome.
6625541	6625941	DVDs?
6626142	6626362	Yes.
6627182	6627822	I will check.
6628262	6631303	Although I already have, you know, two of the LaserDiscs.
6633125	6634846	and Bubblegum Crash and LaserDisc.
6634906	6645670	I'm just saying though, recently the one down in Rockland here on SunEyes has been getting all kinds of DVDs and books, good books, computer games even.
6646131	6647151	All kinds of stuff, just $2.
6647431	6649332	I will check it out.
6649372	6650852	Thank you for the info.
6651233	6654394	Any of you who live anywhere near here... You heard it on Orange Sounds Radio first, y'all.
6655740	6657765	So do we have any more things to say to our listeners?
6657886	6659329	I'm going to hand it back to Rob now.
6659610	6659931	Y'all.
6660131	6660352	Hi.
6661053	6663560	So did you hear the news about why Jamie was in the office for so long?
6664232	6666393	I was eavesdropping, yes, so I did hear a little bit.
6666854	6667394	What did you hear?
6667934	6669115	I heard something about a tourney.
6669495	6669696	Yes.
6670776	6677161	It is official, once again, aiming for the November-ish range, you know, not committing to a day E yet.
6677381	6683905	We don't probably want to avoid Turkey weekend, or maybe not, because a lot of people will be off school Turkey weekend, so maybe that's something to look at.
6684005	6684305	Who knows?
6684345	6685486	We'll see what happens.
6685986	6690049	Speaking from experience last year, went on vacation, a lot of vacation.
6690309	6691110	So we'll see.
6691150	6692931	The tickets to Turkey are really expensive.
6695198	6695959	You're a dork.
6696580	6700564	I'm thinking, you know, either weekend before or weekend after Turkey.
6701525	6707030	As in, like, not the ones immediately next to it, but, like, way after or right preceding, you know.
6707050	6708212	Right on.
6709133	6709493	Hopefully.
6710154	6711014	But it is official.
6711055	6713757	We will be having tournament here at Roseville Golf Land.
6714238	6715039	So badass.
6715919	6718082	What else can we talk about to close the show out here with?
6718615	6720196	I have a really bad headache.
6720416	6720677	Really?
6720737	6721117	Why's that?
6721457	6721857	I don't know.
6721877	6722398	Just everything.
6722418	6724559	Probably because I haven't hardly eaten anything and haven't touched anything.
6724579	6726040	Well, we need to go eat before we go home.
6726481	6726921	I need to eat.
6726961	6728542	Well, we're going to go eat then.
6728983	6732845	Let's go like, you know, on a rampage and, you know, be cannibals or something.
6733866	6757273	When you guys post something on Sack of Money Not just Sack of Money Because it's not just going to be a Sacramento thing It's going to be everywhere We'll post on Sack of Money We'll post on DDR Freak Hell, you email us at OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com We'll come spam your local board Even if you're in like Taiwan We're going to plug our tournament on your board Because it's going to be the biggest damn thing ever We'll have to use one of those online translator services To be able to post My horrible, horrible Babelfish
6758231	6761354	No, I found a really nice Japanese one, but I'll be posting that on our forums.
6761374	6763035	Make it big and shiny, you know, so I can find it.
6763275	6763556	Hold on.
6763816	6767379	Oh, now we got a... Because I'm retarded and I can't browse.
6767719	6769440	You'll know, trust us.
6769701	6771582	About that translator, yeah, I really like it.
6771662	6772203	It's cool.
6772723	6773304	Oh, the new one?
6773344	6773904	The new one you found?
6773924	6775345	Tell them about this.
6775566	6779809	I don't remember the site off the top of my head, but it's actually a Japanese translation program.
6780189	6785354	Well, translation website, I mean, as in a Japanese native site that will translate...
6786154	6789976	Japanese text to English nearly flawlessly if you run a page through it.
6790376	6794998	It will leave the kanji, katakana, hiragana up and put English text underneath it.
6795078	6796979	And you can even read fan fiction with that thing.
6796999	6797499	It's so good.
6797579	6797919	Wow, cool.
6798100	6804562	On top of that, it also translates English to Japanese in a fairly reasonable pattern so you can actually put something on there and look relatively literate.
6804963	6805303	Cool.
6805823	6808204	Have you guys heard the news about why Jamie was in the office for so long?
6809905	6812006	From what I understand, she was talking with the tech, right?
6813066	6814407	We are going to be having a tournament here.
6815436	6819839	Winner, because I just spent a good 10 minutes talking with Mr. Tech Guy to fix every Bimani machine.
6820680	6824903	Because I'm like, I was talking to him and it's like, hey, you know the Soul Calibur is broken.
6824923	6826984	And since I have you, would you mind coming with me?
6827044	6829126	We have a nice tour of the arcade I'd like to take you on.
6830027	6830607	Oh, that's sweet.
6831548	6833289	And he's like, hang on, let me get my clipboard.
6834830	6836291	It was lots and lots of happy fun.
6836731	6840694	Yeah, I have to say, I want to give him a major kudo.
6841175	6842836	Power to Dwayne.
6842856	6844117	Dwayne, the greatest tech ever.
6844963	6847584	We give Roseville Golf Land a lot of crap on this show.
6848484	6849285	Well, maybe a little bit.
6850125	6852286	Really, this is the best arcade in town.
6852446	6853847	This is the best arcade in town.
6854147	6855587	One of the great places to play.
6855748	6862230	But someone should let Shiggle Boss know that the people at RVGL don't actually know what he's talking about in regards to 4th Plus.
6862250	6862890	That's true, yeah.
6862991	6868993	Because I talked to Dwayne down there, and he's like, you know, I just found out about that today, which leads me to believe that Jamie told him.
6869013	6869073	Hmm.
6872342	6873843	I mentioned it because I thought he might already know.
6873863	6877907	I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I just thought I'd grab the mic here.
6877927	6881169	Talk about why Jamie was in the office for so long.
6881189	6882450	Huh?
6883811	6886373	I did my DWI.
6886774	6887914	In other words, I have no DWI.
6888435	6891277	But yeah, so we're going to have a happy, fun tournament.
6891357	6892198	Do you like SCAT 2?
6893839	6895981	First and foremost, it will not be called SCAT 2.
6896321	6896862	It will be RVGO 1.
6900023	6901424	But that's so generic.
6901504	6902385	Where's Tad?
6902405	6905068	We're going to plan a clever name.
6905088	6913115	We have to think of a better name than RBGL1 so we don't be like Swiggle1, Miggle1, and Kamiggle1 or whatever the hell.
6913175	6918080	You know, I love how we try so hard to make this a national show yet we keep talking Bay Area topics.
6918120	6921583	We will not have a tournament named after crap, okay?
6923462	6924843	But it's what made us unique!
6925083	6928004	We will not have a tournament named after crap.
6928104	6929504	Well, we could call it, like, SCAB.
6930085	6931565	Sacramental Tournament in Bowling.
6932125	6933286	You know, SCAB.
6933606	6937608	We are not having a tournament named after bodily functions.
6937948	6939789	As in scab forming or feces.
6939809	6942690	We'll just call it SCT2.
6942730	6944490	And that's the final word because Jamie said so.
6946351	6949312	How about, like, Sacramental's...
6952441	6956724	and Upstanding Citizens... I don't know.
6956864	6967272	Rob, how about we call it SackMyMoney.com Prevents... Prevents... Prevents Crap.
6967312	6968012	There we go.
6968112	6969834	SackMyMoney Prevents Tournament.
6970154	6972055	Yeah, you're not going to play the machine, damn it.
6972556	6974257	How about the Orange Lounge Owns You Tourney?
6979029	6982214	Dude, this is going to be a long, fat discussion on the board.
6982234	6982715	You know that.
6983016	6987302	How about sakbemoney.com presents The Tournament.
6989145	6990708	That's all I need to know is The Tournament.
6991508	6993731	Dude, you know we've got to do something cool, though.
6994031	7001561	Because we made ourselves unique last year at the Folsom Game Room, FTR, by doing freaking SCAT.
7001981	7003583	Sacramento's Cosplay and Turning.
7004064	7008149	Now, everybody made fun of us for that, but it's still, everybody remembers SCAT.
7008570	7009591	Who the hell remembers Miggle 2.5?
7013252	7013732	We'll see.
7013872	7014553	We'll see what happens.
7014853	7025358	Oh, incidentally, for those of you out there, Miggle is Milpina Golf Lands, Figgle is Sunnyvale Golf Lands, Shiggle is Southern Hills Golf Lands, CVGL is Central Valley Golf Lands, etc., etc.
7027313	7032336	Well, it looks like they're shutting down Golfland right now, so it's just a matter of seconds before we get kicked out.
7033517	7035918	We'll work on the tournament details, and we'll have that for you.
7035958	7037639	We'll post on all the local boards about that.
7037679	7045243	But, of course, this is a national tournament, and if you have any tournaments in your area you want to talk about on this show, drop us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
7045283	7049706	If you've got a tape player, a microphone-type kit that you can take to your local arcade and...
7050126	7054168	Film the tournament, or, you know, I say film, but I mean, you know, tape the tournament and get interviews.
7054208	7054868	We'd love to hear it.
7054908	7058370	Give us a five to ten minute package on your local tournament, and we'll air it here on the show.
7058670	7061372	Our listeners just missed the anguish screams as the mania was shut down.
7061392	7062732	Yes, the anguish screams, the song's getting turned off.
7063233	7066074	So, anyway, it's time for us to end the show, so you got any final thoughts?
7066714	7067135	Any final thoughts?
7067195	7067555	Later, Ted.
7068035	7070016	My final thought is feed me, Simo.
7070216	7071217	Feed me all night long.
7072737	7075659	My final thought is thanks to everybody for listening to this very experimental issue.
7075679	7076199	Shine get!
7076219	7077120	Shine get!
7077140	7077660	Shine get!
7082753	7085734	Thanks to everyone for listening to this very experimental show.
7086055	7087155	I saw a really ugly chick.
7087175	7088116	She looked like a horse.
7088476	7089036	She scared me.
7089797	7091578	That was the scariest thing in the world.
7091638	7093459	I lost my combo there, dude.
7094499	7095740	Any last words from Punk Night?
7096861	7097341	It hurts.
7098221	7099422	You want to plug your CD real fast?
7102009	7104690	Actually, I don't have any copies made of my CD.
7104750	7105070	Never mind.
7105371	7105711	You lose.
7108132	7114815	I kind of lost all the files that were for the cover and everything, but I will be making a revision.
7116115	7117416	Well, fine, and I'll plug mine.
7117876	7123278	You can listen to my music, Loki, which is also known as Nightmare Hunter on mp3.com.
7123579	7128601	It's www.mp3.com slash nightmare underscore hunter, and that's it.
7128621	7129041	Come on.
7129693	7131455	Alright, we gotta hurry up and end this show.
7131595	7133036	The final word needs to be made from Dan.
7133056	7133477	Wait, wait, wait.
7133517	7134578	The final word from Dan.
7134698	7136559	Hold on, we're gonna go over and get the final word from Dan.
7136579	7137180	This is my sweetie fiance.
7137220	7138181	And then we're ending this show.
7138201	7139082	He called me insane.
7139402	7139762	Here we go.
7139842	7140703	Final word from Dan.
7141884	7142585	It's time to go.
7143946	7144707	I suck my balls.
7145708	7146549	I'm sorry, one more time.
7146569	7148170	No one can handle my crotch, baby.
7149131	7149852	He waved at the camera.
7149872	7150552	He said suck his balls.
7150873	7152614	And apparently no one can handle Ryan's crotch.
7152634	7153315	Alright, the end.
7153335	7154316	Thanks for listening to the show.
7154336	7155016	We'll see you next week.
