8548	9449	It's a videotape!
9770	10210	Put it in!
10230	10691	Put it in!
16016	19239	You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.
19400	24205	Our live talk program begins now.
24225	24905	Boring!
29210	30952	This video sucks!
34620	37983	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
38563	41245	Orange Lounge may contain nudity.
41826	45189	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
45609	48852	Hide Orange Lounge radio for the fucking children.
49572	52314	The last Metroid is in captivity.
53475	55517	The galaxy is at peace.
68556	71837	I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.
72317	75158	My kind of people and assholes.
75918	80560	One, Warner, he's good.
81000	82561	Missed it by that much.
82921	84321	That's Dr. Evil's cat.
84681	85301	How can you tell?
85582	86782	I never forget a pussy.
87681	90403	37.
87701	90403	My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks.
90703	91224	In a row?
91384	91704	Sure.
92004	93645	And monkeys might fly out of my butt.
93765	95426	You are the weakest link to fight.
95546	97368	So you get nothing.
97908	98629	You lose.
99409	100450	Good day, sir.
100630	105313	Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.
105813	112678	I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange
114099	120105	DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 14 for September the 29th of 2002.
120165	123769	You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most incredible radio station of all things B-Money.
141334	144116	We are the greatest Bomani Talk radio program ever.
144537	146799	We are the only Bomani Talk radio program ever.
147579	149381	My name is Rob Roberts.
149761	151263	But you might know me as Sky.
151623	153665	Joining me as always is our resident Happy Bunny.
153785	156888	Everyone, please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
156988	158129	You smell like butt.
159710	161632	We've got a few people around here tonight.
161792	163433	I'm going to introduce them one at a time.
163473	165015	We've got Matt, also known as Loki.
165856	166096	Hello.
166516	167237	We've got Dave.
168838	170519	We had some other people, but they ran away.
170579	171680	There's beef in the other room.
171720	172620	That's why they ran away.
172960	173861	Beef is bad.
173941	177843	They got enticed by some big beef.
178084	178584	Beef is bad.
178604	179424	It's hiding in the other room.
179465	180045	Beef is bad.
181636	183657	Beasts taste like murder and murder tastes good.
185659	186559	To quote Dennis Leary.
186839	189761	I will tell you right now, this is going to be one of those shows.
190582	191403	We'll get into it later.
192383	202930	If you want to go ahead and send me your FUs of the week, just join our chat room at irc.eggheads.org, any other side IRC server, and you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
203591	210535	And we'll be talking to everybody else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to play some old school 2DX songs, because they're cool.
212176	213417	Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?
214817	217358	I would like to open someone's head to see what they've got.
217398	217978	Brains!
218459	219039	Brains are yummy.
219819	221140	You can use a straw to eat them.
221160	226962	Because remember, I can sniff your spicy brains.
228522	230603	Red Dragon 2, starring Jamie Summers.
232524	232964	Brains.
233404	235565	I'd starve in here, though.
236385	237806	All right, we'll be right back.
268991	270211	Thank you for watching.
270251	271212	See you next time.
304349	306071	Thank you for watching!
414344	415305	Thank you for watching!
475748	480719	From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bomani stuff, comes our Bomani Science Lesson of the Day.
481480	484386	Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.
493760	495922	Alright, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
496022	500647	Big thanks to 23rd Magus for sending us that promo we just used to come back in on.
500908	506574	Unfortunately it came out a little quiet, but we'll work on getting that a little louder for future broadcasts of that promo.
508419	510801	We need more promos on this show because I'm getting lazy.
511741	515944	I'm getting lazy, so the audience needs to take care of that for me if they want.
518286	520207	I'm just reading some things in the chat room.
520387	526431	If you do want to join our chat room, go to any other site, IRC server, and just join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
527031	531494	And they're just talking about those songs that we played, Panorama and Shine On.
532075	533896	And all sorts of different opinions on that.
534797	535577	What do we want to do first?
535597	538179	We want to talk about Max USA or we want to talk about FU?
538821	541208	Well, I was going to start us off on a positive note.
541529	544839	Okay, we're going to talk about Max USA, DDL Max.
545785	551367	Well, basically, I've gotten a little bit of information about the release of DDR Max.
551407	555628	I'm sure for everyone who's been looking on DDR Freak, you've seen the release of the box art.
555648	560869	If you have not, just go to DDRFreak.com, and it should be the second announcement there.
560909	562410	There's a direct link to the box art.
562430	564290	I warn you, it is a very large image.
564350	565570	It's very high quality, though.
567231	570832	There's also a few hints on what you might be hearing on the new version.
570852	571152	Yeah.
571392	574915	Yes, you can also check it out over on SoCalKicks.com.
574955	582221	One of our faithful listeners, SoCalKicks, has a site that's pretty much very up to the minute on all the Max USA news.
582762	589307	And one thing that we found out through the cover, and I'm going to pull up the cover because some people in the room here haven't... Ah, shit.
589848	590308	Sorry about that.
590949	594492	I haven't pulled up the cover for some people in the room here.
594512	596394	I'm going to do that right now if I can find it.
598010	602530	Let's see... But the cover of DDR Max USA...
603644	604384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
633805	637370	I'm not particularly fond of that version, but... It's just all fucked up.
637390	638391	What the hell?
651328	652528	They look like parachute pants
674762	678943	is best known for a song of theirs called Sandstorm, which you may or may not have heard.
679403	688206	Now, speculation is that that will be the song that will turn up in DDR Max USA, although, who knows, you have a different opinion on this, Matt, do you?
688766	691127	Well, there's another song that's pretty much the same song.
691447	692427	It's Feel the Beat.
692587	699049	It's got a lot more stuff that they could do with instead of Sandstorm, which is the same thing repeating over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
700189	701169	I actually have an MP3.
701189	703310	We can play that later on in the show if you'd like.
707145	707385	Yes.
708006	710729	This is Sandstorm, for those of you who maybe haven't heard the song before.
710749	714172	So, if you have an idea of what you can look forward to, possibly.
714232	714813	We don't know yet.
714853	717375	We'll hopefully get confirmation on that very soon in the near future.
717435	719698	So, there's a little teaser of that for you.
719938	721359	And then Reel2Reel did that song...
722883	727747	I don't have an audio copy of it, unfortunately, but it goes like, I'd like to move it, move it, I'd like to move it.
727767	728407	You might know that one.
728427	729648	I haven't heard that song at all.
730409	731850	You'd probably know it if you heard it.
731890	733671	You'd probably be surprised at what you've heard.
735633	742898	We also, I asked if it was okay for me to say, so the tentative date is going to be November 5th.
743979	749143	It could possibly be pushed back a week after that, but that's what I have so far as a release date.
749543	754128	So get over to GameStop or EB or wherever that you like to go and reserve your copy, like now.
754408	755549	November 5th.
755609	756550	Buy your copy.
756730	757912	Purchase your copy.
757972	759473	Spend money on this copy.
760474	761735	And so that's very cool.
761756	765900	We got a, hopefully, it's tentative release date, but it sounds pretty certain it's going to be November 5th.
766679	775705	And as mentioned last week in the October 8th issue of the official PlayStation Magazine will be a demo of DDR Max USA, so go check that out.
776086	780729	And actually, that was the other bit of news that was released this week.
780789	782410	Some people have gotten their hands on that demo.
783290	791496	And also, I believe DDR Freak has the news, as does SoCalKicks.com, as does most of your faithful Bomani news sites out there.
791556	795479	There are some pictures out there of the DDR Max demo.
796239	802460	And what it does reveal is that Secret Rendezvous is going to be one of the songs on Max USA, which is... Yes!
803820	812602	You can get your hot lesbian action on with Secret Rendezvous, which is interesting because that means there's a Max 2 song in there, so who knows what other Max 2 songs might turn up.
813062	817583	Perhaps I'd like to see, you know, like Burning Heat or Kakumei.
818023	818803	You want Burning Heat?
819903	823084	I don't want Burning Heat personally, but I'd like to see it in DDR, yes.
823764	823904	So...
825703	827804	Now, just make sure that you release your copy.
827824	835007	I just think it's funny, though, how they replaced the kanji with little three-letter acronyms for the... Not acronyms, that's not a good word, but abbreviations.
835607	837208	And standard is apparently STD.
838761	842364	STD, so if you're playing a song on Trick, it's now your STD.
843064	844746	So make sure you wear those latex shoes.
847288	849169	You need to talk about your new shoes that you got, Jamie.
849189	851751	You've got burning heat shoes on today.
852031	852332	Okay.
852852	855174	Unfortunately, we don't have our cam on today because it's really dark in here.
855214	860878	I will scan my shoes so that everyone can see and put them up on the Sack of Imani forums.
860918	864261	But they've got little flames on them, so it looks like the Max 2 logo.
864301	865742	So she's got burning feet, we all say.
865922	869844	Yep, replaced the laces with black laces, so now they're all sleek and cute.
870425	876788	My shoes own, and I got them at the Vans outlet, so... The other thing the demo reveals, there's no .5 speed mix.
876808	885753	That was something that was on the E3 demo that's not on this demo, so who knows if it's going to be on the final release or not.
885954	887094	There are no dark mode.
887374	891537	Rumor saying not, because of technical issues, but who knows what they're going to do.
894440	900683	The demo also did not include foot rankings, which was something that's supposedly supposed to be in the final release.
900723	902665	So that might be added later, we just don't know yet.
902765	906146	Just saying for the preview, there are no foot rankings currently.
906187	908348	So that's about all we see for right now.
909128	915712	Let the beat hit them, look to the sky, exotic ethnic and secret rendezvous, all playable with this month's official PlayStation magazine.
915772	921915	So we'll definitely get our hands on that and share our thoughts on it with you once we get it.
921935	922556	Still working on it.
922956	923136	Yes.
924031	926052	So, let's see, any other chat room?
926072	936796	They're saying they want to see, like, Long Train Runnin', The Whistle Song, and, uh... Uh... Foot Rankings will be in the final release.
938217	938357	Hmm.
938797	939017	Okay.
939037	939537	We'll see.
939557	940798	Oh, we have some information in there.
941158	942219	Some insider scoop.
943579	946300	The last thing to be put in is going to be, uh, the Foot Rankings.
946700	949301	So... They're still working on it.
949522	952643	They're encouraging us not to share our thoughts, but to share an ISO of the demo.
952663	952843	Ha ha!
953630	954771	No.
954791	955471	Go out and buy your copy.
955532	956252	Or just wait and buy Max USA.
956272	958494	Save your money.
970885	971766	Why Am I Being Shot?
971806	978232	What else do we want to say on Max USA?
978312	981395	Any other thoughts on Max USA?
982076	984698	Things that they need to do quickly before the final release?
985459	986620	Other songs we hope to see?
987841	988342	Any opinions?
989540	1002728	Well, actually, if you look really, really, really, really, really closely in the background of Max USA, the cover, you'll notice in really, really, really small print hidden in there, it says, yes, there will most definitely be Let Them Move in this version.
1003648	1006170	So just, you know, to warn you guys.
1007673	1008514	Watch out for that.
1009214	1009634	No.
1010575	1015957	I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed by Jason himself that Let Them Move will not be a song.
1016377	1020879	But I heard a rumor that it might be the Training Mode song.
1020899	1021339	It better not be.
1021359	1021740	I don't know.
1021780	1023921	I would rather have After the Game of Love for Training Mode.
1024021	1025161	It's like in third mix.
1025961	1028483	Why don't you just get rid of Training Mode and give us a couple more songs?
1029203	1033685	I use Training Mode to listen to my edits with the clap assist on.
1034921	1037863	I'm sorry, actually we're confusing lesson mode and training mode.
1038223	1040924	Training mode is the one where you can slow down the song and all that stuff.
1041204	1044246	Lesson mode is where you learn how to play TDR.
1044286	1051070	Lesson mode is to just keep, you know, like in 3rd Mix they had a pimp song, you know, after the Game of Love.
1051270	1051570	Did they?
1051730	1052210	Oh yeah, that's right.
1052330	1055072	It's when you're not quite ready for the STDs, you go to lesson mode.
1057586	1060489	and remember, wear latex shoes so you don't catch those STDs.
1060670	1060830	Yes.
1061871	1065115	You're like poor little Miss Muffet who saddled her trumpet.
1065836	1070221	Oh, this is... Black Lab suggests that instead of Max 300, Let Them Move will be the extra stage.
1071983	1076208	Everyone will be feeling that because they'll be like throwing up or something.
1076348	1076788	Let them...
1079646	1082328	All right, so we started on a positive note.
1082408	1084289	Shall we go to the FUs of the week?
1084350	1084730	What do you think?
1085510	1085791	Sure.
1085971	1086271	All right.
1086471	1087091	You got one, Jamie?
1087352	1087632	Yes.
1087872	1094697	All right, let's start off, as we always do, with Jamie's FU of the week, which turns in always to everybody's FU of the week, so here you go.
1096198	1097979	My FU of the week goes to Taco Bell.
1100401	1101942	I hadn't eaten a damn thing all day.
1101962	1103423	I get to Taco Bell.
1104665	1109967	and I wanted to have a nice, you know, chicken grilled stuff burrito.
1111147	1112668	And I wanted a chicken mix and melt.
1112788	1115749	My chicken mix and melt was yummy, but it had tomatoes on it, but I forgot, that's okay.
1115949	1126632	Anyway, we get over here to Rob's place, and I take a bite into my grilled stuff burrito, my chicken grilled stuff burrito, and it's beans, all beans.
1127342	1130945	All beans and a little bit of rice, and then I found one piece of chicken in the whole damn thing.
1131545	1132306	And I paid for chicken.
1132606	1133847	So, that's my F.U.
1133887	1134647	of the week.
1135768	1136669	Okay, that was beautiful.
1137209	1137649	My F.U.
1137669	1139971	of the week is to Roseville Golf Land.
1139991	1141792	Yeah, that's right.
1141812	1142873	I need to change the song here.
1143113	1143874	Oh, my own song.
1143894	1144914	Wait, what was my song?
1145715	1146696	Oh, Petite Love.
1146896	1147536	Oh, boy.
1148357	1150398	What an effing cool song.
1151439	1151719	Yay.
1151939	1152259	Okay.
1153020	1153500	My F.U.
1153520	1155722	of the week is to Roseville Golf Land for...
1156585	1169256	Even though they did upgrade both their Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania machines to 8th and 7th mix respectively, they broke Guitar Freaks already after one hour.
1170177	1170697	One hour.
1170737	1171498	It's a new record.
1172455	1174536	They can't upgrade- IT'S A NEW RECORD!
1175136	1177217	You've got a new record, save it on the memory card!
1177717	1190502	No, but it's really shitty now, because I played Drone Mania a lot, and that's cool, but if I want to play session mode, too fucking bad, because Guitar Freaks, they already fucked it up, and they haven't even started playing yet.
1190703	1192083	It was open, I think, for one hour.
1192683	1196525	Actually, if you think about it, it wasn't as bad as when they got the seventh mix.
1196885	1199326	The seventh mix, they couldn't even play it, it just broke.
1200166	1201047	Because of some coding.
1201841	1204984	Keep in mind, when we got this mix, do you know who installed that?
1205344	1206245	Who actually got it working?
1206666	1207607	My fiancé did!
1208407	1209488	Dan got it working!
1209689	1210069	Cool.
1210109	1213532	So maybe we should just send Dan over there and say, hey, fix this.
1213592	1217736	Of course, that's also why this mix was set for two tokens when we first got it.
1218717	1220078	Cool.
1220138	1221800	Matt, you got any fuckies of the week?
1222421	1222481	Um...
1224589	1226412	Actually, I don't think I do.
1226812	1229356	Well, fine, for once.
1230317	1233481	I don't know, I haven't really been thinking about things to be angry at.
1234763	1236245	Um, let me see here.
1236265	1236385	Thanks.
1236405	1236585	Thanks.
1242219	1242740	Alright, you lose.
1242780	1243780	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
1243800	1244581	Yeah, yeah, I got it.
1244621	1244961	I got one.
1245281	1245582	Okay.
1246182	1253988	Okay, this FU goes to the makers of EJ Software, the programs I use for making wonderful songs.
1254568	1258151	Unfortunately, I have a sample kit, and I wanted to steal samples from it.
1258691	1265736	And they have a little thing in there to bump the pitch up so that it's, you know, at 140, which is what EJ uses.
1265956	1268338	And the damn thing kept crashing every single time.
1268478	1269359	So I have to do that.
1269759	1271160	And that's kind of weak, but that's it.
1271564	1272145	That's all I got.
1273886	1274867	I'll have more next week.
1275728	1276028	All right.
1276288	1276789	You promise?
1277269	1277690	I promise.
1277750	1277990	All right.
1278671	1281553	One thing I do have to say is that drumming is something that's totally owned.
1282394	1286538	Kuchaka and Concierto in Blue and the Extra Stage in Japanese, I can't read it.
1286998	1289140	They all play the coolest songs.
1289821	1293224	Okay, I just need to get over there and play it so I can play Another World and have my gags fixed.
1295912	1301636	I'm going to be bringing that song next week and we are going to play Another World on Orange Lounge because Gactones, he's pretty.
1302317	1303257	I have some FUs of the week.
1303317	1306740	Very, very, very, very, very, very interesting.
1307240	1308101	I have some FUs of the week.
1309262	1316788	My first FU of the week, as wonderful as they are for hosting this wonderful program, Live365.com gets my first FU of the week.
1318126	1322548	First of all, for playing that goddamn Prodigy ad and we missed the show.
1322568	1328370	And I'm all for, you know, playing the ads occasionally to help pay the bills, but that Prodigy song sucks, I'm sorry.
1328650	1330011	Quit playing that ad during my show.
1331652	1335853	Second, F you for them, is that they keep stats.
1336033	1339535	So we can see, you know, how many people are listening to the show, how many hours we get and all that.
1339975	1340715	Well, guess what?
1340755	1344637	For every station on Live 365, they lost last week's stat.
1345257	1352399	And by the way, I happen to know, because I see live stats that are coming in, that last Sunday happened to be one of our biggest nights for the show to date.
1352740	1357721	And we don't get any credit for that now, so our ratings suck, thanks to Live365.com.
1357761	1358221	So FU!
1358462	1359182	So poo-poo on them.
1359382	1360622	Everybody, plug in twice.
1361242	1363283	Although, thanks for hosting the show.
1363343	1364163	Hey, what can I say?
1364243	1366164	But you fucked up on that one, so poo.
1366704	1367084	Poo-pee.
1367284	1367845	Poo-pee on you.
1368885	1371506	My other FU of the week goes to my 2DX controller.
1372549	1376716	Because button number 3 and button number 7 have been sticking like, like a lot.
1377337	1377798	And I hate it.
1379690	1380030	That's it.
1380070	1381430	That's my last FU.
1382390	1384591	You have another FU, Jamie.
1384671	1391172	My next FU goes toward Holic, R5, and Y31, yet again.
1392032	1393612	I am so close to passing this one.
1393632	1402914	You know, I had a freaking full combo on R5 going into right before that one really hard part that I always had issues with.
1403494	1406675	And I lost it the whole song because I can't figure that one part out.
1407215	1408215	But, you know...
1408955	1411280	Thank you to all of the seven star songs.
1411340	1412322	I'm going to pass one of you.
1412682	1412923	One day.
1413905	1414466	One day I will.
1416009	1417051	One day my prince will come.
1417311	1417892	Is that a promise?
1418373	1418533	Yes.
1419605	1420786	That's what I promised at the threat.
1421586	1422927	Oh, I mean, not at the threat.
1423947	1426309	Max, chatroom, any FUs?
1426749	1429890	The chatroom has a ton of FUs right now, so I'm going to get some of those.
1430251	1441397	But first off, I have to state that, actually, our resident comedian in the chatroom, Pyro Man, is back, and he suggested how you can get a sticky controller.
1441717	1444798	Just the secret rendezvous video and four hours on Kazop.
1445759	1445839	Hmm.
1447642	1450824	Alright, let's get to the FUs from the chatroom, shall we?
1454888	1456409	Wait, hold on, this isn't fair.
1456449	1458371	They get a cool song, and I get the tea bug.
1458771	1459932	Sorry, life sucks.
1460032	1460172	No.
1462841	1467025	SoCalKicks says, Fuck you everyone who is bitching because for me life has never been better.
1467085	1475171	And fuck you everyone who is calling him Fox version 2.0 because his latest picture makes him look like Fox even though I'd rather laugh at the situation and go along with it.
1475892	1476412	Whatever that means.
1476472	1477653	I think that was half inside joke.
1478714	1484699	JB says, F you to SyFam for being so cheap they can't properly advertise their artists like Jenny Rom.
1485539	1486840	He's such a Jenny Rom whore.
1487421	1488402	Well, you saw it in his...
1492626	1501108	DJ Konami wants to give an F you to the assholes that don't take it seriously when I'm teaching them how to play Beatmania.
1501128	1504189	Maybe we will.
1504209	1505630	Maybe we will.
1512253	1513614	Oh my god, this is a huge one.
1514295	1516636	Uh... Oh, he sent it three times.
1516776	1517997	One is enough, don't worry.
1518397	1525202	23rd Magus wants to give a big F you to Absolute Trick, because it caused him much embarrassment when he failed it on the Max 2 on Wednesday.
1525362	1526283	Fuck you, Absolute!
1526663	1530346	I also want to say, fuck you to Earthlink for screwing with their FTP servers for my site.
1531967	1534569	And he wants to know if that was, uh, fuck instead of fuck.
1536471	1537731	It was a spelling thing, anyway.
1539092	1541292	Uh, more F... Oh, Bradley's here.
1541392	1542073	Hey, what's up, Bradley?
1542513	1543833	My power went out, so I had to come over here.
1545074	1547014	You couldn't hear the show at your own house, so you had to come over here.
1547714	1548174	Oh, right on.
1549775	1553536	There's nothing to do in my apartment without power, so... So you want to give a big F you to power?
1555296	1555917	Fuck you, power.
1558037	1561938	Uh, Twen has not only... Oh my god, he's got a bunch.
1562278	1563359	He's got six, here we go.
1564472	1567733	FU number one, Japan played every other fucking song on Fifth Mix.
1567933	1569294	That's FU number one, that's where you've been.
1569934	1572895	FU number two, Feet of Fury beta being pushed back nearly half a month.
1573435	1575536	FU number three, AIM for always crapping out.
1575656	1578097	FU number four, no one appreciating his mixes, aww.
1578557	1581117	FU number five, can't view anything while listening to Orange Lounge.
1581238	1586199	FU number six, people dissing me for not passing End of the Century Maniac with a B. Okay.
1586999	1587540	Which mix?
1588040	1588500	It depends.
1589281	1589762	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1603149	1608010	His FU is to himself for being a moron and closing Microsoft Word in the middle of an assignment.
1608450	1608830	Dope!
1608891	1609811	That's why you save.
1609831	1611971	That's why we use autosave.
1612171	1612912	There you go.
1613192	1619973	Keep in mind, this is a rule for whenever... The rule for word processors and programs applies to RPGs.
1620473	1621514	Save often.
1624314	1629436	And Pyro Man wants to give an FU to me for starting the show so damn late in Illinois.
1629456	1630116	Well, fuck you, Rob.
1631187	1633469	Wait, hold on.
1633949	1634650	Hold on, Pyro Man.
1634670	1635510	I got something for you.
1637412	1640874	I have exactly the message to give to you.
1647799	1648980	Let me call you an ambulance.
1649460	1649700	Anyway.
1650901	1651482	Let's see.
1652442	1655284	Oh, Twin wants to point out that that's Fifth Mix that he plays in the Sentry on.
1656545	1656705	And...
1658174	1661275	Black Lab, I missed your FUs, you're going to have to resend them, I'm sorry.
1661335	1665296	If you didn't send them over to... Oh, he has nothing, I guess, unless you wrote them in black.
1666477	1666997	Alright, whatever.
1668237	1673339	Chaos says, FU to Beautiful Days, because he got one regular grade on it.
1674739	1675680	Oops, a little loud.
1675860	1677160	And everything else is a flashing grade.
1677920	1678881	Frowny face.
1680441	1682922	Pyro Man says... Oh, same thing.
1683402	1685963	DDR Mike says, FU to Big Black Cock.
1688112	1690253	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1713772	1716254	I don't want to see pictures right now.
1716374	1718055	Those are all the pictures.
1718335	1720857	That was relating to SoCalKick's post.
1720917	1722318	I have to say, yes, sort of.
1722438	1723479	We'll look at that during break.
1725940	1729402	He did want to point out also we have some follow-up on DDR Max USA stuff.
1731653	1731993	Let's see.
1732093	1736355	From the E3 beta version of DDR Max USA, it was announced a new half-speed would be in the list of modes.
1736415	1745940	Right now, its absence from the first November-issue demo of Official PlayStation Magazine is rumored that it was removed from the final version because of technical difficulties.
1746940	1751242	Foot rankings confirmed here on SoCalKicks.com.
1751322	1754784	People began to worry about that, too, because it was also absent from the demo.
1755224	1758726	But I can tell you right now, it is one of the last things that's going to be put into the game.
1759506	1760808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1782606	1786409	will make it into DDR Max USA, similar to an Oni mode, perhaps.
1787069	1788470	So, take that all with a grain of salt.
1788550	1791171	It's still rumor, rumor, rumorville.
1791892	1795714	So, that's it.
1797776	1798896	Yay, and there you have it.
1799156	1799777	There you have it.
1799817	1800417	Now you know.
1800777	1801138	And now you know.
1801158	1802038	And knowing is half the battle.
1802458	1803119	The more you know.
1806981	1814888	It's another FU, but it's a personal FU, and I don't like to name people by name for FUs, but Pyroman does want to give an FU to a certain individual because he smells.
1815368	1817170	So, you know who you are.
1817530	1818191	You know who you are.
1818331	1820933	Everybody make sure you've been bathing, because you're pissing off Pyroman.
1821894	1823295	And on that note, I think we're going to go to break.
1823315	1823735	What do you think?
1824236	1826417	I think that is a wonderful idea.
1826538	1829480	We are going to take a quick break, and we will come right back.
1830535	1832499	We're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back.
1832579	1836286	I've been requested to play the DJ Konami thing, which I'm going to have to dig up and find.
1836326	1837789	We'll get to that pretty soon.
1837809	1841696	We're going to start off with one of my favorite songs from Max 2.
1841736	1842237	How's that sound?
1842577	1842778	Winner.
1884853	1885935	Thanks for watching!
1941215	1944178	Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.
1945258	1949882	I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.
1950523	1953105	Listen carefully and try to follow.
1953985	1956007	The objects will come down from the top.
1956327	1959670	When it hits the red line, push the button.
1961211	1964194	When it hits the red line, turn the table.
1964934	1965575	You get it?
1965995	1967736	Alright, let's practice.
1968977	1969238	First,
1994455	1995497	Thanks for watching!
2032135	2035239	Now it's all the keys and the turntable.
2035519	2037281	It's hard, but you can do it!
2061614	2063084	New Feet Mania
2094049	2097952	We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.
2137083	2138464	We think we figured it out.
2139284	2140565	Orange Lounge Radio.
2141165	2144647	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 14.
2146468	2147348	That's an old promo.
2147388	2149089	I'm starting to play the old promos again.
2149509	2150310	Because they've been a while.
2150350	2151951	It's been a while, so they're fresh again.
2152791	2153691	It's like a fine wine.
2153731	2154632	You let them age a little bit.
2156426	2159409	We want to also talk about another new Bomani game that just hit.
2159529	2161411	I believe it is official as of Monday.
2162292	2164415	2DX8Style is out and about.
2164975	2169240	And unfortunately... And somebody... I accidentally closed the window.
2169260	2170441	They sent it in a little too late.
2171142	2171342	But...
2172629	2174731	It took them a while to do that with 7th Style too, though.
2174771	2174991	Let's see.
2175011	2175691	It's pulling up right now.
2202176	2208219	We've got a bunch of the songs that are released, and some of the non-stop courses, which I think is really interesting.
2209740	2213362	We have a Tran course, that's what I like, I think that's really cool.
2213382	2218365	There's a Tran course, which consists of Beautiful Days, Alien World, Starmind, G2, and Stoic.
2218645	2221567	Although I think G2 is a scary-ass Tran video, in my opinion.
2222307	2223568	This song is scary.
2224308	2230792	Some of the other non-stop course names that are interesting, Feel, DJ Taka, of course, Eurobeat, Super Eurobeat,
2231957	2234358	Vocal, Performance, Trance, VJ Hess.
2235178	2235879	That's an interesting one.
2235939	2241421	Number five, Newcomer, UG2, Rapid2, Original, Cinderella.
2242862	2243622	That's an interesting one.
2243642	2245623	Well, that's all... Look what that is.
2245663	2246423	Look what the songs are.
2247023	2248804	Stick Around, Jelly Kiss, Glorious Days.
2249384	2250845	Are those the sauna tracks?
2251425	2253426	No, I don't think Glorious Days is a sauna song.
2253526	2255907	It's just kind of happy sounding songs.
2256727	2257988	Piano, Tack...
2259491	2262716	Hirata, Hell, of course, and Saturday Night.
2262956	2264298	That's a pretty cool course, Saturday Night.
2264738	2270366	You got Dancing into the Night, Blown My Heart Away, Funky Bingo Paradise, Wow Wow 7 Days, and Please Don't Go.
2272645	2277508	There's some very interesting genre names in 8th style, which has been getting a lot of laughs out of people.
2277548	2278928	There's one called Cuddlecore.
2279789	2283391	Murmur Twins is the name of the song, and that's in the genre.
2283431	2284491	Metalhouse just sounds cool.
2284531	2285052	Cuddlecore.
2285092	2285872	Where's Metalhouse?
2286152	2288153	Metalhouse by Sunglasses of Night.
2289074	2289954	That would be the song.
2290275	2295517	Sunglasses of Night would be Metalhouse, and that's good, cool, featuring Hidosewa.
2295537	2296938	Psychedelic techno.
2297398	2298299	Oh, this will be a good one.
2298479	2301841	In the girl rock genre, Halfway of Promise by Yutakami.
2302836	2304337	I just need to do the sauna course
2325794	2326635	Sonic Wars would be cool.
2327016	2328858	But unfortunately, we don't know much else about 8th Style.
2328878	2330900	We're still waiting to see if any arcades in the U.S.
2330940	2331621	are going to be getting it.
2331681	2332903	We know of one that ordered it.
2334244	2337468	It has seven buttons on a turntable and effectors.
2337508	2341313	Yes, 8th Style will have seven buttons and a turntable.
2342240	2342981	14 and 2 turntables.
2343882	2349947	And it's this little hole that you put your coin in and a big plasma screen if you're getting a brand new one like we are.
2350347	2351248	Well, Scandia anyway.
2351708	2353089	Yeah, let's see.
2353149	2354270	What are they saying in the chat room?
2354771	2355872	Some people know more.
2356212	2357533	A few arcades are ordering it.
2357553	2358334	Well, which ones?
2358374	2359174	Don't just tell me a few.
2359254	2359935	Tell me which arcades.
2360155	2363138	It's not like that many arcades even have 2DX to begin with.
2363518	2367882	We happen to know locally where we base Orange Lounge out of in Sacramento that there's an arcade...
2368482	2370683	Black Lab quotes a famous Beck song, Two turntables and a microphone.
2393757	2394997	That would be Kraken DJ.
2395298	2396798	Well, with a little switch in the middle.
2396938	2397718	Was there a microphone?
2397738	2398899	There's not a microphone in Kraken DJ.
2399079	2400399	Kraken DJ is a cool game.
2400719	2403260	I don't know why they don't have more of it in places.
2403540	2410642	Kraken DJ, for those that have never played it, it's two turntables and they kind of automatically spin like a real turntable would.
2410963	2414044	As you're playing the game and it's all scratching, there's no buttons at all.
2414084	2414664	You just scratch.
2414684	2415504	There's a switch in the center.
2415624	2419025	Yeah, there's a switch in the center because you have to scratch one turntable and you scratch the other one.
2419045	2421046	You have to move it back and forth or you have to...
2422646	2425727	This is a pretty difficult game.
2425747	2429547	I think that 2DX is easier than Kraken DJ.
2431088	2431448	By far.
2431468	2433248	I wouldn't be more than 100.
2452600	2456341	DJ Konami says that San Jose State is also supposed to be getting an 8th mix.
2456422	2457262	So we'll see.
2457322	2458202	Or 8th style, sorry.
2458862	2460143	I think they're upgrading the 6th.
2460883	2467545	I also heard a rumor that Beatmania 7th mix is finally coming out for PS1 on Christmas Eve is the tentative release date.
2468365	2468886	So we'll see.
2468906	2470086	It's about freaking time.
2470206	2470906	Time to get ordering.
2471106	2471406	Yeah.
2472307	2476528	So go place your pre-orders for that on your favorite import game site.
2477348	2479149	But do not buy from BuyRipe.
2479605	2481692	When you're buying it buy right, you're buying wrong.
2482435	2483880	Because they will cheat you.
2486601	2488462	Sure, go ahead, but I'm not going to cue the music because I'm lazy.
2488702	2492805	Well, it's an old fuck you, but just my reasons for saying don't buy it, buy right.
2492925	2497627	When I bought my Tekken 4 there, I was expecting to get a Japanese copy so I could have a chance at reading the manual.
2498067	2500549	They sent me the Asian release and then wouldn't replace it.
2500789	2503410	And they said, oh, you didn't say it was Japanese, we just said it was import.
2503930	2506932	I could have bought that at YesAsia.com for about $30 cheaper.
2507472	2508853	So buy right will cheat you.
2509473	2510274	They will cheat you.
2511515	2512295	So don't buy there.
2513563	2518946	Pyromance said that he held an employee at Gunpoint and now Nickel City in Illinois will be getting 8th style.
2519666	2520026	Lovely.
2520226	2523068	Which we all know is probably a load of crap, but it's funny.
2523768	2524228	Let's see.
2527279	2528720	Let's change gears a little bit here.
2528740	2531882	This is a story I want to... Oh, unless you guys have anything you want to say about 8thStyle?
2533424	2541469	I can't play 7-key, let alone 5-key, and all that stuff, so... F you to 8thStyle for being so damn hard.
2542970	2543431	There we go.
2544151	2544732	Practice!
2546173	2550416	Also, I'd like to point, that guy that you just flashed the picture up on the screen is very ugly.
2550456	2552717	We'll get to that in a little bit.
2553318	2554559	You're a 2DX player, Bradley.
2554579	2556020	What do you think of 8thStyle so far?
2556849	2557249	Looks cool.
2558050	2564895	I've listened to much of the music so far, but... Do you think it's going to be the biggest 2DX style ever, ever, ever?
2566396	2569238	I don't know about that, but we shall see.
2569558	2571100	I thought 5th style was awfully hard to top.
2573001	2573501	6th style?
2574502	2575783	I thought 5th style was hard to top.
2576544	2577164	6 tries.
2577424	2580667	It's matching, maybe, but I don't think it's better overall than 5th.
2582992	2584012	Let's get to this other story.
2584032	2585773	Completely changing gears here a little bit.
2586333	2587593	Okay.
2588233	2590254	As if the show wasn't already on its way to a train wreck.
2590714	2593014	We're going to talk about... This is interesting.
2593895	2598856	TwinGalaxies.com This is a link that was sent to me at the end of last week's show.
2598896	2599896	I forget who sent it to me.
2599936	2600396	I'm sorry.
2600796	2604777	Whoever sent it to me, just go ahead and give yourself an ego boost in the chat room and thanks.
2605417	2612479	TwinGalaxies.com The worldwide authority on player rankings, game statistics, and championship tournaments.
2614635	2618613	Oh, I'm supposed to mention the extra stage for 8th Style is a revenge song.
2619355	2619875	Yay!
2619915	2620015	Yay!
2649410	2649991	We'll all laugh.
2650071	2650911	Okay.
2651312	2653473	This is breaking news as of July 29th.
2653493	2654774	We're a little late in reporting here.
2654794	2655275	What can we do?
2655295	2656015	This guy's ugly.
2657957	2658537	Now be nice.
2658597	2659338	He might be listening.
2660939	2662100	Nobody listens to this.
2662160	2664702	No, he's working on breaking his own world record.
2665242	2678693	One of the hottest new series of modern arcade titles to play is the Dance Dance Revolution series by Konami, with the most current and popular release officially known as DDR Max 2, which in effect is the seventh mix in the series.
2679420	2684743	For those unfamiliar with the game, players select different songs and become physically engaged in the game itself.
2684823	2690486	It makes it sound like the last stage of Nick Arcade when they were swatting flies on the blue screen.
2690566	2694908	Judging by the look of this ugly person, he hasn't been engaged in this game very long.
2703295	2710059	Dancing literally in order to hit the specific arrow directions on the floor pad with their feet.
2710459	2718984	This title, along with others such as MoCap Boxing and Police 911, are part of the latest trend in modern video gaming.
2719444	2721606	physically interactive gameplay.
2742737	2743298	Anyway.
2743678	2745899	Bunga Bunga always gets a laugh on this show.
2746360	2746820	Back to the article.
2746840	2749722	We can talk about that until the cows come home.
2750563	2753145	Making sure, okay, I just... So back to our article.
2753165	2754225	Sorry, back to the article, yes.
2755827	2756347	Twin Galaxies.
2756367	2769977	Twin Galaxies chief referee Robert T, I can't say your last name, proclaims gamer Damien Sarkoony as our first verified and recognized world champion at the DDR Max 2 title with a five score song total of...
2770337	2770558	of 315,802,020 points.
2784813	2792314	If I recall correctly, if you play a 9-foot song, the max score you'll get on a max 2 is 90 million, correct?
2792654	2795895	Multiply that by 5, that's 450 million.
2796315	2803496	So even if you fucked up your 5 9-footers completely, you should have a score of at least 400 million points, correct?
2804296	2807957	This guy has the world record with a score of 315 million.
2807977	2809057	That's like 4 7-footers and a 6.
2809097	2809177	Yes.
2815205	2821128	Hell, I could play friggin' Dynamite Ray Basic on stealth five times and still beat that damn score.
2821808	2823289	The sirens are going outside.
2823769	2825370	The world thinks this is madness.
2825430	2840357	The world record is 315 million, held by... The official Twin Galaxies tournament settings have already been determined for this title and appear later in this breaking news story, which we'll read.
2840857	2843338	But before we get into that, let's recap the experience.
2844238	2850443	The game's record capabilities are unusual in that the scores are not permanently kept in the game's memory as far as points are concerned.
2851284	2853566	Well, if you have a memory card, it'll save it to the memory card.
2853906	2858891	Also, I should mention that one of the rules for entering this world record is you have to be fucking ugly.
2861553	2863234	The scores are too safe.
2863274	2863975	Matt, go!
2864075	2864535	Go do it!
2865636	2870821	The scores are safe if you've got your initials in the machine that has your score beside it when it pops up on the screen.
2871835	2877378	While his score was world record breaking, it wasn't good enough to place on the top ten.
2877718	2879158	SoCalKicks is going right now.
2879198	2880439	He says he's running out with the camera.
2880459	2881460	He's going to take a picture of it.
2881480	2882400	SoCalKicks, you can't do it.
2882460	2883040	You're not ugly.
2883080	2884301	You're Fox 2.0, remember?
2884321	2884881	You can't do it.
2884981	2887883	And besides that, you still owe me that screen capture so you can get my GameCube pen.
2888163	2889383	So sit your ass down.
2891324	2892345	We're going to be in trouble for that one.
2892785	2893225	Let's see.
2894165	2899308	Further machines set to five song attempts use only the sum of the last three songs for the record.
2900345	2903849	To be fair, I'm authorizing two different records to be tracked separately.
2904069	2907093	One for three song and one for five song submissions.
2907513	2910917	Most machines are set to a minute thirty to two minutes per song.
2912699	2914962	I didn't think time ever had anything to do with it, but whatever.
2915692	2916533	Let's see.
2917273	2923657	Further, there are several rest periods in between songs based on the actions you must do for the setting and song selection.
2924017	2928420	I have included my ruling on this with the TGTS information below.
2928480	2930841	So, Twin Galaxy, a little bit of Judge Judy action here.
2932042	2932882	They're making a ruling.
2932902	2936544	Because these guys have been around since the 80s, so they're old and sad.
2936584	2936925	Yeah.
2945527	2946808	I mean, it's sad.
2947228	2949549	They have no concept of how a DDR machine works.
2950129	2952190	How can they be considered an authority on something?
2952210	2952251	P.S.
2952291	2953051	Let me restate.
2953531	2959714	Since 1981, the worldwide authority on player rankings, gaming statistics, and championship tournaments.
2959734	2962256	They're pretty good at that for me to poop on.
2962936	2969279	I mean, you can't be an authority on something that you apparently know nothing about.
2969499	2969940	Let's see.
2970820	2971560	Let's keep going here.
2971800	2972461	I've got to finish this.
2973152	2982695	Speaking with Damien, as well as fellow DDR fan and Crazy Taxi World Champion, JC Padilla, because Crazy Taxi and DDR have so fucking much in common.
2982715	2984015	Because you use your feet on a button.
2985736	2989717	Because they both are utilized by ugly people in playing.
2992538	2994460	and also some other local expert players.
2996161	2999224	But you'll never be the world champion because you're not ugly like that.
3000666	3003268	I would love to know who the other local expert players were.
3003849	3009614	We picked up these random 8-year-olds from the kindergarten room.
3009654	3015420	We reasoned out the rules and you will see below in their entirety and hope to start logging some more scores on it soon.
3016244	3022926	One of the most important discoveries is the decision that gamers view using the same song up to five times in a row as cheesy.
3023786	3026026	So to be fair, my official ruling takes this into consideration.
3026066	3028247	So if you play five songs in a row, that's cheesy.
3030787	3032748	The chat room is going off on this, by the way.
3032968	3034288	I'll get to them in a minute.
3035168	3037069	The game itself is pretty intense.
3038211	3039412	Wow, that was intense!
3040052	3047157	And some players even brought their own combination water spray and fan handheld device to cool down in between performances.
3047217	3048358	Did they buy it at Walmart for $2?
3048738	3052541	Along with Goofy drinking hat filled with Sobe.
3056784	3059185	and elaborate entourage of people with fans.
3059265	3066928	I'm picturing one of these fucking dorks wearing those hats with this straw that goes right in their mouth, a little thing they can squeeze when they're in between songs.
3068769	3071490	This is sad.
3071550	3074611	I wonder if this guy did it playing like Dynamite Rave, love to me.
3075351	3075971	That would be funny.
3077712	3079973	I are Dynamite Raver world champion, yeah!
3082084	3087948	Though quite the physical game, I am told that players of all ages, shapes, and sizes have been able to perform well.
3088088	3091310	Even one player who I am told was in the 300 pound range.
3091771	3095213	It should also be noted that facial deformities do not affect gameplay at all.
3095373	3097715	So DDR doesn't discriminate against fat people.
3097775	3098495	That's good to know.
3099276	3102318	Definitely a game where both eye and foot coordination is required.
3102598	3103199	Well, duh.
3106993	3118922	So now here are the rules, and I would officially like to thank Damien Sarkoony for not only taking the initiative and becoming our first recognized and verified world champion, but to assist me with creating the rules.
3119983	3124566	So, basically, he made the rules, and he's the world champion.
3126267	3128469	Okay, okay, alrighty.
3129269	3131011	Is this like one of the editor's kids or something?
3134205	3134906	Anyway, the rules.
3135507	3136948	You want to read the rules, Jamie.
3136968	3137389	Go for it.
3137569	3138190	General rules.
3138791	3143116	First, player must be performing in single mode.
3143196	3143916	So no doubles.
3145478	3151362	Players can compete on either three-song or five-song machine setting variations, which is determined by the arcade proprietor.
3151562	3155444	Now, if I'm not mistaking, there's also a four-song machine, so those people are just fucked, huh?
3155745	3155965	Yep.
3156285	3156585	All right.
3156665	3160968	Referees must log the song difficulty and score per song for all three or five songs.
3160988	3161608	The referee.
3161628	3164150	Do they wear the black and white shirt, too, and make bad calls?
3165311	3168533	They walk around playing, you know, Blow My Whistle, Bitch, with their little whistles there.
3169894	3170615	Battle, dammit!
3171355	3175379	Force.
3175599	3180004	Players are allowed to utilize the entire duration of the game timers in between songs as rest.
3181505	3183627	This includes song selection and setting selection.
3183988	3184868	Okay, yay, whatever.
3185609	3185909	Fifth.
3186309	3189490	Players are allowed to utilize the same song no more than twice.
3189751	3194032	Oh, so they can play the same song twice, they just can't play it more than twice.
3194052	3196593	Regardless of whether playing three songs or five songs.
3196633	3198534	Oh my god, I'm gonna cry.
3198754	3199874	These people make me cry.
3200534	3203295	At this time... Twin Galaxies.
3203455	3207117	Twin Galaxies will not be tracking records on the Oni, a.k.a.
3207157	3207397	Hell.
3207497	3208737	First of all, that's incorrect.
3208877	3209858	Oni means ogre.
3210418	3213299	Anyway, Hell Mode, assuming I spelled that right.
3214119	3214979	Okay, they're stupid.
3215299	3216900	How can you misspell Oni?
3217520	3218300	O-N-I.
3218360	3219440	You can't misspell it.
3219500	3219781	God.
3219801	3221541	First of all, they mistranslated the damn thing.
3221621	3222881	Oni does not mean hell.
3224262	3224602	Okay.
3226282	3227843	You know, hell is what, Jigoku?
3228743	3229263	Aren't I correct?
3229283	3231003	Yeah.
3231304	3232644	Yeah, how does Jigoku sound like Oni?
3234184	3234444	Tell me.
3234624	3235045	Keep going.
3235925	3237385	Sorry, that's one of my pet peeves there.
3238165	3238746	Keep going, girl.
3238766	3239346	You go, girl.
3239446	3240386	Go on with your bad self.
3241684	3244885	All songs contained within the mix are eligible for selection.
3244985	3245826	I would hope so.
3247447	3248767	Which means Dynamite Rave!
3248847	3249487	Love to be!
3249547	3249968	Twice!
3250068	3250448	Yay!
3252068	3256710	The following rules are applicable for each of the three song or five song selections.
3256891	3260132	Only one of the settings, difficulty, can be the player's choice.
3260152	3264794	The rest are determined to be the official TG... Twin Galaxies scoreboard.
3265840	3268961	Difficulty player can choose between light, standard, or heavy.
3269401	3270601	Speed has to be on 1.
3271181	3271641	Easiest?
3271761	3273102	My butt!
3273122	3273842	1.5 is easier than 1.
3273882	3274822	Wait a minute!
3274862	3277263	They said speed has to be set to the easiest, which is 1.
3277503	3278923	I disagree with that.
3278943	3279363	My god!
3279903	3280483	Retards!
3280603	3281143	Retards!
3281464	3281924	I hate you.
3282324	3283764	If they say easiest, then I can play it on 1.5.
3283804	3285304	Because it's the easiest.
3287005	3287885	Boost set to off.
3288025	3289225	Appearance set to invisible.
3289745	3290766	Turn set to off.
3290946	3291766	Other set to off.
3293127	3294208	Scroll set to standards.
3294268	3296070	They don't say anything at all about three zeros.
3296090	3297792	So you can't do Dark Reverse, Jamie.
3297893	3298153	Sorry.
3298193	3299034	No Dark Reverse!
3299855	3302398	So why didn't they just say no modifiers?
3302458	3306002	Since that's pretty much what they're saying here except for difficulty.
3306122	3307084	No modifiers.
3307104	3307864	That's it.
3308846	3310287	Because there's no modifiers.
3310327	3310628	That's it.
3311004	3311964	This is going to get beautiful.
3312005	3312465	Keep going.
3312725	3313405	Keep going, Jamie.
3313885	3315386	It only gets better from here, folks.
3315426	3315746	Keep going.
3315766	3318528	The following rules apply to the scoring of the title.
3318748	3325871	The Twin Galaxies referee must log for tracking purposes the song selection difficulty chosen and final tally for each of three or five songs.
3326472	3330934	At the very end, the Twin Galaxies referee must manually tally the five song total.
3331234	3334115	The three song machines tally for you at the final score screen.
3334155	3334976	Okay, that's still stupid.
3336237	3341421	Note that the sum of the last three songs in the five-song selection are not simultaneously tracked as three-song record.
3342682	3352610	It is understood that as the five-song machines do not display the sum tally of all five songs at the end, that the discretion and integrity of the TG referee is accepted for such submissions.
3353211	3356053	Tenth, some song titles are listed in foreign wording.
3356093	3359616	For example, a song called... Okay, what the hell is wrong with them?
3361157	3364120	They put this... There's a song called Kamumei.
3365305	3368068	Okay, the song is fucking Kakumei.
3368248	3369330	It means revolution.
3370010	3372353	Okay, first of all... But you're allowed to play Kamumi.
3372974	3374275	You're allowed to play Kamumi.
3374655	3376858	Okay, you want to know what I'm going to do tonight?
3377599	3378840	Except that I have work tomorrow.
3378880	3379581	Yes, I got a job.
3379661	3383265	Anyway, I'm going to be drafting a letter to these stupid fucks.
3388192	3388792	I love this.
3389032	3392573	In the chat room right now, they're all going, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel.
3394393	3395673	Okay, these people are idiots.
3396233	3397494	I'm going to be drafting a letter.
3399314	3401614	Going item by item.
3402295	3403295	Why they are wrong.
3403675	3405135	Black Lab suggested the same thing.
3406015	3407075	He's with you on that.
3408616	3409856	You need to get a mob together.
3410396	3413317	What if we draft up, you know, we get a few people.
3413897	3415517	I'm talking, give me a speak on my phone.
3416589	3423212	We get the people together, we draft a letter, have all of us who were agreed with this sign it and send it in to them to let them know exactly how stupid they are.
3423412	3428795	By the way, if you all take screenshots of us playing the game and all beating that score... Bring the digital camera!
3430495	3434757	Well, we've got to keep going here because they have their specific rules submissions here.
3436158	3439519	We might just post about this later, so we're going to keep going with this.
3439539	3445002	It is the player's responsibility to inform the TG referee what the recognized name of such songs are because they're stupid.
3445692	3452697	Well, that being said, I look forward to refereeing future game attempts by Damien and anyone else wishing to compete in this highly popular modern arcade release.
3452997	3455759	And this person puts their stupid name on the site.
3456300	3456960	And their phone number.
3457981	3458801	Oh, oh.
3459202	3460342	And their email address.
3460382	3463345	By the way, he's the Star Wars arcade champion.
3464625	3466207	We should, do we have this link in the chatroom?
3466607	3473933	Unfortunately, yeah, I believe we did post this in the chatroom, but if they don't, I did say it was on twingalaxies.com, but if they want to see this article for themselves, there it is.
3474353	3475574	I just posted a link in the chatroom.
3476755	3478136	Uh, yeah, we gotta crank call this shit out.
3478216	3478676	No, I'm kidding.
3478716	3479457	Don't crank call.
3479557	3480378	Be professional.
3480818	3481819	Everybody, be professional.
3483796	3484977	I believe I was reading now.
3485017	3485717	It wasn't on this page.
3485757	3486878	I thought it was on this page.
3487178	3487878	But I guess it's not.
3488858	3490099	You can videotape it.
3490139	3492080	You can't take pictures because those could be altered.
3492300	3493340	But you can videotape it.
3493440	3496101	So all we've got to do is get a camera and we can videotape the whole thing.
3496521	3500783	I would be willing to go out there with a camera and tape one, both of you guys breaking the record.
3500803	3501243	That's fine.
3501843	3504444	And everybody in the chat room is already wanting to go do it too.
3504504	3505485	So they might beat us to it.
3505525	3509566	But if you guys want to be lazy, you don't want to bother with this, we're going to do it.
3510887	3511407	This week...
3512762	3519543	Watch as DarkSakura, Loki, and Sky all smash the world record and submit our videotape.
3519763	3520744	You in on this too, Bradley?
3522204	3522844	I don't know if I'm that good.
3524564	3527425	Bradley, Bradley, a five-year-old is that good.
3527465	3528525	You're that good, trust me.
3530226	3535307	Let me just add, I couldn't PA to save my life, so this ought to be interesting.
3535347	3537007	If I beat this, this guy really sucks.
3538866	3551589	so not only will you be seeing us all smashing the world record but we'll be submitting an open letter and we'll post about that on our website this week sometime we'll post where you can also add your name to the letter or something we'll figure something else
3552975	3563802	And if I could send them the link to Konami's 7th Mix ranking page, probably hundreds of people have already beaten that score.
3563942	3565923	A zillion people have beaten that score.
3565963	3567444	We should probably go ahead and get that pulled up.
3569686	3570346	You're going to pull up what?
3571627	3572448	What site are you pulling up?
3572468	3572969	Internet Ranking.
3573249	3574730	Oh, here, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3574750	3575130	Let me do that.
3577012	3581456	Actually, I wanted to check some of these private messages real fast because there's some things going on here.
3583318	3585380	Okay, nothing new there.
3585600	3588062	Playing it on one speed, you know, that's standard.
3588783	3589784	How is that hard?
3590404	3591365	You know, how is that hard?
3591865	3592246	I believe...
3594688	3598750	SoCal Kicks was already submitting a score at Bachelorette School.
3599110	3601391	No, that's only $185 million from what I see.
3601431	3604732	That wouldn't do it, but that's only... See, that's Max.
3604812	3605533	That's a problem.
3606173	3611935	Max 2 and Max grade differently, so you're not going to be able to get a score on Max that beats it because they grade completely differently.
3613116	3615537	But he just wants to show off that he's elite, so there you go.
3617898	3619839	Oh, and AaronJapan.com has some great stuff, too.
3626205	3636211	Black Lab wants to break the record too.
3636251	3637131	Black Lab, come with us.
3638272	3638792	You're local.
3638952	3640613	You can come with us and break the record with us.
3641153	3644875	So we're all going to break the world record and be the latest DDR players in history.
3645115	3649338	Okay, Black Lab's like, when and where?
3652380	3659826	If I had a video camera in this house, I would go out to Scandia tonight after the show because they don't close until 10 and we'd be able to make it out there.
3659886	3665530	But unfortunately, we'll have to do this tomorrow or sometime during the week and figure that out.
3665631	3669033	23rd Magus wants to point out a hedgehog sleeping in a wet paper bag could beat that score.
3669994	3670334	Fair enough.
3670714	3672916	So we want to pull up 7th Mixed Internet Ranking?
3673016	3673156	Yep.
3673357	3678861	The only problem with Internet Ranking, if I remember right, it tracks the percentages, right?
3678921	3679601	Not the actual scores?
3679641	3679942	I don't know.
3679982	3680282	Let's see.
3680882	3681523	Oh, it is scores.
3687901	3690502	Let's see, I have to find Max2, there it is.
3693163	3696504	Let's see, here's the Max2 site, and now I'm looking for internet ranking.
3697404	3698905	Help me read some Japanese here, there it is.
3700425	3702486	Here we go, Max internet ranking, ranky.
3703567	3705687	We're going to find out the real world champion here.
3707928	3711790	Let's see, what, do we hold up for one of these, one of those stuff, keep going, keep going, keep going?
3712430	3714050	What, just any one of these, or what?
3714671	3715511	Oh, they don't have scores!
3716562	3718523	Oh, they don't have the charts anymore, that's the problem.
3719303	3721323	Aw, well, shit on Konami.
3722504	3724244	Shit on Konami for not having the scores, oh well.
3724884	3726465	But trust me, they were much better than that.
3727805	3728465	We guarantee it.
3728966	3730446	Maybe, oh, maybe I can get it from up here.
3731746	3733527	Uh, don't do, uh, the Onis, keep going.
3734127	3734667	Where do I go?
3734687	3735447	Go down to these?
3735547	3736468	Down to those, yeah.
3736608	3737168	Okay, let's see.
3738380	3739002	Oh, there we go.
3739843	3746397	On one of these, let's see, 139,576,495, no that's not high enough, but these songs aren't hard enough.
3746417	3747399	I bet if I go down to like number 15...
3748800	3752583	Okay, here's a documented score right here.
3752603	3752583	401,845,325.
3752803	3760629	That already puts that other score to shame, so... All these other scores, look at that, they're all higher.
3760689	3763891	And this is a certain set of songs.
3763911	3765572	They're probably not even all nine-footers.
3765632	3769755	And actually... Those are probably just three songs.
3770135	3772657	No, actually, that's including the extra stages.
3772917	3774418	Oh, including the extra stages.
3775059	3776120	And Kakumei.
3776460	3776780	Wow.
3777481	3777721	Well...
3779201	3780368	Poo on Twin Galaxies
3781414	3785177	We're going to take a real quick break, but this break is going to be special.
3785217	3788399	We're going to play some original works during this break.
3788780	3791422	Loki has a new one he's going to play for us, so we're going to get that in.
3791862	3795064	And I wanted to get a new artist in who hasn't been featured on this show yet.
3795105	3796766	I just have to pull up his song here.
3797346	3803911	This is Takeout Kid, and he's got a song called, it looks like Donkey Kong Remix is the name of it.
3804372	3806493	Perhaps he'll elaborate on that in the chat room.
3806513	3807254	He's in there right now.
3807694	3809696	And we're going to play that creation by him.
3811481	3814445	and then we're going to... I wanted to plug his website.
3814465	3816448	He wanted me to plug his site for playing this.
3816608	3824638	His site, if you like what you hear, is at www.mp3.com slash liquidkid and he can post that in the chat room if he wants.
3825319	3825980	We're going to hear that.
3826798	3830820	and then we're going to hear another bit from Loki and you want to introduce the song that you're going to be doing, Loki?
3831320	3838703	Yeah, this was going to be an actual Paranoia remix but it didn't work out that way so it's something else entirely.
3839283	3842664	I think I was calling it like Shadow Style or something like that.
3842904	3853569	Okay, so we're going to do some originals this break and when we come back more talk and venting and the typical kind of anger you'd expect from Orange Lounge Radio.
3986643	3988805	Thanks for watching!
4013022	4013543	Thanks for watching!
4089732	4090476	Thanks for watching!
4168301	4169273	Thank you for watching
4294901	4299905	After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.
4300706	4304488	Undersedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.
4304989	4311314	Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UndersedationLive.org.
4334242	4335203	Thank you for watching!
4358917	4360398	Thank you for watching!
4376570	4378032	Thank you for watching!
4405470	4406391	Bitch, get a new song.
4429497	4431979	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
4432559	4435682	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 14.
4435742	4442867	And we've been going off on TwinGalaxies.com and their completely made-of-ass ranking system for Max 2.
4442927	4444448	There is one word, two syllables.
4444528	4444749	Yes.
4444869	4445349	Inane.
4446810	4450013	and we're all on a rampage to go beat that sometime this week.
4450073	4454296	Black Lab and Dark Tetsuya over the break, by the way, have also joined in on our campaign.
4454577	4457439	We are all going to go and smash the world record this week sometime.
4457919	4459701	And we're not doing it to be mean.
4459741	4461302	We're just, well, yeah, we're doing it to be mean.
4461842	4462483	I mean, I don't know.
4462803	4463764	We're doing it to make a point.
4466486	4467227	I mean, my God.
4468908	4473452	That's like saying, you know, I'm the best kid on the planet because my mommy loves me best.
4475316	4476418	Honestly, it's like, what's going on?
4476639	4478242	Anyway, yeah.
4478963	4480185	Follow up to last week.
4480265	4483651	Last week we were going off about Naoki's diary.
4483671	4486637	Today I decided I wanted to be a woman.
4488547	4492490	and all sorts of fun dear diaries were submitted by the chatroom.
4492910	4493350	What the hell?
4493390	4494231	Let's take some more.
4494531	4496953	If you guys in the chatroom have more diaries... It's been a week.
4497213	4506980	If you have some more diary entries, if you think Naoki has some more diary things that he's written that he's maybe just not sharing with us, give us some diary entries.
4507020	4508140	Submit them to us in the chatroom.
4508160	4512523	Just send me a PM, your best Naoki diary entry, and we'll read some more tonight.
4513804	4516546	Rob, I don't think that they can see that you're waving your hand.
4516746	4517587	It's like, come on...
4518234	4547215	Wave of hand bringing towards me By the way In defense of Rob Because I can read the kana in it In Naoki's diary It did have Be-Mani Spelled out with the kana Be, the extending kana Ma, and Ni So it's Be-Mani According to Naoki, it's Be-Mani Be-Mani Radio Program So don't be a bee-itch about it
4549280	4553584	Alright, let's read what Naoki wrote this last week in his diary, shall we say?
4553604	4554184	Your diary.
4554405	4558589	I've decided to let Paul Oteri write the music and I'm gonna sing!
4558609	4561812	You could probably do a better job.
4563714	4564394	Naoki's diary.
4564795	4567077	Time has... Oh wait, we need some music, don't you think?
4567857	4568738	Let's find some music.
4568818	4572182	Let's find some good Naoki music.
4572522	4573543	Let's do Journey to Wonderland.
4574784	4576485	Let's make that be Naoki's diary.
4576825	4578066	It's not a Naoki song, but it's funny.
4578507	4579227	That's what's important.
4585832	4586732	Time has gone.
4587433	4589995	These days, music games are as common as dirt.
4590535	4595478	But when DDR started in 1998, DDR seemed like the hardest thing in the world to work on.
4595979	4599781	Even looking back on it today, I feel exhausted just to try to remember it.
4600282	4602844	Now it feels like a sleeping memory deep in my heart.
4604193	4606395	That's going to be the next Naoki song, by the way, deep in my heart.
4607075	4608256	Yeah, there was still in my heart.
4608596	4611699	And, you know, deep and dive and whatever.
4613720	4615141	Dive into the butt.
4617222	4621645	When we began work on DDR, I started writing four pieces of music for the game.
4622165	4635713	But as production advanced and the public waited for the release of DDR, only one of my songs, Paranoia, was included in the game, and a major collaboration was formed with Hoshiba EMI's Dance Mania compilation series in order to provide the rest of the music.
4636254	4638935	Now, if I remember correct, wasn't Brilliant to you in the first DDR?
4639296	4640777	Did he just... Oh, it's just 1.5?
4641877	4643598	Uh, hello, what about Trip Machine?
4643798	4644979	That's still him anyways.
4645419	4645680	Oh, wait!
4646520	4648181	He's not Desire.
4649782	4650702	Not Desire.
4651662	4652002	Whatever.
4652063	4654243	Naoki's getting forgetful as he's getting old.
4654824	4655724	He's got Alzheimer's.
4657545	4662167	Technically it wasn't the Naoki personality, it was the Desire personality that wrote that song.
4662187	4664348	So obviously he wouldn't have a recollection of that one.
4667688	4668149	Let's see.
4668709	4674212	The other songs were put on the shelf, and although I was the only person in the world to hear them, they didn't go to waste.
4674572	4680115	The DDR Max 2 song, D2R, was based on some of the songs left out of the original DDR game.
4680175	4680816	D2R!
4681116	4681736	D2R!
4686999	4687159	Ah!
4688520	4690641	There's more that's going to sound like brilliant to you.
4693467	4706964	You may think of Paranoia as a song that most people fondly remember, but in fact it was something I was forced to make under many restrictions.
4707545	4710949	The end result is a song that felt very underground slash urban.
4712412	4714514	These days, my music is very different.
4715134	4726844	The Royal Route high-energy dance songs, such as Brilliant To You, Can't Stop Falling In Love, etc., are my new forte, and although I much prefer them, the underground style was a projection point in terms of my music.
4726944	4729246	Rob, when was Brilliant To You a new style?
4729507	4730007	Wasn't that like 1.5?
4730287	4732629	He's talking about 1.5, though.
4732669	4735672	No, but he's like, my new style was Brilliant To You.
4735752	4736533	I know, I know.
4736793	4737393	I know, Dave, I know.
4738494	4743341	These days I still try to develop the underground style using the Revenge and Desire labels.
4744302	4748507	Paranoia, Trip Machine, and Make It Better appeared in DDR Internet Ranking Kit.
4750491	4754974	1.5, and with every maiden voyage, trial, error, and conflict always appeared from time to time.
4755454	4764441	Although my music has moved on and evolved, I still look back on these three songs and realize that if they hadn't existed, much of my current music wouldn't be possible.
4764842	4771947	In the grand scale of things, these songs are very important to me in my career, especially when I remember the pressure I was under when I produced them.
4774509	4779473	With the songs completed, and DDR only... Is that Taco Bell coming back up or something there, Jamie?
4781152	4795743	With the songs completed and DDR only several months from release, I took a deep breathe and prepared to face the next challenge, DDR second mix.
4797024	4800807	Let's read some of the submitted things, shall we?
4803830	4804210	That was it.
4805171	4805491	That was it.
4806380	4810944	Oh, it also revealed that the Max 3 song, there's going to be a B4U song called Graduation.
4811004	4811344	Hooray.
4813966	4814907	Shock of shocks.
4814967	4816428	Oh my god, B4U and Max 3.
4816468	4822052	I was expecting that.
4822112	4826316	Naoki himself, which I believe is just the 23rd Magus Disguise, but we won't say anything.
4826696	4835263	Naoki himself says, Dear Diary, my newest song is called Dynamite Afronova BD24UR Trip Machine Deeper and Deeper Eternal Rebirth Evolution KZ Dirty Mix.
4836377	4836957	Wow!
4838298	4839258	I'll buy that for a dollar.
4841019	4842720	DJ Konami says this.
4842980	4846322	Dear Diary, I've made a kickin' tune for the next DJ Konami tune.
4846382	4848103	He seemed kind of reluctant to use it, though.
4849324	4852345	Dear Diary, more B4U crap coming soon in Max 3.
4852545	4852985	Enjoy!
4853646	4855907	Dear Diary, I am done with the extra states for Max 3.
4856167	4857048	It is called Max 3.
4857788	4859529	I am the king of the originality.
4861650	4864612	Dear Diary, I make music so people like me.
4864632	4865313	Thanks, you, bye.
4883853	4892322	TwinSenses, Dear Diary, today I earned the world record in DDR Max 2 with a score of 315,802,020 points.
4892822	4895425	I am the best because my mommy and Paula Terry love me.
4895485	4895945	Praise me!
4897727	4898047	Biter.
4899028	4901531	SoCalKicks submits a follow-up to last week.
4902131	4905775	Dear Diary, my English, I would like to know what this blow is.
4908673	4913195	And if you missed last week's show, you're just going to have to wait 11 weeks for it to turn up in the rebroadcast.
4913496	4917958	Dear Naoki, to find out what the blow is, take your vacuum cleaner and stick it on your groin.
4918438	4919539	Press the on button.
4919679	4921520	She's gone from suck to blow.
4924214	4926216	Dear Diary, I hate my life and want to die
4946973	4950237	Well, after he told me I still wanted it, I knew he would do a better job than Paula.
4951238	4952259	Oh, okay.
4952640	4953581	Thank you, SirDuckX.
4958025	4962250	Dartetsuya says, Dear Diary, I'm having B4U remixed Let Them Move for DDR Max 3.
4962670	4963071	Hooray.
4964492	4968537	Then it would be even more out of tune, just with more people singing it.
4969949	4971470	How about a sim update, Loki?
4971490	4973572	You want to talk about what's going on in the sim world?
4973833	4975954	Yeah, actually quite a bit's going to be happening next week.
4976315	4980859	We have the site opening again of Team Guilo, so they're going to be coming up on Tuesday.
4981459	4983902	So everyone look for that on October 1st there.
4984422	4987144	I don't know what the website's going to be, probably Team Guilo, but...
4988254	4990615	I don't know yet, because they haven't really gotten a host name.
4990635	4992016	So, we'll have to wait for that.
4992116	4997218	And then also, I've heard rumors that the Melting Pot's going to be coming back up in about a couple weeks, too.
4997238	4999079	So, we'll have to watch for that.
5000059	5003080	Other than that, still waiting for StepMania Beta 6.
5004301	5008622	DWI, it's been quiet, so don't know anything coming out for that.
5008782	5009583	Don't really care.
5010243	5011364	Kind of abandoned them.
5011824	5015025	Other than that, there is some major news.
5016206	5017166	The Tourney Mix 2's done.
5018081	5019602	and we have results somewhere.
5019982	5020743	We can pull them up.
5022343	5023424	Oh, I suppose I can do that.
5023864	5024945	We had some locals win.
5025005	5026626	I'm excited for them.
5026706	5029828	We need to get them on the show so they can brag.
5034707	5035007	DJ DropForce
5066347	5072229	SoDeep Wire Remix was third place, and that was done by the Sacramento's Agent Chang.
5072789	5073389	Woo!
5073989	5074949	Yes, we're playing favorites.
5075009	5075949	Congratulations.
5077870	5084531	For standard, the official placing was Klung Klung 1655 from Keyboard Mania.
5084551	5085171	That got first.
5085191	5087412	That was some of the Seattle folks that did that, I believe.
5087432	5090752	I don't remember the exact names, but I just know they're on that board over there.
5090772	5092573	Second place was Flying to Your Soul.
5092893	5093633	I have no idea.
5094373	5099175	and third place was The Great Giana Sisters, which was pretty good from what I played.
5100375	5105317	Now Public, this is what was actually voted on by the users themselves and not the judges.
5105718	5110539	First place went to So Deep Choir Remix, which was, you know, our Agent Chang.
5111560	5112580	Second place was Heaven.
5113301	5116242	Third place was QQQ, and that was done by...
5117782	5130166	Mooglehunter, Standard, The Great Gianna Sisters, 1 for 1st, M, The Fake 8th Style Song, 1 for 2nd, and Klung Klung 1655, 1 for 3rd.
5134367	5134747	Woohoo!
5135428	5136829	Congratulations to all the winners!
5136929	5143754	Um, Tourney Mix 3 is gonna be, has been announced for December, they're gonna be doing that, so rules and stuff will be coming out in November.
5144475	5145035	So look at that.
5146056	5147197	Uh... Congrats you!
5148117	5155183	Hold on, SoCalKicks had a, uh, his diary entry got chopped up, that's why it didn't make much sense, so I'm going to, uh, pull up the rest of his diary entry.
5155243	5158445	He sent it over... Ooh.
5158725	5158865	Ah!
5158985	5160747	I opened up a picture of Jenny Rom, my bad.
5160987	5162308	I was about to say, I'm scared.
5162668	5163108	Let's see.
5163668	5163909	Okay.
5164249	5167030	Dear Diary, this is from SoCalKicks, Naoki Diary.
5167350	5170391	Dear Diary, my hipster experimentation did not go as well as planned.
5170471	5175553	Paula begged me not to go, saying she would give me this blow and that she could do a better job.
5175834	5179155	But the way she said it, I don't even think that she knows what this blow is anyway.
5179455	5183517	So I continued to go seek this white American who was going to give me the true form of this blow.
5183837	5187779	Well, I quickly made it to Northern California where this orange site is based, so it says.
5188139	5190039	And my research finally led me to an address.
5190139	5191120	I knocked on the door and said...
5191500	5195042	Yes, I am American hipster, knows Naoki, before I finish the rest of my English.
5195362	5196823	I would like to know what this blow is.
5197163	5198544	Well, after he told me, I still wanted it.
5198624	5200025	I knew he would do a better job than Paula.
5201566	5203147	Thanks, G. Thanks.
5206529	5207369	Shine get!
5207909	5210511	I get random, I get these random PMs for people.
5210591	5212212	I just got one that says shine get.
5212872	5213753	These people are weird.
5215425	5220748	So now your little thing under your name on the website could be, gives a better blow than Politary.
5221309	5222269	Oh, maybe we should do that.
5223390	5225552	Better blowing than Pol... Can you arrange that for me, Jamie?
5225852	5226332	Alright, thank you.
5227413	5229194	Oh, Pyro Man sent another one before he left.
5229394	5231976	Dear Santa, I want a new Politary for Christmas.
5233977	5239020	I hate you.
5239380	5240861	I think that Politary's a fembot.
5242082	5243463	You think Politary's a fembot, huh?
5245282	5245662	Damn it.
5245922	5246643	You know what we just did?
5246663	5249745	We just opened the door for people to send us random shit over private message.
5249805	5253907	Her along with the B4U girls and Jenny Rom.
5253967	5254628	They're all friends.
5254668	5255868	Especially Jenny Rom.
5257309	5257629	Yeah.
5258530	5260331	Alright, we're going to take a quick... Yes.
5260971	5261372	Yes, Loki.
5261472	5261632	Yes.
5263041	5264843	New DDRPC characters.
5265263	5266684	What the hell were they thinking?
5266925	5268206	It's the gay and lesbian team.
5268626	5269527	I don't know if you noticed.
5269547	5271829	It's like bondage goth people.
5271929	5274291	I don't even know what the hell it is.
5274872	5275912	The chick's a total dyke.
5275932	5279976	I don't know about the guy, but I'm just assuming it's the gay and lesbian team for DDRPC.
5280016	5280777	Hold on, let me pull it up.
5282178	5282979	It's very scary.
5285892	5295457	I'm going to konamihwi.com slash ddrpc because that's where I can download all the newest and greatest characters.
5301281	5305963	And I'm going to link that in the chat room for you folks because I like you.
5307744	5310266	And they are called Kobe and Nikki.
5310646	5311987	And you can see Kobe is a cop.
5313857	5315697	And Nicky's just a dyke.
5316017	5317178	I don't know how else to explain Nicky.
5317238	5321099	Yeah, but I didn't know cops wore spiked hats with little skulls.
5321119	5322559	And he's already got the handcuffs on.
5322679	5323859	He's already ready to bust you.
5323899	5325079	I'm going to tie you up.
5325099	5326560	I'm going to tie you up.
5328620	5331981	And he's wearing bubbles on his shirt.
5332221	5337882	Yeah, the next four characters are all like, the construction worker is the next one.
5337902	5342203	Yeah, we're waiting for the construction worker, then the Indian, then we're going to have the leather daddy.
5343874	5346155	I bet you anything the Jason Enos one's going to be Leather Daddy.
5347436	5348016	No.
5348296	5349157	I'm just teasing.
5349717	5350057	No.
5350177	5352898	But the rumor is that the Jason Enos one's going to be the last character.
5352998	5355920	It's been spread like wildfire everywhere.
5356620	5356960	We'll see.
5357481	5357821	We'll see.
5359702	5364824	Of course, the chat room's saying that Kobe and Nikki are probably supposed to be ravers or clubbers.
5366145	5368186	Yeah, big gay ravers and clubbers.
5370932	5373614	And apparently Jenny Rom... Jenny Rom is a sliver slut.
5375676	5376316	Sliver slut.
5380420	5389728	Okay, we're going to take a real... Oh, do you want to... Well, okay, we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and by popular demand in the chat room, they're begging us to do it tonight because we haven't done it in a few weeks.
5389968	5391810	We're going to do a listless segment tonight for you guys.
5392270	5392711	We're going to do...
5393877	5394577	Yeah, we're going to do that.
5394757	5405240	And then at the end of the show, Jamie's going to give us the update on the big, big, big tournament we're going to do here in Sacramento that Orange Lounge is one of the many co-sponsors of called Shaft.
5405360	5410202	Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament, and Jamie's got all the details for you guys.
5410402	5413283	By the way, DJ Konami, no Kyle Snyder, please.
5413971	5416472	There's going to be no Kyle Snyder character in DDRPC, sorry.
5417213	5422995	We're going to be doing the DDR shaft update before the end of the show.
5423015	5427217	We're also going to do list list for best B-Mani artist.
5427597	5429278	So we'll be making our list during this break.
5430799	5431539	So stick around.
5432300	5433900	Stay for our break before we break you.
5434681	5436442	Stick around because we're going to be right back.
5436902	5437602	Break down.
5438062	5438663	Break down.
5438723	5441344	In fact, I'm saying stick around so much I think I'm just going to play that.
5500193	5501956	Thanks for watching!

5749642	5754386	From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!
5754827	5756688	Holla!
5756908	5759471	P.S.
5760271	5769519	TTPO You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 14, and we're getting ready to do our list list.
5769539	5770820	We're kind of having a little bit of debate.
5772156	5780644	During the break, while people were trying to make our lists here in the studio, trying to think if a singer should be considered a Bamani artist.
5780664	5782805	Like, could you say Sana on your list?
5783306	5786729	So, Brad was in here kind of... You've got to talk into the mic.
5787830	5793495	Or something like Paula Terry, because she doesn't, as far as I know, doesn't write anything.
5794075	5795116	I still count performers.
5795917	5796377	Yeah, exactly.
5796718	5798159	I wouldn't consider them an artist.
5798179	5798439	Okay.
5799938	5800759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5821371	5822191	of erotic dancing.
5822652	5825853	And, you know, even though she doesn't really write her stuff.
5826513	5828874	I have to make one quick amendment to the sim update, too.
5829494	5832035	Feet of Fury was pushed back to October 15th.
5832095	5833415	That's the Dreamcast one.
5833675	5836476	And there is a video on the site over at CAgames.com.
5836836	5837456	Looks interesting.
5837496	5839697	Kind of looks like Disney's Dance Magic mode a little bit.
5840177	5841678	It's going to be interesting.
5842558	5843558	It's an interesting idea, anyway.
5844098	5844558	So here we go.
5844598	5845099	We're doing a list.
5845119	5846539	Who's participating in today's list?
5846599	5847119	I know I am.
5847179	5847699	Jamie is.
5848040	5848560	Loki is.
5848700	5849140	And Bradley?
5850003	5850483	Bradley is.
5851003	5851863	Oh, Brad, you're doing one, too?
5852244	5853924	Okay, well, then we've got five people on the list today.
5854864	5855844	It'll be a fat, big list.
5855884	5857085	No, we're doing three choices apiece.
5857105	5857585	You got three?
5858565	5859465	You better hurry up, Brad.
5859885	5860826	I'll do you last, okay?
5861346	5861706	Ooh.
5862446	5863426	Not like that.
5863626	5864286	Not like that.
5866787	5867047	Boy.
5867447	5867727	All right.
5869688	5870588	Jamie, let's start with you.
5870628	5874329	What's your number three pick for favorite Bomani performer ever, ever, ever?
5874789	5875449	Osama Kubota.
5875829	5876989	Osama Kubota.
5877009	5878710	Osamu.
5878730	5879290	Do not insult him.
5884338	5884978	Any reasons why?
5885839	5886439	Presto.
5887039	5888039	Need I say anything more?
5888059	5888560	All right.
5888580	5889160	Presto.
5889740	5890180	Fair enough.
5890200	5895262	And not to mention his Nanbe Mani stuff is absolutely gorgeous.
5896042	5896342	You know?
5898043	5901744	Yeah, I kind of forgot that it's performed.
5901764	5906306	It's not... Because, you know, Presto is like a famous song.
5907026	5907466	Classical.
5908086	5911208	I'm still referring to his rendition of it.
5911428	5911848	Yeah, I know.
5911868	5912128	That's fine.
5914139	5914459	Next.
5916580	5918621	Chat room is... Okay, never mind.
5918641	5920182	They're settling that debate in there internally.
5920202	5923003	Somebody was saying Osamu Kobota is a girl, but it's a guy with long hair.
5923623	5924443	Yeah, it's a guy with long hair.
5925844	5926324	All right, Loki.
5926364	5928225	Yeah, it's a guy's name.
5928485	5929566	Loki, your number three choice.
5929986	5930586	Ryo Nagumi.
5931406	5931807	I'm sorry?
5932087	5932567	Naguma.
5933567	5934228	Nagumo.
5934428	5935008	Whatever.
5935808	5937069	You got to spell that for me, buddy.
5939295	5942416	Brad, spell that for me so I can type it.
5943116	5949719	That is R-E-O space N-A-G-U-M-O.
5950299	5950959	And what did they do?
5952200	5952500	Everything.
5952864	5956526	He did 20 November and all those kickass things.
5956667	5957867	Instant love.
5957987	5959248	Alright, alright, fair enough.
5959268	5960149	My bad.
5962070	5964732	They're saying that's DJ Naguro, same person.
5965072	5973438	However, we did make the rule in here that people's multiple egos would not fall under their name.
5973678	5975779	So Naoki will not count for everything.
5975839	5980382	You either gotta put Revenge or Naoki Underground or whatever.
5980763	5982124	Naoki doesn't count for everything.
5984185	5986406	Okay, yes, Brad, you got a number three choice yet?
5986466	5987187	No, we're going to Bradley.
5987267	5987887	Bradley, number three.
5988467	5989228	I will say Revenge.
5990468	5991949	Revenge, because you like all their songs.
5992229	5992730	Good choice.
5994331	6004356	And Revenge is the extra stage song, the special extra stage song, if you like AAA or 7, maybe it has to be a flashing 7, another.
6005097	6006738	It's called Sakura.
6006878	6010260	It's a spritule, because they misspelled it.
6012023	6013324	Any comments from DarkSakura?
6013584	6016046	I'm never going to be able to play that damn song.
6018347	6018648	All right.
6018728	6023631	My number three choice, and this should come as no surprise for me, but maybe that I put it so low on my list.
6024011	6026353	Number three, Erotic, of course.
6027594	6029175	Bestest Bomani band ever.
6029215	6031256	Well, third bestest Bomani band ever.
6031357	6032197	I don't care what you say.
6033778	6037621	Chatroom is begging that one of us put down Jenny Rom.
6037681	6038121	I don't know.
6038261	6039482	I don't know if anybody will see.
6039923	6040383	All right, Brad.
6042825	6051553	Okay, well, since Matt got my number three, Riro Nagumo, I'm going to have to go with Naoki Naoki, alright Any particular reason why?
6052774	6063563	Well, it was neck and neck with Taka, DJ Taka and Naoki But I think Naoki's been more responsible for a lot more of my favorite songs, so Alrighty, fair enough
6064784	6066785	Alright, that's our number three choices.
6066885	6067846	On to the number twos.
6067906	6068266	Jamie.
6068727	6073309	Number two, well, I have a list here, and I'm thinking and thinking and thinking.
6073610	6074750	I'm actually going to say Bus Stop.
6075311	6075891	Bus Stop.
6076291	6081655	Because, okay, I like Long Train Runnin', and I liked, you know, Kick the Can.
6081855	6083656	I really liked it when it was new.
6084817	6086798	And I really dig their remixes.
6086818	6090160	You know, they take some of the things you don't really expect and make really good remixes.
6091121	6093062	Hey, I'm going to defend for you, uh...
6094372	6094672	Na-na-na-na
6107406	6113189	Don't forget about how many people were trying to do the Pee Wee Herman Tequila dance.
6114269	6115290	Very true, very true.
6115810	6117190	All right, Loki, your number two pick.
6117591	6121452	My number two pick has to go with Desire, because I love Chirp Machine.
6121492	6122253	Desire.
6122673	6123373	Sounds fun.
6123753	6126354	So we got Revenge and Desire both on this list.
6126374	6126995	That'll be interesting.
6129256	6130456	Bradley, your number two pick.
6131477	6131897	Good Cool.
6132477	6133158	Good Cool.
6133238	6134278	That's a good choice.
6134658	6135118	Good Cool.
6135178	6136199	Good Call on Good Cool.
6137774	6139135	Alright, my number two choice.
6139215	6140195	Any particular reason why?
6140295	6140696	Good, cool?
6141096	6142056	Oh, they have a lot of good songs.
6143177	6143597	Fair enough.
6145118	6146559	I do not want the nerd that fell on the floor.
6146599	6147039	You can eat it.
6149360	6153983	My number two choice, of course, duh, Orange Lounge.
6154323	6154643	Hello.
6156764	6158265	Orange Lounge is my number two choice.
6158845	6160405	And, come on, duh.
6161186	6162186	I don't have to explain why.
6162266	6163647	If I have to explain why, you're a retard.
6163967	6165027	Brad, you're number two choice.
6165247	6166228	Why is it your favorite?
6166668	6167668	I really do dig their song.
6167688	6172550	I mean, not only did it make a catchy title for the show, but obviously we picked it because they've got some good shit.
6172570	6174671	Like, Mobomoga's a great song, retrospective song.
6174971	6175631	And the videos.
6175731	6177252	I think the videos have a lot to do with it.
6177272	6177952	They're cute!
6178212	6179673	Alright, yes, Orange Lounge, rules.
6180073	6182034	Anyway, Brad, you're number two choice.
6182114	6183474	What are we doing here?
6183554	6185235	Okay, my number two is Akira Yamaoka.
6186251	6191273	Ah, good one, Akira Yamaoka, except for 250 BPM, but... Akira.
6191673	6193833	Yeah, spell the last name for me, I don't want to F it up.
6195814	6198135	Yeah, Y-A-M-A, okay.
6199515	6202096	Okay, any other, any particular reason why?
6203356	6208478	Pretty much everything Akira Yamaoka has done, yeah, I feel, oh my god, that's a great song.
6208738	6214680	But, yeah, pretty much everything, except, you're right, 250 BPM is kind of a shit song, but everything else has been wonderful.
6214800	6215420	Okay, there you go.
6215960	6218221	Alright, Jamie, number one pick.
6218301	6220562	This will come as a surprise to absolutely no one.
6220962	6222302	This is my number one choice.
6222982	6223342	Tack.
6224203	6226263	Rob had it typed out before I said it.
6227084	6233006	For people who know me, I have been quoted as saying that if I don't marry Dan, I'm going to marry Tack or Margaret Cho.
6233046	6236887	So, that's basically... Fair enough.
6237407	6243409	You know, everything he's done, except for stoic, has made me absolutely orgasmic.
6243717	6248180	Yeah, but Tech has Tran as it shows in the Stoic video.
6249121	6250162	He's his girlfriend now.
6250342	6253524	But Stoic is boring.
6254345	6255505	Stoic is a boring song.
6256506	6257987	And the video is kind of boring too.
6258087	6265412	However, every other thing he's done, especially like his... I've been listening to a lot of that song, what is it, Bar Morgengrau?
6266653	6269836	That song is really awesome.
6269876	6271757	Chatroom is arguing with you on Stoic.
6273544	6274324	This is my opinion.
6274424	6275566	I don't care for stoic.
6276307	6278068	However, Gravity is awesome.
6278129	6278989	There's Schlagwerk.
6280731	6281052	Holic.
6283324	6290665	The thing is, I had the site up on Sekbimani.com, however, it's gone.
6290685	6292566	I need to find what the new official tag site is.
6293026	6297207	Last I checked, he had five of his original pieces for download.
6299067	6306468	If you can't find the site, for people who actually know me, I'll make sure that they're made available since he had them up public on his site.
6306648	6307408	Cool.
6307528	6310749	23rd Magus would like you to know that Tomorrow Perfume makes a mess of pants.
6313647	6315608	Loki, your number one pick.
6317730	6318651	Let's see here.
6318671	6322693	I don't know.
6322773	6323674	You didn't write this down.
6323714	6324795	You're just pulling this out of your ass here.
6324815	6328698	Well, no, I see what Brad has, and I don't want to say it because that was going to be my number one pick.
6328738	6329378	All right, what's yours?
6330139	6331259	No, no, you can keep yours.
6331780	6333481	So I'm going to have to go with...
6339756	6340316	Oh, what the hell?
6340376	6342418	I'm going to pick one that's going to get eliminated anyways.
6342698	6342918	What?
6343098	6345139	I'm going with NW260.
6345480	6346220	NW260?
6347001	6347281	What?
6347301	6349122	The number one of a money band?
6350062	6351603	Oh my god, you lose.
6351904	6352844	You lose.
6355106	6355706	Dropout.
6356586	6357047	That's it.
6357687	6357947	Good.
6357967	6358508	You lost.
6358728	6359428	You lose.
6359468	6361630	Can I get all the numbers and all the Roman numerals?
6361930	6363211	All the Roman, like, you know.
6364311	6365192	I want all the numbers.
6366816	6367717	Alright, whatever.
6368458	6370400	Wait, wait, wait.
6370560	6371401	You changed your mind?
6371481	6372782	Alright, he changed his mind.
6373683	6375585	Goodbye, NW260.
6375625	6377046	We're going to put in a real one here.
6377467	6380730	Let's go with Captain Jack.
6381551	6382331	Captain Jack!
6382492	6383693	Good idea, Captain Jack.
6385715	6386756	And why do you like Captain Jack?
6388573	6391077	because, I don't know, because he sucks.
6391437	6391778	Whatever.
6394141	6394422	Alright.
6395203	6395543	Whatever.
6395864	6397606	He does have that butt-ugly hoochie model with him.
6399695	6402536	I thought you didn't like ugly people, what's up with that?
6402716	6407376	I didn't like Captain Jack, but his Captain Jack video had a lot of women in wet t-shirts.
6407456	6408897	Oh, good point.
6409337	6412477	Now, chat room is getting very angry with us on our choices here.
6413198	6415798	There's some interesting things that haven't turned up yet, so we'll see.
6416618	6417118	Change mine.
6417338	6418799	No, come on, you just said it.
6418939	6420019	What do you want to change it to?
6420419	6420799	Taka.
6421379	6421819	Taka?
6422899	6425700	Oh, okay, wait, let's see if somebody else does it.
6425760	6426720	Let's see if somebody else does it.
6428760	6429981	Okay, next one is Bradley.
6430722	6433384	I was originally going to say Taka, but of course she took it, so I'll say DJ Taka.
6433804	6434765	DJ Taka, all right.
6435646	6438769	I was going to be very surprised if Taka didn't turn up somewhere, but there it is.
6438869	6441891	Bradley put down Taka as his number one choice.
6443012	6446856	My number one choice, Vincent Damore.
6447196	6447776	No question.
6447816	6454182	Vincent Damore is my absolute favorite Bomani artist, and if you don't like that, you can suck it.
6455103	6455623	That's a good one.
6456064	6456364	All right.
6457679	6459000	Brad, your number one choice.
6459200	6467107	Well, since I knew, you know, before that Jamie was going to pick TAC, so, because that would have been my first, because everything TAC comes out with makes me cream.
6467147	6468848	You all have this game rigged.
6469328	6471630	You all are picking what the others are going to pick.
6471650	6476174	So, instead of TAC, I picked LED, because also everything TAC ever does makes me cream.
6476234	6477275	Oh, good pick, good pick, LED.
6477335	6478376	I cream them in the...
6480896	6487438	JB punches us all for not putting Jenny Rom on the list somewhere.
6490119	6492139	Jenny Rom's the new SmileDK, haven't you heard?
6492159	6497801	I would like to thank you all for not putting SmileDK on the list.
6499162	6500762	Please, what does Jenny Rom do?
6500782	6502283	Uh, Waka Laka.
6503163	6505003	Oh, wow.
6506224	6506864	Waka Laka...
6508267	6508968	All right, all right.
6509689	6510329	Yell about it.
6510730	6511410	Yell about it.
6511591	6513012	Now, this is going to be hard.
6513532	6517076	Anything that gets taken off this list is going to cause some people to get nasty.
6517556	6519018	So this is going to be a fun one.
6519518	6520299	Okay, here we go.
6520359	6521961	This is the full list we've got so far.
6522001	6531350	We have Usamo Kubota, Reo Nagumo, Revenge, Erotic, Naoki, Bus Stop, Desire, Good Cool, Orange Lounge, Akira Yamaoka,
6532324	6537729	Yamaoka, Tak, Captain Jack, Taka, Vincent Damore, and L.E.D.
6538269	6539270	This is going to be tricky.
6539831	6544515	And Naoki just encompasses stuff that goes under Naoki, nothing else, right?
6545115	6545916	Yes, you got it.
6548732	6554534	Right, but we'll remember, well, that's... Naoki Underground is still Naoki, so we should go with that.
6555154	6560395	I'm not talking about, like, Desire as in Naoki or other Naoki monikers, but Naoki Underground is still Naoki.
6560515	6561435	Alright, well, we'll see.
6561475	6562196	We'll see what happens.
6562216	6563696	We'll go ahead and start our vote off the list.
6563756	6564836	Alright, Jamie, take it off.
6565036	6565476	What's going?
6565676	6567337	I hate shirt machines, so take off Desire.
6567757	6569419	Desire is off the list.
6569459	6573904	There is only one version of Trip Machine that I've liked, and that's the jungle one.
6574344	6574705	All right.
6574745	6576146	This is going to get dirty.
6576186	6577688	I mean, this is going to be bad.
6577768	6578148	All right.
6578409	6579230	All right, Matt.
6579350	6579950	What's going on?
6582153	6582653	Let's see.
6583875	6585036	Say goodbye, Naoki.
6585577	6586097	You suck.
6586518	6588320	Naoki is coming off the list.
6589358	6590179	I'm not surprised.
6590339	6594442	Dear Diary, today some guy in America is going to be off the list.
6594583	6596224	Dear Diary, I hate America.
6597125	6599107	My feelings are hurt, so I took a bubble bath.
6599147	6600187	Calcutta, take me away.
6603510	6603831	Bradley.
6604271	6605332	Bradley, what's coming up?
6605868	6610809	Well, since he's only done one song in all of Omani, Captain Jack's.
6611929	6612089	Oh!
6612409	6613549	One song in all of Omani?
6613789	6614910	He's one of the major people.
6614930	6620411	The Race, Little Boy, Captain Jack, In the Navy.
6620531	6622111	Is it still going?
6622171	6622931	Is that still your point?
6623251	6624571	Alright, Captain Jack's gone.
6625532	6626792	Goodbye, Captain Jack.
6630292	6633013	Oh, God, this is hard.
6642744	6643405	This is hard.
6643525	6644245	I really don't know.
6652210	6656133	This is hard, but I'm going to have to take Akira Yamakawa off the list.
6657374	6658574	And Brad has a heart attack.
6659615	6660896	Alright, Brad.
6663343	6663883	What's left?
6663903	6664604	Your last one.
6664744	6665484	There's no revenge.
6665904	6666525	Oh, wait, wait.
6666665	6667585	Yep, there it is.
6667605	6668106	Hey.
6668886	6669546	Goodbye, erotic.
6670767	6671768	Oh, you asshole.
6671828	6672448	I hate you.
6672628	6673369	I hate you.
6673949	6674749	He's going to cut you.
6674869	6675350	I hate you.
6675410	6676350	I'm going to cut you.
6676690	6677591	I'm going to cut you deep.
6677771	6682313	So let's go ahead and read off the list then for our... I have to post this in the chat room real fast before you read.
6682554	6683754	Gorgeous and lovely chat.
6683774	6683994	Hold on.
6684014	6688537	I actually have to close all my private message windows because people are about ready to vote here.
6689157	6689537	So once...
6692799	6693439	Here it goes.
6693979	6699661	There's the list, and you can send me your votes over private message, and Jamie's going to read it off for you right now, for those of you that aren't in the chat room.
6699941	6703082	We have Osamu Kubota, Rea Nagumo.
6703202	6704222	How did that one survive?
6704682	6706582	I was going to take that one off, but I figured someone else would.
6706602	6713064	We have Revenge, Bus Stop, Good Cool, Orange Lounge, Tack, DJ Taka, Vincent Damore, and L.E.D.,
6713784	6714725	So there it is.
6715125	6719628	You've got to pick your absolute favorite and send it to me over private message.
6719648	6721349	And we're going to take a really quick break.
6721869	6722049	Huh?
6722550	6723891	Absolute, since you said absolute.
6724171	6725872	We're going to do absolute because I said absolute?
6725932	6726612	All right, fair enough.
6729614	6732296	Send your votes in right now here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6732316	6734117	We're going to take about four minutes.
6734137	6736259	We'll do two songs because this is a hard decision for you guys.
6736279	6738980	And then we're going to come back, read the results, and end the show because we're already at 855.
6739681	6741682	So here we go on Orange Lounge Radio.
6741782	6742262	Vote now.
6742323	6742943	Vote now, now, now, now.
6767465	6768065	Thanks for watching!
6979488	6988036	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
6988076	6994102	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
6995383	7003852	Alright, we are back, and I'm trying to prep to go off the air here, but I'm getting very last minute here, but we are going to read the results of the...
7004801	7007342	Best Bomani Artist Ever!
7008343	7013666	So we've got the results here and I'm trying to... Sorry, I need a minute here.
7013946	7018549	You know what, I'm going to have to throw on another song real fast because I'm trying to prep for the end of the show here and I'm not ready yet.
7018569	7021950	So we're going to play something very fast and we'll be right back.
7022010	7022811	Sorry for the inconvenience.
7099674	7100755	Alright, hello.
7102096	7102677	Thank you, Jamie.
7103718	7105699	I'm trying to do about a million things at once here, but that's okay.
7106060	7106360	We got it.
7106400	7106940	We are back.
7107661	7112225	And right at the end of the show, we're going to announce the best Bomani artist ever.
7112725	7119952	Third place was Orange Lounge for best Bomani artist ever.
7119972	7122054	I'm happy for that one, because that's our namesake there.
7122154	7123435	Orange Lounge, third best ever.
7123915	7125697	Second best Bomani artist ever.
7126417	7127018	Good, cool.
7127850	7128731	Good, cool.
7128931	7129751	Good, cool.
7130292	7135536	And first place, this ain't going to surprise a damn person, it won by an absolute landslide.
7135956	7138438	First place, DJ Taka.
7138778	7140700	Best Bomani artist ever, so there it is.
7140760	7143082	Poo-poo on everybody who didn't vote for Tak.
7143702	7144763	Nobody voted for Tak?
7145343	7146624	Nobody voted for Revenge?
7146764	7148145	Nobody voted for Osamu Kubota?
7148185	7148926	I was kind of surprised.
7148946	7153810	See, I should have taken Taka off so that everyone would vote for Tak.
7154270	7156392	Oh, you would have been the evil bitch of Bomani.
7158658	7160118	Alright, well that's it.
7160498	7161079	Taka's winner.
7161599	7164479	Just really briefly because we were supposed to do this much earlier.
7164719	7166920	Oh yeah, the shaft update, please.
7167400	7168780	We'll run a little long, they won't mind.
7170241	7174942	Basically we've got the perfect attack rules already posted for the upcoming tournament.
7174982	7181303	Sac Mimani hosts another fabulous tournament that will be held at Sacramento Scandia on Hillsdale.
7181604	7186685	We've got directions, we have maps, we have the address, we have everything up on...
7187865	7188986	and SACBEMANI.com.
7189026	7196710	If you go to S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I.com, there is a link for Shaft and that is the whole section dedicated to that.
7196750	7198411	The only rules we have up are perfect attack right now.
7198451	7201953	Well, to be specific, it's accuracy attack.
7201973	7203334	It is not a true perfect attack.
7203834	7206836	If it's true perfect attack, we're only gauging by perfects.
7207356	7208678	So this is accuracy attack.
7209779	7215065	We should have freestyle rules posted by the middle of the week as soon as they're finalized.
7216046	7217607	So make sure you go there.
7217868	7221792	We have a discussion going on with psychedbymoney.com forums, so be sure to keep your eye on it.
7221932	7224375	There's also a thread on DDR Freak Under Tournament discussion.
7225174	7230559	And I'm not just saying this because I'm involved with the planning of this, but honestly, this is going to be one of the biggest tournaments in history.
7230599	7231480	It really will be.
7232400	7236864	Assuming we get the participation for it, which it sounds like we're going to be getting a lot of support for this.
7237244	7242369	Honestly, if you live far away, you live a ways away, this is going to be worth the trip.
7243129	7245271	There's going to be prizes up the wazoo.
7245291	7246112	We've got door prizes.
7246472	7248014	We have some really cool door prizes.
7248034	7249114	We can't even announce them yet.
7249135	7249735	They're that good.
7250195	7250396	So...
7251116	7256658	We'll have to... And we've got Loki donating hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs as prizes.
7256778	7257579	As door prizes.
7257679	7258499	As door prizes.
7258699	7259439	Anybody can win this.
7259459	7260000	Just show up.
7260020	7261040	Just show the fuck up.
7261120	7261900	That's all you gotta do.
7262401	7267443	So, definitely come to tournament November 9th at Sacramento Scandia.
7267483	7268423	It's gonna be huge.
7268943	7269243	Huge.
7269663	7269944	Alright.
7271304	7272665	And also the A-Team Freestyle.
7272685	7275246	If you're not gonna come for anything else, come for the A-Team Freestyle.
7275286	7278187	If you wanna see what Freestyle was two years ago...
7279002	7280482	We are having a blast from the past.
7280502	7282343	We're having a team freestyle mode.
7282743	7283803	It's limited entry.
7284143	7289145	We're basically leaving it to, we want past winners of tournaments to participate in at first.
7289725	7293086	But if we get enough entrants, we'll open it up.
7294526	7295866	Alright.
7295966	7297247	Final thoughts from everybody in the room.
7297467	7297687	Loki.
7299201	7300441	I don't have any thoughts right now.
7300461	7307243	Too much big stuff's happening next week, so we'll probably have a lot more to report on next week, so I can't wait.
7307543	7307863	All right.
7308203	7308483	Dave.
7309463	7310623	Kuchaka rules.
7310923	7311663	Steel drums.
7311783	7312084	Whee!
7313504	7314224	And Bradley.
7315004	7315724	I need power!
7315924	7316784	Power!
7318665	7320065	I love Bradley's final thoughts.
7321565	7323246	My final thought is nothing.
7323346	7324266	Absolutely nothing.
7324386	7324846	And Jamie.
7325675	7327678	Wheel of Morality, turn, turn, turn.
7327738	7329621	Tell us the lesson that we should learn.
7330583	7333547	And today's moral is... I have no morals.
7333567	7334188	What are you talking about?
7334228	7334869	Let's just end the show.
7335510	7336311	Alright, fair enough.
7336331	7337293	We're going to end this show now.
7337353	7337994	See you guys later.
7338034	7338595	Thanks for listening.
7339469	7339990	Finish her!
7340010	7340370	Finish her!
7382223	7385750	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
