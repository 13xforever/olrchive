It's a video tape! Put it in! Put it in!

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Boring!

00:25.000 --> 00:43.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain nudity, Orange Lounge may

00:43.000 --> 00:49.600
contain many four-letter words, hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

00:49.600 --> 00:53.480
The last Metroid is in captivity.

00:53.480 --> 01:08.480
The galaxy is at peace.

01:08.480 --> 01:15.560
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Ms. Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

01:15.560 --> 01:20.560
One, Warner's, disco.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.560
Missed it by that much.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.560
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.560
How can you tell?

01:25.560 --> 01:27.560
I never forget a pussy. Cat.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.560
Thirty-seven. My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.560
In a row?

01:31.560 --> 01:33.560
And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.560
You are the weakest thing could bite.

01:35.560 --> 01:40.560
So you get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir.

01:40.560 --> 01:45.560
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

01:45.560 --> 01:54.060
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.060
Dark Sakura

01:55.060 --> 01:56.060
I hate nature!

01:56.060 --> 01:59.060
I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

01:59.060 --> 01:59.560
Sky

01:59.560 --> 02:01.060
Do I look like the weather girl?

02:01.060 --> 02:02.060
Everything alright?

02:02.060 --> 02:03.560
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.560
Orange Lounge Radio

02:06.560 --> 02:12.560
We are live and this is episode number 14 for September the 29th of 2002.

02:12.560 --> 02:17.560
You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's most incredible radio station of all things, Bimani!

02:20.560 --> 02:24.560
We are the greatest Bimani Talk radio program ever.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.560
We are the only Bimani Talk radio program ever.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.560
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.560
Joining me as always is our resident happy bunny.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.560
Everyone, please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakoda.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.560
You smell like butt.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.560
We've got a few people around here tonight.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.560
I'm going to introduce them one at a time.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.560
We've got Matt, also known as Loki.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.560
Hello.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.560
We've got Dave.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.560
We had some other people, but they ran away.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.560
There's beef in the other room.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
That's why they ran away.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.560
Beef is bad.

02:53.560 --> 02:57.560
They got enticed by some big beef.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.560
Beef is bad.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
It's hiding in the other room.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.560
Beef is bad.

03:01.560 --> 03:05.640
he's like murder and murder tastes good

03:05.640 --> 03:08.760

06:19.800 --> 06:25.800
Even if it's not for you, sure, I will see you through

06:25.800 --> 06:30.800
No, no, I won't leave it when I can't keep it strong

06:30.800 --> 06:34.800
Understand, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You need to set me free, keep me from waiting

06:38.800 --> 06:42.800
To unlock the truth of life

06:42.800 --> 06:45.800
Even if it's not for you, even if it's for you

06:45.800 --> 06:51.800
They're tied to things that you will never have to find

06:52.800 --> 06:59.800
Your future holds all that you wish for it to have

07:01.800 --> 07:04.800
Find an emo, have fun while you can

07:05.800 --> 07:10.800

From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bimani stuff, comes our Bimani Science Less

08:00.120 --> 08:01.120
of the Day.

08:01.120 --> 08:13.800
Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.

08:13.800 --> 08:18.240
Alright you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a big thanks to 23rd Magus for sending

08:18.240 --> 08:22.440
us that promo we just used to come back in on, unfortunately it came out a little quiet

08:22.440 --> 08:28.460
but we'll work on getting that a little louder for future broadcasts of that promo because

08:28.460 --> 08:33.260
we need more promos on this show because I'm getting lazy, I'm getting lazy so the audience

08:33.260 --> 08:38.240
needs to take care of that for me if they want.

08:38.240 --> 08:42.520
I'm just reading some things in the chat room, if you do want to join our chat room go to

08:42.520 --> 08:47.160
any other side IRC server and just join channel pound orange lounge

08:47.160 --> 08:50.820
and uh... they're just talking about those songs uh... that we played panorama

08:50.820 --> 08:52.140
and shine on

08:52.140 --> 08:54.300
and uh... all sorts of different opinions on that

08:54.300 --> 08:56.100
uh... what do you want to do first

08:56.100 --> 08:59.100
we want to talk about Max USA or we want to talk about FU

08:59.100 --> 09:01.680
well I'm just trying to self out a positive bit

09:01.680 --> 09:03.920
okay we're going to talk about Max USA

09:03.920 --> 09:06.760
DDR MAX

09:06.760 --> 09:11.480
basically I've gotten a little bit of information about the release of DDR Max

09:11.480 --> 09:15.800
sure for everyone who's been looking on DDRFreak. You've seen the release of the box art. If

09:15.800 --> 09:20.840
you have not, just go to DDRFreak.com and it should be the second announcement there.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.880
There's a direct link to the box art. I warn you it is a very large image. It's very high

09:24.880 --> 09:31.560
quality though. There's also a few hints on what you might be hearing on the new version.

09:31.560 --> 09:38.360
Yes. You can also check it out over on SoCalKicks.com. One of our faithful listeners, SoCalKicks,

09:38.360 --> 09:44.420
has a site that's pretty much very up to the minute on all the Max USA news, and one thing

09:44.420 --> 09:47.400
that we found out through the cover, and I'm going to pull up the cover because some people

09:47.400 --> 09:53.800
in the room here haven't, ah shit, sorry about that, I haven't pulled up the cover for some

09:53.800 --> 09:59.960
people in the room here, I'm going to do that right now if I can find it, let's see, but

09:59.960 --> 10:06.360
the cover of DDR Max USA is kind of bluish and it gives away some things, it says featuring

10:06.360 --> 10:11.360
dance hits by Darude, Aurora, JS16, and Reel to Reel.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.520
So we kind of get some hints on some licensed songs through that information.

10:15.520 --> 10:20.160
We find out that Aurora did Ordinary World, so that's definitely going to be on there,

10:20.160 --> 10:23.400
and JS16 did Stomp to My Beats, so that'll definitely be on there.

10:23.400 --> 10:28.060
And I do believe, I get bragging rights, because I think last week on this show I said, if

10:28.060 --> 10:31.240
any song turns up in DDR Max USA, it'll be Ordinary World.

10:31.240 --> 10:42.360
I don't know about you guys, but I think the legs on that chick look really fucked up in

10:42.360 --> 10:43.360
the picture.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.580
I mean, it doesn't look right.

10:45.580 --> 10:50.280
If you think about it in terms of the rest of how her body should be, it's just all fucked

10:50.280 --> 10:51.280
up.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
What the hell?

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
They look like parachute pants.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.740
I think that he did a very nice picture, a very nice job with that background.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.700
It's very detailed, like the hand especially.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.700
very nice rendering and what's also kind of cool about the background you can see

11:02.700 --> 11:08.620
some freeze arrows in there so kind of teases the video from third mix take

11:08.620 --> 11:15.380
that down now so some interesting things there and of course Darude is best known

11:15.380 --> 11:18.700
for a song of theirs called sandstorm which you might have may or may not have

11:18.700 --> 11:23.660
heard now speculation is that that will be the song that will turn up in DDR Max

11:23.660 --> 11:27.140
USA although who knows you have a different you have a different opinion

11:27.140 --> 11:28.140
Matt, do you?

11:28.140 --> 11:31.140
Well, there's another song that's pretty much the same song.

11:31.140 --> 11:32.140
It's Feel the Beat.

11:32.140 --> 11:36.140
It's got a lot more stuff that they could do with instead of Sandstorm, which is the

11:36.140 --> 11:39.140
same thing repeating over and over and over and over and over and over again.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.140
I actually have an MP3.

11:41.140 --> 11:47.140
We can play that later on in the show, if you'd like.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.140
Yes.

11:48.140 --> 11:52.140
This is Sandstorm for those that maybe haven't heard the song before, so if you have an idea

11:52.140 --> 11:54.140
of what you can look forward to, possibly.

11:54.140 --> 11:55.140
We don't know yet.

11:55.140 --> 11:59.180
Hopefully get confirmation on that very soon in the near future, so there's a little teaser

11:59.180 --> 12:00.180
of that for you.

12:00.180 --> 12:05.060
And then Reel to Reel did that song, I don't have an audio copy of it unfortunately, but

12:05.060 --> 12:08.740
it goes like, I like to move it, move it, I like to move it, you might know that, you

12:08.740 --> 12:09.740
know it.

12:09.740 --> 12:10.740
I haven't heard that song at all.

12:10.740 --> 12:14.340
You'd probably know it if you heard it, you'd probably be surprised at what you've heard,

12:14.340 --> 12:15.340
so.

12:15.340 --> 12:21.140
We also, I did get, you know, I asked if it was okay for me to say so, the tentative date

12:21.140 --> 12:23.540
is going to be November 5th.

12:23.540 --> 12:29.460
It could possibly be pushed back a week after that, but that's what I have so far as a release date.

12:29.460 --> 12:34.260
So get over to GameStopper or EB or wherever that you like to go and reserve your copy, like now.

12:34.260 --> 12:40.240
November 5th. Buy your copy. Purchase your copy. Spend money on this copy.

12:40.240 --> 12:45.200
And so that's very cool. We got a... hopefully it's tentative release date, but it sounds pretty certain it's

12:45.200 --> 12:46.560
going to be November 5th.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.920
And as mentioned last week in the

12:48.920 --> 12:54.940
October 8th issue of the official PlayStation Magazine will be a demo of DDR Max USA, so

12:54.940 --> 12:55.940
go check that out.

12:55.940 --> 13:00.860
And actually, that was the other bit of news that was released this week.

13:00.860 --> 13:03.460
Some people have gotten their hands on that demo.

13:03.460 --> 13:09.820
And also, I believe DDR Freak has the news, as does SoCalKicks.com, as does most of your

13:09.820 --> 13:11.640
faithful Bomani news sites out there.

13:11.640 --> 13:17.920
There are some pictures out there of the DDR Max demo, and what it does reveal is that

13:17.920 --> 13:23.880
Secret Rendezvous is going to be one of the songs on Max USA, which is, YES!

13:23.880 --> 13:28.200
You can get your hot lesbian action on with Secret Rendezvous, which is interesting because

13:28.200 --> 13:32.200
that means there's a Max 2 song in there, so who knows what other Max 2 songs might

13:32.200 --> 13:33.200
turn up.

13:33.200 --> 13:38.080
Perhaps, I'd like to see, you know, like Burning Heat or Kakumei.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.080
You want Burning Heat?

13:39.080 --> 13:40.080
Who knows?

13:40.080 --> 13:43.840
I don't want Burning Heat personally, but I'd like to see it in DDR, yes.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.840
though.

13:44.840 --> 13:49.080
Just to make sure that you get a release of copy, I just think it's funny though how they

13:49.080 --> 13:53.880
replace the kanji with the little three letter acronyms for the, not acronyms, that's not

13:53.880 --> 13:55.680
a good word, but abbreviations.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.080
And standard is apparently STD.

13:58.080 --> 14:03.120
STD, so if you're playing a song on trick, it's now you're STD.

14:03.120 --> 14:07.340
So make sure you wear those latex shoes.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.200
You need to talk about your new shoes that you got, Jamie.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.200
Did my shoes get ash?

14:10.200 --> 14:11.920
You've got burning heat shoes on today.

14:11.920 --> 14:12.920
Okay.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.920
Unfortunately, we don't have our cam on today because it's really dark in here.

14:15.920 --> 14:20.920
I will scan my shoes so that everyone can see and put them up on the SAC-Vimani forums.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.920
But they've got little flames on them, so it looks like the Max2 logo.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.920
So she's got burning feet, we all say.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.920
I'm going to replace the laces with black laces so now they're all sleek and cute.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.920
My shoes own, and I got them at the Vans outlet.

14:32.920 --> 14:36.920
The other thing the demo reveals, there's no.5 speed mix.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.920
That was something that was on the E3 demo that's not on this demo.

14:40.920 --> 14:45.920
So who knows if it's going to be on the final release or not.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.240
There are no dark mode.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.960
Rumors saying not because of technical issues,

14:49.960 --> 14:51.600
but who knows what they're going to do.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.800
The demo also did not include foot rankings,

14:57.800 --> 14:59.800
which was something that's supposedly supposed

14:59.800 --> 15:00.640
to be in the final release.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.800
So that might be added later.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.720
We just don't know yet.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.600
Just saying for the preview, there

15:04.600 --> 15:06.120
are no foot rankings currently.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.960
So that's about all we see for right now.

15:08.960 --> 15:15.960
Let The Beat Hit Em, Look To The Sky, Exotic Ethnic, and Secret Rendezvous, all playable with this month's official PlayStation Magazine.

15:15.960 --> 15:21.960
So, we'll definitely get our hands on that and share our thoughts on it with you once we get it.

15:21.960 --> 15:22.960
We're still working on it.

15:22.960 --> 15:23.960
Yes.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.960
So, let's see, any other chat room?

15:25.960 --> 15:30.960
They're saying they want to see, like, Long Train Runnin', The Whistle Song, and, uh...

15:34.960 --> 15:37.960
Foot Rankings will be in the final release.

15:37.960 --> 15:41.280
We have some information in there.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.640
Some insider scoop.

15:43.640 --> 15:49.080
The last thing to be put in is going to be the foot rankings, so they're still working

15:49.080 --> 15:50.080
on it.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.200
They're encouraging us not to share our thoughts, but to share an ISO of the demo.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
No.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.200
You've got to go out and buy a PlayStation magazine.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.200
Go out and buy your copy.

15:58.200 --> 16:04.640
Now, this one thing that we're always going to say is that for any release that comes

16:04.640 --> 16:07.720
out in America, make sure that you spend your money and buy the copy because we will not

16:07.720 --> 16:25.400
Any other thoughts on Max USA, things that they need to do quickly before the final release,

16:25.400 --> 16:27.560
other songs we hope to see?

16:27.560 --> 16:29.680
Any opinion?

16:29.680 --> 16:33.960
Well actually if you look really really really really really closely in the background of

16:33.960 --> 16:39.040
Max USA, the cover. You notice in really, really, really small print hidden in there,

16:39.040 --> 16:44.640
it says, yes, there will most definitely be Let Them Move in this version. So just, you

16:44.640 --> 16:48.200
know, to warn you guys, watch out for that.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.200
No.

16:49.200 --> 16:56.320
I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed by Jason himself that Let Them Move will not be a song,

16:56.320 --> 17:01.320
but I heard a rumor that it might be the training mode song. Who knows?

17:01.320 --> 17:02.320
It better not be.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.320
I don't know.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.320
training mode. Like in third mix.

17:05.320 --> 17:09.320
Why don't you just get rid of training mode and give us a couple more songs?

17:09.320 --> 17:14.320
I use training mode to listen to my edits with the clap assist on.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.320
I'm sorry, actually we're confusing lesson mode and training mode.

17:17.320 --> 17:18.320
Yeah, lesson mode, not training mode.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.320
Training mode is the one where you can slow down the song and all that stuff.

17:21.320 --> 17:24.320
Lesson mode is where you learn how to play TDR.

17:24.320 --> 17:31.320
Lesson mode to just keep, you know, like in third mix they had the pimp song, you know, after the game of love.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.320
Did they? Oh yeah, that's right.

17:32.320 --> 17:37.320
It's when you're not quite ready for the STDs, you go to lesson mode.

17:37.320 --> 17:40.320
And remember, wear latex shoes so you don't catch those STDs.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.320
Yes.

17:41.320 --> 17:45.320
You're like poor little Miss Muffet who sat on her trumpet.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.320
Oh, Black Lab suggests that instead of Max 300,

17:48.320 --> 17:51.320
Let Them Move will be the extra stage.

17:51.320 --> 17:55.320
Everyone will be failing Max because they'll be throwing up or something.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.320
Bleh.

17:56.320 --> 17:59.320
Let them bleh.

17:59.320 --> 18:05.320
Alright, so we started on a positive note. Shall we go to the FUs of the Week? What do you think?

18:05.320 --> 18:06.320
Uh, sure.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.320
Alright. You got one, Jamie?

18:07.320 --> 18:08.320
Yes.

18:08.320 --> 18:16.320
Alright, let's start off, as we always do, with Jamie's FU of the Week, which turns in always to everybody's FU of the Week. So, here you go.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.320
My FU of the Week goes to Taco Bell.

18:19.320 --> 18:28.920
I hadn't eaten a damn thing all day, I get to Taco Bell and I wanted to have a nice chicken

18:28.920 --> 18:32.880
grilled stuff burrito and I wanted a chicken mixed with milk.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.080
My chicken mixed with milk was yummy but I had tomatoes on it but I forgot.

18:36.080 --> 18:44.520
Anyway, we get over here to Rob's place and I take a bite into my chicken grilled stuff

18:44.520 --> 18:49.200
burrito and it's beans, all beans, all beans and a little bit of rice and then I found

18:49.200 --> 18:51.520
one piece of chicken in the whole damn thing

18:51.520 --> 18:55.840
and i paid for chicken

18:55.840 --> 18:57.200
okay that was beautiful

18:57.200 --> 18:58.920
my f-u of the week

18:58.920 --> 19:01.220
is to roseville golf land

19:01.220 --> 19:05.600
yeah that's right i need to change the song here

19:05.600 --> 19:08.280
oh petite love oh boy

19:08.280 --> 19:11.400
what an f-ing cool song

19:11.400 --> 19:12.840
yay okay

19:12.840 --> 19:16.440
my f-u of the week is to roseville golf land

19:16.440 --> 19:22.000
even though they did upgrade both their guitar freaks and drummania machines

19:22.000 --> 19:26.360
says they have eighth and seventh notes respectively

19:26.360 --> 19:29.960
they broke guitar freaks already after one hour

19:29.960 --> 19:32.440
one hour it's a new record

19:32.440 --> 19:35.100
they can't upgrade it's a new record

19:35.100 --> 19:37.640
you've got a new record save it on the memory card

19:37.640 --> 19:38.680
no but

19:38.680 --> 19:40.720
it's really shitty now

19:40.720 --> 19:44.440
i play drummania a lot and that's cool but if i want to play session mode

19:44.440 --> 19:45.720
too fucking bad

19:45.720 --> 19:50.280
because guitar freaks they already fucked it up and they haven't even started playing

19:50.280 --> 19:55.000
yet. It was open I think for one hour. Actually, if you think about it, it wasn't as bad as

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
when they got it to 7th Mix. The 7th Mix, they couldn't even play it. It just broke

20:00.000 --> 20:04.760
because of some coding. Keep in mind when we got 5th Mix, do you know who installed

20:04.760 --> 20:10.480
that? Who actually got it working? My fiance did. Dan got it working. Cool. So maybe we

20:10.480 --> 20:15.000
should just send Dan over there and say, hey, fix this. Of course that's also why 5th Mix

20:15.000 --> 20:19.520
uh...

20:19.520 --> 20:24.440
uh... that you had any uh... but he's really

20:24.440 --> 20:27.880
actually i don't think i do

20:27.880 --> 20:28.880
fine

20:28.880 --> 20:30.240
for what

20:30.240 --> 20:34.240
i don't know i haven't really been thinking about things to be angry at a

20:34.240 --> 20:41.240
uh...

20:41.240 --> 20:45.240
Alright, you lose. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Yeah, yeah, I got it. I got one.

20:45.240 --> 20:54.240
Okay, this F.E.U. goes to the makers of E.J. software, the programs I use for making a wonderful song.

20:54.240 --> 20:58.240
Unfortunately, I have a sample kit, and I wanted to steal samples from him.

20:58.240 --> 21:05.240
And they have a little thing in there to bump the pitch up so that it's, you know, at 140, which is what E.J. uses.

21:05.240 --> 21:09.240
And the damn thing kept crashing every single time, so I have to do that.

21:09.240 --> 21:12.240
And that's kind of weak, but that's it. That's all I got.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.240
I'll have more next week.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.240
Alright. You promise?

21:16.240 --> 21:17.240
I promise.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.240
Alright.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.240
One thing I do have to say is that Drumminia 7th Mix totally owns.

21:21.240 --> 21:26.240
Kuchaka and Concierto in Blue and the Extra Stage in Japanese, I can't read it.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.240
They all play the coolest songs.

21:29.240 --> 21:34.240
Okay, I just need to get over there and play it so I can play Another World and have my gax fix.

21:34.240 --> 21:39.640
I'm going to be bringing that song next week and we are going to play Another World on

21:39.640 --> 21:42.260
Orange Lounge because Gaktones, he's pretty.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.260
I have some FUs of the Week.

21:43.260 --> 21:47.160
He's also very, very, very, very, very, very interesting.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.320
I have some FUs of the Week.

21:49.320 --> 21:55.600
My first FU of the Week, as wonderful as they are for hosting this wonderful program, Live365.com

21:55.600 --> 21:58.440
gets my first FU of the Week.

21:58.440 --> 22:02.640
First of all, for playing that goddamn Prodigy ad in the midst of the show.

22:02.640 --> 22:07.400
I'm all for, you know, playing the ads occasionally to help pay the bills, but that Prodigy song

22:07.400 --> 22:12.040
sucks, I'm sorry. Quit playing that ad during my show.

22:12.040 --> 22:17.360
Second F.U. for them is that they keep stats, so we can see, you know, how many people are

22:17.360 --> 22:21.160
listening to the show, how many hours we get and all that. Well, guess what? For every

22:21.160 --> 22:26.760
station on Live 365, they lost last week's stat. And by the way, I happen to know, because

22:26.760 --> 22:30.960
I see live stats as they're coming in, that last Sunday happened to be one of our biggest

22:30.960 --> 22:36.160
nights for the show to date and we don't get any credit for that now so our ratings suck

22:36.160 --> 22:42.440
thanks to life365.com. So FU! So poo poo on them. Everybody, log in twice. Although, thanks

22:42.440 --> 22:47.000
for hosting the show, hey, what can I say, but you fucked up on that one, so poo. Poopy!

22:47.000 --> 22:53.200
Poopy on you. My other FU of the week goes to my 2DX controller, because button number

22:53.200 --> 23:00.040
three and button number seven have been sticking like, like a lot, and I hate it. That's it,

23:00.040 --> 23:02.040
That's my last F.U. that I can pick up.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.040
You have another F.U., Jamie.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.040
Oops, wrong one.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.040
My next F.U. goes toward

23:07.040 --> 23:11.040
HolikR5NY31 yet again.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.040
I am so close to passing this one.

23:13.040 --> 23:18.040
You know, I had a freakin' full combo on R5

23:18.040 --> 23:21.040
going into right before that one really hard part

23:21.040 --> 23:23.040
that I always had issues with.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.040
And I lost it the whole time

23:25.040 --> 23:27.040
because I can't figure that one part out.

23:27.040 --> 23:37.040
But, you know, fuck you to all of the seven star songs. I'm gonna pass one of you. One day. One day I will, I promise. One day my prince will come.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.040
Is that a promise?

23:38.040 --> 23:43.040
Yes. That's what I promise as a threat. Oh, I mean, not a promise.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.040
Max, chat room, any FUs?

23:46.040 --> 23:50.040
The chat room has a ton of FUs right now, so I'm going to get some of those.

23:50.040 --> 24:01.040
But first off, I have to state that actually, our resident comedian in the chat room, PyroMan, is back, and he suggested how you can get a sticky controller.

24:01.040 --> 24:05.040
Just the secret rendezvous video and four hours on Kazop.

24:05.040 --> 24:11.040
Alright, let's get to the FUs from the chat room, shall we?

24:11.040 --> 24:18.640
Wait, hold on. This isn't fair. They get a cool song, and I get the T-bug.

24:18.640 --> 24:19.960
Sorry. Life sucks.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.960
No.

24:22.960 --> 24:26.760
SoCalKick says, Fuck you, everyone who is bitching, because for me life has never been

24:26.760 --> 24:31.320
better. And fuck you, everyone who is calling him Fox version 2.0 because his latest picture

24:31.320 --> 24:35.880
makes him look like Fox, even though I rather laugh at the situation and go along with it.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.800
Whatever that means. I think that was a half-insight joke.

24:38.800 --> 24:44.040
JB says, F you to SyFam for being so cheap they can't properly advertise their artists

24:44.040 --> 24:45.040
like Jennie Rom.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.920
He's such a Jennie Rom porn.

24:46.920 --> 24:51.940
Well, you saw what his new title is on SyFamani?

24:51.940 --> 24:52.940
What is that?

24:52.940 --> 24:55.940
Drilling Jennie Rom fanboy.

24:55.940 --> 25:00.020
DJ Konami wants to give an F you to the assholes that don't take it seriously when I'm teaching

25:00.020 --> 25:01.020
them how to play Beatmania.

25:01.020 --> 25:02.020
Hi, I am DJ Konami.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.020
You know what?

25:03.020 --> 25:08.360
During our first break we should play that for him.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.360
Maybe we will.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.360
Let's give you your pops.

25:10.360 --> 25:11.360
Maybe we will.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.360
Oh my god, this is a huge one.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.120
Oh, he sent it three times.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.120
One is enough.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.120
Don't worry.

25:19.120 --> 25:23.080
23rd Magus wants to give a big F you to Absolutetrick because it caused him much embarrassment

25:23.080 --> 25:25.520
when he failed it on the Max 2 on Wednesday.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
Fuck you Absolut.

25:26.520 --> 25:32.040
I also want to say fuck you to Earthlink for screwing with their FTP servers for my site.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.080
And he wants to know if that was fuck instead of fuck.

25:35.080 --> 25:38.080
It was a spelling thing, anyway.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.080
More F-

25:40.080 --> 25:42.080
Oh, Bradley's here. Hey, what's up, Bradley?

25:42.080 --> 25:44.080
My power went out, so I had to come over here.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.080
You couldn't hear the show at your own house? You had to come over here?

25:47.080 --> 25:48.080
Yeah.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.080
Oh, right on.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.080
There's nothing to do in my apartment without power, so...

25:52.080 --> 25:54.080
So you want to give a big F you to power?

25:54.080 --> 25:55.080
I'll get that.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.080
Fuck your power.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.080
Twin has not only-

26:00.080 --> 26:02.080
Oh my god, he's got a bunch.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.080
He's got six. Here we go.

26:04.080 --> 26:08.640
F you number one Japan played every other fucking song on fifth mix. That's a few number one

26:08.640 --> 26:12.680
That's a region been if you number two feet of fury beta being pushed back nearly half a month

26:13.040 --> 26:16.160
If you number three a I am for always crapping out if you number four

26:16.160 --> 26:20.960
No one appreciating his mixes all if you number five can't view anything while listening to orange lounge

26:20.960 --> 26:24.860
If you number six people dissing me for not passing into the century maniac with a B

26:26.560 --> 26:28.560
Which mix it depends

26:28.560 --> 26:35.560

and waiting on black waiting on black lives if you haven't gotten yet and uh...

Yeah, that was relating to SoCalCakesPost.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.440
I'd have to say yes, sort of.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.840
We'll look at that during break.

28:43.840 --> 28:47.080
And he did want to point out also,

28:47.080 --> 28:51.640
we have some follow-up on DDR Max USA stuff.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.200
Let's see, from the E3 beta version,

28:53.200 --> 28:55.240
DDR Max USA was announced a new half speed

28:55.240 --> 28:56.440
would be in the list of modes.

28:56.440 --> 29:00.440
Right now, his absence from the first November issue demo

29:00.440 --> 29:02.120
of Official PlayStation Magazine is

29:02.120 --> 29:04.720
rumored that it was removed for the final version because

29:04.720 --> 29:06.880
of technical difficulties.

29:06.880 --> 29:11.520
The foot rankings confirmed here on socalkicks.com.

29:11.520 --> 29:15.840
People began to worry about that too because it was also absent from the demo, but I can

29:15.840 --> 29:20.200
tell you right now it is one of the last things that's going to be put into the game.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.660
They first have to make all the step charts for all the modes, remember there's doubles

29:23.660 --> 29:28.680
to do as well, and they have to get those done before giving the songs foot rankings.

29:28.680 --> 29:34.380
And also there's two rumors, so we're going to spread dirty rumors around right now, that

29:34.380 --> 29:39.220
The song list was increased by 15 songs, making the total list 80 songs.

29:39.220 --> 29:45.820
And also, rumor that a challenge will make it into DDR Max USA, similar to an Oni mode

29:45.820 --> 29:47.140
perhaps.

29:47.140 --> 29:52.000
So take that all with a grain of salt, it's still Rumor, Rumor, Rumorville.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.940
So that's it.

29:55.940 --> 29:59.260
Yay, and there you have it.

29:59.260 --> 30:00.260
There you have it.

30:00.260 --> 30:01.260
Now you know.

30:01.260 --> 30:02.260
And now you know.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.260
And knowing is half the battle.

30:03.260 --> 30:32.500
We are going to take a quick break and we will come right back.

30:32.500 --> 30:36.300
I've been requested to play the DJ Konami thing, which I'm going to have to dig up and find.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.780
We'll get to that pretty soon.

30:37.780 --> 30:41.660
We're going to start off with one of my favorite songs from Max 2.

30:41.660 --> 30:42.180
How's that sound?

30:42.180 --> 30:44.180
winner

31:12.180 --> 31:15.540
Dealing, I will always young

31:17.540 --> 31:19.540
Drifting away

31:19.540 --> 31:24.540
I'm flying, I'm gonna head for paradise

31:24.540 --> 31:26.540
Nothing to say

31:26.540 --> 31:31.540
I'm climbing, I wanna see my future rise

31:56.540 --> 32:25.100
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!

32:25.100 --> 32:30.100
I know you all know BeatMania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

32:30.100 --> 32:33.100
Listen carefully and try to follow.

32:33.100 --> 32:36.100
The objects will come down from the top.

32:36.100 --> 32:40.100
When it hits the red line, push the button.

32:41.100 --> 32:44.100
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

32:44.100 --> 32:48.100
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.100
First, hit the white keys.

32:51.100 --> 32:58.100
Now hit the black key.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.100
Yeah.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.100
Yeah.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.100
Yeah.

33:01.100 --> 33:09.100
Okay, now a combination of both white and black key.

33:09.100 --> 33:10.100
Yeah.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.100
Yeah.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.100
Yeah.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.100
Yeah.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.100
Yeah.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.100
Yeah.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.100
Yeah.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.100
Yeah.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.100
Yeah.

33:18.100 --> 33:19.100
Yeah.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.100
Yeah.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.100
Don't drop it.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.600
It's gonna be a little weird.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.600
No reason why you're feeling weird.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.600
You better think back if you think back.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.600
Easy, huh?

33:28.600 --> 33:29.100
All right.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.600
Let's go on to the scratch game.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.600
When the objects reach the red line, scratch!

33:34.600 --> 33:36.600
And if you do, don't play it.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.100
If you don't play it, you better.

33:39.100 --> 33:44.100
With a fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.

33:52.100 --> 33:55.100
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.100
It's hard, but you can do it!

34:17.100 --> 34:19.100
Okay, effector time!

34:19.100 --> 34:23.100
Here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

34:23.100 --> 34:27.100
Look way below, do you see the foot switch?

34:27.100 --> 34:30.100
That's the effect on and on switch.

34:30.100 --> 34:34.100
To this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

34:34.100 --> 34:38.100
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

34:42.100 --> 34:45.100
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

34:45.100 --> 34:50.100
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

34:52.100 --> 34:57.100
This powerful sound system is moving everybody hot!

34:57.100 --> 35:02.100
Alright! Gotta go! Do not rule out your fabulous sound!

35:02.100 --> 35:07.100
On this very good version of the TV Mania!

35:15.100 --> 35:19.100
We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.

35:19.100 --> 35:24.580
?)

35:24.580 --> 35:39.020
We think we figured it out.

35:39.020 --> 35:41.200
Orange Lounge Radio.

35:41.200 --> 35:46.620
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 14.

35:46.620 --> 35:47.580
That's an old promo.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.920
I'm starting to play the old promos again, because it's been a while, it's been a while,

35:50.920 --> 35:52.840
so they're fresh again.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.480
It's like a fine wine, you let them age a little bit.

35:56.480 --> 36:00.540
We want to also talk about another new Bimani game that just hit, I believe it is official

36:00.540 --> 36:08.520
as of Monday, 2DX8 style is out and about, and unfortunately, and somebody, I accidentally

36:08.520 --> 36:14.020
closed the window, they sent it in a little too late, but Konami wanted to give an F.U.

36:14.020 --> 36:17.500
to Konami because they still haven't updated their official website with any information,

36:17.500 --> 36:21.300
even though the game is supposedly out now. As of Monday, the game was released.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.260
It took them a while to do that with Southern Style too, though.

36:23.260 --> 36:30.900
Yeah. Luckily, BomaniStyle.com has a little bit of information on 2DX8 style, which includes

36:30.900 --> 36:35.300
some of the song lists. If I can pull that up here real fast.

36:35.300 --> 36:47.300
We've got a bunch of the songs that are released, and some of the non-stop choruses, which I

36:47.300 --> 36:49.800
think is really interesting.

36:49.800 --> 36:53.500
We have a Tran course, that's what I like, I think that's really cool.

36:53.500 --> 36:58.700
There's a Tran course, which consists of Beautiful Days, Alien World, Starmind, G2, and Stoic.

36:58.700 --> 37:04.400
Although I think G2 is a scary ass Tran video, in my opinion.

37:04.400 --> 37:09.120
Some of the other non-stop course names that are interesting, Feel, DJ Taka of course,

37:09.120 --> 37:15.920
Eurobeat, Super Eurobeat, Vocal Performance, Trance, VJ Hess, that's an interesting one,

37:15.920 --> 37:23.880
Number 5, Newcomer, UG2, Rapid 2, Original, Cinderella, that's an interesting one.

37:23.880 --> 37:28.400
Well that's all, look what that is, look what the songs are, Stick Around, Jelly Kiss, Glorious

37:28.400 --> 37:31.480
Days, are those the Sona tracks?

37:31.480 --> 37:33.640
No I don't think Glorious Days is a Sona song.

37:33.640 --> 37:42.440
just kind of happy sounding songs. Piano, Tack, Hirata, Hell, of course, and Saturday

37:42.440 --> 37:47.000
Night. That's a pretty cool chorus, Saturday Night. You got Dancing into the Night, Blowing

37:47.000 --> 37:52.780
My Heart Away, Funky, Bingo, Paradise, Wow Wow, Seven Days, and Please Don't Go. There's

37:52.780 --> 37:57.180
some very interesting genre names in 8th style, which has been getting a lot of laughs out

37:57.180 --> 38:02.480
of people. There's one called Cuddlecore. The Murmur Twins is the name of the song,

38:02.480 --> 38:09.480
Metal House by Sunglasses of Night

38:32.480 --> 38:33.480
being sung by women.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.480
Oh.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.480
That's a pretty good one.

38:35.480 --> 38:41.520
Though I did notice that there were a good number that were sauna tracks.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.480
Well sauna would be a female, last time I checked.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.000
You just need to do the sauna course.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.120
Sauna course would be cool.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.640
But unfortunately we don't know much else about 8th Style, we're still waiting to see

38:49.640 --> 38:51.740
if any arcades in the U.S. are going to be getting it.

38:51.740 --> 38:53.360
We know of one that ordered it.

38:53.360 --> 38:57.680
Seven buttons on a turntable and effectors.

38:57.680 --> 39:01.280
Yes, 8th Style will have seven buttons and a turntable.

39:01.280 --> 39:07.780
14 and 2 turntables and it's this little hole that you put your coin in and a big plasma

39:07.780 --> 39:11.520
screen if you're getting a brand new one like we are, well Scandia anyway.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.840
Yeah let's see, what are they saying in chat room?

39:14.840 --> 39:18.840
Some people know more, a few arcades are ordering it, well which ones, don't just tell me a

39:18.840 --> 39:23.560
few tell me which arcades, it's not like that many arcades even have 2DX to begin with.

39:23.560 --> 39:27.360
We happen to know locally where we base Orange Lounge out of in Sacramento that there's an

39:27.360 --> 39:32.120
arcade scandia supposed to be getting eight style they have ordered it we've

39:32.120 --> 39:36.000
seen the invoice so we know apparently there's a few on the East Coast they're

39:36.000 --> 39:39.560
actually going to be picking it up we assume arcade infinity would get it I

39:39.560 --> 39:45.800
wouldn't see why not maybe Sunnyvale Golf Land who knows I think the SVGL is

39:45.800 --> 39:51.340
supposed to have theirs very soon black lab quotes a famous Beck song to

39:51.340 --> 39:57.200
turntables and a microphone that would be cracking DJ well was there a

39:57.200 --> 40:00.920
microphone. There's not a microphone in Kraken DJ. Kraken DJ is a cool game. I don't know

40:00.920 --> 40:05.260
why they don't have more of it in places. Kraken DJ, for those who have never played

40:05.260 --> 40:11.160
it, it's two turntables and they kind of automatically spin like a real turntable would as you're

40:11.160 --> 40:14.760
playing the game and it's all scratching. There's no buttons at all. You just scratch.

40:14.760 --> 40:17.200
There's a switch in the center. Yeah, there's a switch in the center because you have to

40:17.200 --> 40:20.080
scratch one turntable and you scratch the other one and you have to move it back and

40:20.080 --> 40:24.480
4 or 3 have to blend between the two, so it'll be interesting.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.320
It's just a pretty difficult game.

40:27.320 --> 40:32.520
I think that 2DX is easier than Kraken DJ, by far.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.480
Yeah, I think it's easier too, but I don't know.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.000
I find Kraken DJ fun.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I think it's just the concept of Kraken DJ is a little hard

40:38.000 --> 40:38.720
to grasp at first.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.220
It's weird.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.000
It's different.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.520
The layout is very different.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.680
But isn't it by Sega, if I'm not mistaken?

40:43.680 --> 40:44.080
Yes.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.880
We need to see a home release of that then, I think.

40:45.880 --> 40:46.520
That'll be fun.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.640
But the controller would cost like a million dollars.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.760
I wouldn't be more than 100.

40:51.760 --> 40:56.960
DJ Konami says that San Jose State is also supposed to be getting an 8th mix, so we'll

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
see.

40:57.960 --> 40:58.960
Or 8th style, sorry.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.720
I think they're upgrading the 6th.

41:00.720 --> 41:05.560
I also heard a rumor that BeatMania 7th mix is finally coming out for PS1 on Christmas

41:05.560 --> 41:08.400
Eve is the tentative release date.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.400
So we'll see.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.400
It's about freaking time.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.360
Time to get ordering.

41:12.360 --> 41:16.800
So go place your pre-orders for that on your favorite import game site.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.720
But do not buy from BuyRight.

41:19.720 --> 41:23.080
When you're buying at BuyRight, you're buying wrong.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.080
They will cheat you.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.520
Can I do another Fuck You of the Week?

41:26.520 --> 41:27.520
Sure, go ahead.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.920
I'm not going to cue the music because I'm lazy.

41:28.920 --> 41:33.020
Well, it's an old Fuck You, but my reason's first thing, don't buy at BuyRight.

41:33.020 --> 41:36.880
When I bought my Tekken 4 there, I was expecting to get a Japanese copy so I could have a chance

41:36.880 --> 41:38.120
at reading the manual.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.760
They sent me the Asian release and then wouldn't replace it, and they said, oh, you didn't

41:41.760 --> 41:42.760
say it was Japanese.

41:42.760 --> 41:43.880
We just said it was import.

41:43.880 --> 41:47.540
I could have bought that at YesAsia.com for about $30 cheaper.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.540
So BuyRight will cheat you.

41:49.540 --> 41:50.940
They will cheat you.

41:50.940 --> 41:53.620
So don't buy there.

41:53.620 --> 41:58.020
Pyroman said that he held an employee at gunpoint and now Nickelodeon City in Illinois will

41:58.020 --> 42:07.420
be getting 8th style, which we all know is probably a load of crap, but it's funny.

42:07.420 --> 42:08.840
Let's change gears a little bit here.

42:08.840 --> 42:13.380
This is a story I want to, unless you guys have anything you want to say about 8th style.

42:13.380 --> 42:20.620
I can't play 7 key, let alone 5 key, and all that stuff, so F you to 8 style for being

42:20.620 --> 42:23.060
so damn hard.

42:23.060 --> 42:25.060
There we go.

42:25.060 --> 42:26.060
Practice!

42:26.060 --> 42:29.720
Also, I'd like to point that guy that you just flashed the picture up on the screen

42:29.720 --> 42:30.720
is very ugly.

42:30.720 --> 42:33.420
We'll get to that in a little bit.

42:33.420 --> 42:34.420
You're a 2DX player, Bradley.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.300
What do you think of 8th style so far?

42:36.300 --> 42:37.300
Looks cool.

42:37.300 --> 42:41.700
I've listened to much of the music so far, but...

42:41.700 --> 43:08.260
Do you think it's going to be the biggest 2DX style ever?

43:08.260 --> 43:10.820
As if the show wasn't already on its way to a train wreck.

43:10.820 --> 43:17.400
We're going to talk about, this is interesting, twingalaxies.com, this is a link that was

43:17.400 --> 43:21.020
sent to me at the end of last week's show, I forget who sent it to me, I'm sorry, whoever

43:21.020 --> 43:26.060
sent it to me, just go ahead and give yourself an ego boost in the chat room and thanks.

43:26.060 --> 43:31.980
Twingalaxies.com, the worldwide authority on player rankings, game statistics, and championship

43:31.980 --> 43:32.980
tournaments.

43:32.980 --> 43:39.260
Oh, I'm supposed to mention the extra stage for 8th style is a revenge song.

43:39.260 --> 43:48.540
They have an article now that the Dance Dance Revolution world record has been set and this

43:48.540 --> 43:51.260
was on July 9th, 2002.

43:51.260 --> 43:55.420
And Loki, this guy that you were saying was very ugly in the picture, that's your world

43:55.420 --> 43:56.700
record holder right here.

43:56.700 --> 44:00.620
So I thought I would read this article for you guys because I think you'll find it interesting

44:00.620 --> 44:01.620
because we sure did.

44:01.620 --> 44:04.780
On one note, I am pulling my microphone away so that I don't laugh.

44:04.780 --> 44:05.780
Okay, yes.

44:05.780 --> 44:06.780
Please do.

44:06.780 --> 44:07.780
No, we want to hear your laughter.

44:07.780 --> 44:30.420
One of the hottest new series of modern arcade titles to play is the Dance Dance Revolution

44:30.420 --> 44:36.040
series by Konami, with the most current and popular release officially known as DDR Max

44:36.040 --> 44:39.480
2, which in effect is the seventh mix in the series.

44:39.480 --> 44:43.060
For those unfamiliar with the game, players select different songs and become physically

44:43.060 --> 44:44.840
engaged in the game itself.

44:44.840 --> 44:49.760
It makes it sound like the last stage of Nick Arcade when they were swatting flies on the

44:49.760 --> 44:50.760
blue screen.

44:50.760 --> 44:55.120
Judging by the look of this ugly person, he hasn't been engaged in this game very long.

44:55.120 --> 45:00.000
Maybe it's to have an engagement he can get physically.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.840
He'll never get engaged to a girl, but anyway, dancing literally in order to hit the specific

45:05.840 --> 45:08.760
arrow directions on the floor pad with their feet.

45:08.760 --> 45:11.760
This is a game you play with your feet.

45:11.760 --> 45:17.520
This title, along with others such as mocap boxing and police 911, are part of the latest

45:17.520 --> 45:21.760
trend in modern video gaming, physically interactive game play.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.920
Hey, and they are all kamami games, who's our innovator here?

45:24.920 --> 45:28.560
Now they left out Boonga Boonga Revolution, what's up with that?

45:28.560 --> 45:30.920
A boonga!

45:30.920 --> 45:31.920
Boop!

45:31.920 --> 45:32.920
Anyway.

45:32.920 --> 45:38.920
If they released it in America, they'd just have to call it, you know, Proctology Major.

45:38.920 --> 45:39.920
Or whatever.

45:39.920 --> 45:41.920
Fingers go up the hole.

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
Anyway.

45:42.920 --> 45:45.920
Boonga Boonga always gets a laugh on this show.

45:45.920 --> 45:46.920
Back to the article.

45:46.920 --> 45:49.920
We can talk about that until the cows come home.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
Moo.

45:50.920 --> 45:51.920
Making sure.

45:51.920 --> 45:52.920
Okay, I just...

45:52.920 --> 45:53.920
So, back to our article.

45:53.920 --> 45:54.920
Sorry.

45:54.920 --> 45:55.920
Back to the article, yes.

45:55.920 --> 45:56.920
Twin Galaxy.

45:56.920 --> 46:01.440
Twin Galaxy's chief referee, Robert T., I can't say your last name, proclaims gamer

46:01.440 --> 46:08.120
Damien Sarcuni as our first verified and recognized world champion at the DDR Max 2 title with

46:08.120 --> 46:14.400
a 5 score song total of 315,802,020 points.

46:14.400 --> 46:18.720
I'm sorry, I can't...

46:18.720 --> 46:19.720
Why is that funny?

46:19.720 --> 46:23.440
Because I'm top that on standard songs.

46:23.440 --> 46:29.680
This is the thing, if I recall correctly, if you play a 9 foot song, the max score you'll

46:29.680 --> 46:36.960
get on a Max 2 is 90 million, correct? Multiply that by 5, that's 450 million. So even if

46:36.960 --> 46:42.760
you fucked up your 5 9-footers completely, you should have a score of at least 400 million

46:42.760 --> 46:51.660
points, correct? This guy has the world record with a score of 315 million. That's like four

46:51.660 --> 46:52.960
seven-footers and a six.

46:52.960 --> 46:53.960
Yes.

46:53.960 --> 47:00.360
Hell, I could play freakin' Dynamite Raid Basic on stealth five times and still beat

47:00.360 --> 47:01.860
that damn score.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.800
The sirens are going outside.

47:03.800 --> 47:05.480
The world thinks this is madness.

47:05.480 --> 47:08.520
The world record is 315 million.

47:08.520 --> 47:17.180
Held by the official Twin Galaxies tournament settings have already been determined for

47:17.180 --> 47:20.960
this title and appear later in this breaking news story, which we'll read.

47:20.960 --> 47:24.300
But before we get into that, let's recap the experience.

47:24.300 --> 47:28.160
The game's record capabilities are unusual in that the scores are not permanently kept

47:28.160 --> 47:30.720
in the game's memory as far as points are concerned.

47:30.720 --> 47:33.880
Well, if you have a memory card, it'll save it to the memory card.

47:33.880 --> 47:38.120
Also, I should mention that one of the rules for entering this world record is you have

47:38.120 --> 47:41.600
to be fucking ugly.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.440
The scores are too safe.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.440
Matt, go!

47:44.440 --> 47:45.440
Go do it!

47:45.440 --> 47:49.320
The scores are safe if you've got your initials in the machine that has your score beside

47:49.320 --> 47:55.480
it when it pops up on the screen. While his score was world record breaking it wasn't

47:55.480 --> 47:59.920
good enough to place on the top ten. SoCalKicks is going right now, he says he's going running

47:59.920 --> 48:02.540
out with a camera, he's going to take a picture of that. SoCalKicks, you can't do it, you're

48:02.540 --> 48:06.160
not ugly, you're Fox 2.0, remember, you can't do it. And besides that you still owe me that

48:06.160 --> 48:11.680
screen capture so you can get my GameCube in. So sit your ass down. We're going to be

48:11.680 --> 48:16.740
in trouble for that one. Let's see, further machines set to five song attempts use only

48:16.740 --> 48:22.320
the sum of the last three songs for the record. To be fair, I'm authorizing two different

48:22.320 --> 48:27.440
records to be tracked separately, one for three song and one for five song submissions.

48:27.440 --> 48:33.360
Most machines are set to a minute thirty to two minutes per song. I didn't think time

48:33.360 --> 48:39.480
ever had anything to do with it, but whatever. Let's see. Further, there are several rest

48:39.480 --> 48:43.840
periods in between songs based on the actions you must do for the setting and song selection.

48:43.840 --> 48:48.540
I have included my ruling on this with the TGTS information below.

48:48.540 --> 48:52.140
So Twin Galaxy, a little bit of Judge Judy action here.

48:52.140 --> 48:53.140
They're making a ruling.

48:53.140 --> 48:56.440
Who's making them an authority on what DDR is?

48:56.440 --> 48:57.720
They have already gotten a lot of their...

48:57.720 --> 49:01.040
Because these guys have been around since the 80s, so they're old and sad.

49:01.040 --> 49:04.360
They've gotten their information so freaking wrong.

49:04.360 --> 49:07.260
I mean, it's sad.

49:07.260 --> 49:10.080
They have no concept of how a DDR machine works.

49:10.080 --> 49:12.080
How can they be considered an authority on something?

49:12.080 --> 49:18.280
Let me restate, since 1981, the worldwide authority on player rankings, gaming statistics,

49:18.280 --> 49:19.280
and championship tournaments.

49:19.280 --> 49:22.840
They must be, you know, they're pretty good at that for me to poop on.

49:22.840 --> 49:29.640
I mean, you can't be an authority on something that you apparently know nothing about.

49:29.640 --> 49:33.240
Let's see, uh, let's keep going here, I gotta finish this.

49:33.240 --> 49:39.640
Speaking with Damien, as well as fellow DDR fan and Crazy Taxi world champion, JC Padilla,

49:39.640 --> 49:42.720
Those Crazy Taxi and DDR have so fucking much in common.

49:42.720 --> 49:45.960
Because you use your feet on a button.

49:45.960 --> 49:52.600
Because they both are utilized by ugly people in play.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.880
And also some other local expert players.

49:54.880 --> 50:00.240
Yep, but you'll never be the world champion because you're not ugly like that.

50:00.240 --> 50:03.880
I would love to know who the other local expert players were.

50:03.880 --> 50:09.240
We picked up these random eight year olds from the kindergarten room and we reasoned

50:09.240 --> 50:15.320
We reasoned out the rules and you will see below in their entirety and hope to start locking some more scores on it soon

50:15.840 --> 50:22.780
One of the most important discoveries is the decision that gamers view using the same song up to five times in a row is cheesy

50:23.420 --> 50:28.120
So to be fair my official ruling takes us into consideration. So if you play five songs in a row, that's cheesy

50:30.600 --> 50:34.160
Chat room is going off on this by the way, I'll get to them in a minute

50:34.760 --> 50:36.920
The game itself is pretty intense

50:36.920 --> 50:40.120
Wow, that was intense!

50:40.120 --> 50:45.640
And some players even brought their own combination water spray and fan handheld device to cool

50:45.640 --> 50:47.040
down in between performances.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.720
Did they buy a Walmart for $2?

50:49.720 --> 50:56.840
Along with a Goofy drinking hat filled with SOBY!

50:56.840 --> 50:59.240
An elaborate entourage of people with fans.

50:59.240 --> 51:03.320
I'm picturing one of these fucking dorks wearing those hats with a straw that goes right in

51:03.320 --> 51:11.420
mouth a little thing they can squeeze when they're in between songs.

51:11.420 --> 51:14.060
I wonder if this guy did it playing like Dynamite Rave.

51:14.060 --> 51:15.060
Love to me.

51:15.060 --> 51:17.580
That would be funny.

51:17.580 --> 51:22.140
I are Dynamite Rave-er world champion, yeah.

51:22.140 --> 51:26.560
Though quite the physical game, I am told that players of all ages, shapes, and sizes

51:26.560 --> 51:28.220
have been able to perform well.

51:28.220 --> 51:31.380
Even one player who I am told was in the 300 pound range.

51:31.380 --> 51:35.380
It should also be noted that facial deformities do not affect gameplay at all.

51:35.380 --> 51:38.380
So DDR doesn't discriminate against fat people. That's good to know.

51:38.380 --> 51:42.380
Definitely a game where both eye and foot coordination is required.

51:42.380 --> 51:43.380
Well, duh!

51:46.380 --> 51:48.380
So now here are the rules.

51:48.380 --> 51:59.380
And I would officially like to thank Damien Sarcuni for not only taking the initiative and becoming our first recognized and verified world champion, but to assist me with creating the rules.

51:59.380 --> 52:05.380
So, basically, he made the rules and he's the world champion.

52:05.380 --> 52:06.380
Okay.

52:06.380 --> 52:07.380
Alrighty.

52:07.380 --> 52:13.380
Is this like one of the editor's kids or something?

52:13.380 --> 52:15.820
Anyway, the rules.

52:15.820 --> 52:16.820
You want to read the rules, Jamie?

52:16.820 --> 52:17.820
Go for it.

52:17.820 --> 52:18.820
General rules.

52:18.820 --> 52:23.220
First, player must be performing in single mode.

52:23.220 --> 52:25.780
So no doubles.

52:25.780 --> 52:30.180
Players can compete on either 3-song or 5-song machine setting variations, which is determined

52:30.180 --> 52:31.180
by the arcade proprietor.

52:31.180 --> 52:35.420
Now, if I'm not mistaken, there's also a 4-song machine, so those people are just fucked,

52:35.420 --> 52:36.420
huh?

52:36.420 --> 52:37.420
Yep.

52:37.420 --> 52:38.420
All right.

52:38.420 --> 52:41.020
Referees must log the song difficulty and score per song for all 3 or 5 songs.

52:41.020 --> 52:45.340
The referee, do they wear the black and white shirt too and make bad calls?

52:45.340 --> 52:48.380
They walk around playing, you know, blow my whistle, bitch, with their little whistles

52:48.380 --> 52:49.380
there.

52:49.380 --> 52:50.380
Battle, dammit!

52:50.380 --> 52:51.380
Force.

52:51.380 --> 52:52.380
Okay.

52:52.380 --> 53:05.380
Okay. Players are allowed to utilize the entire duration of the game timers in between songs as rest. This includes song selection and setting selection. Okay, yay, whatever.

53:05.380 --> 53:06.380
Fifth.

53:06.380 --> 53:09.380
Players are allowed to utilize the same song no more than twice.

53:09.380 --> 53:13.380
Oh, so they can play the same song twice, they just can't play it more than twice.

53:13.380 --> 53:16.380
Regardless of whether playing three songs or five songs.

53:16.380 --> 53:19.380
Oh my god, I'm gonna cry. These people make me cry.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.380
At this time...

53:21.380 --> 53:27.380
Twin Galaxies. Twin Galaxies will not be tracking records on the ONI, AKA hell.

53:27.380 --> 53:33.380
First of all, that's incorrect. ONI means ogre. Anyway, hell mode, assuming I spelled that right.

53:33.380 --> 53:39.380
Okay, they're stupid. How can you misspell ONI? O-N-I. You can't misspell it. God.

53:39.380 --> 53:45.380
First of all, they mistranslated the damn thing. ONI does not mean hell. Okay?

53:45.380 --> 53:49.380
You know, hell is what, Jigoku? Aren't I correct?

53:49.380 --> 53:53.380
Um, yeah, how does Jigoku sound like Oni?

53:53.380 --> 53:55.380
Tell me.

53:55.380 --> 53:57.380
That's one of my pet peeves there.

53:57.380 --> 54:01.380
Keep going, girl. You go, girl. Go on with your bad self.

54:01.380 --> 54:06.380
All songs contained within the mix are eligible for selection. I would hope so.

54:06.380 --> 54:10.380
Which means dynamite rave! Love to me! Twice, yay!

54:10.380 --> 54:23.380
The following rules are applicable for each of the three song or five song selections. Only one of the settings, difficulty, can be the player's choice. The rest are determined to be the official T, G, G, and F.

54:23.380 --> 54:25.380
Twin Galaxies scoreboard.

54:25.380 --> 54:34.380
Difficulty player can choose between light, standard, and heavy. Speed has to be on one. Easiest? My butt! 1.5 is easier than one.

54:34.380 --> 54:39.380
Wait a minute! They said speed has to be set to the easiest, which is one. I disagree with that. My God!

54:39.380 --> 54:42.380
Retards! Retards! I hate you.

54:42.380 --> 54:46.380
If they say easiest, then I can play it on 1.5, because that's the easiest.

54:46.380 --> 54:54.380
Boost set to off, appearance set to invisible, turn set to off, others set to off, scroll set to standards.

54:54.380 --> 54:56.380
They don't say anything at all about free zeros.

54:56.380 --> 54:58.380
So you can't do dark reverse, Jamie? Sorry.

54:58.380 --> 54:59.380
No dark reverse!

54:59.380 --> 55:07.380
So why didn't they just say no modifiers since that's pretty much what they're saying here except for difficulty. No modifiers. That's it.

55:08.380 --> 55:10.380
Because there's no modifiers. That's it.

55:11.380 --> 55:15.380
This is going to get beautiful. Keep going. Keep going, Jamie. It only gets better from here, folks. Keep going.

55:16.380 --> 55:25.380
The following rules apply to the scoring of the title. The Twin Galaxies referee must log for tracking purposes the song selection difficulty chosen and final tally for each of the three or five songs.

55:25.380 --> 55:26.380
songs.

55:26.380 --> 55:31.020
At the very end, the TWG referee must manually tally the five-song total.

55:31.020 --> 55:36.340
The three-song machines tally for you at the final score screen.

55:36.340 --> 55:39.980
Note that the sum of the last three songs in the five-song selection are not simultaneously

55:39.980 --> 55:42.700
tracked as the three-song record.

55:42.700 --> 55:47.500
It is understood that as the five-song machines do not display the sum tally of all five songs

55:47.500 --> 55:54.060
at the end, that the discretion and integrity of the TG referee is accepted for such submissions.

55:54.060 --> 55:57.900
song titles are listed in foreign wording for example a song called

55:57.900 --> 56:00.220
okay what the hell is wrong with them

56:00.220 --> 56:05.900
they put this, there's a song called Kamumei

56:05.900 --> 56:09.940
okay the song is fucking kakumei it means revolution

56:09.940 --> 56:12.700
okay first of all but you're allowed to play kamumi

56:12.700 --> 56:14.560
you're allowed to play kamumi

56:14.560 --> 56:18.440
okay you want to know what i'm going to do tonight except that i have work

56:18.440 --> 56:20.280
tomorrow yes i got a job anyway

56:20.280 --> 56:27.280
I'm going to be drafting a letter to these stupid fucks.

56:28.020 --> 56:30.580
And I'm going to... In the chat room right now, they're all going,

56:30.580 --> 56:34.300
rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble.

56:34.300 --> 56:36.060
Okay, these people are idiots.

56:36.060 --> 56:39.300
I'm going to be drafting a letter.

56:39.300 --> 56:42.180
Going item by item.

56:42.180 --> 56:43.660
Why they are wrong.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.740
Black Lab suggested the same thing.

56:45.740 --> 56:48.400
He's with you on that.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.400
You need to get a mob together.

56:50.400 --> 56:54.400
What if we draft up the, you know, we get a few people...

56:54.400 --> 56:56.400
I'm talking, give me a speaker and a microphone.

56:56.400 --> 57:01.400
We get the people together, we draft a letter, have all of us who were agreed with this sign it,

57:01.400 --> 57:03.400
and send it in to them to let them know exactly how stupid they are.

57:03.400 --> 57:08.400
By the way, if you all take screenshots of us playing the game and all beating that score for you.

57:08.400 --> 57:10.400
We have a digital camera.

57:10.400 --> 57:16.400
Well, we got to keep going here because they have their specific rules submissions here.

57:16.400 --> 57:19.700
I might just post about this later, so we're going to keep going with this.

57:19.700 --> 57:46.040
It is the player's responsibility to inform the GG referee what the recognized name of such songs are for

57:46.040 --> 57:54.040
Unfortunately, yeah, I believe we did post this in the chatroom, but if they don't, I did say it was on twingalaxies.com, but if they want to see this article for themselves, there it is.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.040
I just posted a link in the chatroom.

57:56.040 --> 58:02.040
Uh, yeah, we gotta crank all the shit out of it. No, I'm kidding, don't crank call. Be professional, everybody, be professional.

58:02.040 --> 58:08.040
Uh, I believe I was reading now, it wasn't on this page, I thought it was on this page, but I guess it's not.

58:08.040 --> 58:13.040
You can videotape it. You can't take pictures, because those could be altered, but you can videotape it.

58:13.040 --> 58:16.040
So all we gotta do is get a camera and we can videotape the whole thing.

58:16.040 --> 58:21.040
I would be willing to go out there with a camera and tape one, both of you guys breaking the record. That's fine.

58:21.040 --> 58:25.040
And everybody in the chat room is already wanting to go do it too, so they might beat us to it.

58:25.040 --> 58:30.040
But we, if you guys want to be lazy, you don't want to bother with this, we're gonna do it.

58:30.040 --> 58:37.040
This week, watch this. Dark Sakura, Loki, and Sky all smash the world record.

58:37.040 --> 58:40.840
and submit our videotape. You in on this too, Bradley?

58:40.840 --> 58:45.120
I don't know if I'm that good.

58:45.120 --> 58:48.600
Bradley, a five-year-old is that good. You're that good, trust me.

58:48.600 --> 58:53.480
Let me just add, I couldn't PA to save my life,

58:53.480 --> 58:57.120
so this ought to be interesting. If I beat this, this guy really sucks.

58:57.120 --> 59:02.120
So not only will you be seeing us all smashing the world record,

59:02.120 --> 59:06.760
but we'll be submitting an open letter, and we'll post about that on our website

59:06.760 --> 59:10.900
this week sometime. We'll post where you can also add your name to the letter or something.

59:10.900 --> 59:11.900
We'll figure something else.

59:11.900 --> 59:19.280
And if I could send them like the link to the Konami's seventh, seventh mixed up, ranking

59:19.280 --> 59:20.280
page.

59:20.280 --> 59:21.280
Ah.

59:21.280 --> 59:22.280
Internet ranking.

59:22.280 --> 59:24.280
Like hundreds, probably hundreds of people have already beaten that score.

59:24.280 --> 59:25.880
A zillion people have beaten that score.

59:25.880 --> 59:29.800
We should probably go ahead and get that pulled up, but go ahead.

59:29.800 --> 59:30.800
You're going to pull up what?

59:30.800 --> 59:31.800
Internet ranking.

59:31.800 --> 59:32.800
What's how you're pulling up?

59:32.800 --> 59:33.800
Internet ranking.

59:33.800 --> 59:45.800
Here, yeah, yeah, let me do that. Actually, I wanted to check some of these private messages real fast because there's some things going on here. Okay, nothing new there.

59:45.800 --> 59:51.800
And it says that playing it on one speed, you know, that's standard. How is that hard? You know, how is that hard?

59:51.800 --> 59:54.600
I believe

59:54.600 --> 59:59.040
SoCalKicks was already submitting a score of Bastion at a score of C.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.360
No, that's only a hundred eighty five million for what I see. That wouldn't do it, but

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.680
that's only D.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.880
See, that's Max. That's a problem.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:09.680
Max 2 and Max grade differently, so you're not going to be able to get a score on Max

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.120
that beats it because they grade completely differently.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.400
But he just wants to show off that he's elite, so there you go.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:22.400
yeah i don't know if you're in japan dot com has some great stuff too

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.980
secrets

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.760
so-called kicks to show off his send me all these pictures one show off that he's

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.060
lee

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:34.680
uh... no you can't call into the show we don't have phone sorry uh...

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.760
black lab wants to break the record to black lab come with us

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.100
your your local you come with us and break the record with us

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.180
so we're all going to uh... break the world record of the latest ddr players

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.140
in history history

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.940
okay black lives like when and where

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.940
as if i had a video camera in this house i would go

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.260
out to scandia tonight after the show

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.940
because they don't close till ten week we'd be able to make it out there but

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.220
unfortunately have to do this tomorrow or or sometime during the week

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.060
and uh... figure that out

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:07.780
uh... twenty-third maggots wants to point out a hedgehog sleeping in a wet

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.660
paper bag beat that score

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.300
so we will we want to pull up a seven mixin ranking

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.460
the only problem with internet ranking if i remember right it uh...

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.900
tracks the percentages, right?

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:19.660
Not the actual scores?

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:19.940
I don't know.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.860
Let's see.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.100
Oh, it is scores.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:26.540
There's the ones that were just the average non-OD internet

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.900
ranking.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.220
Let's see, I have to find Max2.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.140
There it is.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.180
Let's see, here's the Max2 site, and now I'm

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.260
looking for internet ranking.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.620
Help me read some Japanese here.

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.420
There it is.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.260
Here we go.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.540
Max internet ranking ranking.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.660
we're going to find out the real world champion here

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.220
uh... let's see what

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:52.440
do we vote up for one of these one of the separate people

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.660
what just anyone of these are what

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.560
or they don't have scores

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.100
well they don't have the charts anymore that's the problem

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.400
uh... well

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.460
shit on konami

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.920
shit on konami for not having a score so well

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.820
but trust me they were much better than that

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.000
we guarantee it

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.620
maybe oh maybe i can get it from up here

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:14.700
uh... don't do it

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.340
looked at these down those yet okay let's see

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.660
well there we go

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.420
on uh... one of these

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.900
let's see a hundred thirty nine million five hundred seventy six four nine five

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.780
knots i had to be songs are hard enough i've ever go down like number fifteen

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.860
okay here's a documented score right here four hundred and one million eight

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.100
hundred forty five thousand three hundred twenty five

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.500
that already puts out of the sport of shame so

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.900
uh... there's like

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.900
All these other scores, look at that, they're all higher.

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:45.900
And these, this is a certain set of songs, they're probably not even at all nine footers.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.900
And actually, those are probably just three songs.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.900
No, actually that's including the extra stages.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.900
Oh, including the extra stages this way.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.900
And Kakame.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.900
Wow. Well, poo on twin galaxies.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.900
We're going to take a real quick break, but this break is going to be special.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.600
special. We're going to play some original works during this break. Loki has a new one

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.800
he's going to play for us, so we're going to get that in. And I wanted to get a new

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:17.480
artist in who hasn't been featured on this show yet. I just have to pull up a song here.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:23.640
This is Takeout Kid, and he's got a song called, it looks like Donkey Kong Remix is the name

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.840
of it. Perhaps he'll elaborate on that in the chat room. He's in there right now. And

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.760
we're going to play that creation by him. And then we're going to, I wanted to plug

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:40.760
his website

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.760
So we're going to do some originals this break.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.280
And when we come back, more talk, inventing, and the

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.760
typical kind of anger you'd expect from

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:19.760
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.760
Oh

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.760
The

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.760
The

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.760
The

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.760
The

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.760
The

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.760
The

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.760
The

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.760
Oh

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:40.640
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.640
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Ron, and Jessica

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.640
Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:56.640
under sedation live dot org

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.640
Hope we'll be together

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.640
Now you know that I love you

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.640
Love you, love you, love you, love you

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.640
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.640
Not a little bit of you to see

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.640
The cow has been made up of two foots, you

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.640
But not a little bit of me to see

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.640
Baby, know you gotta try a little bit harder

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.640
So you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.140
It's nice, a little slight, let's enjoy the moment now

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.140
And just have a good time, a good time

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.640
Try it, baby, good, just a little bit of love

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.640
And gonna feel so fine

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.640
Is it really true that you feel the same way too?

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:12.140
And hope we'll be together now

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.140
You know that I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:52.620
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:58.620
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 14, and we've been going off on twingalaxies.com

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:03.220
in their completely made of ass ranking system for Max 2.

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.220
There is one word, two syllables.

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.220
Yes.

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.220
Innane.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:10.140
And we're all on a rampage to go beat that sometime this week.

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:14.660
Black Lab and Dark Tetsuya over the break, by the way, have also joined in on our campaign.

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:18.060
We are all going to go and smash the world record this week sometime.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.820
And we're not doing it to be mean, we're just, well, yeah, we're doing it to be mean.

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:26.420
I mean, I don't know, we're doing it to make a point.

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:32.240
I mean, my God, that's like saying, you know, I'm the best kid on the planet because my

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.140
mommy loves me best.

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:37.660
Honestly, it's like, what's going on?

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.200
Anyway, yeah.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.540
Follow up to last week.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:51.460
Last week we were going off about Naoki's diary, and all sorts of fun dear diaries were

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.020
submitted by the chatroom.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.020
What the hell?

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.020
Let's take some more.

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:57.820
If you guys in the chatroom have more diaries, it's been a week, if you have some more

01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:03.780
diary entries, if you think Naoki has some more diary things that he's written, that

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:07.200
he's maybe just not sharing with us, give us some diary entries.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.300
Submit them to us in the chatroom.

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:13.140
First up, send me a PM, your best Naoki diary entry, and we'll read some more tonight.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.940
Rob, I don't think that they can see that you're waving your hand, you know, it's like

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.820
come on, wave of hand, bringing towards me.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:28.340
By the way, in defense of Rob, because I can read the kana in it, in Naoki's diary, it

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:37.420
I did have Bemani spelled out with the Kana, B, the extending Kana, Ma, and Ni, so it's

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.420
B-Mani.

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:41.020
According to Naoki, it's B-Mani.

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:45.300
B-Mani, radio program!

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.340
So don't be a bee-itch about it.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:54.340
Alright, let's read what Naoki wrote this last week in his diary, shall we say?

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:59.340
I've decided to let Paula Terry write the music, and I'm gonna sing!

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.340
You could probably do a better job.

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:07.340
Naoki's Diary. Time has- oh wait, we need some music, don't you think?

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:11.340
Let's find some music. Let's find some good Naoki music.

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.340
You think you want ever so- Journey to- let's do Journey to Wonderland.

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.340
Let's make that be Naoki's Diary.

01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.340
It's not a Naoki song.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:26.100
But it's funny, and that's what's important.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.620
Time has gone.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:30.620
These days, music games are as common as dirt.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:35.860
But when DDR started in 1998, DDR seemed like the hardest thing in the world to work on.

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:40.300
Even looking back on it today, I feel exhausted just to try to remember it.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:44.340
Now it feels like a sleeping memory deep in my heart.

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.900
That's going to be the next Naoki-san, by the way.

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:46.900
Deep in my heart.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.400
You know, there was still in my heart, still hurt.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.400
And, you know, deep and dive and whatever.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.400
Dive into the butt.

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:01.900
When we began work on DDR, I started writing four pieces of music for the game.

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.400
But as production advanced and the public waited for the release of DDR,

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.900
only one of my songs, Paranoia, was included in the game,

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:13.400
and a major collaboration was formed with the Mushiba EMI's Dance Mania compilation series

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.900
in order to provide the rest of the music.

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.900
Now, if I remember correctly, it wasn't brilliant to you in the first DDR?

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.900
1.5

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.900
Did he just forget? Oh, it's just 1.5?

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:24.900
Uh, hello? What about Trip Machine? That's still him anyways.

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:28.900
Oh, wait! He's not Desire.

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.900
Not Desire.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.900
Whatever. Naoki's getting forgetfulness. He's getting old.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.900
He's got Alzheimer's.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:41.900
Technically, it wasn't the Naoki personality. It was the Desire personality that wrote that song.

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:44.900
So obviously he wouldn't have recollection of that one.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:47.900
Let's see...

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:53.900
The other songs were put on the shelf, and although I was the only person in the world to hear them, they didn't go to waste.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:59.900
The DDR Max 2 song, D2R, was based on some of the songs left out of the original DDR game.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:00.900
D2R!

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:01.900
D2R!

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:07.900
Ah!

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:30.120
The end result is a song that felt very underground

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.480
slash urban.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.200
These days my music is very different.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.720
The royal route, high energy dance songs such as Brilliant to You, Can't Stop Falling in

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:44.920
Love, etc. are my new forte, and although I much prefer them, the underground style

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:58.680
is a projection point in terms of my music.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:04.000
These days I still try to develop the underground style using the Revenge and Desire labels.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.920
Paranoia, Trip Machine, and Make It Better appeared in DDR Internet Ranking Kit 1.5 and

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.520
with every maiden voyage, trial, error, and conflict always appeared from time to time.

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.900
Although my music has moved on and evolved, I still look back on these three songs and

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:24.920
realize that if they hadn't existed, much of my current music wouldn't be possible.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:29.520
In the grand scale of things, these songs are very important to me in my career, especially

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:36.040
when I remember the pressure I was under when I produced them. With the songs completed

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.720
and DDR only... Is that Taco Bell coming back up or something there, Jamie? With the songs

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:50.440
completed and DDR only several months from release, I took a deep breath and prepared

01:19:50.440 --> 01:20:00.640
to face the next challenge, DDR's second mix. Let's read some of the submitted things, shall

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:09.040
we? That was it, that was it. Oh, it also revealed that the Max 3 song, there's going

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:16.680
to be a B4U song called Graduation, hooray. Shock of shocks. Oh my God, B4U and Max 3,

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.680
I was expecting that.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:26.680
Naoki himself, which I believe is just the 23rd Magus disguise, but we won't say anything.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:31.680
Naoki himself says, Dear Diary, my newest song is called Dynamite, Afro Nova, BD24,

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:36.680
UR, Trip Machine, Deeper and Deeper, Eternal Rebirth, Evolution, KZ, Dirty Mix.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:41.680
Wow! I'll buy that for a dollar.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:46.480
says this dear diary I've made a kicking tune for the next DJ Konami tune he

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:50.620
seemed kind of reluctant to use it though DJ dear diary more B for you

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:36.640

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:42.160
SoCalKick submits a follow-up to last week.

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:48.800
Dear Diary, my English, I would like to know what this blow is.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:52.120
And if you missed last week's show, you're just going to have to wait 11 weeks for it

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120
to turn up in the rebroadcast.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:57.520
Dear Naoki, to find out what the blow is, take your vacuum cleaner and stick it on your

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.520
groin.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:59.520
Press the on button.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.520
She's gone.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.720
From suck to blow.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:08.720
Oh, I've been waiting for this one. Here's one from Pyro Man.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.720
Oh, Pyro, I expected so much better from you, but I'll read this anyway.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.720
Dear Diary, I hate my life and want to die.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.720
That's it. Dear Diary, I hate my life and want to die.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.720
Pyro, you're a funnier guy than that. Come on.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.720
You let me down, bud. Let me down.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:26.720
You spent too much time in the whambulance.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.720
Well, after he told me I still wanted it, I knew he would do a better job than Paula.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.720
Thank you, SirDungX.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.720
Dart Tetsuya says,

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.720
Dear Diary, I'm having B4U remix Let Them Move for DDR Max 3.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.720
Then it would be even more out of tune?

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:50.720
Just with more people singing it?

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.720
How about a sim update, Loki? Do you want to talk about what's going on in the sim world?

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.720
Yeah, actually quite a bit is going to be happening next week. We have the site opening again

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.720
Team Gwylo, so they're going to be coming up on Tuesday, so everyone look for that on October 1st there.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:11.720
I don't know what the website's going to be, probably Team Gwylo, but I don't know yet, because they haven't really gotten a host name, so we'll have to wait for that.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:19.720
And then also I heard rumors that the melting pot's going to be coming back up in about a couple weeks too, so we'll have to watch for that.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:27.120
Other than that, still waiting for StepMania Beta-6, DWI, it's been quiet, so don't know

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.520
anything coming out for that, don't really care, kind of abandoned them, and other than

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:40.000
that, there is some major news, the tourney mix 2 is done, and we have results somewhere,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.920
we can pull them up, oh, I suppose I can do that.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.160
We had some locals win, I'm excited for them, we had two locals win, we need to get them

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:55.160
on the show so they can brag.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:38.440
For

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:44.440
The official placing was Clunk Clunk 1655 from Keyboard Mania.

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.440
That was some of the Seattle folks that did that, I believe.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.440
I don't remember the exact name, so I just know they're on that board.

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.440
Second place was Flying to Your Soul.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.440
I have no idea.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:59.440
Third place was The Great Giana Sisters, which was pretty good from what I played.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.440
Now, Public, this is what was actually voted on by the users themselves, not the judges.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:10.440
First place went to Soty Choir Remix, which was our agent Chang.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.440
Second place was Heaven.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:18.440
Third place was QQQ, and that was done by Moogle Hunter.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.440
Yay, local favorite.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.440
Congratulations for them.

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:24.440
Standard, The Great Giana Sisters won for first.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.440
M, the fake 8th style song.

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.440
The fake 8th style song won for second.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.440
And Klung Klung 1655 won for third.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.440
Congratulations to all the winners.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:40.440
Turning Mix 3 has been announced for December.

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.440
They're going to be doing that.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.440
So rules and stuff will be coming out in November.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.440
So look at that.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.440
Congrats to you.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.440
Hold on. SoCalCakes had a...

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.440
His diary entry got chopped up.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.440
That's why it didn't make much sense.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.440
So I'm going to pull up the rest of his diary entry.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.440
He sent it over.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440
Ah!

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.440
I opened up a picture of Jenny Rom.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.440
My bad.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.440
I was about to say, I'm scared.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.440
Let's see.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.440
Dear Diary, my hipster experimentation did not go as well as planned.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.860
Paula begged me not to go, saying she would give me this blow and that she could do a

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:15.860
better job.

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:19.500
But the way she said it, I don't even think that she knows what this blow is anyway.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:23.060
So I continued to go seek this white American who is going to give me the true form of this

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:24.060
blow.

01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:28.200
Well, I quickly made it to Northern California, where this orange site is based, so it says,

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.060
and my research finally led me to an address.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:34.480
I knocked on the door and said, yes, I'm American hipster, knows Naoki before I finish the rest

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.480
of my English.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.960
I would like to know what this blow is.

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.560
Well, after he told me, I still wanted it.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.000
I knew he would do a better job than Paula.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.680
Thanks, gee, thanks.

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.760
Shine get.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:50.560
I get random, I get these random PMs from people.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.200
I just got one that says, shine get.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.500
People are weird.

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:59.860
So now your little thing under your name on the website could be, gives a better blow

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.860
than Politary.

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.520
Oh, maybe we should do that.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.660
Better blowing than poli- can you arrange that for me, Jamie?

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:06.660
Yes.

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:07.660
Alright, thank you.

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.380
Oh, Pyro Man sent another one before he left.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:13.780
Dear Santa, I want a new Politary for Christmas.

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:14.780
I hate you.

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:22.100
I think that Politary's a fembot.

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:25.300
You think Politary's a fembot, huh?

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:29.300
You know what we just did? We just opened the door for people to send this random shit over private message.

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:35.300
Her, along with the B4U girls and Jenny Rom, they're all friends. Especially Jenny Rom.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:39.300
Alright, we're going to take a quick...

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:40.300
Yes?

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.300
Yes, Logie?

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.300
Yes?

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:46.300
New DDRPC characters. What the hell were they thinking?

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.300
It's the gay and lesbian team. I don't know if you noticed.

01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:53.300
It's like bondage goth people. I don't even know what the hell it is.

01:27:53.300 --> 01:28:00.300
The chick's a total dyke. I don't know about the guy, but I'm just assuming it's the gay and lesbian team for DDRPC. Hold on, let me pull it up.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.300
It's very scary.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:15.300
I'm going to KonamiHWI.com slash DDRPC because that's where I can download all the newest and greatest characters.

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.300
And we have the page up.

01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:27.860
And I'm going to link that in the chat room for you folks, because I like you.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:35.580
And they are called Coby and Nicky, and you can see Coby is a cop, and Nicky is just a

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:36.580
dyke.

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:37.580
I don't know how else to explain Nicky.

01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:41.140
Yeah, but I didn't know cops were spiked hats with little skulls and stuff.

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:42.780
And he's already got the handcuffs on.

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.900
He's already ready to bust you.

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.540
I'm going to tie you up, okay?

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:48.660
I'm going to tie you up.

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:53.100

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:57.980

teasing but the rumor is that Jason Enos one's gonna be the last character it's

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:16.100
It's been spread like wildfire everywhere.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.780
We'll see. We'll see. Of course the chat room saying that

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:25.020
Kobe and Nikki are probably supposed to be ravers or clubbers.

01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.420
Yeah, big gay ravers and clubbers.

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:32.300
And apparently Jenny Rom...

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:35.680
Jenny Rom is a sliver slut.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:40.340
Sliver slut!

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:46.600
Okay, we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and by popular

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.260
demand in the chat room, they're begging us to do it tonight because we haven't done it

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:52.340
in a few weeks, we're going to do a listless segment tonight for you guys.

01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:57.440
We're going to do that and then at the end of the show, Jamie's going to give us the

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:01.940
update on the big, big, big tournament we're going to do here in Sacramento.

01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:05.380
The Orange Lounge is one of the many co-sponsors I've called SHAFT.

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:10.300
Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament and Jamie's got all the details for you guys.

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:13.980
By the way, DJ Konami, no Kyle Snyder, please.

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.900
There's going to be no Kyle Snyder character in DDRPC, sorry.

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:19.420
We're going to be doing the

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:20.720
DDR

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:21.660
Shaft

01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.540

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.740

01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:27.540
B-Moni Artist.

01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:30.700
So we'll be making our list during this break.

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.340
So stick around.

01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.220
Stay for our break before we break you.

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.900
Stick around, because we're going to be right back.

01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:38.060
Break down.

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:45.060
in fact I'm saying stick around so much I think I'm just gonna play that

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:18.060
So many nights we end with a completed start

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:27.060
Aren't you really a life that she should have been searching?

01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:30.060
With you, with you, with you

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:33.060
The universe is on its side

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:37.060
I wanna feel with you, with you, with you

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:41.060
Wherever you are, you see you in my eyes

01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:44.060
Why do we speak a lot like this?

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:48.060
I like to share a little more by talking

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:52.060
How can we keep repeating the same old lies?

01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:55.060
You and I, let everything be so new

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:59.060
Why do we speak alone like this?

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:03.060
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.060
Why do we know we'll be together?

01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:10.060
I wanna do it, this and that

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:18.060
Man, I wanna do it, now let's do it

01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:26.060
And let a woman make her be the one

I'm going after yourself, you're such a me

I'm out of state, of what can be

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.060
You can be about to smash this on your own

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:08.060
Honey, don't leave me alone

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:12.060
I'll be your dancing flower, dancing flower, dancing no be

01:35:42.060 --> 01:36:09.100
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 14 and we are getting ready to do our

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:10.100
list list.

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:14.580
a little bit of debate during the break while people were trying to make our lists here

01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:16.700
in the studio.

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:22.260
Trying to think if a singer should be considered a Bamani artist, like could you say Sana on

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:23.340
your list?

01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:27.820
So Brad was in here kind of, wait you've got to talk to the mic.

01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:33.940
Or something like Polteri, because she doesn't, as far as I know, doesn't write anything.

01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:35.420
I still count performers.

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:36.620
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:40.060
I wouldn't consider them an artist, but whatever.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:45.980
So we'll say then, favorite Bamani performer, because that would include everybody, and

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:50.860
then that way you can put Sana on your list, because the way I see it, Let the Snow Paint

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:54.700
Me in Seventh Style, I believe is only credited to Sana and nobody else, and even if she didn't

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:58.460
write it, it's because it's from her album, and I believe somebody made the analogy that

01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:05.240
Britney Spears is considered an artist of erotic dancing, even though she doesn't really

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.240
write her stuff.

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.860
I have to make one quick amendment to the sim update too, Feed a Fury was pushed back

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:16.960
to October 15th, that's the Dreamcast one, and there is a video on the site over at CAGames.com.

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:20.240
Looks interesting, kind of looks like Disney's Dance Magic mode a little bit.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.640
It's going to be interesting.

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.160
It's an interesting idea anyway.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.560
So here we go, we're doing a list, who's participating in today's list?

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.040
I know I am, Jamie is, Loki is, and Bradley?

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.040

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.040
Oh, Brad, you're doing one too?

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.960

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:35.980
rendition of it

Nagumo.

01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:55.420
Whatever.

You've got to spell that for me, buddy.

01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:00.980
Brad?

01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:03.180
Spell that for me so I can type it.

01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:10.300
That is R-E-O space N-A-G-U-M-O.

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:11.300
And what did they do?

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:12.300
Everything.

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:14.780
They did 20 November and...

01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:15.780
Oh, okay.

01:39:15.780 --> 01:38:51.740

01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:52.740

Whatever.

01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:59.300

Brad?

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:02.020
Spell that for me.

01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.220
So I can type it.

01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:10.340
That is R-E-O space N-A-G-U-M-O.

01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:11.340
And what did they do?

01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:12.340
Everything.

01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:17.540
They did 20 November and instant love.

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.180
Alright, alright, fair enough.

01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:24.060
pretty much every beat my I didn't know they're they're saying that's DJ Naguro

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:29.420
same person however we did oh I should establish this we did make the rule in

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:34.420
here that people's multiple egos would not fall under their name so Naoki will

01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:39.300
not count for everything you either got to put revenge or you know Naoki

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:45.100
underground or whatever Naoki doesn't count for everything so okay yes Brad

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.700
you got a number three choice yet no we're going to Bradley Bradley number

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:49.700
I will say Revenge, because I like all of them.

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:52.700
Revenge, because you like all their songs. Good choice!

01:39:52.700 --> 01:40:04.700
And Revenge is the extra stage song, the special extra stage song, if you like AAA or 7, maybe it has to be a flashing 7 or another.

01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:10.700
It's called Sakura and it's a sprit-ule, because they misspelled it.

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.700
Any comments from Dark Sakura?

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:16.700
I'm never going to be able to play that damn song!

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:22.060
All right, my number three choice, and this should come as no surprise for me, but maybe

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:24.180
that I put it so low on my list.

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:27.860
Number three, Erotic, of course.

01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:35.220
Bestest Bomani band ever, well, third bestest Bomani band ever, I don't care what you say.

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:39.060
Chat room is begging that one of us put down Jenny Rom, I don't know, I don't know if anybody

01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:40.060
will see.

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:41.060
All right, Brad.

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:48.060
Okay, well, since Matt got my number three real negumo, I'm gonna have to go with Naoki.

01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:52.060
Naoki, all right. Any particular reason why?

01:40:52.060 --> 01:41:02.060
Well, it was neck and neck with Taka, DJ Taka and Naoki, but I think Naoki's been more responsible for a lot more of my favorite songs.

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:08.060
All right, fair enough. All right, that's our number three choices. On to the number twos. Jamie.

01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:13.060
Number two, well, I have a list here and I'm thinking and thinking and thinking.

01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.060
I'm actually going to say bus stop.

01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:16.060
Bus stop.

01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:21.060
Because, okay, I like long train run-in and I liked, you know, Kick the Can.

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:26.060
I really liked it when it was new and I really dig their remixes.

01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:30.060
You know, they take some of the things you don't really expect and make them really good remixes.

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:33.060
Hey, I'm going to defend for you.

01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:35.060
Well, I'll stand up for you on this.

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:42.060
The Kick the Cam is still a good remix. It's played out as it is. That is a really good remix.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.060
So I have to agree with you.

01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:53.060
Don't forget about how many people were trying to do the Pee Wee Herman tequila dance.

01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:55.060

any other injuries one

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.160
pretty much everything economic has done

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.960
yeah i feel we got

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:30.960
That's a great song. But, um, yeah, pretty much everything, except you're right.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.800
250 B.A.M. is kind of a shit song, but everything else has been wonderful.

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:38.320
Okay, there you go. Alright, Jamie, number one pick.

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.360
This will come as a surprise to absolutely no one. This is my number one choice.

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:46.400
Tack. Rob had it typed up before I said it.

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:53.000
For people who know me, I have been quoted as saying that if I don't marry Dan, I'm going to marry Tack or Margaret Cho.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.240
So, that's basically...

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.240
Fair enough.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:04.520
You know, everything he's done has just, except for Stoic, has made me absolutely orgasmic.

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.520
But Tech has Tran, as it shows in the Stoic video.

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:11.040
He's his girlfriend now.

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:14.360
But Stoic is boring.

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.560
Stoic is a boring song.

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.480
And the video is kind of boring too.

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:23.660
However, every other thing he's done, especially like his, I've been listening to a lot of

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:25.920
that's not what the bar morgan growl

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.140

01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:42.900

Last I checked, he had five of his original pieces for download.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:03.320
If you can't find the site, you know, for people who actually know me, I'll make sure

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:06.720
that they're made available since he had them up for public on his site.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:07.720
Cool.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:11.720
23rd Magus would like you to know that Tomorrow Perfume makes him mess his pants.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:12.720
Okay.

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:16.920

And why do you like Captain Jack?

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:34.040
Because, I don't know. Because he sucks. Whatever.

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.040
Alright. Whatever.

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.040
He does have that butt ugly hoochie model with him.

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.040
Because his Captain Jack...

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:43.040
I thought you didn't like ugly people. What's up with that?

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.040
I didn't like Captain Jack, but his Captain Jack video had a lot of women in wet t-shirts and...

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:49.280
all people

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:52.840
now chat room is getting very angry with us on our choices here we're going to

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.520
these are not alright

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:19.900
I was going to be very surprised if Taka didn't turn up somewhere, but there it is, Bradley

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:23.040
put down Taka, it's his number one choice.

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:32.040
My number one choice, Vincent DeMoor, no question, Vincent DeMoor is my absolute favorite Bomani

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.600
artist, and if you don't like that, you can suck it.

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:36.880
That's a good one.

01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.960
Alright, Brad, your number one choice.

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:44.920
I knew, you know, before that Jamie was going to pick TAC, so that would have been my first

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:47.200
because everything TAC comes out with makes me cream.

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.400
You all have this game rigged, you all are just picking what the others are going to

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:52.400
pick.

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:57.320
So, instead of TAC, I picked LED, because also everything that it ever does makes me

01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.320
cream.

01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320
Oh, good pick.

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:00.320

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:20.480
well that's it

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:21.600
talk is there

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:25.600
Just really briefly, because we were supposed to do this much earlier...

01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:29.600
Oh yeah, the shaft update, please. We'll run a little long, they won't mind.

01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:34.600
Okay. Basically, we've got the perfect attack rules already posted for the upcoming tournament.

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:41.600
Sakbemani hosts another fabulous tournament that will be held at Sacramento-Scandia on Hillsdale.

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:48.600
We've got directions, we have maps, we have the address, we have everything up on Sakbemani.com.

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:55.700
If you go to S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I dot com, there is a link for SHAFT, and that is the whole

01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:56.700
section dedicated to that.

01:59:56.700 --> 02:00:01.580
The only rules we have for a perfect attack right now, well, to be specific, it's accuracy

02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:02.580
attack.

02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:03.580
It is not a true perfect attack.

02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:11.420
If it's a true perfect attack, we're only gauging by perfects, so this is accuracy attack.

02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:16.120
We should have freestyle rules posted by the middle of the week as soon as they're finalized.

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:17.900
So make sure you go there.

02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:21.360
We have a discussion going on on the site of the money.com forum, so be sure to keep

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:22.360
your eye on it.

02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:25.320
There's also a thread on DDR for you to have a tournament discussion.

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:28.720
And I'm not just saying this because I'm involved with the planning of this, but honestly, this

02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:32.780
is going to be one of the biggest tournaments in history, it really will be, assuming we

02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:36.620
get the participation for it, which it sounds like we're going to be getting a lot of support

02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:37.620
for this.

02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:43.280
Honestly, if you live far away, you live a ways away, this is going to be worth the trip.

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:46.520
There's going to be prizes up the wazoo, we've got door prizes.

02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:50.260
We have some really cool door prizes, we can't even announce them yet, they're that good.

02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:56.840
So we'll have to, and we've got Loki donating hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs as prizes.

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:57.840
As door prizes.

02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:58.840
As door prizes.

02:00:58.840 --> 02:00:59.840
Anybody can win this.

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:00.840
Just show up.

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:01.840
Just show the fuck up.

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:02.840
That's all you gotta do.

02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:07.560
So definitely come to tournament November 9th at Sacramento-Scandia.

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:08.560
It's gonna be huge.

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:09.560
Huge.

02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:10.560
Alright.

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:14.360
And also the A-Team freestyle, if you can't, if you're not gonna come for anything else,

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:15.360
come for the A-Team freestyle.

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:20.280
If you want to see what freestyle was two years ago, we are having a blast from the

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.280
past.

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:22.280
We're having a team freestyle mode.

02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:24.280
It's a limited entry.

02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:29.360
We're basically leaving it to...we want past winners of tournaments to participate in at

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:30.360
first.

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:36.240
But if we get enough entrants, we'll open it up.

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:37.480
Final thoughts from everybody in the room?

02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:38.480
Loki.

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:40.560
I don't have any thoughts right now.

02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:44.920
much big stuff's happening next week so you know we'll probably have a lot more

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:51.440
the report on next week so I can't wait all right Dave Kuchaka rules steel drums

02:01:51.440 --> 02:02:02.080

02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:15.160

02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:19.160
