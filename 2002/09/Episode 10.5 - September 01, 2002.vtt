I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and scorching case of purpose.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.700
Kiss my grass, nuge.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.200

Loser.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.500
Lame.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.500
I'm a fart of my face.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.700
Breathing.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.400
Grasping.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.000
Heaving.

01:17.000 --> 01:17.800
Grasping.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.500
Heaving.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.400
Whatever.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.100
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut

01:22.100 --> 01:25.400
while I go listen to my written experience record.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.200
Da da da da da da.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.700
I am your singing solid ground.

01:30.700 --> 01:38.300
Live, but not really, from Roseville Golf Land here, this is Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38.300 --> 01:41.200
This is a special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, I should say.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.700
It's so special, it rides the short bike.

01:43.700 --> 01:46.200
It's episode number 10.5.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.300
We're calling it 10 and a half.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.300
Episode 10 and a half of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.200
Because this isn't Sunday, but we're fooling you.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.300
This is our special Labor Day edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.100
Because we refuse to labor the day before Labor Day.

01:59.100 --> 02:02.780
Yes, Jamie and I are going to be taking the weekend off, so as you're listening to this

02:02.780 --> 02:05.700
right now, Jamie and I are off somewhere vacationing.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.700
I don't want to know what you're off doing.

02:07.700 --> 02:08.700
Somewhere sunny.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.900
This is something I know who you'll be with.

02:10.900 --> 02:15.180
Actually, well actually at the point that you're listening to this, probably Sunday

02:15.180 --> 02:19.620
night at 7 o'clock, I'm probably going to be in Sunnyvale actually, so I might be getting

02:19.620 --> 02:20.620
interviews and things like that.

02:20.620 --> 02:21.620
Take me.

02:21.620 --> 02:24.540
I wish I could, but I'm spending all weekend and you know.

02:24.540 --> 02:26.260
I'll just make Dan take me.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.260
It's a private getaway.

02:27.260 --> 02:28.260
You should make Dan take you.

02:28.260 --> 02:30.060
And now Dan's gonna be here tonight, correct?

02:30.060 --> 02:30.560
Somewhere.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.460
We're gonna have to get an interview with him at some point.

02:32.460 --> 02:33.160
Oh, God.

02:33.160 --> 02:33.660
So...

02:34.160 --> 02:37.360
For those who are uninformed, Dan is my significant other,

02:37.360 --> 02:40.660
also known as the great and terrible Dan Man X,

02:40.660 --> 02:42.360
also known as Gunstar Hero,

02:42.360 --> 02:44.960
for people who have seen me mention that, so...

02:44.960 --> 02:45.460
Right on.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.460
So, yes, also known as Big Hater of Bimani.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.260
He is not a big hater of Bimani.

02:50.260 --> 02:52.860
He's the one who got all, you know, who, like, you know,

02:52.860 --> 02:55.060
creamed his pants when he's played Guitar Freaks.

02:55.060 --> 02:55.760
Guitar Freaks.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.360
There you go, Guitar Freaks is where it's at.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.080
Visual no, nobody's allowed to vision

03:06.600 --> 03:11.920
So, yeah, we're it's gonna be a very experimental show tonight, it might not even be two hours long

03:11.920 --> 03:15.800
It might be a weird kind of segment. We're kind of trying to divvy this up in a little segment

03:15.800 --> 03:20.280
So Brad is our timekeeper right now. He'll let me know when we hit 40 minutes for the first segment, right?

03:20.480 --> 03:25.140
We hit yes. Yes. Yes. In fact, we are now at a minute and a half right on

03:25.140 --> 03:28.140
So, um, I'm gonna introduce everybody that's sitting out.

03:28.140 --> 03:30.140
Now, I guess we should explain the layout.

03:30.140 --> 03:31.140
I wish this was TV sometimes.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.140
So we're gonna explain the layout of Rozo Golf in a little bit.

03:33.140 --> 03:34.140
Webcam, webcam.

03:34.140 --> 03:35.140
No webcam tonight.

03:35.140 --> 03:38.140
In fact, there hasn't been a webcam any week except the first week.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.140
We gotta get that fixed.

03:39.140 --> 03:40.140
But we will, we promise.

03:40.140 --> 03:44.140
Actually, um, episode 11 next week is gonna be a very different show

03:44.140 --> 03:46.140
because we're gonna have a new intro.

03:46.140 --> 03:47.140
Yes.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.140
I've already got one planned out.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.140
And hopefully a new site and everything.

03:50.140 --> 03:51.140
Oh, you don't like the idea of a new intro?

03:51.140 --> 03:52.140
No, I love the intro.

03:52.140 --> 03:54.140
It has right now.

03:54.140 --> 03:57.980
Well, we might we might dig it out of the archives occasionally. We'll use it for tonight's show

03:59.040 --> 04:01.040
We get the look from Irene

04:01.520 --> 04:06.500
Anyway, I'm gonna introduce the people that are up here upstairs right now because we get some people here that we don't normally

04:06.960 --> 04:13.100

Haha.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Anyway, more for my Vegas story.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yes.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Cause I am the mic whore now.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.960
I just want to warn the listeners that there's a Tonight Show very different, very random.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.420
Could be the best show we ever do.

10:13.420 --> 10:14.420
Could be the fucking worst.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.420
You can hear a burp.

10:15.420 --> 10:18.660
Anyway, oh, yeah, there's more about burp later. Anyway

10:19.780 --> 10:23.420
No, no, I want a dog in one of the crane games once again

10:23.420 --> 10:29.100
I raped the crane game and I want a dog in named him burp now did the rate did the crane game call the police did?

10:29.100 --> 10:31.100
It's oh, bye. Bye. Bye later

10:31.220 --> 10:33.160
I was she left

10:33.160 --> 10:39.460
you know who I feel that one of our regular listeners slinky also known as will was here and like ready to be on the

10:39.460 --> 10:43.060
Show and you know, we were supposed to start taping at 730 tonight

10:43.060 --> 10:47.340
And well, you know we we got here and we thought oh, we'll play one bimani game

10:47.340 --> 10:49.540
and then we'll tape and then one kind of turned into five and

10:50.300 --> 10:53.580
By the time we were ready to tape slinky's parents showed up and took him home

10:53.580 --> 10:59.020
So I know last I saw him he was you know napping in the the sumo game. Oops. So sorry slinky

10:59.020 --> 11:01.780
We'll get you on another show. We love you parents

11:02.500 --> 11:07.760
Maybe away from the show. Oh you guys have to get going. Well, wait before okay

11:07.760 --> 11:08.700
We'll take a break from the biggest story

11:08.700 --> 11:11.500
You want to plug your your new role-playing game that's coming out?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
Because this is pretty cool. You want to plug it?

11:13.500 --> 11:17.500
Okay, I guess so. My new game that I made after three years of work with me as the sole programmer,

11:17.500 --> 11:23.500
my friend Steve as the sole artist, is an epic-sized role-playing game in 2D.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.500
It's an epic computer game.

11:26.500 --> 11:32.500
It's actually a parody of a lot of RPGs, and it's all funny, and it's all cool, and it's all awesome.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.500
It's in beta testing right now, and I've gone through about 400 different beta versions.

11:35.500 --> 11:40.500
But I'm getting good feedback, starting to get some good feedback, and pretty soon it's going to be released public.

11:40.500 --> 11:45.900
Look, I have played the game, it's very cool. Imagine kind of like Dragon Warrior, but like Bitchy.

11:45.900 --> 11:57.300
Actually, it's a lot like Earthbound as well, which wouldn't surprise me because Earthbound is, as some may or may not know, is Rick's most godly RPG ever.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.900
My favorite game of all time.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.500
The battles really remind me of Earthbound battles.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.300
Uh-huh. Shmack.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.500
Do you get a bat as a weapon?

12:05.500 --> 12:14.500
You actually get several bats as a weapon. You can have a rock as a weapon, or you can have a stick with a little nail poked through it. That's what it's called, a stick with a nail poked through it as a weapon.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
No orange bat of justice?

12:16.500 --> 12:19.500
No, but there's a hammer of justice that you get in the courthouse.

12:19.500 --> 12:25.500
Cool. Oh, you know the always clever deer carcass, right? The animal carcass you can use to fight with?

12:25.500 --> 12:32.500
Yeah, that's true. That's actually roadkill. You can use roadkill. And the theory is that it stinks so bad it's bound to hurt your enemies.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.900
indian and and and i think that they got out

12:35.900 --> 12:39.300
the car dot yeah that's actually the notice the double chin there was a name

12:39.300 --> 12:40.460
by soon jeff

12:40.460 --> 12:42.460
uh... which he always got a dog off

12:42.460 --> 12:43.460
sisters

12:43.460 --> 12:47.500
so it's really powerful is very very powerful and yeah i think i got out of

12:47.500 --> 12:48.820
the people with your daughter that

12:48.820 --> 12:51.340
that's embarrassing adults and they see a guy that

12:51.340 --> 12:52.540
exactly

12:52.540 --> 12:53.540
at what myself

12:53.540 --> 12:56.100
i don't want daily are there any

12:56.100 --> 12:59.340
are there any of the money references in the game did you try it all incorporate

12:59.340 --> 13:02.740
DDR taking over my fucking life thing in there or...

13:02.740 --> 13:03.940
uh...

13:03.940 --> 13:06.820
you know what there's so many jokes in there so many

13:06.820 --> 13:08.540
megabytes of

13:08.540 --> 13:10.540
just text jokes

13:10.540 --> 13:15.220
uh... that i can't even imagine that i didn't stick a few bimani jokes in there

13:15.220 --> 13:19.900
right on so any expected time release like in time for christmas to put under

13:19.900 --> 13:22.740
the tree i'm hoping actually did to be done with it by uh... the end of

13:22.740 --> 13:23.820
september

13:23.820 --> 13:27.380
i'm thinking as far as that goes we're getting really close to done yeah bug

13:27.380 --> 13:32.900
Counts we're not getting anything back at all. Well. I haven't played it the new one yet, so we'll see

13:32.900 --> 13:35.800
I'm the stickler on beta testing so we'll see we're done with that

13:35.800 --> 13:39.460
We're moving on to Cedric the Littlest Demon where you fight the devil then you fight Mitch in limbo

13:39.460 --> 13:41.460
And then you fight not I'm sorry Nietzsche

13:41.900 --> 13:45.340
Limbo and then you have to fight God in heaven, and then you win the game when you can kill God

13:46.140 --> 13:48.580
So we're hoping that that killing the god

13:49.060 --> 13:53.020
Are you selling on this black matrix II though have you ever heard of black matrix?

13:53.020 --> 13:54.280
No, uh-uh.

13:54.280 --> 14:00.520
Black Matrix is an RPG where, in their universe, God and Satan fought, and Satan won.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.520
Ooh, cool.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.020
So you play as the slave of a dominatrix.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.520
I'm down with that, yo.

14:05.520 --> 14:10.520
Um, is it going to be something you have to pay for, or is it going to be completely free, or what's the deal?

14:10.520 --> 14:15.520
QDRPG is going to be totally free, depending on how many people we get playing it.

14:15.520 --> 14:20.520
We may or may not do Cedric free as well, but QDRPG 2, which is going to be completely different,

14:20.520 --> 14:24.920
have absolutely nothing to do with QDRPG 1 whatsoever. As most, as most old Nintendo

14:24.920 --> 14:29.800
sequels didn't like, like Castlevania 2, nothing like the first at all. Uh huh, yeah, they're

14:29.800 --> 14:32.440
gonna be completely different, it's gonna be a completely different idea, we're definitely

14:32.440 --> 14:35.660
gonna charge for that, and we're actually, the game after that's gonna be 3D. But we

14:35.660 --> 14:39.320
still get free copies, right? Always gonna get free copies from all my friends, always.

14:39.320 --> 14:44.800
Alright guys, but you guys listening have to pay, haha. Alright later, thanks for interviewing.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.400
And we'll let all our listeners know when QDRPG is released and where you can get a

14:48.400 --> 14:54.280
copy of it if you like them rpg-type games and before we change the subject

14:54.280 --> 14:57.880
i don't think rick brought it up i have to give some credit to timmy timmy did an

14:57.880 --> 15:01.880
awesome job on the soundtrack on this game it's if you like uh technoish type

15:01.880 --> 15:04.800
of music and stuff like that it's it's great it's got good music and uh

15:04.800 --> 15:08.520
probably the best thing that i like about this game it's just full of great

15:08.520 --> 15:12.480
jokes and cheesy shit like that you gotta play it it's not gonna be like

15:12.480 --> 15:16.400
diablo style graphics or anything if that's what you're expecting but it's

15:16.400 --> 15:21.220
It's just, it's like, it's 8-bit goodness is what I kinda, it's a cross between Super

15:21.220 --> 15:22.220
Nintendo and Nintendo.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.220
It's a little more than 8-bit.

15:23.220 --> 15:24.220
Yeah, maybe like 10-bit.

15:24.220 --> 15:25.220
Three and a half!

15:25.220 --> 15:26.220
You wanted to say something, Irene?

15:26.220 --> 15:36.180
Oh, did he say something about fighting Nichi on there, the philosopher guy?

15:36.180 --> 15:37.180
That's gonna be in the next game.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.180
Yeah, that's what I mean.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.180
In the next game.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.180
Yep.

15:40.180 --> 15:41.180
The philosopher guy or whatever?

15:41.180 --> 15:42.180
I guess, yeah.

15:42.180 --> 15:44.180
Knowing Rick, yeah.

15:44.180 --> 15:50.000
it would be rather wrong to like fight him with the Bruce's philosopher song in

15:50.000 --> 15:54.680
the background and then you'll get was represent who's very ready stable the

15:54.680 --> 16:00.520
armies yeah run by Jesus and Santa the holidays and such stuff like that it's

16:00.520 --> 16:04.920
it's great just different references throughout the entire game it's good

16:04.920 --> 16:09.280
stuff so back so yes they get to the biggest trip well we wanted we wanted to

16:09.280 --> 16:14.000
make sure we got Rick's plug on the air for you had to go so okay well anyway I

16:14.000 --> 16:15.440
I was in Vegas and y'all weren't.

16:15.440 --> 16:21.320
So basically when we first got there,

16:21.320 --> 16:23.320
it was basically all the moderators hanging out together.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.360
Well, I mean, we were all of us moderators anyway.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.280
We went to the food court to hang out.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.080
I played $10 worth of nickels and then won like five of it

16:31.080 --> 16:34.280
back on video poker, which I apparently own at.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.800
And then my total winnings for the whole week,

16:36.800 --> 16:41.100
it was like $2.95, which is part of my cab there.

16:41.100 --> 16:41.600
Notable.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.680
Is that how much a foot long those hot dogs

16:43.680 --> 16:48.480
I did not buy an elephant penis. They were selling these hot dogs that were like two

16:48.480 --> 16:54.640
feet long and really fat so they were being referred to as elephant peni. As the cock

16:54.640 --> 17:02.120
of the elephant. Anyway, so as it went on that night we went to the Rio for the gigantic

17:02.120 --> 17:08.280
humongous seafood buffet. It was like 30 bucks but you could get sashimi, Maine lobster,

17:08.280 --> 17:12.680
You know, Kalamari, all kinds of cool awesome seafood.

17:12.680 --> 17:17.800
And then, you know, that night at the Rio, there was this awesome Perfect Attack showdown

17:17.800 --> 17:23.920
between Pot Guy and Anowon, or Nor as he's also known.

17:23.920 --> 17:31.080
There's also, Blue was also showing off some pretty, pretty awesome double skills, you

17:31.080 --> 17:34.720
know, going up into the sixes and sevens on some of those.

17:34.720 --> 17:39.000
I, of course, raped the crane machine there and ended up giving up a lot of my stuff.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.060
Walking back, we were going back inside of the hotel and all of a sudden I hear,

17:43.060 --> 17:44.060
TDR Freak!

17:44.060 --> 17:50.340
And that's when our Stalker fanboys DJ Bubbles and his friend found us, who I guess apparently

17:50.340 --> 17:57.360
they came from out of town to find us and buy coffee for us or something.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.360
Cool.

17:58.360 --> 18:03.880
But the next day, well, I didn't fall asleep until after 7am for some reason because I

18:03.880 --> 18:10.280
was really tired. Too much excitement. We went to the Game Land arcade, which was freaking

18:10.280 --> 18:18.280
amazing. That arcade, I played Mambo-a-Go-Go there. Mambo! No, forget this, for two tokens

18:18.280 --> 18:26.720
a play. DDR Max 2 for two tokens a play. Right on. Beat Mania 3, six core, for two tokens

18:26.720 --> 18:35.100
play. Radiant Silver Gun for one. We apologize to your speakers. That was

18:35.100 --> 18:39.580
literally my reaction. I had played the photo game in Biohazard Gun Survivor 2

18:39.580 --> 18:44.860
which was really amazing. The arcade owned and of course we were showing up

18:44.860 --> 18:51.700
the, well I didn't, but the locals were sort of sitting there you know mouth open

18:51.700 --> 18:52.740
watching

18:52.740 --> 18:56.480
as uh... some of the more notable freestylers namely uh...

18:56.480 --> 18:58.260
meldy deejay ball

18:58.260 --> 19:00.460
uh... story making excited over there

19:00.460 --> 19:04.100
past memories of boomtown

19:04.100 --> 19:06.700
in reno

19:06.700 --> 19:10.580
you know they were they were showing their stuff and uh...

19:10.580 --> 19:13.900
and then everybody went back to some people wanted to guess the old

19:13.900 --> 19:15.500
no we i i heard about

19:15.500 --> 19:17.700
well i heard about

19:17.700 --> 19:20.860
that i guess there was some kind of pump it up challenge going on

19:20.860 --> 19:24.400
that was friday night i was fighting apparently one of the locals got really

19:24.400 --> 19:25.960
pissed off

19:25.960 --> 19:29.680
you still have a spotlight doesn't matter

19:29.680 --> 19:34.040
and he was basically getting out of a prop cycle so i was happy

19:34.040 --> 19:36.640
uh... his pops i close the best game ever

19:36.640 --> 19:37.880
but in town

19:37.880 --> 19:42.500
uh... anyway back to saturday night uh...

19:42.500 --> 19:46.920
uh... iguana girl islander and i all it's a strategic experience that up with

19:46.920 --> 19:51.060
my friend, um, uh, Tiara and her, uh, her man, Rick, which you have to do.

19:51.060 --> 19:54.200
If you ever go to Vegas, whether you're a fan of the show or not, it's just the

19:54.200 --> 19:57.420
coolest thing in Vegas, I think shut up.

19:57.460 --> 20:02.620
Well, we went sober once and then we, we had a warp core breach.

20:03.220 --> 20:07.540
We basically between the, the three of us, between me, Iguana girl and Islander,

20:07.940 --> 20:13.240
we had, um, a large, they, they shared a large one and a small one.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.460
and then I had a small one all to myself.

20:15.460 --> 20:19.000
And, ooh, okay, I just got given a tape, so I got a tape.

20:19.000 --> 20:19.840
Tall just showed up.

20:19.840 --> 20:20.680
You wanna say hello to everybody in the...

20:20.680 --> 20:21.960
Your CD's in the car.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.920
In, what up, my niggers?

20:23.920 --> 20:24.760
Oh.

20:26.700 --> 20:27.540
Anyway.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.440
You can address those cards and letters to Tall,

20:29.440 --> 20:32.080
courtesy of Tall's house.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.360
I was telling a story.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.760
Sorry, yes, finish your story.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.560
Anyway, so after my friends left,

20:40.560 --> 20:46.300
We had this drunken walk over to Circus Circus so Iguana Girl could play the old machine

20:46.300 --> 20:51.140
up in the Midway, which was ass on the right player's side because half the buttons didn't

20:51.140 --> 20:52.140
work.

20:52.140 --> 20:54.300
That's the same machine that I played DDR on for the very first time with Circus Circus.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.300
You lost your DDR Virginity.

20:55.300 --> 20:57.300
Yes, lost my DDR in...

20:57.300 --> 20:58.300
It's a USA machine.

20:58.300 --> 21:04.420
Now the 1.5 is downstairs and actually has a good pad, last time I played, but anyway.

21:04.420 --> 21:05.420
There was more...

21:05.420 --> 21:06.660
No, we don't have 4th Plus yet.

21:06.660 --> 21:13.040
There was more staying up until all hours of the morning and playing a taboo, drunken

21:13.040 --> 21:17.780
taboo which was like the absolute winner and that actually had the quote of the evening

21:17.780 --> 21:24.420
which was, it's like a penguin but it's in this place where the British used to send

21:24.420 --> 21:29.940
their criminals and that was trying to get them to say kangaroo.

21:29.940 --> 21:35.140
Yes this is, because you know taboo, you have a list of five words that you cannot use to

21:35.140 --> 21:38.100
to describe your main word that's on the thing, and you have a timer.

21:38.100 --> 21:40.180
Like, I used penguin twice.

21:40.180 --> 21:42.820
I was using penguin for tuxedo, and I used penguin.

21:42.820 --> 21:46.940
It's like, it's colored like a penguin, but it's equine for a zebra.

21:46.940 --> 21:47.440
What?

21:47.440 --> 21:48.740
You know, mine made sense.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.220
I don't know where you'd get, you know, kangaroo.

21:50.220 --> 21:50.860
Kangaroo?

21:50.860 --> 21:51.620
I'm lost.

21:51.620 --> 21:55.100
And the other best one, it's like, I was trying

21:55.100 --> 21:59.220
to get someone to say the word blow, and the quote was,

21:59.220 --> 22:01.620
it's like, if I wanted you to suck my cock,

22:01.620 --> 22:04.140
you would be giving me a blank job.

22:04.140 --> 22:12.460
so did they get it yes actually they got it and our team actually did get the the kangaroo so

22:12.460 --> 22:18.860
that was we just started we just started listing off australian you know animals like koala kangaroo

22:18.860 --> 22:27.180
so anyway um the next the next day was um you know we all checked out and a bunch of people went to

22:27.180 --> 22:31.740
this other buffet and i went to all you can eat sushi with my friend and hung out at circus circus

22:31.740 --> 22:37.500
and got to play Tsurugi which is the best game ever it's basically um it's like mocap boxing in

22:37.500 --> 22:43.740
um and uh police 911 only you have a sword with a light sensor and you get to you know cut people

22:43.740 --> 22:48.940
in half and cut off their head and cool us name is blade of honor uh apparently dj aba found a

22:48.940 --> 22:54.220
techno motion machine at um Excalibur in the basement but i didn't get to play it unfortunately

22:54.220 --> 23:03.180
And I played Pump It Up Perfect, but it was, you know, a crappy broken one, and they had

23:03.180 --> 23:10.860
a brave firefighters machine, Ferrari F-355, you know, the full three monitor one.

23:10.860 --> 23:15.780
New York New York had an awesome arcade for the casinos.

23:15.780 --> 23:17.940
But the best arcade you went to would be that game?

23:17.940 --> 23:18.940
Oh, Gameland.

23:18.940 --> 23:22.500
Gameworks is ass, except they have Sonic Fighters there.

23:22.500 --> 23:26.340
Tekken 4 on a projection TV with a couch with controllers attached to it

23:26.340 --> 23:31.880
Oh cool. This is good for people to know because Vegas is a big tourist spot. You know everybody guitar freaks there

23:31.880 --> 23:35.460
It sucks in the DVR is a USA machine, and they overpriced everything

23:35.460 --> 23:38.160
It's like a dollar fifty for planning with a machine. Oh, it's like the metreon

23:38.300 --> 23:43.140
Yeah, but it's like ass at least it's you know the decor is better, and they play good trance in the background

23:45.300 --> 23:48.760
How many places did you guys go all over the damn city?

23:48.760 --> 23:52.760
Did you get to see any showgirls or, you know, did you go to any TV bars?

23:52.760 --> 23:59.760
Dude, this one drag queen showgirl gave me a flyer and people were collecting pictures of the boobs.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.760
Did you get any free prawn?

24:01.760 --> 24:04.760
I didn't want any free prawn because there was like...

24:04.760 --> 24:06.760
The free prawn in Vegas is stupid.

24:06.760 --> 24:14.760
It was like they were all ugly and they were fake boobs and one of them was a man because you could see the Adam's apple.

24:14.760 --> 24:24.720
apple anyway so that this is actually starting to lead into my fuck you of the

24:24.720 --> 24:34.880
week now we don't have the music backdrops tonight we can edit that in

24:34.880 --> 24:40.400
anyway so my fuck you of the week and starts off with us getting out with

24:40.400 --> 24:46.000
Iguana Girl Jessica and I getting on the plane and this like really rude asshole

24:46.000 --> 24:51.840
was on his cell phone and he kept bumping into her but she didn't say

24:51.840 --> 24:54.080
anything about it and then he bumped into me and knocked me into a pole so I

24:54.080 --> 24:57.200
turned he was you know just doing he's like oh I'm on this little cell phone

24:57.200 --> 24:59.120
things that make you look like you're talking to yourself and you ride the

24:59.120 --> 25:03.800
short bus forever so he like you saw any like it was completely oblivious to the

25:03.800 --> 25:12.440
what I fucking hate people who do that shit anyway so um so anyway um we um we

25:12.440 --> 25:16.120
uh I turn around and said you know excuse me you need to watch what you're

25:16.120 --> 25:20.040
doing you know I thought something's like oh I'm having five conversations at

25:20.040 --> 25:23.920
once and then he just started walking off so like that's an excuse we were

25:23.920 --> 25:26.040
over there laughing at him when they told him to turn off his cell phone

25:26.040 --> 25:29.480
before takeoff because apparently he didn't hear that either and then there

25:29.480 --> 25:32.320
was this guy behind me whose kid kept kicking me in the back of the chair I

25:32.320 --> 25:37.280
I kept looking at the kid and I was just talking to Jessica, you know, minding my own business was like, yeah

25:37.280 --> 25:41.560
my fight was okay except I kept getting kicked in the butt and he's like stop whining and apparently he kept bitching when I

25:41.800 --> 25:44.840
driving him out listening to my, you know, Luna C

25:45.400 --> 25:50.360
compilation. He was, you know, he was a fucktard. So fuck him and fuck the guy on the cell phone and

25:51.360 --> 25:56.560
my other fuck you of the week goes to the unemployment development department

25:56.560 --> 26:02.080
Which, okay, I didn't get any sleep last night, so forgive me for slurring a little bit and

26:02.080 --> 26:03.080
being tired and bitchy.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.080
She just sounds a little drunk.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.080
She's a little hungover.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.560
And I'm PMSE, so don't give me any bullshit.

26:08.560 --> 26:13.240
Anyway, um, I tried to get out of it.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.240
I couldn't get out of it.

26:14.240 --> 26:22.560
So I hop on the bus at 10am, go all over freakin' Sacramento to try to get to, um, basically

26:22.560 --> 26:26.080
it's where Stockton Boulevard and Broadway meet, but it's like another block past that.

26:26.080 --> 26:32.580
at 50th and Broadway. I got down there, kept napping on the bus. I got there at a quarter

26:32.580 --> 26:38.140
after one. This is from getting on the bus at 10. Wow. And I was there for 30 minutes.

26:38.140 --> 26:42.640
The guy was so condescending and was talking down and I probably had more brain in my butt

26:42.640 --> 26:50.220
than he did in all of his head. So, you know, basically I got out of there as fast as possible

26:50.220 --> 26:56.760
and got home at like a quarter after five o'clock and decided and just wolf

26:56.760 --> 27:00.920
down all these espresso beans so I'm a combination of tired and hyper so fuck

27:00.920 --> 27:05.200

28:10.920 --> 28:12.920

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920

28:17.920 --> 28:19.920
Rob isn't being nice this week.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.920
The penguin has a Fuck of the Week.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.920
And I played Max Unlimited so many fucking times.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.920
I'm guessing over 30.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.920

29:11.040 --> 29:14.400
Roosevelt Golf Land for not having fourth plus yet even though we're here

29:14.400 --> 29:17.680
right now he just pretty much loitering is what we're doing we're just sitting

29:17.680 --> 29:22.120
upstairs we're in the party area right now where you a lot of party and going

29:22.120 --> 29:27.680
up on yeah this employee came by and looked at us funny earlier like are they

29:27.680 --> 29:31.320
supposed to be here apparently so because we have the microphones and is

29:31.320 --> 29:34.800
that any different than usual they always look at us funny true that's when

29:34.800 --> 29:40.400
we're playing. That's when Rob's playing Deluxe. Let's go interview employees, that sounds

29:40.400 --> 29:44.980
like fun. Well we can do that in a later segment. I think actually what I want to do, maybe

29:44.980 --> 29:50.740
next segment, is maybe just be mobile. Since we have a mobile unit here, maybe we'll walk

29:50.740 --> 29:54.900
around and tour Golf Land and give our opinions on the games. We'll talk about every single

29:54.900 --> 30:01.600
thing that is broken. Like everything? Yeah, like everything. So it'll be a nice long day.

30:01.600 --> 30:07.040
got two hours to fill

30:07.040 --> 30:11.060
since we just kinda got off the whole vegas thing i was recently in vegas and i

30:11.060 --> 30:14.020
happen to come across a dance dance revolution tournament

30:14.020 --> 30:15.660
alright they had um...

30:15.660 --> 30:19.820
uh... perfect attack and a freestyle tournament and they had forty slots for each

30:19.820 --> 30:21.500
i got like eleventh

30:21.500 --> 30:25.220
like the eleventh slot for freestyle so i was good there i definitely got to play

30:25.220 --> 30:30.160
but i got forty one on the perfect attack and that pissed me off

30:30.160 --> 30:35.020
and somebody somebody dropped out so i got forty so i'm like yes but i played

30:35.020 --> 30:36.240
last

30:36.240 --> 30:40.660
so you know i was waiting for like what four hours to play some like that so you

30:40.660 --> 30:45.340
know i get there and i play my freestyle and i did great i loved it i had fun i'd

30:45.340 --> 30:47.620
did all three the songs perfectly

30:47.620 --> 30:50.580
and then the guy that goes after me does a fucking backflip

30:50.580 --> 30:53.940
over the freakin rail and goes through and hits is

30:53.940 --> 30:57.500
i don't know how he did it but i got second there so i got a cd i got a cd

30:57.500 --> 30:58.260
player

30:58.260 --> 31:03.060
And then Imperfect Attack, I played the last, and I triple-a'd a couple of songs.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.960
And that was, um...

31:04.960 --> 31:05.900
Wow, you know?

31:05.900 --> 31:09.700
So I got first place, five hundred bucks. And there's, um...

31:09.700 --> 31:11.160
You know, that's my story.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.040
Sweet! Congratulations.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.380
I didn't know we had a local that owned the Vegas tournament. That's news.

31:16.380 --> 31:20.540
I've noticed that there's a different breed of freestyle in Vegas, you know.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.800
Thanks, Sock.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.660
Hey there.

31:24.660 --> 31:26.400
The views and opinions of our guests.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.920
yeah uh... the vegas freestylers suck okay

31:29.920 --> 31:33.160
and i've noticed lots of lots of eighteen action going on so when i broke

31:33.160 --> 31:36.000
out my new freestyle love to me i had a crowd

31:36.000 --> 31:40.760
i found a place for my freestyle vegas here i come

31:40.760 --> 31:42.920
that was a dynamite raid

31:42.920 --> 31:46.800
this announcement now when we have our tournament at uh... hopefully we know

31:46.800 --> 31:50.160
we're trying to get it for some game room

31:50.160 --> 31:51.600
because they didn't maybe

31:51.600 --> 31:55.040
it that we may have a particular issue maybe a new machine coming in that we

31:55.040 --> 31:59.120
we want to have another tournament on. I can't say anything about it. Can't say until it

31:59.120 --> 32:02.720
comes in, but. But if we have, we're either going to have it here or there, here at Roseville

32:02.720 --> 32:07.680
Golf Land or there, if ever I hear back from management. Anyway, um, I'm going to try to

32:07.680 --> 32:12.000
contact them again, but back to what I was saying. One of the freestyle segments is going

32:12.000 --> 32:19.320
to be 18 style freestyle. Oh God. So you will be encouraged to pull out your best knee drops,

32:19.320 --> 32:24.600
hand plants, backflips, but no matrix walk. Aw, no matrix walks. It's pretty much going

32:24.600 --> 32:31.600
the replacement for improv freestyle is just uh... Yes, because improv was where it was a novel idea, the novelty belongs in the library.

32:31.600 --> 32:40.600
It was a novel idea, just a lot of shitty entrants, and sorry to those who entered improv freestyle. There were some good ones, but a lot of you got up there and PA'd.

32:40.600 --> 32:44.600
It wasn't necessarily that the skill was bad, it was that they got some ass steps. You know, we...

32:44.600 --> 32:50.600
I don't know if it was ass steps or me, but mine really sucked.

32:50.600 --> 33:01.600
Actually, part of the problem was that, you know, our bad, we picked, I should just say my bad, blame me, I was in freestyle, I thought, oh, four to six feet songs, people can improv those, those aren't too bad.

33:01.600 --> 33:11.600
Whoops, I probably should have done like two and three foot songs and one foot songs. Actually, if I ever do another improv freestyle tournament, it's all gonna be beginner songs on USA, as far as I'm concerned.

33:11.600 --> 33:18.600
I can only improv on Heavy. I love improv, and that's how I make all my freestyles, it's improv over and over and over again.

33:18.600 --> 33:22.600
Were you playing last October? Were you playing in October?

33:22.600 --> 33:25.600
No, I haven't gotten to play in any of the Sacramento tournament.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.600
Well, there's going to be another one coming up by the end of the year.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.600
Also, if it's a Folsom game room, I have no way to get there.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.600
We'll find a way. Somebody here at the table will get you.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
We work things out.

33:35.600 --> 33:36.600
You're on the board, right?

33:36.600 --> 33:37.600
I am.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.600
Yeah, we'll get you there somehow.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.600
I posted on the whole series.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.840
Yeah, yeah, so well

33:44.840 --> 33:49.600
Oh, but I do want to say one improv freestyle that I liked a lot of the tournament was Bradley

33:49.880 --> 33:52.040
Yes, for those who see he did little bitch

33:52.920 --> 33:55.680
And just he just kind of got into it at the end. He was just like you're

33:57.040 --> 33:59.680
Great. I loved it. And he didn't say hi say hi Oh

34:01.640 --> 34:03.640
The little bitch himself Bradley, yes

34:04.760 --> 34:10.000
How was your move you just moved recently to get get a little closer to golf land? Yes, it was good

34:10.000 --> 34:16.920
So I'm still unpacking so moving things around you had to move out of the town of sorority life and get get into

34:17.440 --> 34:22.900
Get into the little cluster Rosa golf. Oh, yeah, cuz he was in Davis where you know, they filmed sorority life. So

34:24.920 --> 34:26.280
Yes

34:26.280 --> 34:29.460
Let's talk to Anita cuz we haven't talked to her much during this show yet

34:29.460 --> 34:34.880
We got a spotlights on you all lights on you girl. Come here. Tell us about where you're from

34:34.880 --> 34:36.880
You're from a little hick town up north

34:36.880 --> 34:40.420
Yes, I'm from Yuba City.

34:40.420 --> 34:43.820
Yes! I went to the police and got yelled at.

34:43.820 --> 34:47.460
Now you want to give a little plug because I know Yuba City has a little

34:47.460 --> 34:51.100
team of regulars up there that play and I love the name of this team by the way.

34:51.100 --> 34:54.380
So tell us about the team up there. Okay, our team is called the

34:54.380 --> 34:58.060
token stealing toddler stompers.

34:58.060 --> 35:02.380
Awesome name. Best name ever. Yes. I hate golf land

35:02.380 --> 35:06.540
for the sole reason that you have to babysit your freaking tokens.

35:06.540 --> 35:13.540
Yes, yes. We got sick and tired of doing that. We actually inspired this new setup of plastic tokens,

35:13.540 --> 35:16.540
but we don't use those anymore because there's not enough people.

35:16.540 --> 35:19.540
Like, you know, when you got like a thousand tokens up on the machine,

35:19.540 --> 35:23.540
if everybody has their own color-coded token, then you can tell who's, you know, in line.

35:23.540 --> 35:27.540
They were using licenses at Gameworks so that people wouldn't run off with their cards.

35:27.540 --> 35:28.540
Oh.

35:28.540 --> 35:31.540
You know, ID cards, student IDs, licenses.

35:31.540 --> 35:32.540
Yeah.

35:32.540 --> 35:37.540
And explain why, what do you mean by cards? Because some people may not have been to Gameworks ever.

35:37.540 --> 35:45.540
They use token, instead of tokens they use those little credit cards like the Metreon uses.

35:45.540 --> 35:49.540
So you were saying about your team.

35:49.540 --> 35:56.540
Oh yeah, token stealing toddler stompers was inspired by a little incident that happened at one of our arcades.

35:56.540 --> 36:02.380
A little kid got into a little trouble and we sort of, well, one of our girls, her name

36:02.380 --> 36:08.340
is May, and she ended up pushing the little kid a little bit.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.340
Just a little bit.

36:09.340 --> 36:10.340
Just a tiny bit.

36:10.340 --> 36:11.340
Just a tad.

36:11.340 --> 36:12.340
A touch.

36:12.340 --> 36:13.340
Because he would not leave her alone.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.920
And his father came, caused a ruckus.

36:15.920 --> 36:20.540
Ever since then we've decided to call ourselves token stealing taller stompers because she

36:20.540 --> 36:24.060
was accused of stomping on this kid, basically.

36:24.060 --> 36:27.240
So anyway, that's how it started.

36:27.240 --> 36:30.680
So how is the scene in a little, because for those who don't know, Yuba City is kind of

36:30.680 --> 36:34.220
one of those towns that's like, it's just kind of there on the side of the road in the

36:34.220 --> 36:35.220
middle of nowhere.

36:35.220 --> 36:38.940
Actually, now it's getting bigger because it has the Sacramento Amphitheater in the town,

36:38.940 --> 36:41.260
so it's getting a little bit more notoriety that way.

36:41.260 --> 36:44.700
But how is it playing DDR like in the middle of nowhere, where you've got to really drive

36:44.700 --> 36:48.460
a long way to get something outside of DDR?

36:48.460 --> 36:55.520
Well, I work in Sacramento, so driving's not too bad for me, but we do have a Max 2 now,

36:55.520 --> 36:57.500
so that is a lot of fun.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.060
Everybody has a freaking Max 2 now.

36:59.060 --> 37:00.060
What is up with that?

37:00.060 --> 37:01.060
Illegal kits.

37:01.060 --> 37:02.060
I mean...

37:02.060 --> 37:03.060
Happy kits.

37:03.060 --> 37:04.540
Ooh, my boots.

37:04.540 --> 37:05.540
My legs hurt.

37:05.540 --> 37:07.900
My boots and my leg, bootleg.

37:07.900 --> 37:11.140
Oh, yeah, same.

37:11.140 --> 37:17.420
It's the, hey, we like to think that we're legal kits, yeah.

37:17.420 --> 37:20.300
They're the great pretender.

37:20.300 --> 37:23.060
Well, it's really not that bad in Yuba City altogether.

37:23.060 --> 37:26.980
There's the folks, I mean, as DDR communities go,

37:26.980 --> 37:30.620
we've got a lot of really great people there.

37:30.620 --> 37:32.380
We used to have two places to go.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.580
Now, we only have one.

37:33.580 --> 37:37.060
But the people who work there are really good to us.

37:37.060 --> 37:38.380
They listen to us.

37:38.380 --> 37:40.740
If we want the machine turned up, they're happy to do it.

37:40.740 --> 37:43.300
And we've never had problems there.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.220
So it's really great, yeah.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.300
That sounds like a dream come true.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.540
In fact, yeah.

37:49.540 --> 37:50.900
What was that again?

37:50.900 --> 37:52.460
It's unlike here at Golf Land, where

37:52.460 --> 37:54.540
when we ask them to turn it up, they turn it down

37:54.540 --> 37:55.660
to half volume.

37:55.660 --> 37:56.980
Exactly.

37:56.980 --> 37:58.940
That's because they're backward ass here.

37:58.940 --> 38:01.700
But we're not complaining, are we?

38:01.700 --> 38:03.980
Because we're getting fourth plus.

38:03.980 --> 38:04.980
I am complaining.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.220
I am very much complaining.

38:06.220 --> 38:08.140
Are we going to complain when they get fourth plus,

38:08.140 --> 38:09.100
though, to replace USA?

38:09.100 --> 38:11.180
USA will be gone and replaced with fourth plus.

38:11.180 --> 38:12.620
Isn't that wonderful?

38:12.620 --> 38:13.900
Somewhat, yes.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.180
Yes.

38:15.180 --> 38:17.060
You can play conga feeling to your heart's content.

38:17.060 --> 38:21.340
know everything on USA is gonna be on there. This is my outlook on this, because USA is

38:21.340 --> 38:26.860
where the newbies go to play, right? So they take USA, we got Max 2. But we got 4th+, we're

38:26.860 --> 38:30.140
gonna wanna play Max 2 and 4th+, where the newbies gonna go. Yeah, they're gonna play

38:30.140 --> 38:33.180
all 4th+, immediately, and you get to play up next. They're gonna go to hell, that's

38:33.180 --> 38:37.140
where they're gonna go. Yeah, but see, see here's- No, they're gonna go play Spiderstomp.

38:37.140 --> 38:41.840
We'll just set them to play Spiderstomp. No, but see, but see, here's the other thing.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.860
The people at Sunsplash are also very stupid at making it so that you can't fail on your

38:44.860 --> 38:51.180
first song if it's on you know little or not little brother uh you know standard

38:51.180 --> 38:55.540
the first standard basic it's it's stupid and so that's still one song

38:55.540 --> 39:00.140
where you have to wait and stuff and and and watching them hurts I swear it hurts

39:00.140 --> 39:06.100
to see them suck so bad because I I mean some of them have the basic idea we all

39:06.100 --> 39:10.820
started off somewhere at the top yeah but we also I I'm gonna say I'm hoping

39:10.820 --> 39:14.340
that we all started off higher than some of the people to play here you know just

39:14.340 --> 39:18.180
jumping around on the freaking pad. I know none of us would be the where we

39:18.180 --> 39:22.280
are today if we started there because we would have given up long ago well no no

39:22.280 --> 39:25.860
mercy with Ted but Ted I guess yeah I started off at home do you think that's

39:25.860 --> 39:30.660
something the announcer should start saying like oh my eyes are bleeding your

39:30.660 --> 39:37.480
dance is like burning your dance makes Captain Jack cry we have more intros to

mean we actually do a show online that promotes the line of the music games and

51:54.140 --> 52:01.780
we advertise this place for free yeah so and then the shit hits the fan well we

52:01.780 --> 52:10.260
could go outside I guess if if you'd rather not us tape in here okay all

52:10.260 --> 52:14.620
right we're getting some manager we might possibly hate golf land we might

52:14.620 --> 52:16.580
possibly get kicked out of the

52:16.580 --> 52:19.580
still have to end the show early because of this we'll have to see what it what's

52:19.580 --> 52:20.600
gonna happen here

52:20.600 --> 52:23.860
so we can fill up with music yeah we can fill up something

52:23.860 --> 52:29.500
i will play more beatmania for your listening pleasure, we'll listen to the brad mix

52:29.500 --> 52:32.260
no

52:32.260 --> 52:33.860
that has bemani

52:33.860 --> 52:35.220
yeah we might

52:35.220 --> 52:36.800
make our business elsewhere

52:36.800 --> 52:40.620
we might have to go to fulsome game room or some place that would let us do a show there

52:40.620 --> 52:41.500
i don't know

52:41.500 --> 52:45.620
we'll see

52:45.620 --> 52:51.140
and he's going to the list and stopping on

52:51.140 --> 52:55.060
something to know really suck what if they took the tape

52:55.060 --> 53:00.220
no then they'll make them pay by anyone

53:00.220 --> 53:04.820
so we're eagerly awaiting what's gonna happen here

53:04.820 --> 53:11.820
we could run away

53:11.860 --> 53:12.700
i'm sorry

53:12.700 --> 53:14.220
i said where's the fun in that

53:14.220 --> 53:16.660
i know where's the fun in that so we'll see what happens

53:16.660 --> 53:18.140
because i if they did

53:18.140 --> 53:21.100
if they did throw us out for trying to do our show i i doubt we'd come here

53:21.100 --> 53:22.700
very much in the future

53:22.700 --> 53:24.460
so we'll see

53:24.460 --> 53:30.460
what's gonna happen when uh... mister manager comes back

53:30.460 --> 53:33.220
so i don't know if there's anything interesting newer going on in the

53:33.220 --> 53:38.340
of a money world right now news-wise you don't have mad sim update oh yeah I've

53:38.340 --> 53:41.540
been mad has him at some update we should get him over here and we're

53:41.540 --> 53:46.540
being stared at by an employee yep we are are we oh is he waving yeah he

53:46.540 --> 53:52.740
waved and he walked off all right so we got the goal oh yeah what's that that

53:52.740 --> 54:00.720
manager looks like he's 16 years old what's the manager like 500-pound like

54:00.720 --> 54:04.960
sumo wrestler i'm getting out of here i'm sorry i gotta go oh well she's she's coming

54:04.960 --> 54:07.200

54:09.200 --> 54:12.480
who is the manager oh we're gonna see what's happening let's step away from the machine

54:13.680 --> 54:14.720
let's see what's going on

54:17.200 --> 54:19.200
oh okay oh we thought that guy was the manager

54:21.440 --> 54:24.800
that would be the day can we get that on tape

54:24.800 --> 54:29.800
So you enjoy working in Gulfland?

54:29.800 --> 54:32.800
She can't comment on tape or else she'd get in trouble.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.800
But I'm sure she'd say nothing but good things.

54:34.800 --> 54:36.800
Yes, Gulfland is winner.

54:36.800 --> 54:39.800
Except maybe the little kids who destroy things around here, who knows about that.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.800
Like, yeah.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.800
Do I have to go for the taping or not?

54:42.800 --> 54:45.800
No, we don't know because the manager's got to come downstairs and...

54:45.800 --> 54:48.800
I know, he's going to decide you guys to tape him.

54:48.800 --> 54:53.800
Really? Even though a lot of people film home videos and stuff here?

54:53.800 --> 54:56.960
Same difference, only audio.

54:56.960 --> 55:00.520
Alright, alright, she's not going to talk, she's not going to talk.

55:00.520 --> 55:04.840
We'll see what happens. This is interesting, we weren't expecting this

55:04.840 --> 55:05.520
development.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.560
Well maybe we should take another quick break then.

55:08.560 --> 55:11.800
Do we want to take a quick break? Well no, because I kind of want to get this on air, whatever happens.

55:11.800 --> 55:16.520
So we'll see. What are we leaving? No, we're going to see what happens. The manager's coming down.

55:16.520 --> 55:19.600
You can always go like in and out or something.

55:19.600 --> 55:23.080
True. We can finish up the show somewhere else.

55:23.080 --> 55:26.440
we'll see what happens

55:26.440 --> 55:28.000
by freaking ten

55:28.000 --> 55:29.940
ten o'clock

55:29.940 --> 55:33.720
i think they're closing at ten now so we have a lot of the bad things going on

55:33.720 --> 55:36.160
on the mania

55:36.160 --> 55:39.660
do you want to go listen to brad playing the mania and now what is it very many

55:39.660 --> 55:41.920
years i don't even know that song

55:41.920 --> 55:43.440
it's crimson

55:43.440 --> 55:46.760
why are they allowed to take us and use us for the commercials but we're not

55:46.760 --> 55:49.560
allowed to take them

55:49.560 --> 55:50.680
maybe

55:50.680 --> 56:00.100
don't know I don't know they probably think we're profiting off of this no we

56:00.100 --> 56:10.920
pay for do our show I know this is this is the guy we'll see what happens we

56:10.920 --> 56:13.160
think

56:14.440 --> 56:19.200
we don't know what's gonna happen we're recording an internet radio show just

56:19.200 --> 56:24.040
We run an internet radio show every Sunday night and we're basically taking the Sunday

56:24.040 --> 56:27.760
off so we decided to do a live show at our favorite Wednesday hangout because we come

56:27.760 --> 56:32.840
every Wednesday and we didn't think that there would be an issue with it if there is so we're

56:32.840 --> 56:33.840
sorry.

56:33.840 --> 56:42.600
Right now, I'll go ahead and do it, I thought you had a filming crew here, but usually we

56:42.600 --> 56:47.640
don't have a problem with it, we just like to book it in advance so we can know what

56:47.640 --> 56:50.820
the interviews about, and that kind of a thing.

56:50.820 --> 56:52.820
Oh, we're just a bunch of dumb kids that are not doing anything special, so.

56:52.820 --> 56:54.820
This is spontaneous, really.

56:54.820 --> 56:59.820
And also, I recognize your kids, you know, in the group, so that's always a big plus.

56:59.820 --> 57:03.820
So, we want to promote, you know, a good hangout environment.

57:03.820 --> 57:04.820
Oh, definitely.

57:04.820 --> 57:05.820
Well, cool.

57:05.820 --> 57:06.820
You want to give a plug to Golf Land?

57:06.820 --> 57:07.820
Any specials going on right now?

57:07.820 --> 57:08.820
Any specials going on right now?

57:08.820 --> 57:09.820
We always have specials.

57:09.820 --> 57:14.820
You can call in advance to find out what they are, Family Night Special or laser tag specials.

57:14.820 --> 57:20.500
Yeah, Saturday mornings on this Saturday, by the way

57:24.220 --> 57:26.640
This past Saturday wasn't it something having to do with

57:27.940 --> 57:29.940
private party

57:32.580 --> 57:34.940
That gonna be the 8 to 10 30 or the 9 to 12

57:34.940 --> 57:40.500
Now all the employees are starting to look at us funny.

57:40.500 --> 57:43.180
You want to do a plug for Orange Lounge Radio?

57:43.180 --> 57:45.780
Well right now I need to get them back to work.

57:45.780 --> 57:46.780
Alright.

57:46.780 --> 57:47.780
Alright.

57:47.780 --> 57:51.380
Any other questions I can answer them but I need to get my employees back to work.

57:51.380 --> 57:55.500
Well thanks for letting us do our crappy show we appreciate it.

57:55.500 --> 57:56.500
Well in your crisis.

57:56.500 --> 58:00.300
You're just doing your job.

58:00.300 --> 58:02.780
There's a promotion for you in the future on it.

58:02.780 --> 58:04.580
and

58:04.580 --> 58:06.980
and your crisis averted

58:06.980 --> 58:09.900
i guess we ought to get out of people's way now we'll take us back upstairs

58:09.900 --> 58:13.060
let's get back and let's get out of the way i think that people's way so

58:13.060 --> 58:15.580
we're going back upstairs so if any of the guests want to come back upstairs as

58:15.580 --> 58:16.580
well

58:16.580 --> 58:18.340
you want to tell you

58:18.340 --> 58:19.300
okay

58:19.300 --> 58:21.020
well that was a great deal

58:21.020 --> 58:22.700
daddy

58:22.700 --> 58:26.860
apparently i'm one of your kids rob the manager pointed out

58:26.860 --> 58:30.420
so yeah this is kind of interesting because um...

58:30.420 --> 58:33.320
we didn't think anything like that would have it but i guess uh... true orange

58:33.320 --> 58:35.620
lounge spontaneous movement there

58:35.620 --> 58:38.380
now as i said we were not gonna stop tape tonight no matter what happens

58:38.380 --> 58:40.500
unless i got a came down the stairs on the screen

58:40.500 --> 58:41.460
stop the tape

58:41.460 --> 58:45.380
so if you get if you kick me in my ass would you keep rolling like yes cream

58:45.380 --> 58:49.900
harder every income on possibly live on by possibly yeah so it sounds like they

58:49.900 --> 58:52.300
like to know about these kind of things in advance because

58:52.300 --> 58:54.740
well they want to do their own little promotions with it i don't know we

58:54.740 --> 58:59.220
should call five minutes ahead and say, hey, we're gonna come, you know, record and stuff, so yeah.

59:00.820 --> 59:04.660
But yeah, that was... That's, that's going on the best stuff. I hope we picked up his audio. I'm kind

59:04.660 --> 59:07.540
of afraid that we didn't get the Golf Line employee's audio. That might have come out

59:07.540 --> 59:12.100
kind of crappy for the listeners. Yeah. It's an experimental show tonight, as I promised. It would

59:12.100 --> 59:17.380
be... You know, we know what we could do. We can just dub over voices if we didn't pick it up.

59:18.660 --> 59:22.180
Maybe when we, maybe what we could do is come back and do that segment in a later show like

59:22.180 --> 59:26.140
the best of will do with voice settings by aryan no you should put in like step

59:26.140 --> 59:30.600
from rejected i'm feeling bad and you know what i'm kind of worried about

59:30.600 --> 59:34.060
though what if this guy actually tunes in and listens though because what do we

59:34.060 --> 59:37.280
do we sit around and we say it offline never updates their machines and they

59:37.280 --> 59:41.620
they're all dirty and things like that now oh well we come here and give our

59:41.620 --> 59:44.520
money that's right so what the hell does he wear a bunch of fat hypocrites

59:44.520 --> 59:50.000
because we've asked off plan but we're the right to complain even if we do pay

59:50.000 --> 59:55.600
of money god damn it so oh they're all coming back oh jamie's jamie's doing some pr work here

59:55.600 --> 01:00:01.280
oh boy talking talking to the manager yay oh she's trying to sell the tournament right now

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:08.000
hey right on yeah so jamie is jamie going all right he's going bye-bye irene will fill in his

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.760
co-host while you're gone yeah well hey jamie's gonna go uh work things out some promising news

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.240
maybe oh now this is so this guy is really awesome he's done so much stuff he turned up the

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.460
the prepare machine actually i would you recognize this guy is that what and

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:25.000
they'll say here about this employee here says say his name over the air

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.200
search or saying good things on doing

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.160
very good employee here he sees the one employee we've run into that will fixed

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.680
games we ask them to be fixed he has a thing as they are broken he fixes them

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.440
like prepare was turned on there's a game called uh... similar next to it

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.820
was about five times sluts pepper machine so my my

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.620
thing was to go and turn off the sumo machine but now prepare you can hear

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.740
from upstairs it's it's insane a lot and i love it

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.900
and then this guy this guy has made all kinds of stuff that he's letting us do

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.200
this thing here

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.140
and uh... it sucks that he's he's leaving pretty soon don't know where to

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.840
go and why don't i don't know he's on he's uh... not going to be working here

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.960
for too much longer so what he's trying to do

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.900
is get james name and number

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.980
possibly even like you know the URL for the boards into the right hand so that

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.860
these trends will continue to happen on a regular basis

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.660
that right on all

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.860

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.960

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.680
let's talk to you do you have any sim news for us i don't know if it was

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.280
have you seen what you've most

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.000
particularly retarded edit

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.520
for max three hundred now after the free to think of the book fifty fucking

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.520
billionaire

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:41.000
i can't no way to do that ever first off i didn't make the edit this guy get

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.060
needed that actually it was one of the ones that was in the data bank on

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.040
fitness

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.680
about ninety percent of the nyoki edits that nyoki pick are all done by him he's

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.720
the same guy plays that they made a edit swing and i'd love it so awesome

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.040
yeah but do you think that it is fucking off the house in any

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.360
they didn't say that she writes this pretty dear i mean is that he made

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.820
sense but i feel like she did actually fight

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.160
it's in this

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.960
uh... i've got some good news actually came by low and the melting pot are

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.920
coming back up october first redesigning the site

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.440
uh... what happened was is there a switching servers or something and

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.080
one they did that someone bought the main name

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.520
for who who says it has someone but team bryler's dot coms name and so now they

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.880
had to change it or something, but they're actually still up. You just have to type in

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:31.360
their IP address in order to find it. So they're still up and they said they're going to be

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:38.040
done with the site and everything October 1st. As far as other SimNews, really no new

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.440
versions of anything. Turning Mix, I guess, is still going because their media section

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.380
is down on DDR, East Coast Invasion. Yeah, I won't be entering this time because I'm

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:52.160
busy with everything else. I swear to God, I never have enough free time to actually

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.000
sit down and make, you know, a decent step file. Or I don't have the patience or just

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.720
don't care. One of those. And also DDRPC still no new characters, so that sucks.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.620
That was interesting because they released, we thought they were going to kind of be doing

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:09.900
them every Friday. They released What's His Name and What's Her Face on the first week.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:15.280
And then Valencia and Guy were the second. Yes. And then there were no third ones. No,

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:21.980
nothing, so. Yeah. Wow. This is, I'm still kind of in shock over this interesting turn

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:25.660
the show's taken where Jamie's, uh, gone into the office to talk about God knows what with

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:30.360
the manager. You know, I'm kind of getting worried. Do you think we need to send a rescue

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.120
mission? No, you know, actually this might be good because they're talking for a long

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.740
time. Yeah, maybe they're talking about a tournament. Yes, I know. Actually they are

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:41.860
talking about the tournament. Really? Yes. From when I was walking by and coming up here

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:45.920
I heard him talking about the tournament, so. I heard the word tournament. Interesting.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:51.540
So we'll see what happens. Did you hear the words, ugh, ugh, ugh? Stop it! Jamie, you

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:58.500
Hit Brad once you hear this. It's all Brad that's doing all of these funny noises, but my girlfriend's ratting me out. How's that?

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.140
Hey

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:03.680
Gosh, get it later. Yes. Yes Joe

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:08.140
and if man if the what's-his-name bands us, I'm gonna be pissed

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:14.640
Imagine if we all get banned from golf land for this then they won't get any money darn shucks

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.060
I'll just have to take my business elsewhere

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:21.060
I'll be able to afford an apartment, move out, and actually get on with my life.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:26.060
Maybe, you know, tune up my car and that kind of stuff. That'd be cool.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:32.060
This is like the addiction recovery thing. They all ban us from Golf Land, you know.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:35.060
I'm gonna cut you off.

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.060
Hey, there's plenty of other places to play DDR, okay?

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.060
Right? Right, Rod?

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.060
I guess. Sure. Hello? Is anybody there?

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:49.060
But see, that's the thing. I don't really know if there would be a tournament here seeing how anal they are.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:55.060
I mean, every single encounter with Golfland employees has been anal, anal, anal.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.060
Except for the nice manager who helps us out tonight.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.060
Yes, he's very nice.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:02.060
Except for him. He's pretty cool, but everyone else has been kind of anal and stupid.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:06.060
Did you notice he looks kind of like an overweight Owen Wilson?

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.060
But he's very nice.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:11.060
Yes, but he's got that face like Owen Wilson.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:14.880
you might be telling him that date and time to listen to this very show

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.900
i hope not

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.780
and i hope you're going to edit this out of the way that the case in all these

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:23.260
comments and i think i think you're wrong

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:28.260
this is what i know i think

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.660
and this is now low-key talking

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.940
little kids are going to kick my ass

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:38.740
love to kick my ass so yeah i was kicked by a little kid about the money

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.640
They don't kick my ass, they just threaten to kick my ass.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.640
I don't know why, it's not like I look like a little kid or something.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.640
You know where we are? We're in the upstairs part of Golf Land,

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.340
and we're surrounded, we're in the happy birthday section, or the party section, whatever,

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:54.640
and there's all these drawings of dragons with really huge nostrils.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.640
Like, what the hell?

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.240
Okay, what's up with that dragon right there?

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.640
I mean, he looks like there's a bulge coming out of his stomach, and I don't think it's his stomach.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.840
They all look crazy, they all look...

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.440
And he's having a very happy birthday.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.040
It's a nostril-saurus or something, God, it's like, crazy.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.320
That's what I find you with the shorts and burning cupcake.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.200
Burning cupcake?

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.120
Look out, he's coming right for us!

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:21.360
That's burning heat, my friend. See, now, all those things that you would assume

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.920
are, like, confetti, those are actually spots he's seen because he's on acid. I mean, look at his eyes.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:32.920
Yeah, I could have, like, telephoned operator. There's two conversations going on right now, this show isn't in stereo.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.820
Oh, yeah

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:41.420
Yeah, so I like telephone operator as I was continuing my conversation. Yes. Yes. Yes

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.980
So let's get um, interesting talk on I don't know. What are we English? I like ass

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.160
Let's get our money

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.320
Ass is good bread. Oh

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.320
Money

01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:01.920
The money's neat and fun and I think the money's super but not laser done this show drunk. Um, I know

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:07.560
We should have gotten more people like playing DDR actually and playing, you know

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.560
Hip-hop mania and drum mania. It's an audio thing

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:18.880
Visual aids don't help. Yes, but we could get very good. I'd rather undermine your intelligence

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.220
Thank you, Ted, but what is it? Your powers of observation are great

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:28.660
I'm sorry, you have to read 8-Bit Theater, anyway, or maybe not, yeah, so anyway.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.780
Over your head, it's probably too advanced for you for a simple month.

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.100
So let's start talking about that.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.740
Yeah, you know, keyboard mania is fixed and working, I noticed, I went down there and

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.740
played it.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.740
No, the right side is.

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.340
Yeah, the left side has this tendency to make new chords.

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.100
We need to tell Dwayne or whatever the hell his name is about it.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:51.700
Dwayne the nice guy, Dwayne the nice guy, Dwayne the nice guy, Dwayne the nice guy.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.200
His name's Bob, okay.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:53.700
Dwayne.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.500
It's Bob.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.000
Dwayne.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:55.500
Bob.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.000
Dwayne.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Dammit, it's Bob, okay?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.500
Dwayne.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.000
Dwayne.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:09:59.500
Bob.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.000
Dwayne.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:00.500
Bob.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.000
Dwayne.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:01.500
Bob.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.000
You know-

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.800
You know, I hope we don't get sued for, like, saying all these people on the radio, but, you know, we have no money and can't get blood out of turnips, so, you know, you'll never take me alive.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.700
That was a cheesy saying.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:18.100
You know, I come in and I saw that and I'm like, wow, it's on, it's working, and the keys are all intact, oh my god.

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.700
Keyboard mania is, I guess, okay.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:25.260
Just wait one minute, I mean, just wait one, uh, let me, uh, start over.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:28.860
Just wait a second, there'll be little kids pulling the keys off any minute now.

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:30.640
Oh, no.

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:32.560
No.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.060
Oh, yeah?

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.780
Yeah, for about a month, actually.

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:42.540
I was, I was just thinking, now, if, like, to be honest, just say, say, if we ever got banned,

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.540
how would they support themselves during the winter?

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.860
I mean, no one comes in here other than us.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.900
Who would keep, you know, who would run this place?

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.900
How would they get the money to run this place?

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:56.900
I think something like that would happen. We're their only source of income in the winter.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.900
Except for maybe, you know, three dollars off Pac-Man or something.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.900
But, um, you know, and that's like a week.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:07.900
Okay, so, what's gonna happen is they're gonna, we're gonna be, we get banned.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:12.900
They're gonna be going without us for about a couple of months and realize that they're in debt or something, you know?

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.900
Well, let's just put it this way. I mean, I spend unusual, you know,

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:21.040
time coming here about fifteen to twenty dollars and tokens every time which is

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.620
why I don't like coming down here all the time because it's really hard in my

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:31.600
account yeah I'm poor but anyways yes so if you know they just cut me off shit

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.640
man look at Q's are man if I stop coming there I like spend 15 grand there over

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:42.320
four years okay so sad I have to say though I'm very dishonest when it comes

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.680
with two ways I get my tokens I came here tonight played a few games DDR

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:52.600
maybe four five six of them two of those being doubles i came with no money i'm a scrounger

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:57.720
as it were okay so they don't make any money off me so banning me how do you scrounge tokens

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.960
exactly you go around baking people or you found him on the ground or why i find the machine or

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:07.160
what he asked me uh you know oh some machines broken tonight i don't tell him i tell him the

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.680
ones that i want to play that are broken not the ones that are broken that i get money out of

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:17.800
Uh-huh see I don't shame shame. I'm I'm I don't steal up a donation

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.200
Wait wait you're gonna feed this this

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:26.960
Give the money to people who actually okay. I I spend money. I spend

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:37.520
Wow, that's like giving to the Salvation Army, that was incredible.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.520
Thank you.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520
Ring ring ring, here's my bell.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.480
Well, thanks for being a shout out you want to give here on our little program.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.600
Well, it was good to meet everybody.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.600
I do exist.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600
I am Vandalous.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600
Right on.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600
And I'm out.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.600
Well, thanks for coming.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.600
Nice seeing you.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.600
Goodbye, Vandalous.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.600
Later.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.600
Yeah, the one person Anita's back.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.600
Did you see anything that happened to us downstairs?

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.600
We got accosted by the man.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.600
The employee came up to us and said,

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.600
I don't think you're supposed to be doing the show here.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.600
I still don't believe that he exists.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.600
I think it was just an elaborate hologram.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.600
Okay.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.600
Anyway, as I was telling Anita,

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.600
and finally the manager came out,

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.600
but we got the cool manager tonight

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.600
who likes the Bamani crowd and does things for us.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.600
So, but Jamie's in his office right now.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:30.840
now and we don't know what's going on. She's been in there for quite a while there's there's been a

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:37.280
recent plague of child deduction hey hey hey Jamie's no Jamie's not a child it's just just it's been

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.360
in this community and stuff so in as we discovered on last week's under station live she has the

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:49.960
voice of a child but she's she's not a child sorry Joe that's scary so we don't know what's going on

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:56.100
We're just gonna keep this show going. We said it would be an experimental show ten point ten point five and and shit boy

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.820
This is a train wreck radio live

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.220
This show was brought to you by ass here

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.480
That's my ass

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.480
God, I don't want to touch that my good ass. Are you trained? That's gross. You're nasty on your ass

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.520
You know and they're getting that rubbing noise on the air by the way

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.860
That's what it sounds like to be against my ass.

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:21.860
I hope you all enjoyed.

01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.460
I don't ever want to go back there.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.460
There's something...

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.460
There's a bad party.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.460
Don't blow into the microphone.

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:27.980
You know what's wrong with this show?

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:28.980
There's no donuts.

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:29.980
That's why!

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:30.980
None of us are hyper.

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:34.620
We could go downstairs and get overpriced cardboard pizza.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.620
No.

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.620
I'm pretty hungry.

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.740
Maybe.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:38.740
Not enough for cardboard pizza.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.140
Sometimes though, sometimes though, if you go right before closing you can get free cardboard

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.140
pizza.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.140
Wow!

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.140
It's like saying you get free shit.

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.940
God, I love free shit, I know.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.740
That's like when you're driving down the street, and they have like the big signs that say,

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.140
you know, free dirt!

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.100
I know!

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.100
Free pie!

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.720
And the pie is also evil.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.260
It's worse than cardboard pizza, it's foam pizza, come on.

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.860
Fertilizer for sale.

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:01.860
Exactly!

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.740
Like, who gives a damn?

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:04.740
Yeah, exactly.

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:05.740
Oh, oh.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:06.740
Charn!

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.740
Nope.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:08.740
Oh, did you think, do we have a Jamie?

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:09.740
Oh, I see.

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.740
What?

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.740
Nope.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:12.740
I thought we had a Jamie sighting.

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:13.740
Nope, not yet.

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:14.740
A Jamie sighting, what is she like an alien or something?

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.740
No, I'm starting to wonder what happened.

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:17.740
It's a Jamie, oh my god.

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:20.740
When we go into our next break, we won't come back from that break until Jamie's back.

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:21.740
Oh, somebody else is going into the office now.

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:22.740
Oh.

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.740
Oh my gosh.

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.740
A group thing.

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:25.740
Uh oh.

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.740
Oh my gosh.

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:27.740
My gosh.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.740
All right.

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:29.740
What is going on?

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:30.740
Take advantage of nobody being downstairs.

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:31.740
That's what I did earlier.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.740
I was happy.

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.740
All right, take care.

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:34.740
Well, now we gotta keep this show going.

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.740
What to talk about now?

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:37.740

Okay, I said we'd call. Yes, back to the track.

Okay, we're going to try making the phone call. We'll go to the backup topic if we have to.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.440
Now, I'm going to do my best to try to understand what the guy's saying,

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.160

Well, it's telling me the numbers not available and to leave a message at the south

Oh, well, that's experimental radio right there for you. The number didn't work. Damn it. All right, we'll go

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:38.060
What's on your mind Anita? Well, I have a fuck you. Oh, yes. Okay, such a language. Fuck me or fuck. No, I'm just

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.980
well

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.160
Yeah

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.960
My fuck you of the week is

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.040
DVD region codes I

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:58.840
Don't know what you guys think about this, but I can't stand them. I usually don't have a fuck you

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.740
I'm usually really mellow.

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:02.740
I really, usually things don't bother me.

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.240
She usually has the darn you.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.240
You're just kidding.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.240
What?

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.240
But for the past several weeks.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.240
Tell me, have you never been mellow?

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.240
So sad.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.240
Have you ever been lonely?

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:19.240
Have you ever tried?

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.240
Okay, okay, all right.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.240
All right, anyway, I'm sorry to cut you off.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.740
Okay, well, see, I don't understand region codes because

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:31.580
I suppose they were invented to avoid piracy, correct?

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.580
Yes.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.020
Well, they didn't do it.

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:39.780
All that they succeeded in doing is screwing over people like me who want to buy nice DVDs

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.780
from other countries that don't have any English translations.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:48.980
Well, you know, I have a Japanese PlayStation 2 so I can play DVDs with the Japanese region

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:51.420
and I bet if I hooked things up right I could do a dub.

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.420
So...

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.420
Ooh!

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.420
You should give me a call.

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.420
We'll talk.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.420
You're gonna do a dub?

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.420
No, not a dub.

01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:03.660
Not like I'm gonna actually talk and do the dub. I'm gonna like put it in the VCR and tape hit record and

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.300
Be a good dubber

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.420
Life is on

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.100
Stop it

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:16.960
If you don't get that show started dubbing company a dubbing company what we call it

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.700
The dubbers

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.500
Sacra dubbers

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:33.420
Dubbermentals. Dubbermentals. Dubbers Incorporated. Star Dubbers. Yeah, a dubby-dub. Rub-a-dub.

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:44.260
Lame. No. Oh, that'd be good. Rub-a-dub. Dub-a-rub. I don't know. We should seriously all, you

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:50.180
know, do dubbing for anime. Yeah, I would love to be an anime voice person thing. Who

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.180
Who would you want to do the voice for?

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.180
Akane Tendo from Ranma.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.180
Give us a sample of what your dub would sound like.

01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:00.180
Uh, I don't know any of her lines.

01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:03.180
I'm feeling fat and saucy.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.180
You are? I'm sorry, Ralph.

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.180
Say, would you like to go to a movie?

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.180
Ouch. Ouch.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.180
Yo!

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.180
I hate you.

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.180
I know what voice you'd like to do.

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:16.180
Who's the name of the main character from La Blue Girl?

01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:18.180
Shut up.

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:26.180
I thought it was LA. Or I would do Ranma Chan, the girl side of Ranma. I could do one from her.

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:31.180
I'm going back to China, so suck on that old man.

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.180
Excellent.

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:35.180
They're clapping in the background.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.180
They love you. They really love you.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:43.180
Thank you, thank you. Yeah, I think that would be cool. That would be the ultimate job, but I think only Canadians do that.

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:47.380
Come on, you haven't heard the new Funimation Dragon Ball Z dubs then yet, have you?

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:48.380
They're from Texas.

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:49.820
Are they good?

01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:50.820
They're from Texas.

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:51.820
Oh, okay, so that's no.

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:55.620

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:24.540
okay yeah oh shit this thing's been on pause the whole time darn no no no no

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:29.500
no I'm not that stupid so about like if we do have a second tournament let's

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:34.260
get that so it'd be scat two or what it'll be it'll be scab Sacramento's

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:38.760
tournament and bowling. That was the idea if we did it at CCL we do stab. Yeah, stab.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:44.840
Second one is tournament and bowling. I don't know what's going to happen. Let's not give out all of our secrets.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.400
Oh, some stupid laser tag game thing. The next exciting laser tag game starts soon. Laser

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.720
knights. Laser knights. Ooh. Have you ever played the laser knights yet? I have played the laser

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:56.220
tag here so many times it is really crappy.

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.060
But you have to say good things tonight because they're letting us do our crappy show here. I don't have to say anything good. Alright, you know.

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.300
It looks like Owen Wilson, an overweight Owen Wilson.

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.900
That is lanky style.

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.020
What?

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.100
L-A-N-K-Y.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:07.660
K-Y.

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.260
My emphasis on the K-Y.

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:15.740
You know, I saw this license plate that said K-Y lady.

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.900
Like, who wants to advertise that you're the K-Y lady?

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.100
Oh, here's somebody who hasn't been on this show yet tonight.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:25.100
Everybody say hello to Somnia Megasex, also known as Ryan.

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:25.820
Hello, Ryan.

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:26.620
What is this?

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.820
Like, live broadcast for him?

01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:30.860
And Dan the man's coming up too.

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:34.420
Now this is going to be interesting because we're going to have to explain to Dan what happened to Jamie.

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.340
We don't know what happened to Jamie.

01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:40.540
I don't know what happened to Jamie either. But we lost your fiance Dan.

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:44.580
We lost Jamie.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:49.220
Dan comes in, come tell us the gossip on Jamie once she's not here.

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.900
She's in the office right now with the manager.

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.020
She's completely insane.

01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:56.780
How so?

01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.880
You know her.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.340
That was Dan, the man, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.640
This is quite true.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.020
So, yeah, did you see us downstairs at the beginning of this segment?

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.020
We almost all got arrested.

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:09.060
Really? No, I'm just kidding.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:12.560
Oh, damn. This is how the story changes, like, you ever play telephone?

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.920
No, one of the employees came up to us and said, oh, what do you guys do? And I said it was a school project, you know.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.440
This is really redundant for our listeners.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.060
Yeah.

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:24.300
Because that's the only school I know about.

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:28.200
yeah rodney my charm school so i'm the only one here

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:31.360
that actually looks like i'm in high school because i am

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.920
and what are we were just your cousins

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.120

so long story short manager came down but it was the good manager the nice

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.880
manager support and i hear golf on the one employee the lights

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.760
of the money players and now they're in office right now we think they're

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.400
talking about a tournament possibly but we don't know he not to spread rumors

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.800
prematurely but you know what i have a turn i don't know if we're on a radio

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:06.200
and we're spreading rumors or anything like that right ok no one listens to the

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.920
show or ok opa

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.480

o'clock you don't even know yet big pots

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.680
like like how do i listen to it

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.660
how do you listen to it well this is kind of redundant for our listeners are already

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:20.320
listening

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.200
we're just going to go to our website they may not know the website h t

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:48.900
lounge idea

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:52.660

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:53.700
this live show don't know

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:57.080

You just let your feelings show

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:14.180
Life is a mystery

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.020
Super duper good at it

01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.020
You've got to do it all right

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:27.020
You are the light of my heart

01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:33.020
You are the light of my heart

01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:40.020
Oh, whether you would see me there

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:47.020
Oh, whether you would see me there

01:37:47.020 --> 01:38:15.020
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:25.940
Alright, and we're back from that little break we took of music. Hope you enjoyed it. And

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:34.020
Jamie is back. Jamie has a headache. Now, oh my gosh, what went on in there? Just being

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:39.060
so enthusiastic. Basically, we're a go. We're gonna have a tourney here. That's what you're

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.540
speculating out here. Probably setting up some kind of tournament for Rosalind. That's

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:49.760
And I can't go into too much detail right now, but it's initial right on we're going to get us going now

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.160
You didn't have to do anything naughty to make that happen right no

01:38:53.160 --> 01:39:00.540
No, you know I had to ask did my fiance's downstairs. I know he called you insane during the last break. Don't you know it?

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:07.780
He lives with me. Do you have any retorts? Oh now you guys if I'm insane Dan's like freaking retarded

01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:09.980
I think Brad and Irene are leaving now, so

01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:16.440
So I'll use my little, yeah, so they're going to, as soon as they close, we're going to

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440

Golf Line's closing in a few minutes, so as soon as they close, we're going to end the

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:21.480
show.

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:28.160
You guys have anything you want to say, goodbyes or anything like that?

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.940
Sayonara.

It's been really fun doing the show and the money all the way loot rock on.

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:05.200
Did you want to give a shout out to your, your friends, this new shirt, this new shirt

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.120
you're wearing here in honor of my step squad family.

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.880
I need to go ahead and let you guys know I am wearing my shirt tonight and about it's

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:13.880
not TV.

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:16.720
Iguana girl and I both had a Heineken in your honor on the plane.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.800
Of course we were too broke on the way back to have one other woman, but we had, we had

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:32.760
one for our Step Squad homies, so, yo. Right on. Holla! I guess in reference to the promo

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.160
that Step Squad did at Mt. Mike's Journey. So how are you liking this Wednesday night

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:40.720
taping? Ted loves it. He wants us to do this more regularly, more often. As long as we

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:45.760
let him know in advance, I guess. Who do we have to let know now? Well, now that you have

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:51.120
an inn. Ooh. You have an inn. Um, I guess we'll just let him know a week before. Okay,

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.640
this is a burning question. Loki says his name is Bob. I think it's- Dwayne. Dwayne.

01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:01.720
Ah, Loki's wrong. Would you win like a dollar? Loki was just being an ass. He was being an

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.960
ass, but I'm right. Uh, moral of the story, you're right. Yes, exactly, as always. I'm

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:10.680
hungry. Well, I suppose this is an idea we can continue to do in the future if, um, you

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:14.200
know, we want to take another week off or whatever, cause that happens sometimes. Weeks

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:20.760
off or nice yep we saw like sleep go to bed early one night I guess yep maybe I

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.800
can convince Dan to have a barbecue and I guess I can have you know barbecue

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:28.600
tofu or something since I'm having you know barbecue up some shrimp for me or

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.440
something bye everybody thanks for coming

01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:38.000
of course when we're doing this here at golf land and pre taping we can't really

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.320
interact with our chat room right now like we can't experience like I'm sure

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:48.640
SoCalKicks is in the chat room right now and he's promoting USA and yelling at us when

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:54.060
we're dissing Konami in any way and Twen probably has some new Hell remix that he's distributing

01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:55.060
amongst the folks.

01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:56.320
How did we get about our resident joker?

01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.480
Our resident joker is probably in there, Pyro is probably saying some things and talking

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:04.120
about how boring we are tonight because we're not talking about 3-TittedEmmy.

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.480
Pantsless rage, yo.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.720
Pantsless rage, he bounces.

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.400
And Slinky's probably just very bitter that he's not here.

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.400
We miss you Slinky!

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:15.400
It's...

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.400
I don't know, what else is there to say right now?

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.400
Any other Bemani news going on?

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:25.400
I haven't eaten anything today, except a cupcake and some chocolate covered espresso beans

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:29.400
and this like, orange creamsicle Dutch ice drink thingy.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.400
Yum!

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.400
I'm nutritious today, that's probably why I have a headache, my god.

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:39.400
I have Evangelion Redeath though, that's awesome, I'm gonna watch the hell out of that tonight.

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.400
Good stuff.

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:52.400
Apparently though, I think that the lovely people at Gravity, who basically made Ragnarok online, has blocked the servers.

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.400
I could not get on. I'm going to try again.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:01.400
I can only read like the Kana where it says server word not works.

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:06.400
So I need to figure out the rest of it out.

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:12.800
I'll have an update on my addiction online RPG, so yay.

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.440
Right on.

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.240
I'm sure everyone's so interested.

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.040
Well, you know, if people are online

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.200
and they're not listening to our show

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.960
and they're not listening to the Bollywood Music Amore,

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.360
I don't know why they wouldn't be.

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:24.240
But, you know, those are fun things to do.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:25.360
I played right back.

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.800
I turned off the background music.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:29.680
See, this is one reason we are on a modem-friendly stream,

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.080
even though we know a lot of people are on DSL these days.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.880
We reach out to the modem, the folks still on modem,

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:37.700
and those on dsl can still

01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:40.860
do other stuff they're not there but i was not a sucked down when they came to

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:45.760
let down i would be on dial-up listening and playing ragnarok so i'll hour and i

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.400
think you know it's possible that you know believe in yourself

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:53.800
and then you have to leave the music that's not bad at it

01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.340
i gotta believe

01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:58.360
dojo casino it's all in the mind

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:02.000
as we get a lot of looks we were trying to enter in the last thing that when you

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.920
We were trying to say things to our Japanese listeners because we noticed that there are people in Japan listening every week

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:11.580
So I wanted to say something like a hello or something, but none of us knew Japanese. So you have anything you want to say?

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:17.240
Nihonjin no minna san. Domo arigatou gozaimashita.

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.080
Shite kudasai.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:26.520
She just told me to go to hell. I think if I said it as properly as I could I said

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:32.440
And everyone of our Japanese listeners, we thank you very much for listening, and please

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:33.440
keep listening.

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.440
And not just Japan, but worldwide.

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.440
Canada, we got a lot of listeners.

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.440
Unfortunately, I forgot my French.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.440
Up there in Canada.

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:42.920
Yeah, give a shout out to our Canadian moderators, yo, for DBR Freak.

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.640
And Europe, also our Chile, of course.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.640
Can't forget Chile.

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.240
And to all of our moderators in Alabama and the Mideast, and for all the people who didn't,

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.720
you know, the moderators who didn't get to go, we missed you there.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:00.960
I just have to say right now, Mad Love to my fellow DDR Freak moderators, I had a wonderful

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.700
time with you guys.

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:07.080
And Mad Love to Melody for coming from out of town and entertaining me and being the

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:08.680
guest on last week's show.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.680
Is that...

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.960
It looks good that Melody came.

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:11.960
We were having a...

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.960
I had to talk to her on the phone.

01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:16.160
Oh yes, that's right, while we were in the mall to talk to Melody.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:20.760
We were at a strip mall, in the cab on the way to strip mall to go to game land.

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:24.960
It was kind of a support group because she had her... her boyfriend was out of town and

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:27.840
one of my best friends was out of town in vegas so uh...

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:31.320
you know we had to have a support group of uh... you know or pouting is we're

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.720
not in vegas time but

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:36.000
i'm i'm going to get to vegas at some point in the next few months so just a

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.300
warning you vegas folk i will take the tape recorder

01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:39.680
unfortunately

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.560
uh... we didn't

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:43.620
coordinated we just weren't thinking i guess and didn't get jimmy the tape

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:45.880

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:51.640
uh... but

01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:56.440
I did make a mention to a couple of my fellow moderators that I'd love to have them on the show.

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.440
Rad! Good.

01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.440
And you know, of course I always want to have Mel back on.

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:05.140
Uh-huh. And there is a possibility in the future we'll have a few of the members from RTF on the show in the future.

01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:06.140
It's gonna be very cool. I'm hoping so.

01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:06.940
I'm hoping so too.

01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:10.640
I would love to get Rain on. I would love to get, you know...

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.940
I would love to just have an RTF show, have the guys there.

01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:15.940
Have like, you know, my Step Squad people here.

01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:20.140
Right. And even if we can't get you guys here, you know what, we travel too.

01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:23.060
as is shown from Jamie going out of town last week, going to Vegas.

01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:26.820
We might go out to SoCal. I might be going to SoCal in a few weeks.

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:30.140
So we'll be doing some taping down there if I go down there. I'll be sneaking off in Rob's

01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:34.000
trunk a la, you know, Sprytle from, you know,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.320
Speed Racer. Well, we're trying to swing it. Anybody want to be Chim Chim?

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:40.620
I don't know if I can swing the time off work right now or there might actually

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:44.340
be another commitment going on with Undersedation Live. The show I do on

01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:46.660
Saturdays at Undersedationlive.org.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:50.140
I'm the number one guest there.

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:53.460
I'm trying to swing one weekend.

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.020
Excuse me, I have hiccups.

01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:57.060
Semi-live radio, ladies and gentlemen.

01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.500
I will scare them out of you.

01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:01.800
Vanilla ice!

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.980
I'm dying, I'm dying.

01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.140
We're trying to go back.

01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:12.580
Myself, Melody, and Mel B, and my boyfriend Glenn, we're all going to try to go down to

01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:15.120
the Price is Right.

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:18.740

01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:22.140

01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:41.840

01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:05.320
that i could really hear keyboard mania

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.380
uh... i think that uh...

01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:12.380
One thing, that video right there, the Evangelion, it's an anime, it reminds me of something I just got about two weeks ago.

01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:12.880
Oh.

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.380
Okay.

01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:17.380
You might want to check your local grocery outlet, as I do, every now and then.

01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:18.380
Grocery outlet.

01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:21.380
I found the entire series of Bubble Gum Crisis there for two dollars.

01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:23.380
Dub or sub?

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:24.380
Both.

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:25.880
Awesome, DVDs?

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:27.880
I will check.

01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.380
Although I already have, you know, two of the laser discs.

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:32.880
Wow, man.

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.880
And Bubble Gum Crisis laser disc and...

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.380
I'm just saying though, um...

01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:43.700
Recently, the one down in Rockland here on Sunrise has been getting all kinds of DVDs

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.180
and books, good books, computer games even.

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:47.180
All kinds of stuff.

01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:48.180
Just two dollars.

01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:49.180
Everything.

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:50.180
I will check it out.

01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:51.180
Thank you for the info.

01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:52.180
All right.

01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:53.180
Any of you who live anywhere near here.

01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:55.180
You heard it on Orange Lounge Radio first, y'all.

01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:57.860
So do we have any more things to say to the listener?

01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:58.860
All right.

01:50:58.860 --> 01:50:59.860
I'm going to hand it back to Rob now.

01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:00.860
All right.

01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:01.860
Y'all.

01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:02.860
Hi.

01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:03.860
So did you hear the news about why Jamie was in the office for so long?

01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.480
I was eavesdropping, yes.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:09.620
I did hear a little bit, but what did you hear? I heard something about attorney. Yes

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:16.920
It is official once again aiming for the November ish range. You know not committing to a day yet

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:21.840
We don't probably want to avoid turkey weekend or maybe not because a lot of people be off school turkey weekend

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.220
So maybe that's something to look at who knows?

01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:32.680
Speaking from experience last year went on vacation a lot of occasion not so soon. We'll see the tickets to turkey are really expensive

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:43.600
I'm thinking either weekend before or weekend after Turkey as in like not the ones immediately

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:50.560
next to it but like way after or right proceeding you know why don't hopefully um but it is

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:56.640
official we will be having tournament here at Roseville Golf Plan what else can we talk

01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:01.680
about to close the show out here with I have a really bad headache really why stop I don't

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:04.680
I don't know. Probably because I haven't hardly eaten anything and haven't slept with any.

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:06.680
Well, we need to go eat before we go home.

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:07.680
I need to eat.

01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:08.680
Here's your bad joke. Well, we're gonna go eat then.

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:12.680
Let's go, like, you know, on a rampage and, you know, be cannibals or something.

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:13.680
Hey, when you guys-

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.680
Baby!

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:16.680
Post something on, uh, Sacramento Money, man.

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:19.680
Well, we're- not just Sacramento Money, because it's not just gonna be a Sacramento thing, it's gonna be everywhere.

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.680
We'll post on Sacramento Money, we'll post on DDR Freak.

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:28.680
Hell, you give me- you email us at OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com, we'll come spam your local board, even if you're in, like, Taiwan.

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:32.680
We're going to plug our tournament on your board because it's going to be the biggest damn thing ever.

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.680
We'll have to use one of those online translator services to be able to post.

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.680
My horrible, horrible Babel fish.

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:41.680
No, I found a really nice Japanese one, but I'll be posting that on our forums.

01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:43.680
Make it big and shiny, you know, so I can find it.

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:44.680
Hold on.

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:47.680
Because I'm retarded and I can't browse.

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.680
You'll know. Trust us.

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:52.680
About that translator, yeah, I really like it. It's cool.

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:54.680
Oh, the new one? The new one you found? Tell them about this.

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:58.240
man i don't remember the set up top of my head but it is it's actually a

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.120
japanese translation program

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:04.020
well translation website uh... and he has a japanese native site

01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:05.800
that will translate

01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:09.500
and japanese text to english nearly flawlessly or if you want to page

01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:10.240
through it

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:13.340
it will have to leave the kanji katakana hit it up

01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:16.800
and put english text underneath it and you can even read fan fiction with that

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:20.640
thing is so good while on top of that also translates english to japanese and

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:23.740
a fairly reasonable patterns you can actually put something under look

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:25.800
relatively literate

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.900
have you guys heard the news about why jamie was in the office for so long

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:32.880
from what i understand she was talking with the tech right

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:35.340
we are going to be having tournament here

01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:37.100
winner cause i just spent a good

01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.500
ten minutes talking with mr tech guy to fix every bmani machine

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.180
because like

01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:45.360
i was talking to him and he's like hey you know the soul caliber is broken

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:47.820
and says i have you would you mind coming with me we have a nice tour of the

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.960
arcade i'd like to take you on

01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:51.000
oh that's sweet

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.720
and he's like, hang on, let me get my clipboard.

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.660
It was lots and lots of happy fun.

01:53:56.660 --> 01:54:01.300
Yeah, I have to say, I want to give him a major kudos,

01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:04.920
you know, the kudos are the size of Roseville Golf Land.

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.340
We give Roseville Golf Land a lot of crap on this show.

01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:10.160
Well, maybe a little bit, but uh...

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.040
Really, this is the best arcade in town. This is the best arcade in town.

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:17.880
One of the great places to play. But someone should let Shiggle Boss know that

01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:21.080
the people are big deal don't actually know what he's talking about

01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:24.600
in regards to four plus that's really a good i talked to a doing that and he's

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.620
like uh...

01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:27.960
you know i just don't know about that today it would lead to believe that

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.000
jamie told him that i have a good

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.360
that means that because i thought you might have no other talking about but

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.400
uh...

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.840
i decided like the kind of my care

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:42.260
paid to do you know i came he was in the office for so long

01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.640
uh...

01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:44.980
i didn't like you know i did

01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:46.780
letters that they should be in fact

01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:48.460
that i have no did you have your

01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:49.900
but yeah i'm so

01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:53.820
we're gonna have happy fun turning do you think that too

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:57.180
question for most of the will not be called scats you it'll be

01:54:57.180 --> 01:55:00.020
parties you know one

01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:02.180
but that's not a generic restore

01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.680
it's not a regular plan

01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:07.860
cleverly have to think of it and i don't know what we don't be like

01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.000
legal one

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.020
middle one in

01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:12.660
political order whatever

01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:17.220

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:21.200
talking bay area we will not have a tournament named after crap

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.300
uh...

01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:28.100
but it's what made us unique we will not have a tournament named after crap

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.980
political extent of the

01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:31.820
second opportunity in bowling

01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:33.260
that uh...

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:35.100
decided that i had a

01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:40.100
at a minute named after bodily functions as in scab forming or feces

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:41.960
uh...

01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:46.320
uh... and i don't know where he's going to tell

01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:47.880
how about like uh...

01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:52.280
sacramental sacramentals uh...

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.080

uh...

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:19.640
dude

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:23.680
you're going to be along for a discussion of what you know that

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.760
second money dot com presents the tournament

01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:29.120
just

01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:31.440
that's all you do is the tournament

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:34.080
dude you know we've got to do something cool though

01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.820
because we we made ourselves unique last year

01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:39.280
by at the uh... fulsome game room fdr

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.920

01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:53.240

miggle is milkinga golf land, sugol, sunny valley golf land, shiggle is southern hill

01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:02.200

cvgl is uh... central valley golf land etcetera etcetera

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:10.920

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.160
seconds before we get kicked out so

01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:16.680
