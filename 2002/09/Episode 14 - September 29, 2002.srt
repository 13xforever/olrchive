1
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:09,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a videotape!

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it in!

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it in!

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,239
[SPEAKER_13]: You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Our live talk program begins now.

6
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:24,905
Boring!

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,952
[SPEAKER_07]: This video sucks!

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

9
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:41,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

10
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:45,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

11
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:48,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Hide Orange Lounge radio for the fucking children.

12
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:52,314
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Metroid is in captivity.

13
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:55,517
[SPEAKER_01]: The galaxy is at peace.

14
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:11,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

15
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:15,158
[SPEAKER_07]: My kind of people and assholes.

16
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:20,560
[SPEAKER_06]: One, Warner, he's good.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Missed it by that much.

18
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:24,321
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Dr. Evil's cat.

19
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,301
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you tell?

20
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:26,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I never forget a pussy.

21
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:30,403
[SPEAKER_08]: 37.

22
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:30,403
[SPEAKER_08]: My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks.

23
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:31,224
[SPEAKER_08]: In a row?

24
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:31,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

25
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

26
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:35,426
[SPEAKER_08]: You are the weakest link to fight.

27
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:37,368
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get nothing.

28
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:38,629
[SPEAKER_08]: You lose.

29
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Good day, sir.

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

31
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:52,678
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange

32
00:01:54,099 --> 00:02:00,105
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 14 for September the 29th of 2002.

33
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:03,769
[SPEAKER_04]: You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most incredible radio station of all things B-Money.

34
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:24,116
[SPEAKER_17]: We are the greatest Bomani Talk radio program ever.

35
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:26,799
[SPEAKER_17]: We are the only Bomani Talk radio program ever.

36
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,381
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Rob Roberts.

37
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:31,263
[SPEAKER_17]: But you might know me as Sky.

38
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:33,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Joining me as always is our resident Happy Bunny.

39
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:36,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone, please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

40
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:38,129
[SPEAKER_09]: You smell like butt.

41
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,632
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got a few people around here tonight.

42
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,433
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to introduce them one at a time.

43
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:45,015
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got Matt, also known as Loki.

44
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:46,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

45
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:47,237
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got Dave.

46
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:50,519
[SPEAKER_17]: We had some other people, but they ran away.

47
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,680
[SPEAKER_17]: There's beef in the other room.

48
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,620
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why they ran away.

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Beef is bad.

50
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,843
[SPEAKER_17]: They got enticed by some big beef.

51
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:58,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Beef is bad.

52
00:02:58,604 --> 00:02:59,424
[SPEAKER_17]: It's hiding in the other room.

53
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:00,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Beef is bad.

54
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:03,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Beasts taste like murder and murder tastes good.

55
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,559
[SPEAKER_09]: To quote Dennis Leary.

56
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,761
[SPEAKER_17]: I will tell you right now, this is going to be one of those shows.

57
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:11,403
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get into it later.

58
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:22,930
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to go ahead and send me your FUs of the week, just join our chat room at irc.eggheads.org, any other side IRC server, and you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

59
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:30,535
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll be talking to everybody else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to play some old school 2DX songs, because they're cool.

60
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:33,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?

61
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:37,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to open someone's head to see what they've got.

62
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:37,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Brains!

63
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Brains are yummy.

64
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,140
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use a straw to eat them.

65
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Because remember, I can sniff your spicy brains.

66
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:50,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Red Dragon 2, starring Jamie Summers.

67
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:52,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Brains.

68
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:55,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd starve in here, though.

69
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,806
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, we'll be right back.

70
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,211
Thank you for watching.

71
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:31,212
See you next time.

72
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,071
Thank you for watching!

73
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:55,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

74
00:07:55,748 --> 00:08:00,719
[SPEAKER_10]: From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bomani stuff, comes our Bomani Science Lesson of the Day.

75
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.

76
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

77
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:20,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Big thanks to 23rd Magus for sending us that promo we just used to come back in on.

78
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:26,574
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately it came out a little quiet, but we'll work on getting that a little louder for future broadcasts of that promo.

79
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,801
[SPEAKER_17]: We need more promos on this show because I'm getting lazy.

80
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:35,944
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm getting lazy, so the audience needs to take care of that for me if they want.

81
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:40,207
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just reading some things in the chat room.

82
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:46,431
[SPEAKER_17]: If you do want to join our chat room, go to any other site, IRC server, and just join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

83
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:51,494
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're just talking about those songs that we played, Panorama and Shine On.

84
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,896
[SPEAKER_17]: And all sorts of different opinions on that.

85
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:55,577
[SPEAKER_17]: What do we want to do first?

86
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:58,179
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to talk about Max USA or we want to talk about FU?

87
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:01,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was going to start us off on a positive note.

88
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:04,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we're going to talk about Max USA, DDL Max.

89
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:11,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically, I've gotten a little bit of information about the release of DDR Max.

90
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:15,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure for everyone who's been looking on DDR Freak, you've seen the release of the box art.

91
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:20,869
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have not, just go to DDRFreak.com, and it should be the second announcement there.

92
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,410
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a direct link to the box art.

93
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I warn you, it is a very large image.

94
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,570
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very high quality, though.

95
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:30,832
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a few hints on what you might be hearing on the new version.

96
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:31,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

97
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:34,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you can also check it out over on SoCalKicks.com.

98
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:42,221
[SPEAKER_17]: One of our faithful listeners, SoCalKicks, has a site that's pretty much very up to the minute on all the Max USA news.

99
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:49,307
[SPEAKER_17]: And one thing that we found out through the cover, and I'm going to pull up the cover because some people in the room here haven't... Ah, shit.

100
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:50,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry about that.

101
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:54,492
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't pulled up the cover for some people in the room here.

102
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,394
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to do that right now if I can find it.

103
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see... But the cover of DDR Max USA...

104
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,384
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

105
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:37,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not particularly fond of that version, but... It's just all fucked up.

106
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,391
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell?

107
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:52,528
[SPEAKER_17]: They look like parachute pants

108
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:18,943
[SPEAKER_17]: is best known for a song of theirs called Sandstorm, which you may or may not have heard.

109
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:28,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, speculation is that that will be the song that will turn up in DDR Max USA, although, who knows, you have a different opinion on this, Matt, do you?

110
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:31,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, there's another song that's pretty much the same song.

111
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:32,427
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Feel the Beat.

112
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:39,049
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got a lot more stuff that they could do with instead of Sandstorm, which is the same thing repeating over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

113
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:41,169
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually have an MP3.

114
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:43,310
[SPEAKER_16]: We can play that later on in the show if you'd like.

115
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:47,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

116
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,729
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Sandstorm, for those of you who maybe haven't heard the song before.

117
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:54,172
[SPEAKER_17]: So, if you have an idea of what you can look forward to, possibly.

118
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:54,813
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know yet.

119
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:57,375
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll hopefully get confirmation on that very soon in the near future.

120
00:11:57,435 --> 00:11:59,698
[SPEAKER_17]: So, there's a little teaser of that for you.

121
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:01,359
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Reel2Reel did that song...

122
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:07,747
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have an audio copy of it, unfortunately, but it goes like, I'd like to move it, move it, I'd like to move it.

123
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:08,407
[SPEAKER_17]: You might know that one.

124
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard that song at all.

125
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:11,850
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd probably know it if you heard it.

126
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,671
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd probably be surprised at what you've heard.

127
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:22,898
[SPEAKER_09]: We also, I asked if it was okay for me to say, so the tentative date is going to be November 5th.

128
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:29,143
[SPEAKER_09]: It could possibly be pushed back a week after that, but that's what I have so far as a release date.

129
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:34,128
[SPEAKER_09]: So get over to GameStop or EB or wherever that you like to go and reserve your copy, like now.

130
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:35,549
[SPEAKER_17]: November 5th.

131
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:36,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy your copy.

132
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Purchase your copy.

133
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:39,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Spend money on this copy.

134
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:41,735
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's very cool.

135
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:45,900
[SPEAKER_17]: We got a, hopefully, it's tentative release date, but it sounds pretty certain it's going to be November 5th.

136
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:55,705
[SPEAKER_16]: And as mentioned last week in the October 8th issue of the official PlayStation Magazine will be a demo of DDR Max USA, so go check that out.

137
00:12:56,086 --> 00:13:00,729
[SPEAKER_17]: And actually, that was the other bit of news that was released this week.

138
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people have gotten their hands on that demo.

139
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:11,496
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, I believe DDR Freak has the news, as does SoCalKicks.com, as does most of your faithful Bomani news sites out there.

140
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:15,479
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some pictures out there of the DDR Max demo.

141
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:22,460
[SPEAKER_17]: And what it does reveal is that Secret Rendezvous is going to be one of the songs on Max USA, which is... Yes!

142
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:32,602
[SPEAKER_17]: You can get your hot lesbian action on with Secret Rendezvous, which is interesting because that means there's a Max 2 song in there, so who knows what other Max 2 songs might turn up.

143
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:37,583
[SPEAKER_17]: Perhaps I'd like to see, you know, like Burning Heat or Kakumei.

144
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:38,803
[SPEAKER_09]: You want Burning Heat?

145
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,084
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want Burning Heat personally, but I'd like to see it in DDR, yes.

146
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:43,904
[SPEAKER_17]: So...

147
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:47,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, just make sure that you release your copy.

148
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:55,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it's funny, though, how they replaced the kanji with little three-letter acronyms for the... Not acronyms, that's not a good word, but abbreviations.

149
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And standard is apparently STD.

150
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:02,364
[SPEAKER_17]: STD, so if you're playing a song on Trick, it's now your STD.

151
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:04,746
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure you wear those latex shoes.

152
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,169
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to talk about your new shoes that you got, Jamie.

153
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:11,751
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got burning heat shoes on today.

154
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:12,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

155
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, we don't have our cam on today because it's really dark in here.

156
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:20,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I will scan my shoes so that everyone can see and put them up on the Sack of Imani forums.

157
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:24,261
[SPEAKER_17]: But they've got little flames on them, so it looks like the Max 2 logo.

158
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:25,742
[SPEAKER_17]: So she's got burning feet, we all say.

159
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:29,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, replaced the laces with black laces, so now they're all sleek and cute.

160
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:36,788
[SPEAKER_17]: My shoes own, and I got them at the Vans outlet, so... The other thing the demo reveals, there's no .5 speed mix.

161
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:45,753
[SPEAKER_17]: That was something that was on the E3 demo that's not on this demo, so who knows if it's going to be on the final release or not.

162
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,094
[SPEAKER_17]: There are no dark mode.

163
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:51,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Rumor saying not, because of technical issues, but who knows what they're going to do.

164
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,683
[SPEAKER_17]: The demo also did not include foot rankings, which was something that's supposedly supposed to be in the final release.

165
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:02,665
[SPEAKER_17]: So that might be added later, we just don't know yet.

166
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:06,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Just saying for the preview, there are no foot rankings currently.

167
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:08,348
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's about all we see for right now.

168
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:15,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Let the beat hit them, look to the sky, exotic ethnic and secret rendezvous, all playable with this month's official PlayStation magazine.

169
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:21,915
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll definitely get our hands on that and share our thoughts on it with you once we get it.

170
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:22,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Still working on it.

171
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:23,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

172
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:26,052
[SPEAKER_17]: So, let's see, any other chat room?

173
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:36,796
[SPEAKER_17]: They're saying they want to see, like, Long Train Runnin', The Whistle Song, and, uh... Uh... Foot Rankings will be in the final release.

174
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:38,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Hmm.

175
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:39,017
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

176
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:39,537
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

177
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:40,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we have some information in there.

178
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:42,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Some insider scoop.

179
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:46,300
[SPEAKER_09]: The last thing to be put in is going to be, uh, the Foot Rankings.

180
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So... They're still working on it.

181
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:52,643
[SPEAKER_17]: They're encouraging us not to share our thoughts, but to share an ISO of the demo.

182
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:52,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Ha ha!

183
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,771
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

184
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:55,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Go out and buy your copy.

185
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:56,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Or just wait and buy Max USA.

186
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:58,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Save your money.

187
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:11,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Why Am I Being Shot?

188
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:18,232
[SPEAKER_17]: What else do we want to say on Max USA?

189
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:21,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other thoughts on Max USA?

190
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:24,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Things that they need to do quickly before the final release?

191
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:26,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Other songs we hope to see?

192
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:28,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Any opinions?

193
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:42,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, actually, if you look really, really, really, really, really closely in the background of Max USA, the cover, you'll notice in really, really, really small print hidden in there, it says, yes, there will most definitely be Let Them Move in this version.

194
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:46,170
[SPEAKER_16]: So just, you know, to warn you guys.

195
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Watch out for that.

196
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:49,634
No.

197
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:55,957
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed by Jason himself that Let Them Move will not be a song.

198
00:16:56,377 --> 00:17:00,879
[SPEAKER_17]: But I heard a rumor that it might be the Training Mode song.

199
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:01,339
[SPEAKER_17]: It better not be.

200
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:01,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

201
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I would rather have After the Game of Love for Training Mode.

202
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:05,161
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like in third mix.

203
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't you just get rid of Training Mode and give us a couple more songs?

204
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:13,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I use Training Mode to listen to my edits with the clap assist on.

205
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:17,863
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, actually we're confusing lesson mode and training mode.

206
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:20,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Training mode is the one where you can slow down the song and all that stuff.

207
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:24,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Lesson mode is where you learn how to play TDR.

208
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:31,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Lesson mode is to just keep, you know, like in 3rd Mix they had a pimp song, you know, after the Game of Love.

209
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Did they?

210
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, that's right.

211
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,072
[SPEAKER_14]: It's when you're not quite ready for the STDs, you go to lesson mode.

212
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:40,489
[SPEAKER_09]: and remember, wear latex shoes so you don't catch those STDs.

213
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:40,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

214
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:45,115
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like poor little Miss Muffet who saddled her trumpet.

215
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:50,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this is... Black Lab suggests that instead of Max 300, Let Them Move will be the extra stage.

216
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:56,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone will be feeling that because they'll be like throwing up or something.

217
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:56,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Let them...

218
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,328
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so we started on a positive note.

219
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:04,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Shall we go to the FUs of the week?

220
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:04,730
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you think?

221
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

222
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:06,271
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

223
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:07,091
[SPEAKER_17]: You got one, Jamie?

224
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:07,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

225
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:14,697
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, let's start off, as we always do, with Jamie's FU of the week, which turns in always to everybody's FU of the week, so here you go.

226
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,979
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes to Taco Bell.

227
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:21,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I hadn't eaten a damn thing all day.

228
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:23,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I get to Taco Bell.

229
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:29,967
[SPEAKER_09]: and I wanted to have a nice, you know, chicken grilled stuff burrito.

230
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:32,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted a chicken mix and melt.

231
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:35,749
[SPEAKER_09]: My chicken mix and melt was yummy, but it had tomatoes on it, but I forgot, that's okay.

232
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:46,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, we get over here to Rob's place, and I take a bite into my grilled stuff burrito, my chicken grilled stuff burrito, and it's beans, all beans.

233
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:50,945
[SPEAKER_09]: All beans and a little bit of rice, and then I found one piece of chicken in the whole damn thing.

234
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:52,306
[SPEAKER_09]: And I paid for chicken.

235
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:53,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's my F.U.

236
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:54,647
[SPEAKER_09]: of the week.

237
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:56,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that was beautiful.

238
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:57,649
[SPEAKER_14]: My F.U.

239
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,971
[SPEAKER_14]: of the week is to Roseville Golf Land.

240
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's right.

241
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:02,873
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to change the song here.

242
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:03,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my own song.

243
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:04,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, what was my song?

244
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:06,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Petite Love.

245
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:07,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boy.

246
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:10,398
[SPEAKER_14]: What an effing cool song.

247
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:11,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

248
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:12,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

249
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,500
[SPEAKER_14]: My F.U.

250
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,722
[SPEAKER_14]: of the week is to Roseville Golf Land for...

251
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:29,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though they did upgrade both their Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania machines to 8th and 7th mix respectively, they broke Guitar Freaks already after one hour.

252
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:30,697
[SPEAKER_14]: One hour.

253
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,498
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a new record.

254
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:34,536
[SPEAKER_14]: They can't upgrade- IT'S A NEW RECORD!

255
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:37,217
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got a new record, save it on the memory card!

256
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:50,502
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but it's really shitty now, because I played Drone Mania a lot, and that's cool, but if I want to play session mode, too fucking bad, because Guitar Freaks, they already fucked it up, and they haven't even started playing yet.

257
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,083
[SPEAKER_14]: It was open, I think, for one hour.

258
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:56,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, if you think about it, it wasn't as bad as when they got the seventh mix.

259
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:59,326
[SPEAKER_14]: The seventh mix, they couldn't even play it, it just broke.

260
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Because of some coding.

261
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:04,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, when we got this mix, do you know who installed that?

262
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:06,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Who actually got it working?

263
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,607
[SPEAKER_09]: My fiancé did!

264
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan got it working!

265
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:10,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

266
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,532
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we should just send Dan over there and say, hey, fix this.

267
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:17,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that's also why this mix was set for two tokens when we first got it.

268
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.

269
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:21,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt, you got any fuckies of the week?

270
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:22,481
Um...

271
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I don't think I do.

272
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:29,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, fine, for once.

273
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:33,481
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I haven't really been thinking about things to be angry at.

274
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, let me see here.

275
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:36,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

276
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:36,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

277
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:42,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, you lose.

278
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

279
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, I got it.

280
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:44,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one.

281
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:45,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

282
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:53,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, this FU goes to the makers of EJ Software, the programs I use for making wonderful songs.

283
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:58,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, I have a sample kit, and I wanted to steal samples from it.

284
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:05,736
[SPEAKER_16]: And they have a little thing in there to bump the pitch up so that it's, you know, at 140, which is what EJ uses.

285
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:08,338
[SPEAKER_16]: And the damn thing kept crashing every single time.

286
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:09,359
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have to do that.

287
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,160
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's kind of weak, but that's it.

288
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:12,145
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I got.

289
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:14,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll have more next week.

290
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:16,028
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

291
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:16,789
[SPEAKER_14]: You promise?

292
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:17,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise.

293
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,990
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

294
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:21,553
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing I do have to say is that drumming is something that's totally owned.

295
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:26,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Kuchaka and Concierto in Blue and the Extra Stage in Japanese, I can't read it.

296
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:29,140
[SPEAKER_14]: They all play the coolest songs.

297
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I just need to get over there and play it so I can play Another World and have my gags fixed.

298
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:41,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be bringing that song next week and we are going to play Another World on Orange Lounge because Gactones, he's pretty.

299
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:43,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some FUs of the week.

300
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:46,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very, very, very, very, very interesting.

301
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,101
[SPEAKER_17]: I have some FUs of the week.

302
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:56,788
[SPEAKER_17]: My first FU of the week, as wonderful as they are for hosting this wonderful program, Live365.com gets my first FU of the week.

303
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:02,548
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, for playing that goddamn Prodigy ad and we missed the show.

304
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:08,370
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm all for, you know, playing the ads occasionally to help pay the bills, but that Prodigy song sucks, I'm sorry.

305
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Quit playing that ad during my show.

306
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:15,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Second, F you for them, is that they keep stats.

307
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:19,535
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can see, you know, how many people are listening to the show, how many hours we get and all that.

308
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:20,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, guess what?

309
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:24,637
[SPEAKER_17]: For every station on Live 365, they lost last week's stat.

310
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:32,399
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the way, I happen to know, because I see live stats that are coming in, that last Sunday happened to be one of our biggest nights for the show to date.

311
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,721
[SPEAKER_17]: And we don't get any credit for that now, so our ratings suck, thanks to Live365.com.

312
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:38,221
[SPEAKER_17]: So FU!

313
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:39,182
[SPEAKER_09]: So poo-poo on them.

314
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:40,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody, plug in twice.

315
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:43,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Although, thanks for hosting the show.

316
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:44,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, what can I say?

317
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,164
[SPEAKER_17]: But you fucked up on that one, so poo.

318
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:47,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Poo-pee.

319
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:47,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Poo-pee on you.

320
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:51,506
[SPEAKER_17]: My other FU of the week goes to my 2DX controller.

321
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:56,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Because button number 3 and button number 7 have been sticking like, like a lot.

322
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:57,798
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hate it.

323
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,030
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

324
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,430
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my last FU.

325
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,591
[SPEAKER_17]: You have another FU, Jamie.

326
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:11,172
[SPEAKER_09]: My next FU goes toward Holic, R5, and Y31, yet again.

327
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:13,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so close to passing this one.

328
00:23:13,632 --> 00:23:22,914
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I had a freaking full combo on R5 going into right before that one really hard part that I always had issues with.

329
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:26,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And I lost it the whole song because I can't figure that one part out.

330
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:28,215
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know...

331
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:31,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to all of the seven star songs.

332
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to pass one of you.

333
00:23:32,682 --> 00:23:32,923
[SPEAKER_09]: One day.

334
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:34,466
[SPEAKER_09]: One day I will.

335
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:37,051
[SPEAKER_09]: One day my prince will come.

336
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:37,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that a promise?

337
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:38,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

338
00:23:39,605 --> 00:23:40,786
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I promised at the threat.

339
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I mean, not at the threat.

340
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:46,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Max, chatroom, any FUs?

341
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:49,890
[SPEAKER_17]: The chatroom has a ton of FUs right now, so I'm going to get some of those.

342
00:23:50,251 --> 00:24:01,397
[SPEAKER_17]: But first off, I have to state that, actually, our resident comedian in the chatroom, Pyro Man, is back, and he suggested how you can get a sticky controller.

343
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:04,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Just the secret rendezvous video and four hours on Kazop.

344
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:05,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

345
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:10,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's get to the FUs from the chatroom, shall we?

346
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, hold on, this isn't fair.

347
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,371
[SPEAKER_14]: They get a cool song, and I get the tea bug.

348
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:19,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, life sucks.

349
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:20,172
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

350
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:27,025
[SPEAKER_17]: SoCalKicks says, Fuck you everyone who is bitching because for me life has never been better.

351
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:35,171
[SPEAKER_17]: And fuck you everyone who is calling him Fox version 2.0 because his latest picture makes him look like Fox even though I'd rather laugh at the situation and go along with it.

352
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:36,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever that means.

353
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:37,653
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that was half inside joke.

354
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:44,699
[SPEAKER_17]: JB says, F you to SyFam for being so cheap they can't properly advertise their artists like Jenny Rom.

355
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:46,840
[SPEAKER_17]: He's such a Jenny Rom whore.

356
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:48,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you saw it in his...

357
00:24:52,626 --> 00:25:01,108
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Konami wants to give an F you to the assholes that don't take it seriously when I'm teaching them how to play Beatmania.

358
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:04,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we will.

359
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:05,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we will.

360
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:13,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, this is a huge one.

361
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh... Oh, he sent it three times.

362
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:17,997
[SPEAKER_17]: One is enough, don't worry.

363
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:25,202
[SPEAKER_17]: 23rd Magus wants to give a big F you to Absolute Trick, because it caused him much embarrassment when he failed it on the Max 2 on Wednesday.

364
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:26,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you, Absolute!

365
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:30,346
[SPEAKER_17]: I also want to say, fuck you to Earthlink for screwing with their FTP servers for my site.

366
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:34,569
[SPEAKER_17]: And he wants to know if that was, uh, fuck instead of fuck.

367
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:37,731
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a spelling thing, anyway.

368
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:41,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, more F... Oh, Bradley's here.

369
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:42,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, what's up, Bradley?

370
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:43,833
[SPEAKER_04]: My power went out, so I had to come over here.

371
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:47,014
[SPEAKER_17]: You couldn't hear the show at your own house, so you had to come over here.

372
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, right on.

373
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:53,536
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing to do in my apartment without power, so... So you want to give a big F you to power?

374
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:55,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, power.

375
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:01,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, Twen has not only... Oh my god, he's got a bunch.

376
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:03,359
[SPEAKER_17]: He's got six, here we go.

377
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:07,733
[SPEAKER_17]: FU number one, Japan played every other fucking song on Fifth Mix.

378
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,294
[SPEAKER_17]: That's FU number one, that's where you've been.

379
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:12,895
[SPEAKER_17]: FU number two, Feet of Fury beta being pushed back nearly half a month.

380
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:15,536
[SPEAKER_17]: FU number three, AIM for always crapping out.

381
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:18,097
[SPEAKER_17]: FU number four, no one appreciating his mixes, aww.

382
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:21,117
[SPEAKER_17]: FU number five, can't view anything while listening to Orange Lounge.

383
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:26,199
[SPEAKER_17]: FU number six, people dissing me for not passing End of the Century Maniac with a B. Okay.

384
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:27,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Which mix?

385
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,500
[SPEAKER_17]: It depends.

386
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:29,762
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

387
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:48,010
[SPEAKER_17]: His FU is to himself for being a moron and closing Microsoft Word in the middle of an assignment.

388
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:48,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Dope!

389
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:49,811
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you save.

390
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:51,971
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why we use autosave.

391
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:52,912
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

392
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:59,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, this is a rule for whenever... The rule for word processors and programs applies to RPGs.

393
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:01,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Save often.

394
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:09,436
[SPEAKER_17]: And Pyro Man wants to give an FU to me for starting the show so damn late in Illinois.

395
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:10,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, fuck you, Rob.

396
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:13,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, hold on.

397
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:14,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on, Pyro Man.

398
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,510
[SPEAKER_17]: I got something for you.

399
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:20,874
[SPEAKER_17]: I have exactly the message to give to you.

400
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:28,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me call you an ambulance.

401
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:29,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

402
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:31,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

403
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Twin wants to point out that that's Fifth Mix that he plays in the Sentry on.

404
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:36,705
[SPEAKER_17]: And...

405
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:41,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Black Lab, I missed your FUs, you're going to have to resend them, I'm sorry.

406
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:45,296
[SPEAKER_17]: If you didn't send them over to... Oh, he has nothing, I guess, unless you wrote them in black.

407
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:46,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, whatever.

408
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:53,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Chaos says, FU to Beautiful Days, because he got one regular grade on it.

409
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:55,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Oops, a little loud.

410
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,160
[SPEAKER_17]: And everything else is a flashing grade.

411
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Frowny face.

412
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:02,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Pyro Man says... Oh, same thing.

413
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:05,963
[SPEAKER_17]: DDR Mike says, FU to Big Black Cock.

414
00:28:08,112 --> 00:28:10,253
[SPEAKER_16]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

415
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:36,254
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to see pictures right now.

416
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:38,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all the pictures.

417
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:40,857
[SPEAKER_17]: That was relating to SoCalKick's post.

418
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say, yes, sort of.

419
00:28:42,438 --> 00:28:43,479
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll look at that during break.

420
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,402
[SPEAKER_17]: He did want to point out also we have some follow-up on DDR Max USA stuff.

421
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:51,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

422
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:56,355
[SPEAKER_17]: From the E3 beta version of DDR Max USA, it was announced a new half-speed would be in the list of modes.

423
00:28:56,415 --> 00:29:05,940
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, its absence from the first November-issue demo of Official PlayStation Magazine is rumored that it was removed from the final version because of technical difficulties.

424
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Foot rankings confirmed here on SoCalKicks.com.

425
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:14,784
[SPEAKER_17]: People began to worry about that, too, because it was also absent from the demo.

426
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:18,726
[SPEAKER_17]: But I can tell you right now, it is one of the last things that's going to be put into the game.

427
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:20,808
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

428
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:46,409
[SPEAKER_17]: will make it into DDR Max USA, similar to an Oni mode, perhaps.

429
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:48,470
[SPEAKER_17]: So, take that all with a grain of salt.

430
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,171
[SPEAKER_17]: It's still rumor, rumor, rumorville.

431
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:55,714
[SPEAKER_17]: So, that's it.

432
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:58,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, and there you have it.

433
00:29:59,156 --> 00:29:59,777
[SPEAKER_17]: There you have it.

434
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:00,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you know.

435
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:01,138
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you know.

436
00:30:01,158 --> 00:30:02,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And knowing is half the battle.

437
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:03,119
[SPEAKER_17]: The more you know.

438
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:14,888
[SPEAKER_17]: It's another FU, but it's a personal FU, and I don't like to name people by name for FUs, but Pyroman does want to give an FU to a certain individual because he smells.

439
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:17,170
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know who you are.

440
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,191
[SPEAKER_17]: You know who you are.

441
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:20,933
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody make sure you've been bathing, because you're pissing off Pyroman.

442
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:23,295
[SPEAKER_17]: And on that note, I think we're going to go to break.

443
00:30:23,315 --> 00:30:23,735
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you think?

444
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is a wonderful idea.

445
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:29,480
[SPEAKER_17]: We are going to take a quick break, and we will come right back.

446
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,499
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back.

447
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:36,286
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been requested to play the DJ Konami thing, which I'm going to have to dig up and find.

448
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:37,789
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get to that pretty soon.

449
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,696
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to start off with one of my favorite songs from Max 2.

450
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:42,237
[SPEAKER_17]: How's that sound?

451
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:42,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Winner.

452
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:25,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

453
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:24,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.

454
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:29,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

455
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:33,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen carefully and try to follow.

456
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,007
[SPEAKER_08]: The objects will come down from the top.

457
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:39,670
[SPEAKER_08]: When it hits the red line, push the button.

458
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:44,194
[SPEAKER_08]: When it hits the red line, turn the table.

459
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:45,575
[SPEAKER_05]: You get it?

460
00:32:45,995 --> 00:32:47,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's practice.

461
00:32:48,977 --> 00:32:49,238
[SPEAKER_07]: First,

462
00:33:14,455 --> 00:33:15,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

463
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:55,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

464
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,281
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard, but you can do it!

465
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:23,084
[SPEAKER_07]: New Feet Mania

466
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:57,952
[SPEAKER_08]: We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.

467
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,464
[SPEAKER_13]: We think we figured it out.

468
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:40,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio.

469
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:44,647
[SPEAKER_17]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 14.

470
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:47,348
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an old promo.

471
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:49,089
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm starting to play the old promos again.

472
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:50,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they've been a while.

473
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,951
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a while, so they're fresh again.

474
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:53,691
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a fine wine.

475
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,632
[SPEAKER_17]: You let them age a little bit.

476
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:59,409
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to also talk about another new Bomani game that just hit.

477
00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:01,411
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it is official as of Monday.

478
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,415
[SPEAKER_17]: 2DX8Style is out and about.

479
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:09,240
[SPEAKER_17]: And unfortunately... And somebody... I accidentally closed the window.

480
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,441
[SPEAKER_17]: They sent it in a little too late.

481
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:11,342
[SPEAKER_17]: But...

482
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,731
[SPEAKER_17]: It took them a while to do that with 7th Style too, though.

483
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:14,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

484
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:15,691
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pulling up right now.

485
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:48,219
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got a bunch of the songs that are released, and some of the non-stop courses, which I think is really interesting.

486
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,362
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a Tran course, that's what I like, I think that's really cool.

487
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:58,365
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a Tran course, which consists of Beautiful Days, Alien World, Starmind, G2, and Stoic.

488
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:01,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Although I think G2 is a scary-ass Tran video, in my opinion.

489
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,568
[SPEAKER_09]: This song is scary.

490
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:10,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the other non-stop course names that are interesting, Feel, DJ Taka, of course, Eurobeat, Super Eurobeat,

491
00:37:11,957 --> 00:37:14,358
[SPEAKER_17]: Vocal, Performance, Trance, VJ Hess.

492
00:37:15,178 --> 00:37:15,879
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an interesting one.

493
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:21,421
[SPEAKER_17]: Number five, Newcomer, UG2, Rapid2, Original, Cinderella.

494
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:23,622
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an interesting one.

495
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:25,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's all... Look what that is.

496
00:37:25,663 --> 00:37:26,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Look what the songs are.

497
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:28,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Stick Around, Jelly Kiss, Glorious Days.

498
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:30,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those the sauna tracks?

499
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:33,426
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I don't think Glorious Days is a sauna song.

500
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,907
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just kind of happy sounding songs.

501
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:37,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Piano, Tack...

502
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:42,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Hirata, Hell, of course, and Saturday Night.

503
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,298
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a pretty cool course, Saturday Night.

504
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:50,366
[SPEAKER_17]: You got Dancing into the Night, Blown My Heart Away, Funky Bingo Paradise, Wow Wow 7 Days, and Please Don't Go.

505
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:57,508
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some very interesting genre names in 8th style, which has been getting a lot of laughs out of people.

506
00:37:57,548 --> 00:37:58,928
[SPEAKER_17]: There's one called Cuddlecore.

507
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:03,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Murmur Twins is the name of the song, and that's in the genre.

508
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:04,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Metalhouse just sounds cool.

509
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:05,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Cuddlecore.

510
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:05,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's Metalhouse?

511
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:08,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Metalhouse by Sunglasses of Night.

512
00:38:09,074 --> 00:38:09,954
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be the song.

513
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:15,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Sunglasses of Night would be Metalhouse, and that's good, cool, featuring Hidosewa.

514
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:16,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Psychedelic techno.

515
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:18,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this will be a good one.

516
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:21,841
[SPEAKER_17]: In the girl rock genre, Halfway of Promise by Yutakami.

517
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:24,337
[SPEAKER_17]: I just need to do the sauna course

518
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:46,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Sonic Wars would be cool.

519
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:48,858
[SPEAKER_17]: But unfortunately, we don't know much else about 8th Style.

520
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:50,900
[SPEAKER_17]: We're still waiting to see if any arcades in the U.S.

521
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,621
[SPEAKER_17]: are going to be getting it.

522
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:52,903
[SPEAKER_17]: We know of one that ordered it.

523
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:57,468
[SPEAKER_09]: It has seven buttons on a turntable and effectors.

524
00:38:57,508 --> 00:39:01,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, 8th Style will have seven buttons and a turntable.

525
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,981
[SPEAKER_09]: 14 and 2 turntables.

526
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:09,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's this little hole that you put your coin in and a big plasma screen if you're getting a brand new one like we are.

527
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Scandia anyway.

528
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:13,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, let's see.

529
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:14,270
[SPEAKER_17]: What are they saying in the chat room?

530
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people know more.

531
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:17,533
[SPEAKER_17]: A few arcades are ordering it.

532
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:18,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, which ones?

533
00:39:18,374 --> 00:39:19,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't just tell me a few.

534
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:19,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell me which arcades.

535
00:39:20,155 --> 00:39:23,138
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like that many arcades even have 2DX to begin with.

536
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:27,882
[SPEAKER_17]: We happen to know locally where we base Orange Lounge out of in Sacramento that there's an arcade...

537
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:30,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Black Lab quotes a famous Beck song, Two turntables and a microphone.

538
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:54,997
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be Kraken DJ.

539
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:56,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, with a little switch in the middle.

540
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:57,718
[SPEAKER_17]: Was there a microphone?

541
00:39:57,738 --> 00:39:58,899
[SPEAKER_17]: There's not a microphone in Kraken DJ.

542
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Kraken DJ is a cool game.

543
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,260
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why they don't have more of it in places.

544
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:10,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Kraken DJ, for those that have never played it, it's two turntables and they kind of automatically spin like a real turntable would.

545
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:14,044
[SPEAKER_17]: As you're playing the game and it's all scratching, there's no buttons at all.

546
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:14,664
[SPEAKER_17]: You just scratch.

547
00:40:14,684 --> 00:40:15,504
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a switch in the center.

548
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:19,025
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there's a switch in the center because you have to scratch one turntable and you scratch the other one.

549
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:21,046
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to move it back and forth or you have to...

550
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:25,727
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a pretty difficult game.

551
00:40:25,747 --> 00:40:29,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that 2DX is easier than Kraken DJ.

552
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:31,448
[SPEAKER_09]: By far.

553
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:33,248
[SPEAKER_17]: I wouldn't be more than 100.

554
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,341
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Konami says that San Jose State is also supposed to be getting an 8th mix.

555
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:57,262
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll see.

556
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Or 8th style, sorry.

557
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:00,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're upgrading the 6th.

558
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:07,545
[SPEAKER_17]: I also heard a rumor that Beatmania 7th mix is finally coming out for PS1 on Christmas Eve is the tentative release date.

559
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:08,886
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

560
00:41:08,906 --> 00:41:10,086
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about freaking time.

561
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:10,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Time to get ordering.

562
00:41:11,106 --> 00:41:11,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

563
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:16,528
[SPEAKER_17]: So go place your pre-orders for that on your favorite import game site.

564
00:41:17,348 --> 00:41:19,149
[SPEAKER_09]: But do not buy from BuyRipe.

565
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,692
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're buying it buy right, you're buying wrong.

566
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:23,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they will cheat you.

567
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:28,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, go ahead, but I'm not going to cue the music because I'm lazy.

568
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:32,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's an old fuck you, but just my reasons for saying don't buy it, buy right.

569
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:37,627
[SPEAKER_09]: When I bought my Tekken 4 there, I was expecting to get a Japanese copy so I could have a chance at reading the manual.

570
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:40,549
[SPEAKER_09]: They sent me the Asian release and then wouldn't replace it.

571
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said, oh, you didn't say it was Japanese, we just said it was import.

572
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I could have bought that at YesAsia.com for about $30 cheaper.

573
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,853
[SPEAKER_09]: So buy right will cheat you.

574
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,274
[SPEAKER_09]: They will cheat you.

575
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:52,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't buy there.

576
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:58,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Pyromance said that he held an employee at Gunpoint and now Nickel City in Illinois will be getting 8th style.

577
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:00,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Lovely.

578
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Which we all know is probably a load of crap, but it's funny.

579
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:04,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

580
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:08,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's change gears a little bit here.

581
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,882
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a story I want to... Oh, unless you guys have anything you want to say about 8thStyle?

582
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:21,469
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't play 7-key, let alone 5-key, and all that stuff, so... F you to 8thStyle for being so damn hard.

583
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,431
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.

584
00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:24,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Practice!

585
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:30,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, I'd like to point, that guy that you just flashed the picture up on the screen is very ugly.

586
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:32,717
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get to that in a little bit.

587
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:34,559
[SPEAKER_17]: You're a 2DX player, Bradley.

588
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:36,020
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you think of 8thStyle so far?

589
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:37,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks cool.

590
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:44,895
[SPEAKER_17]: I've listened to much of the music so far, but... Do you think it's going to be the biggest 2DX style ever, ever, ever?

591
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:49,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that, but we shall see.

592
00:42:49,558 --> 00:42:51,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought 5th style was awfully hard to top.

593
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:53,501
[SPEAKER_04]: 6th style?

594
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:55,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought 5th style was hard to top.

595
00:42:56,544 --> 00:42:57,164
[SPEAKER_09]: 6 tries.

596
00:42:57,424 --> 00:43:00,667
[SPEAKER_09]: It's matching, maybe, but I don't think it's better overall than 5th.

597
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:04,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get to this other story.

598
00:43:04,032 --> 00:43:05,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Completely changing gears here a little bit.

599
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

600
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:10,254
[SPEAKER_17]: As if the show wasn't already on its way to a train wreck.

601
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:13,014
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to talk about... This is interesting.

602
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:18,856
[SPEAKER_17]: TwinGalaxies.com This is a link that was sent to me at the end of last week's show.

603
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:19,896
[SPEAKER_17]: I forget who sent it to me.

604
00:43:19,936 --> 00:43:20,396
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

605
00:43:20,796 --> 00:43:24,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoever sent it to me, just go ahead and give yourself an ego boost in the chat room and thanks.

606
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:32,479
[SPEAKER_17]: TwinGalaxies.com The worldwide authority on player rankings, game statistics, and championship tournaments.

607
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:38,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm supposed to mention the extra stage for 8th Style is a revenge song.

608
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:39,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

609
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:40,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay!

610
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:09,991
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll all laugh.

611
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:10,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

612
00:44:11,312 --> 00:44:13,473
[SPEAKER_17]: This is breaking news as of July 29th.

613
00:44:13,493 --> 00:44:14,774
[SPEAKER_17]: We're a little late in reporting here.

614
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:15,275
[SPEAKER_16]: What can we do?

615
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:16,015
[SPEAKER_16]: This guy's ugly.

616
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:18,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Now be nice.

617
00:44:18,597 --> 00:44:19,338
[SPEAKER_17]: He might be listening.

618
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:22,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody listens to this.

619
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,702
[SPEAKER_16]: No, he's working on breaking his own world record.

620
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:38,693
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the hottest new series of modern arcade titles to play is the Dance Dance Revolution series by Konami, with the most current and popular release officially known as DDR Max 2, which in effect is the seventh mix in the series.

621
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,743
[SPEAKER_17]: For those unfamiliar with the game, players select different songs and become physically engaged in the game itself.

622
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:50,486
[SPEAKER_17]: It makes it sound like the last stage of Nick Arcade when they were swatting flies on the blue screen.

623
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:54,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Judging by the look of this ugly person, he hasn't been engaged in this game very long.

624
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:10,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Dancing literally in order to hit the specific arrow directions on the floor pad with their feet.

625
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:18,984
[SPEAKER_17]: This title, along with others such as MoCap Boxing and Police 911, are part of the latest trend in modern video gaming.

626
00:45:19,444 --> 00:45:21,606
[SPEAKER_17]: physically interactive gameplay.

627
00:45:42,737 --> 00:45:43,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

628
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:45,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Bunga Bunga always gets a laugh on this show.

629
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:46,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the article.

630
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,722
[SPEAKER_17]: We can talk about that until the cows come home.

631
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:53,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Making sure, okay, I just... So back to our article.

632
00:45:53,165 --> 00:45:54,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, back to the article, yes.

633
00:45:55,827 --> 00:45:56,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Twin Galaxies.

634
00:45:56,367 --> 00:46:09,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Twin Galaxies chief referee Robert T, I can't say your last name, proclaims gamer Damien Sarkoony as our first verified and recognized world champion at the DDR Max 2 title with a five score song total of...

635
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:10,558
[SPEAKER_17]: of 315,802,020 points.

636
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:32,314
[SPEAKER_17]: If I recall correctly, if you play a 9-foot song, the max score you'll get on a max 2 is 90 million, correct?

637
00:46:32,654 --> 00:46:35,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Multiply that by 5, that's 450 million.

638
00:46:36,315 --> 00:46:43,496
[SPEAKER_17]: So even if you fucked up your 5 9-footers completely, you should have a score of at least 400 million points, correct?

639
00:46:44,296 --> 00:46:47,957
[SPEAKER_17]: This guy has the world record with a score of 315 million.

640
00:46:47,977 --> 00:46:49,057
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like 4 7-footers and a 6.

641
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:49,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

642
00:46:55,205 --> 00:47:01,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Hell, I could play friggin' Dynamite Ray Basic on stealth five times and still beat that damn score.

643
00:47:01,808 --> 00:47:03,289
[SPEAKER_17]: The sirens are going outside.

644
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:05,370
[SPEAKER_17]: The world thinks this is madness.

645
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:20,357
[SPEAKER_17]: The world record is 315 million, held by... The official Twin Galaxies tournament settings have already been determined for this title and appear later in this breaking news story, which we'll read.

646
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:23,338
[SPEAKER_17]: But before we get into that, let's recap the experience.

647
00:47:24,238 --> 00:47:30,443
[SPEAKER_17]: The game's record capabilities are unusual in that the scores are not permanently kept in the game's memory as far as points are concerned.

648
00:47:31,284 --> 00:47:33,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, if you have a memory card, it'll save it to the memory card.

649
00:47:33,906 --> 00:47:38,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, I should mention that one of the rules for entering this world record is you have to be fucking ugly.

650
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:43,234
[SPEAKER_09]: The scores are too safe.

651
00:47:43,274 --> 00:47:43,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt, go!

652
00:47:44,075 --> 00:47:44,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Go do it!

653
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:50,821
[SPEAKER_09]: The scores are safe if you've got your initials in the machine that has your score beside it when it pops up on the screen.

654
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:57,378
[SPEAKER_16]: While his score was world record breaking, it wasn't good enough to place on the top ten.

655
00:47:57,718 --> 00:47:59,158
[SPEAKER_17]: SoCalKicks is going right now.

656
00:47:59,198 --> 00:48:00,439
[SPEAKER_17]: He says he's running out with the camera.

657
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:01,460
[SPEAKER_17]: He's going to take a picture of it.

658
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,400
[SPEAKER_17]: SoCalKicks, you can't do it.

659
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,040
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not ugly.

660
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,301
[SPEAKER_17]: You're Fox 2.0, remember?

661
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:04,881
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't do it.

662
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:07,883
[SPEAKER_09]: And besides that, you still owe me that screen capture so you can get my GameCube pen.

663
00:48:08,163 --> 00:48:09,383
[SPEAKER_17]: So sit your ass down.

664
00:48:11,324 --> 00:48:12,345
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to be in trouble for that one.

665
00:48:12,785 --> 00:48:13,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

666
00:48:14,165 --> 00:48:19,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Further machines set to five song attempts use only the sum of the last three songs for the record.

667
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:23,849
[SPEAKER_17]: To be fair, I'm authorizing two different records to be tracked separately.

668
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:27,093
[SPEAKER_17]: One for three song and one for five song submissions.

669
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:30,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Most machines are set to a minute thirty to two minutes per song.

670
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:34,962
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't think time ever had anything to do with it, but whatever.

671
00:48:35,692 --> 00:48:36,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

672
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:43,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Further, there are several rest periods in between songs based on the actions you must do for the setting and song selection.

673
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:48,420
[SPEAKER_17]: I have included my ruling on this with the TGTS information below.

674
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,841
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Twin Galaxy, a little bit of Judge Judy action here.

675
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:52,882
[SPEAKER_17]: They're making a ruling.

676
00:48:52,902 --> 00:48:56,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Because these guys have been around since the 80s, so they're old and sad.

677
00:48:56,584 --> 00:48:56,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

678
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:06,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's sad.

679
00:49:07,228 --> 00:49:09,549
[SPEAKER_09]: They have no concept of how a DDR machine works.

680
00:49:10,129 --> 00:49:12,190
[SPEAKER_17]: How can they be considered an authority on something?

681
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:12,251
[SPEAKER_17]: P.S.

682
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me restate.

683
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:19,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Since 1981, the worldwide authority on player rankings, gaming statistics, and championship tournaments.

684
00:49:19,734 --> 00:49:22,256
[SPEAKER_09]: They're pretty good at that for me to poop on.

685
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:29,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can't be an authority on something that you apparently know nothing about.

686
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:29,940
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

687
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's keep going here.

688
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,461
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got to finish this.

689
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:42,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking with Damien, as well as fellow DDR fan and Crazy Taxi World Champion, JC Padilla, because Crazy Taxi and DDR have so fucking much in common.

690
00:49:42,715 --> 00:49:44,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you use your feet on a button.

691
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:49,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they both are utilized by ugly people in playing.

692
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:54,460
[SPEAKER_17]: and also some other local expert players.

693
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:59,224
[SPEAKER_16]: But you'll never be the world champion because you're not ugly like that.

694
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:03,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I would love to know who the other local expert players were.

695
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:09,614
[SPEAKER_17]: We picked up these random 8-year-olds from the kindergarten room.

696
00:50:09,654 --> 00:50:15,420
[SPEAKER_17]: We reasoned out the rules and you will see below in their entirety and hope to start logging some more scores on it soon.

697
00:50:16,244 --> 00:50:22,926
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the most important discoveries is the decision that gamers view using the same song up to five times in a row as cheesy.

698
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:26,026
[SPEAKER_17]: So to be fair, my official ruling takes this into consideration.

699
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:28,247
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you play five songs in a row, that's cheesy.

700
00:50:30,787 --> 00:50:32,748
[SPEAKER_17]: The chat room is going off on this, by the way.

701
00:50:32,968 --> 00:50:34,288
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll get to them in a minute.

702
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:37,069
[SPEAKER_17]: The game itself is pretty intense.

703
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:39,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, that was intense!

704
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:47,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And some players even brought their own combination water spray and fan handheld device to cool down in between performances.

705
00:50:47,217 --> 00:50:48,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they buy it at Walmart for $2?

706
00:50:48,738 --> 00:50:52,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Along with Goofy drinking hat filled with Sobe.

707
00:50:56,784 --> 00:50:59,185
[SPEAKER_02]: and elaborate entourage of people with fans.

708
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:06,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm picturing one of these fucking dorks wearing those hats with this straw that goes right in their mouth, a little thing they can squeeze when they're in between songs.

709
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:11,490
[SPEAKER_07]: This is sad.

710
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,611
[SPEAKER_17]: I wonder if this guy did it playing like Dynamite Rave, love to me.

711
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:15,971
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be funny.

712
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:19,973
[SPEAKER_17]: I are Dynamite Raver world champion, yeah!

713
00:51:22,084 --> 00:51:27,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Though quite the physical game, I am told that players of all ages, shapes, and sizes have been able to perform well.

714
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:31,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Even one player who I am told was in the 300 pound range.

715
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:35,213
[SPEAKER_16]: It should also be noted that facial deformities do not affect gameplay at all.

716
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:37,715
[SPEAKER_17]: So DDR doesn't discriminate against fat people.

717
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:38,495
[SPEAKER_17]: That's good to know.

718
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:42,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Definitely a game where both eye and foot coordination is required.

719
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:43,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, duh.

720
00:51:46,993 --> 00:51:58,922
[SPEAKER_17]: So now here are the rules, and I would officially like to thank Damien Sarkoony for not only taking the initiative and becoming our first recognized and verified world champion, but to assist me with creating the rules.

721
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:04,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, he made the rules, and he's the world champion.

722
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:08,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay, alrighty.

723
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:11,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this like one of the editor's kids or something?

724
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:14,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, the rules.

725
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,948
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to read the rules, Jamie.

726
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:17,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it.

727
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:18,190
[SPEAKER_09]: General rules.

728
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:23,116
[SPEAKER_09]: First, player must be performing in single mode.

729
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:23,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So no doubles.

730
00:52:25,478 --> 00:52:31,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Players can compete on either three-song or five-song machine setting variations, which is determined by the arcade proprietor.

731
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:35,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if I'm not mistaking, there's also a four-song machine, so those people are just fucked, huh?

732
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:35,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

733
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:36,585
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

734
00:52:36,665 --> 00:52:40,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Referees must log the song difficulty and score per song for all three or five songs.

735
00:52:40,988 --> 00:52:41,608
[SPEAKER_02]: The referee.

736
00:52:41,628 --> 00:52:44,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they wear the black and white shirt, too, and make bad calls?

737
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:48,533
[SPEAKER_09]: They walk around playing, you know, Blow My Whistle, Bitch, with their little whistles there.

738
00:52:49,894 --> 00:52:50,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Battle, dammit!

739
00:52:51,355 --> 00:52:55,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Force.

740
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Players are allowed to utilize the entire duration of the game timers in between songs as rest.

741
00:53:01,505 --> 00:53:03,627
[SPEAKER_09]: This includes song selection and setting selection.

742
00:53:03,988 --> 00:53:04,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yay, whatever.

743
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:05,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Fifth.

744
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Players are allowed to utilize the same song no more than twice.

745
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:14,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so they can play the same song twice, they just can't play it more than twice.

746
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:16,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Regardless of whether playing three songs or five songs.

747
00:53:16,633 --> 00:53:18,534
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, I'm gonna cry.

748
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:19,874
[SPEAKER_17]: These people make me cry.

749
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:23,295
[SPEAKER_17]: At this time... Twin Galaxies.

750
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:27,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Twin Galaxies will not be tracking records on the Oni, a.k.a.

751
00:53:27,157 --> 00:53:27,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell.

752
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:28,737
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, that's incorrect.

753
00:53:28,877 --> 00:53:29,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Oni means ogre.

754
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:33,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Hell Mode, assuming I spelled that right.

755
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:34,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, they're stupid.

756
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:36,900
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you misspell Oni?

757
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,300
[SPEAKER_03]: O-N-I.

758
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,440
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't misspell it.

759
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:39,781
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

760
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,541
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, they mistranslated the damn thing.

761
00:53:41,621 --> 00:53:42,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Oni does not mean hell.

762
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:44,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

763
00:53:46,282 --> 00:53:47,843
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, hell is what, Jigoku?

764
00:53:48,743 --> 00:53:49,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't I correct?

765
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:51,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

766
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:52,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, how does Jigoku sound like Oni?

767
00:53:54,184 --> 00:53:54,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me.

768
00:53:54,624 --> 00:53:55,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep going.

769
00:53:55,925 --> 00:53:57,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, that's one of my pet peeves there.

770
00:53:58,165 --> 00:53:58,746
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep going, girl.

771
00:53:58,766 --> 00:53:59,346
[SPEAKER_17]: You go, girl.

772
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:00,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Go on with your bad self.

773
00:54:01,684 --> 00:54:04,885
[SPEAKER_09]: All songs contained within the mix are eligible for selection.

774
00:54:04,985 --> 00:54:05,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope so.

775
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:08,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Which means Dynamite Rave!

776
00:54:08,847 --> 00:54:09,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Love to be!

777
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:09,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Twice!

778
00:54:10,068 --> 00:54:10,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

779
00:54:12,068 --> 00:54:16,710
[SPEAKER_09]: The following rules are applicable for each of the three song or five song selections.

780
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:20,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Only one of the settings, difficulty, can be the player's choice.

781
00:54:20,152 --> 00:54:24,794
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest are determined to be the official TG... Twin Galaxies scoreboard.

782
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Difficulty player can choose between light, standard, or heavy.

783
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:30,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Speed has to be on 1.

784
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:31,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Easiest?

785
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:33,102
[SPEAKER_09]: My butt!

786
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:33,842
[SPEAKER_09]: 1.5 is easier than 1.

787
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:34,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait a minute!

788
00:54:34,862 --> 00:54:37,263
[SPEAKER_17]: They said speed has to be set to the easiest, which is 1.

789
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:38,923
[SPEAKER_17]: I disagree with that.

790
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:39,363
[SPEAKER_17]: My god!

791
00:54:39,903 --> 00:54:40,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Retards!

792
00:54:40,603 --> 00:54:41,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Retards!

793
00:54:41,464 --> 00:54:41,924
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate you.

794
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:43,764
[SPEAKER_09]: If they say easiest, then I can play it on 1.5.

795
00:54:43,804 --> 00:54:45,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's the easiest.

796
00:54:47,005 --> 00:54:47,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Boost set to off.

797
00:54:48,025 --> 00:54:49,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Appearance set to invisible.

798
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:50,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn set to off.

799
00:54:50,946 --> 00:54:51,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Other set to off.

800
00:54:53,127 --> 00:54:54,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Scroll set to standards.

801
00:54:54,268 --> 00:54:56,070
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't say anything at all about three zeros.

802
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,792
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can't do Dark Reverse, Jamie.

803
00:54:57,893 --> 00:54:58,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

804
00:54:58,193 --> 00:54:59,034
[SPEAKER_09]: No Dark Reverse!

805
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:02,398
[SPEAKER_16]: So why didn't they just say no modifiers?

806
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:06,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Since that's pretty much what they're saying here except for difficulty.

807
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:07,084
[SPEAKER_16]: No modifiers.

808
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:07,864
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

809
00:55:08,846 --> 00:55:10,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Because there's no modifiers.

810
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:10,628
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

811
00:55:11,004 --> 00:55:11,964
[SPEAKER_17]: This is going to get beautiful.

812
00:55:12,005 --> 00:55:12,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep going.

813
00:55:12,725 --> 00:55:13,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep going, Jamie.

814
00:55:13,885 --> 00:55:15,386
[SPEAKER_17]: It only gets better from here, folks.

815
00:55:15,426 --> 00:55:15,746
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep going.

816
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:18,528
[SPEAKER_09]: The following rules apply to the scoring of the title.

817
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:25,871
[SPEAKER_09]: The Twin Galaxies referee must log for tracking purposes the song selection difficulty chosen and final tally for each of three or five songs.

818
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:30,934
[SPEAKER_09]: At the very end, the Twin Galaxies referee must manually tally the five song total.

819
00:55:31,234 --> 00:55:34,115
[SPEAKER_09]: The three song machines tally for you at the final score screen.

820
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:34,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's still stupid.

821
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:41,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Note that the sum of the last three songs in the five-song selection are not simultaneously tracked as three-song record.

822
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:52,610
[SPEAKER_09]: It is understood that as the five-song machines do not display the sum tally of all five songs at the end, that the discretion and integrity of the TG referee is accepted for such submissions.

823
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:56,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Tenth, some song titles are listed in foreign wording.

824
00:55:56,093 --> 00:55:59,616
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, a song called... Okay, what the hell is wrong with them?

825
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:04,120
[SPEAKER_02]: They put this... There's a song called Kamumei.

826
00:56:05,305 --> 00:56:08,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the song is fucking Kakumei.

827
00:56:08,248 --> 00:56:09,330
[SPEAKER_09]: It means revolution.

828
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:12,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, first of all... But you're allowed to play Kamumi.

829
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:14,275
[SPEAKER_03]: You're allowed to play Kamumi.

830
00:56:14,655 --> 00:56:16,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you want to know what I'm going to do tonight?

831
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Except that I have work tomorrow.

832
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I got a job.

833
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:23,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm going to be drafting a letter to these stupid fucks.

834
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:28,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this.

835
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:32,573
[SPEAKER_17]: In the chat room right now, they're all going, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel.

836
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:35,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, these people are idiots.

837
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:37,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be drafting a letter.

838
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:41,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Going item by item.

839
00:56:42,295 --> 00:56:43,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Why they are wrong.

840
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:45,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Black Lab suggested the same thing.

841
00:56:46,015 --> 00:56:47,075
[SPEAKER_17]: He's with you on that.

842
00:56:48,616 --> 00:56:49,856
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to get a mob together.

843
00:56:50,396 --> 00:56:53,317
[SPEAKER_09]: What if we draft up, you know, we get a few people.

844
00:56:53,897 --> 00:56:55,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking, give me a speak on my phone.

845
00:56:56,589 --> 00:57:03,212
[SPEAKER_09]: We get the people together, we draft a letter, have all of us who were agreed with this sign it and send it in to them to let them know exactly how stupid they are.

846
00:57:03,412 --> 00:57:08,795
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, if you all take screenshots of us playing the game and all beating that score... Bring the digital camera!

847
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:14,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we've got to keep going here because they have their specific rules submissions here.

848
00:57:16,158 --> 00:57:19,519
[SPEAKER_17]: We might just post about this later, so we're going to keep going with this.

849
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:25,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the player's responsibility to inform the TG referee what the recognized name of such songs are because they're stupid.

850
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:32,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that being said, I look forward to refereeing future game attempts by Damien and anyone else wishing to compete in this highly popular modern arcade release.

851
00:57:32,997 --> 00:57:35,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And this person puts their stupid name on the site.

852
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And their phone number.

853
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:38,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, oh.

854
00:57:39,202 --> 00:57:40,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And their email address.

855
00:57:40,382 --> 00:57:43,345
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, he's the Star Wars arcade champion.

856
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:46,207
[SPEAKER_09]: We should, do we have this link in the chatroom?

857
00:57:46,607 --> 00:57:53,933
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, yeah, I believe we did post this in the chatroom, but if they don't, I did say it was on twingalaxies.com, but if they want to see this article for themselves, there it is.

858
00:57:54,353 --> 00:57:55,574
[SPEAKER_17]: I just posted a link in the chatroom.

859
00:57:56,755 --> 00:57:58,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, yeah, we gotta crank call this shit out.

860
00:57:58,216 --> 00:57:58,676
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm kidding.

861
00:57:58,716 --> 00:57:59,457
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't crank call.

862
00:57:59,557 --> 00:58:00,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Be professional.

863
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:01,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody, be professional.

864
00:58:03,796 --> 00:58:04,977
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe I was reading now.

865
00:58:05,017 --> 00:58:05,717
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't on this page.

866
00:58:05,757 --> 00:58:06,878
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was on this page.

867
00:58:07,178 --> 00:58:07,878
[SPEAKER_17]: But I guess it's not.

868
00:58:08,858 --> 00:58:10,099
[SPEAKER_17]: You can videotape it.

869
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:12,080
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't take pictures because those could be altered.

870
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,340
[SPEAKER_17]: But you can videotape it.

871
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,101
[SPEAKER_17]: So all we've got to do is get a camera and we can videotape the whole thing.

872
00:58:16,521 --> 00:58:20,783
[SPEAKER_17]: I would be willing to go out there with a camera and tape one, both of you guys breaking the record.

873
00:58:20,803 --> 00:58:21,243
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

874
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:24,444
[SPEAKER_17]: And everybody in the chat room is already wanting to go do it too.

875
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:25,485
[SPEAKER_17]: So they might beat us to it.

876
00:58:25,525 --> 00:58:29,566
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you guys want to be lazy, you don't want to bother with this, we're going to do it.

877
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:31,407
[SPEAKER_17]: This week...

878
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:39,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Watch as DarkSakura, Loki, and Sky all smash the world record and submit our videotape.

879
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:40,744
[SPEAKER_17]: You in on this too, Bradley?

880
00:58:42,204 --> 00:58:42,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm that good.

881
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:47,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Bradley, Bradley, a five-year-old is that good.

882
00:58:47,465 --> 00:58:48,525
[SPEAKER_17]: You're that good, trust me.

883
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:55,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me just add, I couldn't PA to save my life, so this ought to be interesting.

884
00:58:55,347 --> 00:58:57,007
[SPEAKER_16]: If I beat this, this guy really sucks.

885
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:11,589
[SPEAKER_17]: so not only will you be seeing us all smashing the world record but we'll be submitting an open letter and we'll post about that on our website this week sometime we'll post where you can also add your name to the letter or something we'll figure something else

886
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:23,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I could send them the link to Konami's 7th Mix ranking page, probably hundreds of people have already beaten that score.

887
00:59:23,942 --> 00:59:25,923
[SPEAKER_04]: A zillion people have beaten that score.

888
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,444
[SPEAKER_09]: We should probably go ahead and get that pulled up.

889
00:59:29,686 --> 00:59:30,346
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to pull up what?

890
00:59:31,627 --> 00:59:32,448
[SPEAKER_17]: What site are you pulling up?

891
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:32,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Internet Ranking.

892
00:59:33,249 --> 00:59:34,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, here, yeah, yeah, yeah.

893
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me do that.

894
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:41,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I wanted to check some of these private messages real fast because there's some things going on here.

895
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:45,380
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, nothing new there.

896
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Playing it on one speed, you know, that's standard.

897
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:49,784
[SPEAKER_09]: How is that hard?

898
00:59:50,404 --> 00:59:51,365
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, how is that hard?

899
00:59:51,865 --> 00:59:52,246
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe...

900
00:59:54,688 --> 00:59:58,750
[SPEAKER_17]: SoCal Kicks was already submitting a score at Bachelorette School.

901
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,391
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's only $185 million from what I see.

902
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,732
[SPEAKER_17]: That wouldn't do it, but that's only... See, that's Max.

903
01:00:04,812 --> 01:00:05,533
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a problem.

904
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:11,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Max 2 and Max grade differently, so you're not going to be able to get a score on Max that beats it because they grade completely differently.

905
01:00:13,116 --> 01:00:15,537
[SPEAKER_17]: But he just wants to show off that he's elite, so there you go.

906
01:00:17,898 --> 01:00:19,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, and AaronJapan.com has some great stuff, too.

907
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:36,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Black Lab wants to break the record too.

908
01:00:36,251 --> 01:00:37,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Black Lab, come with us.

909
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:38,792
[SPEAKER_17]: You're local.

910
01:00:38,952 --> 01:00:40,613
[SPEAKER_17]: You can come with us and break the record with us.

911
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:44,875
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're all going to break the world record and be the latest DDR players in history.

912
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:49,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Black Lab's like, when and where?

913
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:59,826
[SPEAKER_17]: If I had a video camera in this house, I would go out to Scandia tonight after the show because they don't close until 10 and we'd be able to make it out there.

914
01:00:59,886 --> 01:01:05,530
[SPEAKER_17]: But unfortunately, we'll have to do this tomorrow or sometime during the week and figure that out.

915
01:01:05,631 --> 01:01:09,033
[SPEAKER_17]: 23rd Magus wants to point out a hedgehog sleeping in a wet paper bag could beat that score.

916
01:01:09,994 --> 01:01:10,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Fair enough.

917
01:01:10,714 --> 01:01:12,916
[SPEAKER_17]: So we want to pull up 7th Mixed Internet Ranking?

918
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:13,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

919
01:01:13,357 --> 01:01:18,861
[SPEAKER_17]: The only problem with Internet Ranking, if I remember right, it tracks the percentages, right?

920
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:19,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Not the actual scores?

921
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:19,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

922
01:01:19,982 --> 01:01:20,282
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

923
01:01:20,882 --> 01:01:21,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it is scores.

924
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:30,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, I have to find Max2, there it is.

925
01:01:33,163 --> 01:01:36,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, here's the Max2 site, and now I'm looking for internet ranking.

926
01:01:37,404 --> 01:01:38,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Help me read some Japanese here, there it is.

927
01:01:40,425 --> 01:01:42,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go, Max internet ranking, ranky.

928
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:45,687
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to find out the real world champion here.

929
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:51,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, what, do we hold up for one of these, one of those stuff, keep going, keep going, keep going?

930
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,050
[SPEAKER_17]: What, just any one of these, or what?

931
01:01:54,671 --> 01:01:55,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, they don't have scores!

932
01:01:56,562 --> 01:01:58,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, they don't have the charts anymore, that's the problem.

933
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:01,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Aw, well, shit on Konami.

934
01:02:02,504 --> 01:02:04,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit on Konami for not having the scores, oh well.

935
01:02:04,884 --> 01:02:06,465
[SPEAKER_17]: But trust me, they were much better than that.

936
01:02:07,805 --> 01:02:08,465
[SPEAKER_17]: We guarantee it.

937
01:02:08,966 --> 01:02:10,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe, oh, maybe I can get it from up here.

938
01:02:11,746 --> 01:02:13,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, don't do, uh, the Onis, keep going.

939
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:14,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Where do I go?

940
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:15,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Go down to these?

941
01:02:15,547 --> 01:02:16,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Down to those, yeah.

942
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:17,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, let's see.

943
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, there we go.

944
01:02:19,843 --> 01:02:26,397
[SPEAKER_17]: On one of these, let's see, 139,576,495, no that's not high enough, but these songs aren't hard enough.

945
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:27,399
[SPEAKER_17]: I bet if I go down to like number 15...

946
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,583
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, here's a documented score right here.

947
01:02:32,603 --> 01:02:32,583
401,845,325.

948
01:02:32,803 --> 01:02:40,629
[SPEAKER_17]: That already puts that other score to shame, so... All these other scores, look at that, they're all higher.

949
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:43,891
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is a certain set of songs.

950
01:02:43,911 --> 01:02:45,572
[SPEAKER_17]: They're probably not even all nine-footers.

951
01:02:45,632 --> 01:02:49,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually... Those are probably just three songs.

952
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, that's including the extra stages.

953
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:54,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, including the extra stages.

954
01:02:55,059 --> 01:02:56,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kakumei.

955
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:56,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

956
01:02:57,481 --> 01:02:57,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Well...

957
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:00,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Poo on Twin Galaxies

958
01:03:01,414 --> 01:03:05,177
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to take a real quick break, but this break is going to be special.

959
01:03:05,217 --> 01:03:08,399
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to play some original works during this break.

960
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki has a new one he's going to play for us, so we're going to get that in.

961
01:03:11,862 --> 01:03:15,064
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wanted to get a new artist in who hasn't been featured on this show yet.

962
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:16,766
[SPEAKER_17]: I just have to pull up his song here.

963
01:03:17,346 --> 01:03:23,911
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Takeout Kid, and he's got a song called, it looks like Donkey Kong Remix is the name of it.

964
01:03:24,372 --> 01:03:26,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Perhaps he'll elaborate on that in the chat room.

965
01:03:26,513 --> 01:03:27,254
[SPEAKER_17]: He's in there right now.

966
01:03:27,694 --> 01:03:29,696
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to play that creation by him.

967
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:34,445
[SPEAKER_17]: and then we're going to... I wanted to plug his website.

968
01:03:34,465 --> 01:03:36,448
[SPEAKER_17]: He wanted me to plug his site for playing this.

969
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:44,638
[SPEAKER_17]: His site, if you like what you hear, is at www.mp3.com slash liquidkid and he can post that in the chat room if he wants.

970
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:45,980
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to hear that.

971
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:50,820
[SPEAKER_17]: and then we're going to hear another bit from Loki and you want to introduce the song that you're going to be doing, Loki?

972
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:58,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, this was going to be an actual Paranoia remix but it didn't work out that way so it's something else entirely.

973
01:03:59,283 --> 01:04:02,664
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I was calling it like Shadow Style or something like that.

974
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:13,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so we're going to do some originals this break and when we come back more talk and venting and the typical kind of anger you'd expect from Orange Lounge Radio.

975
01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:28,805
Thanks for watching!

976
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:53,543
Thanks for watching!

977
01:08:09,732 --> 01:08:10,476
Thanks for watching!

978
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:29,273
Thank you for watching

979
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:39,905
[SPEAKER_00]: After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.

980
01:11:40,706 --> 01:11:44,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Undersedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.

981
01:11:44,989 --> 01:11:51,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UndersedationLive.org.

982
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:15,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

983
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:40,398
Thank you for watching!

984
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:58,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

985
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:26,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitch, get a new song.

986
01:13:49,497 --> 01:13:51,979
[SPEAKER_13]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

987
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:55,682
[SPEAKER_17]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 14.

988
01:13:55,742 --> 01:14:02,867
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've been going off on TwinGalaxies.com and their completely made-of-ass ranking system for Max 2.

989
01:14:02,927 --> 01:14:04,448
[SPEAKER_09]: There is one word, two syllables.

990
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:04,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

991
01:14:04,869 --> 01:14:05,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Inane.

992
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:10,013
[SPEAKER_17]: and we're all on a rampage to go beat that sometime this week.

993
01:14:10,073 --> 01:14:14,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Black Lab and Dark Tetsuya over the break, by the way, have also joined in on our campaign.

994
01:14:14,577 --> 01:14:17,439
[SPEAKER_17]: We are all going to go and smash the world record this week sometime.

995
01:14:17,919 --> 01:14:19,701
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're not doing it to be mean.

996
01:14:19,741 --> 01:14:21,302
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just, well, yeah, we're doing it to be mean.

997
01:14:21,842 --> 01:14:22,483
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't know.

998
01:14:22,803 --> 01:14:23,764
[SPEAKER_17]: We're doing it to make a point.

999
01:14:26,486 --> 01:14:27,227
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, my God.

1000
01:14:28,908 --> 01:14:33,452
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like saying, you know, I'm the best kid on the planet because my mommy loves me best.

1001
01:14:35,316 --> 01:14:36,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, it's like, what's going on?

1002
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:38,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, yeah.

1003
01:14:38,963 --> 01:14:40,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Follow up to last week.

1004
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:43,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Last week we were going off about Naoki's diary.

1005
01:14:43,671 --> 01:14:46,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Today I decided I wanted to be a woman.

1006
01:14:48,547 --> 01:14:52,490
[SPEAKER_17]: and all sorts of fun dear diaries were submitted by the chatroom.

1007
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:53,350
[SPEAKER_17]: What the hell?

1008
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's take some more.

1009
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:56,953
[SPEAKER_17]: If you guys in the chatroom have more diaries... It's been a week.

1010
01:14:57,213 --> 01:15:06,980
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have some more diary entries, if you think Naoki has some more diary things that he's written that he's maybe just not sharing with us, give us some diary entries.

1011
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Submit them to us in the chatroom.

1012
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:12,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Just send me a PM, your best Naoki diary entry, and we'll read some more tonight.

1013
01:15:13,804 --> 01:15:16,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, I don't think that they can see that you're waving your hand.

1014
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:17,587
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, come on...

1015
01:15:18,234 --> 01:15:47,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Wave of hand bringing towards me By the way In defense of Rob Because I can read the kana in it In Naoki's diary It did have Be-Mani Spelled out with the kana Be, the extending kana Ma, and Ni So it's Be-Mani According to Naoki, it's Be-Mani Be-Mani Radio Program So don't be a bee-itch about it

1016
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's read what Naoki wrote this last week in his diary, shall we say?

1017
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:54,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Your diary.

1018
01:15:54,405 --> 01:15:58,589
[SPEAKER_16]: I've decided to let Paul Oteri write the music and I'm gonna sing!

1019
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:01,812
[SPEAKER_16]: You could probably do a better job.

1020
01:16:03,714 --> 01:16:04,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Naoki's diary.

1021
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:07,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Time has... Oh wait, we need some music, don't you think?

1022
01:16:07,857 --> 01:16:08,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's find some music.

1023
01:16:08,818 --> 01:16:12,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's find some good Naoki music.

1024
01:16:12,522 --> 01:16:13,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do Journey to Wonderland.

1025
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:16,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's make that be Naoki's diary.

1026
01:16:16,825 --> 01:16:18,066
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a Naoki song, but it's funny.

1027
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:19,227
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what's important.

1028
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:26,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Time has gone.

1029
01:16:27,433 --> 01:16:29,995
[SPEAKER_17]: These days, music games are as common as dirt.

1030
01:16:30,535 --> 01:16:35,478
[SPEAKER_17]: But when DDR started in 1998, DDR seemed like the hardest thing in the world to work on.

1031
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:39,781
[SPEAKER_17]: Even looking back on it today, I feel exhausted just to try to remember it.

1032
01:16:40,282 --> 01:16:42,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Now it feels like a sleeping memory deep in my heart.

1033
01:16:44,193 --> 01:16:46,395
[SPEAKER_17]: That's going to be the next Naoki song, by the way, deep in my heart.

1034
01:16:47,075 --> 01:16:48,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was still in my heart.

1035
01:16:48,596 --> 01:16:51,699
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, deep and dive and whatever.

1036
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Dive into the butt.

1037
01:16:57,222 --> 01:17:01,645
[SPEAKER_17]: When we began work on DDR, I started writing four pieces of music for the game.

1038
01:17:02,165 --> 01:17:15,713
[SPEAKER_17]: But as production advanced and the public waited for the release of DDR, only one of my songs, Paranoia, was included in the game, and a major collaboration was formed with Hoshiba EMI's Dance Mania compilation series in order to provide the rest of the music.

1039
01:17:16,254 --> 01:17:18,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if I remember correct, wasn't Brilliant to you in the first DDR?

1040
01:17:19,296 --> 01:17:20,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Did he just... Oh, it's just 1.5?

1041
01:17:21,877 --> 01:17:23,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, hello, what about Trip Machine?

1042
01:17:23,798 --> 01:17:24,979
[SPEAKER_16]: That's still him anyways.

1043
01:17:25,419 --> 01:17:25,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, wait!

1044
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,181
[SPEAKER_16]: He's not Desire.

1045
01:17:29,782 --> 01:17:30,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Not Desire.

1046
01:17:31,662 --> 01:17:32,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever.

1047
01:17:32,063 --> 01:17:34,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Naoki's getting forgetful as he's getting old.

1048
01:17:34,824 --> 01:17:35,724
[SPEAKER_16]: He's got Alzheimer's.

1049
01:17:37,545 --> 01:17:42,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Technically it wasn't the Naoki personality, it was the Desire personality that wrote that song.

1050
01:17:42,187 --> 01:17:44,348
[SPEAKER_16]: So obviously he wouldn't have a recollection of that one.

1051
01:17:47,688 --> 01:17:48,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

1052
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:54,212
[SPEAKER_17]: The other songs were put on the shelf, and although I was the only person in the world to hear them, they didn't go to waste.

1053
01:17:54,572 --> 01:18:00,115
[SPEAKER_17]: The DDR Max 2 song, D2R, was based on some of the songs left out of the original DDR game.

1054
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:00,816
[SPEAKER_17]: D2R!

1055
01:18:01,116 --> 01:18:01,736
[SPEAKER_17]: D2R!

1056
01:18:06,999 --> 01:18:07,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah!

1057
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,641
[SPEAKER_16]: There's more that's going to sound like brilliant to you.

1058
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:26,964
[SPEAKER_17]: You may think of Paranoia as a song that most people fondly remember, but in fact it was something I was forced to make under many restrictions.

1059
01:18:27,545 --> 01:18:30,949
[SPEAKER_17]: The end result is a song that felt very underground slash urban.

1060
01:18:32,412 --> 01:18:34,514
[SPEAKER_17]: These days, my music is very different.

1061
01:18:35,134 --> 01:18:46,844
[SPEAKER_17]: The Royal Route high-energy dance songs, such as Brilliant To You, Can't Stop Falling In Love, etc., are my new forte, and although I much prefer them, the underground style was a projection point in terms of my music.

1062
01:18:46,944 --> 01:18:49,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, when was Brilliant To You a new style?

1063
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:50,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't that like 1.5?

1064
01:18:50,287 --> 01:18:52,629
[SPEAKER_14]: He's talking about 1.5, though.

1065
01:18:52,669 --> 01:18:55,672
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but he's like, my new style was Brilliant To You.

1066
01:18:55,752 --> 01:18:56,533
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I know.

1067
01:18:56,793 --> 01:18:57,393
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, Dave, I know.

1068
01:18:58,494 --> 01:19:03,341
[SPEAKER_17]: These days I still try to develop the underground style using the Revenge and Desire labels.

1069
01:19:04,302 --> 01:19:08,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Paranoia, Trip Machine, and Make It Better appeared in DDR Internet Ranking Kit.

1070
01:19:10,491 --> 01:19:14,974
[SPEAKER_17]: 1.5, and with every maiden voyage, trial, error, and conflict always appeared from time to time.

1071
01:19:15,454 --> 01:19:24,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Although my music has moved on and evolved, I still look back on these three songs and realize that if they hadn't existed, much of my current music wouldn't be possible.

1072
01:19:24,842 --> 01:19:31,947
[SPEAKER_17]: In the grand scale of things, these songs are very important to me in my career, especially when I remember the pressure I was under when I produced them.

1073
01:19:34,509 --> 01:19:39,473
[SPEAKER_17]: With the songs completed, and DDR only... Is that Taco Bell coming back up or something there, Jamie?

1074
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:55,743
[SPEAKER_17]: With the songs completed and DDR only several months from release, I took a deep breathe and prepared to face the next challenge, DDR second mix.

1075
01:19:57,024 --> 01:20:00,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's read some of the submitted things, shall we?

1076
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,210
[SPEAKER_17]: That was it.

1077
01:20:05,171 --> 01:20:05,491
[SPEAKER_17]: That was it.

1078
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:10,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it also revealed that the Max 3 song, there's going to be a B4U song called Graduation.

1079
01:20:11,004 --> 01:20:11,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Hooray.

1080
01:20:13,966 --> 01:20:14,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Shock of shocks.

1081
01:20:14,967 --> 01:20:16,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, B4U and Max 3.

1082
01:20:16,468 --> 01:20:22,052
[SPEAKER_16]: I was expecting that.

1083
01:20:22,112 --> 01:20:26,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Naoki himself, which I believe is just the 23rd Magus Disguise, but we won't say anything.

1084
01:20:26,696 --> 01:20:35,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Naoki himself says, Dear Diary, my newest song is called Dynamite Afronova BD24UR Trip Machine Deeper and Deeper Eternal Rebirth Evolution KZ Dirty Mix.

1085
01:20:36,377 --> 01:20:36,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow!

1086
01:20:38,298 --> 01:20:39,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll buy that for a dollar.

1087
01:20:41,019 --> 01:20:42,720
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Konami says this.

1088
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:46,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, I've made a kickin' tune for the next DJ Konami tune.

1089
01:20:46,382 --> 01:20:48,103
[SPEAKER_17]: He seemed kind of reluctant to use it, though.

1090
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:52,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, more B4U crap coming soon in Max 3.

1091
01:20:52,545 --> 01:20:52,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Enjoy!

1092
01:20:53,646 --> 01:20:55,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, I am done with the extra states for Max 3.

1093
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:57,048
[SPEAKER_17]: It is called Max 3.

1094
01:20:57,788 --> 01:20:59,529
[SPEAKER_17]: I am the king of the originality.

1095
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:04,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Dear Diary, I make music so people like me.

1096
01:21:04,632 --> 01:21:05,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, you, bye.

1097
01:21:23,853 --> 01:21:32,322
[SPEAKER_17]: TwinSenses, Dear Diary, today I earned the world record in DDR Max 2 with a score of 315,802,020 points.

1098
01:21:32,822 --> 01:21:35,425
[SPEAKER_17]: I am the best because my mommy and Paula Terry love me.

1099
01:21:35,485 --> 01:21:35,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Praise me!

1100
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:38,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Biter.

1101
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:41,531
[SPEAKER_17]: SoCalKicks submits a follow-up to last week.

1102
01:21:42,131 --> 01:21:45,775
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, my English, I would like to know what this blow is.

1103
01:21:48,673 --> 01:21:53,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you missed last week's show, you're just going to have to wait 11 weeks for it to turn up in the rebroadcast.

1104
01:21:53,496 --> 01:21:57,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Naoki, to find out what the blow is, take your vacuum cleaner and stick it on your groin.

1105
01:21:58,438 --> 01:21:59,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Press the on button.

1106
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,520
[SPEAKER_09]: She's gone from suck to blow.

1107
01:22:04,214 --> 01:22:06,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, I hate my life and want to die

1108
01:22:26,973 --> 01:22:30,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, after he told me I still wanted it, I knew he would do a better job than Paula.

1109
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:32,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

1110
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, SirDuckX.

1111
01:22:38,025 --> 01:22:42,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Dartetsuya says, Dear Diary, I'm having B4U remixed Let Them Move for DDR Max 3.

1112
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:43,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

1113
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:48,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it would be even more out of tune, just with more people singing it.

1114
01:22:49,949 --> 01:22:51,470
[SPEAKER_17]: How about a sim update, Loki?

1115
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:53,572
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to talk about what's going on in the sim world?

1116
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:55,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, actually quite a bit's going to be happening next week.

1117
01:22:56,315 --> 01:23:00,859
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the site opening again of Team Guilo, so they're going to be coming up on Tuesday.

1118
01:23:01,459 --> 01:23:03,902
[SPEAKER_16]: So everyone look for that on October 1st there.

1119
01:23:04,422 --> 01:23:07,144
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what the website's going to be, probably Team Guilo, but...

1120
01:23:08,254 --> 01:23:10,615
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know yet, because they haven't really gotten a host name.

1121
01:23:10,635 --> 01:23:12,016
[SPEAKER_16]: So, we'll have to wait for that.

1122
01:23:12,116 --> 01:23:17,218
[SPEAKER_16]: And then also, I've heard rumors that the Melting Pot's going to be coming back up in about a couple weeks, too.

1123
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:19,079
[SPEAKER_16]: So, we'll have to watch for that.

1124
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:23,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, still waiting for StepMania Beta 6.

1125
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:28,622
[SPEAKER_16]: DWI, it's been quiet, so don't know anything coming out for that.

1126
01:23:28,782 --> 01:23:29,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't really care.

1127
01:23:30,243 --> 01:23:31,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of abandoned them.

1128
01:23:31,824 --> 01:23:35,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, there is some major news.

1129
01:23:36,206 --> 01:23:37,166
[SPEAKER_16]: The Tourney Mix 2's done.

1130
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:39,602
[SPEAKER_16]: and we have results somewhere.

1131
01:23:39,982 --> 01:23:40,743
[SPEAKER_16]: We can pull them up.

1132
01:23:42,343 --> 01:23:43,424
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I suppose I can do that.

1133
01:23:43,864 --> 01:23:44,945
[SPEAKER_16]: We had some locals win.

1134
01:23:45,005 --> 01:23:46,626
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm excited for them.

1135
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:49,828
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to get them on the show so they can brag.

1136
01:23:54,707 --> 01:23:55,007
[SPEAKER_16]: DJ DropForce

1137
01:24:26,347 --> 01:24:32,229
[SPEAKER_16]: SoDeep Wire Remix was third place, and that was done by the Sacramento's Agent Chang.

1138
01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:33,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Woo!

1139
01:24:33,989 --> 01:24:34,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we're playing favorites.

1140
01:24:35,009 --> 01:24:35,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

1141
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:44,531
[SPEAKER_16]: For standard, the official placing was Klung Klung 1655 from Keyboard Mania.

1142
01:24:44,551 --> 01:24:45,171
[SPEAKER_16]: That got first.

1143
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:47,412
[SPEAKER_17]: That was some of the Seattle folks that did that, I believe.

1144
01:24:47,432 --> 01:24:50,752
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember the exact names, but I just know they're on that board over there.

1145
01:24:50,772 --> 01:24:52,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Second place was Flying to Your Soul.

1146
01:24:52,893 --> 01:24:53,633
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea.

1147
01:24:54,373 --> 01:24:59,175
[SPEAKER_16]: and third place was The Great Giana Sisters, which was pretty good from what I played.

1148
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:05,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Now Public, this is what was actually voted on by the users themselves and not the judges.

1149
01:25:05,718 --> 01:25:10,539
[SPEAKER_16]: First place went to So Deep Choir Remix, which was, you know, our Agent Chang.

1150
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Second place was Heaven.

1151
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:16,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Third place was QQQ, and that was done by...

1152
01:25:17,782 --> 01:25:30,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Mooglehunter, Standard, The Great Gianna Sisters, 1 for 1st, M, The Fake 8th Style Song, 1 for 2nd, and Klung Klung 1655, 1 for 3rd.

1153
01:25:34,367 --> 01:25:34,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Woohoo!

1154
01:25:35,428 --> 01:25:36,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations to all the winners!

1155
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:43,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, Tourney Mix 3 is gonna be, has been announced for December, they're gonna be doing that, so rules and stuff will be coming out in November.

1156
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:45,035
[SPEAKER_16]: So look at that.

1157
01:25:46,056 --> 01:25:47,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh... Congrats you!

1158
01:25:48,117 --> 01:25:55,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on, SoCalKicks had a, uh, his diary entry got chopped up, that's why it didn't make much sense, so I'm going to, uh, pull up the rest of his diary entry.

1159
01:25:55,243 --> 01:25:58,445
[SPEAKER_17]: He sent it over... Ooh.

1160
01:25:58,725 --> 01:25:58,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah!

1161
01:25:58,985 --> 01:26:00,747
[SPEAKER_17]: I opened up a picture of Jenny Rom, my bad.

1162
01:26:00,987 --> 01:26:02,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I was about to say, I'm scared.

1163
01:26:02,668 --> 01:26:03,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

1164
01:26:03,668 --> 01:26:03,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1165
01:26:04,249 --> 01:26:07,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, this is from SoCalKicks, Naoki Diary.

1166
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:10,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, my hipster experimentation did not go as well as planned.

1167
01:26:10,471 --> 01:26:15,553
[SPEAKER_17]: Paula begged me not to go, saying she would give me this blow and that she could do a better job.

1168
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:19,155
[SPEAKER_17]: But the way she said it, I don't even think that she knows what this blow is anyway.

1169
01:26:19,455 --> 01:26:23,517
[SPEAKER_17]: So I continued to go seek this white American who was going to give me the true form of this blow.

1170
01:26:23,837 --> 01:26:27,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I quickly made it to Northern California where this orange site is based, so it says.

1171
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:30,039
[SPEAKER_17]: And my research finally led me to an address.

1172
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:31,120
[SPEAKER_17]: I knocked on the door and said...

1173
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I am American hipster, knows Naoki, before I finish the rest of my English.

1174
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:36,823
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to know what this blow is.

1175
01:26:37,163 --> 01:26:38,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, after he told me, I still wanted it.

1176
01:26:38,624 --> 01:26:40,025
[SPEAKER_17]: I knew he would do a better job than Paula.

1177
01:26:41,566 --> 01:26:43,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, G. Thanks.

1178
01:26:46,529 --> 01:26:47,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Shine get!

[SPEAKER_17]: I get random, I get these random PMs for people.

1180
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:52,212
[SPEAKER_17]: I just got one that says shine get.

1181
01:26:52,872 --> 01:26:53,753
[SPEAKER_17]: These people are weird.

1182
01:26:55,425 --> 01:27:00,748
[SPEAKER_16]: So now your little thing under your name on the website could be, gives a better blow than Politary.

1183
01:27:01,309 --> 01:27:02,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, maybe we should do that.

1184
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:05,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Better blowing than Pol... Can you arrange that for me, Jamie?

1185
01:27:05,852 --> 01:27:06,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, thank you.

1186
01:27:07,413 --> 01:27:09,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Pyro Man sent another one before he left.

1187
01:27:09,394 --> 01:27:11,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Santa, I want a new Politary for Christmas.

1188
01:27:13,977 --> 01:27:19,020
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate you.

1189
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that Politary's a fembot.

1190
01:27:22,082 --> 01:27:23,463
[SPEAKER_17]: You think Politary's a fembot, huh?

1191
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:25,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn it.

1192
01:27:25,922 --> 01:27:26,643
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what we just did?

1193
01:27:26,663 --> 01:27:29,745
[SPEAKER_17]: We just opened the door for people to send us random shit over private message.

1194
01:27:29,805 --> 01:27:33,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Her along with the B4U girls and Jenny Rom.

1195
01:27:33,967 --> 01:27:34,628
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all friends.

1196
01:27:34,668 --> 01:27:35,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially Jenny Rom.

1197
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:37,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1198
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:40,331
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, we're going to take a quick... Yes.

1199
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:41,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Loki.

1200
01:27:41,472 --> 01:27:41,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1201
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:44,843
[SPEAKER_16]: New DDRPC characters.

1202
01:27:45,263 --> 01:27:46,684
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell were they thinking?

1203
01:27:46,925 --> 01:27:48,206
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the gay and lesbian team.

1204
01:27:48,626 --> 01:27:49,527
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you noticed.

1205
01:27:49,547 --> 01:27:51,829
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like bondage goth people.

1206
01:27:51,929 --> 01:27:54,291
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know what the hell it is.

1207
01:27:54,872 --> 01:27:55,912
[SPEAKER_17]: The chick's a total dyke.

1208
01:27:55,932 --> 01:27:59,976
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know about the guy, but I'm just assuming it's the gay and lesbian team for DDRPC.

1209
01:28:00,016 --> 01:28:00,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on, let me pull it up.

1210
01:28:02,178 --> 01:28:02,979
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very scary.

1211
01:28:05,892 --> 01:28:15,457
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to konamihwi.com slash ddrpc because that's where I can download all the newest and greatest characters.

1212
01:28:21,281 --> 01:28:25,963
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to link that in the chat room for you folks because I like you.

1213
01:28:27,744 --> 01:28:30,266
[SPEAKER_17]: And they are called Kobe and Nikki.

1214
01:28:30,646 --> 01:28:31,987
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can see Kobe is a cop.

1215
01:28:33,857 --> 01:28:35,697
[SPEAKER_17]: And Nicky's just a dyke.

1216
01:28:36,017 --> 01:28:37,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how else to explain Nicky.

1217
01:28:37,238 --> 01:28:41,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but I didn't know cops wore spiked hats with little skulls.

1218
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:42,559
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's already got the handcuffs on.

1219
01:28:42,679 --> 01:28:43,859
[SPEAKER_02]: He's already ready to bust you.

1220
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:45,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tie you up.

1221
01:28:45,099 --> 01:28:46,560
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to tie you up.

1222
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,981
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's wearing bubbles on his shirt.

1223
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:57,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the next four characters are all like, the construction worker is the next one.

1224
01:28:57,902 --> 01:29:02,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're waiting for the construction worker, then the Indian, then we're going to have the leather daddy.

1225
01:29:03,874 --> 01:29:06,155
[SPEAKER_17]: I bet you anything the Jason Enos one's going to be Leather Daddy.

1226
01:29:07,436 --> 01:29:08,016
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1227
01:29:08,296 --> 01:29:09,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just teasing.

1228
01:29:09,717 --> 01:29:10,057
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1229
01:29:10,177 --> 01:29:12,898
[SPEAKER_17]: But the rumor is that the Jason Enos one's going to be the last character.

1230
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:15,920
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been spread like wildfire everywhere.

1231
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:16,960
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1232
01:29:17,481 --> 01:29:17,821
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

1233
01:29:19,702 --> 01:29:24,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, the chat room's saying that Kobe and Nikki are probably supposed to be ravers or clubbers.

1234
01:29:26,145 --> 01:29:28,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, big gay ravers and clubbers.

1235
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:33,614
[SPEAKER_17]: And apparently Jenny Rom... Jenny Rom is a sliver slut.

1236
01:29:35,676 --> 01:29:36,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Sliver slut.

1237
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:49,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we're going to take a real... Oh, do you want to... Well, okay, we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and by popular demand in the chat room, they're begging us to do it tonight because we haven't done it in a few weeks.

1238
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,810
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to do a listless segment tonight for you guys.

1239
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:52,711
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to do...

1240
01:29:53,877 --> 01:29:54,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we're going to do that.

1241
01:29:54,757 --> 01:30:05,240
[SPEAKER_17]: And then at the end of the show, Jamie's going to give us the update on the big, big, big tournament we're going to do here in Sacramento that Orange Lounge is one of the many co-sponsors of called Shaft.

1242
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament, and Jamie's got all the details for you guys.

1243
01:30:10,402 --> 01:30:13,283
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, DJ Konami, no Kyle Snyder, please.

1244
01:30:13,971 --> 01:30:16,472
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be no Kyle Snyder character in DDRPC, sorry.

1245
01:30:17,213 --> 01:30:22,995
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to be doing the DDR shaft update before the end of the show.

1246
01:30:23,015 --> 01:30:27,217
[SPEAKER_17]: We're also going to do list list for best B-Mani artist.

1247
01:30:27,597 --> 01:30:29,278
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll be making our list during this break.

[SPEAKER_09]: Break down.

01:30:38,062 --> 01:30:38,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Break down.

1253
01:30:38,723 --> 01:30:41,344
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, I'm saying stick around so much I think I'm just going to play that.

[SPEAKER_17]: TTPO You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 14, and we're getting ready to do our list list.

1264
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:10,820
[SPEAKER_17]: We're kind of having a little bit of debate.

1265
01:36:12,156 --> 01:36:20,644
[SPEAKER_17]: During the break, while people were trying to make our lists here in the studio, trying to think if a singer should be considered a Bamani artist.

1266
01:36:20,664 --> 01:36:22,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, could you say Sana on your list?

1267
01:36:23,306 --> 01:36:26,729
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Brad was in here kind of... You've got to talk into the mic.

1268
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:33,495
[SPEAKER_15]: Or something like Paula Terry, because she doesn't, as far as I know, doesn't write anything.

1269
01:36:34,075 --> 01:36:35,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I still count performers.

1270
01:36:35,917 --> 01:36:36,377
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.

1271
01:36:36,718 --> 01:36:38,159
[SPEAKER_15]: I wouldn't consider them an artist.

1272
01:36:38,179 --> 01:36:38,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1273
01:36:39,938 --> 01:36:40,759
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1274
01:37:01,371 --> 01:37:02,191
[SPEAKER_17]: of erotic dancing.

1275
01:37:02,652 --> 01:37:05,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, even though she doesn't really write her stuff.

1276
01:37:06,513 --> 01:37:08,874
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to make one quick amendment to the sim update, too.

1277
01:37:09,494 --> 01:37:12,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Feet of Fury was pushed back to October 15th.

1278
01:37:12,095 --> 01:37:13,415
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the Dreamcast one.

1279
01:37:13,675 --> 01:37:16,476
[SPEAKER_17]: And there is a video on the site over at CAgames.com.

1280
01:37:16,836 --> 01:37:17,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Looks interesting.

1281
01:37:17,496 --> 01:37:19,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of looks like Disney's Dance Magic mode a little bit.

1282
01:37:20,177 --> 01:37:21,678
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be interesting.

1283
01:37:22,558 --> 01:37:23,558
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an interesting idea, anyway.

1284
01:37:24,098 --> 01:37:24,558
[SPEAKER_17]: So here we go.

1285
01:37:24,598 --> 01:37:25,099
[SPEAKER_17]: We're doing a list.

1286
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:26,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's participating in today's list?

1287
01:37:26,599 --> 01:37:27,119

[SPEAKER_17]: Bradley is.

1292
01:37:31,003 --> 01:37:31,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Brad, you're doing one, too?

1293
01:37:32,244 --> 01:37:33,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, then we've got five people on the list today.

1294
01:37:34,864 --> 01:37:35,844
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll be a fat, big list.

1295
01:37:35,884 --> 01:37:37,085
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we're doing three choices apiece.

1296
01:37:37,105 --> 01:37:37,585
[SPEAKER_17]: You got three?

1297
01:37:38,565 --> 01:37:39,465
[SPEAKER_17]: You better hurry up, Brad.

1298
01:37:39,885 --> 01:37:40,826
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll do you last, okay?

1299
01:37:41,346 --> 01:37:41,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

1300
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:43,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Not like that.

1301
01:37:43,626 --> 01:37:44,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Not like that.

1302
01:37:46,787 --> 01:37:47,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Boy.

1303
01:37:47,447 --> 01:37:47,727
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1304
01:37:49,688 --> 01:37:50,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie, let's start with you.

1305
01:37:50,628 --> 01:37:54,329
[SPEAKER_17]: What's your number three pick for favorite Bomani performer ever, ever, ever?

1306
01:37:54,789 --> 01:37:55,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Osama Kubota.

1307
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:56,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Osama Kubota.

1308
01:37:57,009 --> 01:37:58,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Osamu.

1309
01:37:58,730 --> 01:37:59,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not insult him.

1310
01:38:04,338 --> 01:38:04,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Any reasons why?

1311
01:38:05,839 --> 01:38:06,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Presto.

1312
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:08,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Need I say anything more?

1313
01:38:08,059 --> 01:38:08,560
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1314
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Presto.

1315
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:10,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Fair enough.

1316
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:15,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And not to mention his Nanbe Mani stuff is absolutely gorgeous.

1317
01:38:16,042 --> 01:38:16,342
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?

1318
01:38:18,043 --> 01:38:21,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I kind of forgot that it's performed.

1319
01:38:21,764 --> 01:38:26,306
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not... Because, you know, Presto is like a famous song.

1320
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:27,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Classical.

1321
01:38:28,086 --> 01:38:31,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still referring to his rendition of it.

1322
01:38:31,428 --> 01:38:31,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

1323
01:38:31,868 --> 01:38:32,128
That's fine.

1324
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:34,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Next.

1325
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:38,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Chat room is... Okay, never mind.

1326
01:38:38,641 --> 01:38:40,182
[SPEAKER_17]: They're settling that debate in there internally.

1327
01:38:40,202 --> 01:38:43,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody was saying Osamu Kobota is a girl, but it's a guy with long hair.

1328
01:38:43,623 --> 01:38:44,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's a guy with long hair.

1329
01:38:45,844 --> 01:38:46,324
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Loki.

1330
01:38:46,364 --> 01:38:48,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's a guy's name.

1331
01:38:48,485 --> 01:38:49,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, your number three choice.

1332
01:38:49,986 --> 01:38:50,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Ryo Nagumi.

1333
01:38:51,406 --> 01:38:51,807
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry?

1334
01:38:52,087 --> 01:38:52,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Naguma.

1335
01:38:53,567 --> 01:38:54,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Nagumo.

1336
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:55,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

1337
01:38:55,808 --> 01:38:57,069
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to spell that for me, buddy.

1338
01:38:59,295 --> 01:39:02,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Brad, spell that for me so I can type it.

1339
01:39:03,116 --> 01:39:09,719
[SPEAKER_15]: That is R-E-O space N-A-G-U-M-O.

1340
01:39:10,299 --> 01:39:10,959
[SPEAKER_16]: And what did they do?

1341
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:12,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything.

1342
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:16,526
[SPEAKER_16]: He did 20 November and all those kickass things.

1343
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:17,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Instant love.

1344
01:39:17,987 --> 01:39:19,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, alright, fair enough.

1345
01:39:19,268 --> 01:39:20,149
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad.

1346
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:24,732
[SPEAKER_17]: They're saying that's DJ Naguro, same person.

1347
01:39:25,072 --> 01:39:33,438
[SPEAKER_17]: However, we did make the rule in here that people's multiple egos would not fall under their name.

1348
01:39:33,678 --> 01:39:35,779
[SPEAKER_17]: So Naoki will not count for everything.

1349
01:39:35,839 --> 01:39:40,382
[SPEAKER_17]: You either gotta put Revenge or Naoki Underground or whatever.

1350
01:39:40,763 --> 01:39:42,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Naoki doesn't count for everything.

1351
01:39:44,185 --> 01:39:46,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, yes, Brad, you got a number three choice yet?

1352
01:39:46,466 --> 01:39:47,187
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we're going to Bradley.

1353
01:39:47,267 --> 01:39:47,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Bradley, number three.

1354
01:39:48,467 --> 01:39:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say Revenge.

1355
01:39:50,468 --> 01:39:51,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Revenge, because you like all their songs.

1356
01:39:52,229 --> 01:39:52,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Good choice.

1357
01:39:54,331 --> 01:40:04,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And Revenge is the extra stage song, the special extra stage song, if you like AAA or 7, maybe it has to be a flashing 7, another.

1358
01:40:05,097 --> 01:40:06,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Sakura.

1359
01:40:06,878 --> 01:40:10,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a spritule, because they misspelled it.

1360
01:40:12,023 --> 01:40:13,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments from DarkSakura?

1361
01:40:13,584 --> 01:40:16,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm never going to be able to play that damn song.

1362
01:40:18,347 --> 01:40:18,648
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1363
01:40:18,728 --> 01:40:23,631
[SPEAKER_17]: My number three choice, and this should come as no surprise for me, but maybe that I put it so low on my list.

1364
01:40:24,011 --> 01:40:26,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Number three, Erotic, of course.

1365
01:40:27,594 --> 01:40:29,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Bestest Bomani band ever.

1366
01:40:29,215 --> 01:40:31,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, third bestest Bomani band ever.

1367
01:40:31,357 --> 01:40:32,197
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't care what you say.

1368
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:37,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Chatroom is begging that one of us put down Jenny Rom.

1369
01:40:37,681 --> 01:40:38,121
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1370
01:40:38,261 --> 01:40:39,482
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if anybody will see.

1371
01:40:39,923 --> 01:40:40,383
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Brad.

1372
01:40:42,825 --> 01:40:51,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, since Matt got my number three, Riro Nagumo, I'm going to have to go with Naoki Naoki, alright Any particular reason why?

1373
01:40:52,774 --> 01:41:03,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it was neck and neck with Taka, DJ Taka and Naoki But I think Naoki's been more responsible for a lot more of my favorite songs, so Alrighty, fair enough

1374
01:41:04,784 --> 01:41:06,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, that's our number three choices.

1375
01:41:06,885 --> 01:41:07,846
[SPEAKER_17]: On to the number twos.

1376
01:41:07,906 --> 01:41:08,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie.

1377
01:41:08,727 --> 01:41:13,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, well, I have a list here, and I'm thinking and thinking and thinking.

1378
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:14,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually going to say Bus Stop.

1379
01:41:15,311 --> 01:41:15,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Bus Stop.

1380
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:21,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, okay, I like Long Train Runnin', and I liked, you know, Kick the Can.

1381
01:41:21,855 --> 01:41:23,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I really liked it when it was new.

1382
01:41:24,817 --> 01:41:26,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really dig their remixes.

1383
01:41:26,818 --> 01:41:30,160
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they take some of the things you don't really expect and make really good remixes.

1384
01:41:31,121 --> 01:41:33,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I'm going to defend for you, uh...

1385
01:41:34,372 --> 01:41:34,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Na-na-na-na

1386
01:41:47,406 --> 01:41:53,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't forget about how many people were trying to do the Pee Wee Herman Tequila dance.

1387
01:41:54,269 --> 01:41:55,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Very true, very true.

1388
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:57,190
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Loki, your number two pick.

1389
01:41:57,591 --> 01:42:01,452
[SPEAKER_16]: My number two pick has to go with Desire, because I love Chirp Machine.

1390
01:42:01,492 --> 01:42:02,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Desire.

1391
01:42:02,673 --> 01:42:03,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds fun.

1392
01:42:03,753 --> 01:42:06,354
[SPEAKER_17]: So we got Revenge and Desire both on this list.

1393
01:42:06,374 --> 01:42:06,995
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll be interesting.

1394
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:10,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Bradley, your number two pick.

1395
01:42:11,477 --> 01:42:11,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Good Cool.

1396
01:42:12,477 --> 01:42:13,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Good Cool.

1397
01:42:13,238 --> 01:42:14,278
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a good choice.

1398
01:42:14,658 --> 01:42:15,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Good Cool.

1399
01:42:15,178 --> 01:42:16,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Good Call on Good Cool.

1400
01:42:17,774 --> 01:42:19,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, my number two choice.

1401
01:42:19,215 --> 01:42:20,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Any particular reason why?

1402
01:42:20,295 --> 01:42:20,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Good, cool?

1403
01:42:21,096 --> 01:42:22,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they have a lot of good songs.

1404
01:42:23,177 --> 01:42:23,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Fair enough.

1405
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:26,559
[SPEAKER_17]: I do not want the nerd that fell on the floor.

1406
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:27,039
[SPEAKER_17]: You can eat it.

1407
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:33,983
[SPEAKER_17]: My number two choice, of course, duh, Orange Lounge.

1408
01:42:34,323 --> 01:42:34,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

1409
01:42:36,764 --> 01:42:38,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge is my number two choice.

1410
01:42:38,845 --> 01:42:40,405
[SPEAKER_17]: And, come on, duh.

1411
01:42:41,186 --> 01:42:42,186
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have to explain why.

1412
01:42:42,266 --> 01:42:43,647
[SPEAKER_17]: If I have to explain why, you're a retard.

1413
01:42:43,967 --> 01:42:45,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Brad, you're number two choice.

1414
01:42:45,247 --> 01:42:46,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is it your favorite?

1415
01:42:46,668 --> 01:42:47,668
[SPEAKER_17]: I really do dig their song.

1416
01:42:47,688 --> 01:42:52,550
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, not only did it make a catchy title for the show, but obviously we picked it because they've got some good shit.

1417
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:54,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, Mobomoga's a great song, retrospective song.

1418
01:42:54,971 --> 01:42:55,631
[SPEAKER_17]: And the videos.

1419
01:42:55,731 --> 01:42:57,252
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the videos have a lot to do with it.

1420
01:42:57,272 --> 01:42:57,952
[SPEAKER_17]: They're cute!

1421
01:42:58,212 --> 01:42:59,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, yes, Orange Lounge, rules.

1422
01:43:00,073 --> 01:43:02,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, Brad, you're number two choice.

1423
01:43:02,114 --> 01:43:03,474
[SPEAKER_15]: What are we doing here?

1424
01:43:03,554 --> 01:43:05,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, my number two is Akira Yamaoka.

1425
01:43:06,251 --> 01:43:11,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah, good one, Akira Yamaoka, except for 250 BPM, but... Akira.

1426
01:43:11,673 --> 01:43:13,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, spell the last name for me, I don't want to F it up.

1427
01:43:15,814 --> 01:43:18,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Y-A-M-A, okay.

1428
01:43:19,515 --> 01:43:22,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, any other, any particular reason why?

1429
01:43:23,356 --> 01:43:28,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty much everything Akira Yamaoka has done, yeah, I feel, oh my god, that's a great song.

1430
01:43:28,738 --> 01:43:34,680
[SPEAKER_15]: But, yeah, pretty much everything, except, you're right, 250 BPM is kind of a shit song, but everything else has been wonderful.

1431
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:35,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, there you go.

1432
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, Jamie, number one pick.

1433
01:43:38,301 --> 01:43:40,562
[SPEAKER_09]: This will come as a surprise to absolutely no one.

1434
01:43:40,962 --> 01:43:42,302
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my number one choice.

1435
01:43:42,982 --> 01:43:43,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Tack.

1436
01:43:44,203 --> 01:43:46,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob had it typed out before I said it.

1437
01:43:47,084 --> 01:43:53,006
[SPEAKER_09]: For people who know me, I have been quoted as saying that if I don't marry Dan, I'm going to marry Tack or Margaret Cho.

1438
01:43:53,046 --> 01:43:56,887
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's basically... Fair enough.

1439
01:43:57,407 --> 01:44:03,409
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, everything he's done, except for stoic, has made me absolutely orgasmic.

1440
01:44:03,717 --> 01:44:08,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but Tech has Tran as it shows in the Stoic video.

1441
01:44:09,121 --> 01:44:10,162
[SPEAKER_09]: He's his girlfriend now.

1442
01:44:10,342 --> 01:44:13,524
[SPEAKER_09]: But Stoic is boring.

1443
01:44:14,345 --> 01:44:15,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Stoic is a boring song.

1444
01:44:16,506 --> 01:44:17,987
[SPEAKER_09]: And the video is kind of boring too.

1445
01:44:18,087 --> 01:44:25,412
[SPEAKER_09]: However, every other thing he's done, especially like his... I've been listening to a lot of that song, what is it, Bar Morgengrau?

1446
01:44:26,653 --> 01:44:29,836
[SPEAKER_09]: That song is really awesome.

1447
01:44:29,876 --> 01:44:31,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Chatroom is arguing with you on Stoic.

1448
01:44:33,544 --> 01:44:34,324
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my opinion.

1449
01:44:34,424 --> 01:44:35,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care for stoic.

1450
01:44:36,307 --> 01:44:38,068
[SPEAKER_09]: However, Gravity is awesome.

1451
01:44:38,129 --> 01:44:38,989
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Schlagwerk.

1452
01:44:40,731 --> 01:44:41,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Holic.

1453
01:44:43,324 --> 01:44:50,665
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing is, I had the site up on Sekbimani.com, however, it's gone.

1454
01:44:50,685 --> 01:44:52,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to find what the new official tag site is.

1455
01:44:53,026 --> 01:44:57,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Last I checked, he had five of his original pieces for download.

1456
01:44:59,067 --> 01:45:06,468
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't find the site, for people who actually know me, I'll make sure that they're made available since he had them up public on his site.

1457
01:45:06,648 --> 01:45:07,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.

1458
01:45:07,528 --> 01:45:10,749
[SPEAKER_17]: 23rd Magus would like you to know that Tomorrow Perfume makes a mess of pants.

1459
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:15,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, your number one pick.

1460
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:18,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see here.

1461
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:22,693
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1462
01:45:22,773 --> 01:45:23,674
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't write this down.

1463
01:45:23,714 --> 01:45:24,795
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just pulling this out of your ass here.

1464
01:45:24,815 --> 01:45:28,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, no, I see what Brad has, and I don't want to say it because that was going to be my number one pick.

1465
01:45:28,738 --> 01:45:29,378
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, what's yours?

1466
01:45:30,139 --> 01:45:31,259
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, you can keep yours.

1467
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:33,481
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to have to go with...

1468
01:45:39,756 --> 01:45:40,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, what the hell?

1469
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:42,418
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to pick one that's going to get eliminated anyways.

1470
01:45:42,698 --> 01:45:42,918
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1471
01:45:43,098 --> 01:45:45,139
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going with NW260.

1472
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,220
[SPEAKER_02]: NW260?

1473
01:45:47,001 --> 01:45:47,281
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1474
01:45:47,301 --> 01:45:49,122
[SPEAKER_02]: The number one of a money band?

1475
01:45:50,062 --> 01:45:51,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, you lose.

1476
01:45:51,904 --> 01:45:52,844
[SPEAKER_03]: You lose.

1477
01:45:55,106 --> 01:45:55,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Dropout.

1478
01:45:56,586 --> 01:45:57,047
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1479
01:45:57,687 --> 01:45:57,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

1480
01:45:57,967 --> 01:45:58,508
[SPEAKER_03]: You lost.

1481
01:45:58,728 --> 01:45:59,428
[SPEAKER_03]: You lose.

1482
01:45:59,468 --> 01:46:01,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I get all the numbers and all the Roman numerals?

1483
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:03,211
[SPEAKER_16]: All the Roman, like, you know.

1484
01:46:04,311 --> 01:46:05,192
[SPEAKER_16]: I want all the numbers.

1485
01:46:06,816 --> 01:46:07,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, whatever.

1486
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:10,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, wait, wait.

1487
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,401
[SPEAKER_16]: You changed your mind?

1488
01:46:11,481 --> 01:46:12,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, he changed his mind.

1489
01:46:13,683 --> 01:46:15,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Goodbye, NW260.

1490
01:46:15,625 --> 01:46:17,046
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to put in a real one here.

1491
01:46:17,467 --> 01:46:20,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go with Captain Jack.

1492
01:46:21,551 --> 01:46:22,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Captain Jack!

1493
01:46:22,492 --> 01:46:23,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Good idea, Captain Jack.

1494
01:46:25,715 --> 01:46:26,756
[SPEAKER_09]: And why do you like Captain Jack?

1495
01:46:28,573 --> 01:46:31,077
[SPEAKER_16]: because, I don't know, because he sucks.

1496
01:46:31,437 --> 01:46:31,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

1497
01:46:34,141 --> 01:46:34,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1498
01:46:35,203 --> 01:46:35,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

1499
01:46:35,864 --> 01:46:37,606
[SPEAKER_09]: He does have that butt-ugly hoochie model with him.

1500
01:46:39,695 --> 01:46:42,536
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought you didn't like ugly people, what's up with that?

1501
01:46:42,716 --> 01:46:47,376
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't like Captain Jack, but his Captain Jack video had a lot of women in wet t-shirts.

1502
01:46:47,456 --> 01:46:48,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, good point.

1503
01:46:49,337 --> 01:46:52,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, chat room is getting very angry with us on our choices here.

1504
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:55,798
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some interesting things that haven't turned up yet, so we'll see.

1505
01:46:56,618 --> 01:46:57,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Change mine.

1506
01:46:57,338 --> 01:46:58,799
[SPEAKER_17]: No, come on, you just said it.

1507
01:46:58,939 --> 01:47:00,019
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you want to change it to?

1508
01:47:00,419 --> 01:47:00,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Taka.

1509
01:47:01,379 --> 01:47:01,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Taka?

1510
01:47:02,899 --> 01:47:05,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay, wait, let's see if somebody else does it.

1511
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:06,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see if somebody else does it.

1512
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, next one is Bradley.

1513
01:47:10,722 --> 01:47:13,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I was originally going to say Taka, but of course she took it, so I'll say DJ Taka.

1514
01:47:13,804 --> 01:47:14,765
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Taka, all right.

1515
01:47:15,646 --> 01:47:18,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to be very surprised if Taka didn't turn up somewhere, but there it is.

1516
01:47:18,869 --> 01:47:21,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Bradley put down Taka as his number one choice.

1517
01:47:23,012 --> 01:47:26,856
[SPEAKER_17]: My number one choice, Vincent Damore.

1518
01:47:27,196 --> 01:47:27,776
[SPEAKER_17]: No question.

1519
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:34,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Vincent Damore is my absolute favorite Bomani artist, and if you don't like that, you can suck it.

1520
01:47:35,103 --> 01:47:35,623
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good one.

1521
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:36,364
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1522
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:39,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Brad, your number one choice.

1523
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:47,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, since I knew, you know, before that Jamie was going to pick TAC, so, because that would have been my first, because everything TAC comes out with makes me cream.

1524
01:47:47,147 --> 01:47:48,848
[SPEAKER_02]: You all have this game rigged.

1525
01:47:49,328 --> 01:47:51,630
[SPEAKER_02]: You all are picking what the others are going to pick.

1526
01:47:51,650 --> 01:47:56,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So, instead of TAC, I picked LED, because also everything TAC ever does makes me cream.

1527
01:47:56,234 --> 01:47:57,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, good pick, good pick, LED.

1528
01:47:57,335 --> 01:47:58,376
[SPEAKER_17]: I cream them in the...

1529
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:07,438
[SPEAKER_17]: JB punches us all for not putting Jenny Rom on the list somewhere.

1530
01:48:10,119 --> 01:48:12,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Jenny Rom's the new SmileDK, haven't you heard?

1531
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:17,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to thank you all for not putting SmileDK on the list.

1532
01:48:19,162 --> 01:48:20,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Please, what does Jenny Rom do?

1533
01:48:20,782 --> 01:48:22,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Waka Laka.

1534
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wow.

1535
01:48:26,224 --> 01:48:26,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Waka Laka...

1536
01:48:28,267 --> 01:48:28,968
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right.

1537
01:48:29,689 --> 01:48:30,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Yell about it.

1538
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:31,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Yell about it.

1539
01:48:31,591 --> 01:48:33,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, this is going to be hard.

1540
01:48:33,532 --> 01:48:37,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything that gets taken off this list is going to cause some people to get nasty.

1541
01:48:37,556 --> 01:48:39,018
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is going to be a fun one.

1542
01:48:39,518 --> 01:48:40,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, here we go.

1543
01:48:40,359 --> 01:48:41,961
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the full list we've got so far.

1544
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:51,350
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Usamo Kubota, Reo Nagumo, Revenge, Erotic, Naoki, Bus Stop, Desire, Good Cool, Orange Lounge, Akira Yamaoka,

1545
01:48:52,324 --> 01:48:57,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Yamaoka, Tak, Captain Jack, Taka, Vincent Damore, and L.E.D.

1546
01:48:58,269 --> 01:48:59,270
[SPEAKER_17]: This is going to be tricky.

1547
01:48:59,831 --> 01:49:04,515
[SPEAKER_14]: And Naoki just encompasses stuff that goes under Naoki, nothing else, right?

1548
01:49:05,115 --> 01:49:05,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you got it.

1549
01:49:08,732 --> 01:49:14,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, but we'll remember, well, that's... Naoki Underground is still Naoki, so we should go with that.

1550
01:49:15,154 --> 01:49:20,395
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not talking about, like, Desire as in Naoki or other Naoki monikers, but Naoki Underground is still Naoki.

1551
01:49:20,515 --> 01:49:21,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, well, we'll see.

1552
01:49:21,475 --> 01:49:22,196
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see what happens.

1553
01:49:22,216 --> 01:49:23,696
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go ahead and start our vote off the list.

1554
01:49:23,756 --> 01:49:24,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, Jamie, take it off.

1555
01:49:25,036 --> 01:49:25,476
[SPEAKER_17]: What's going?

1556
01:49:25,676 --> 01:49:27,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate shirt machines, so take off Desire.

1557
01:49:27,757 --> 01:49:29,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Desire is off the list.

1558
01:49:29,459 --> 01:49:33,904
[SPEAKER_09]: There is only one version of Trip Machine that I've liked, and that's the jungle one.

1559
01:49:34,344 --> 01:49:34,705
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1560
01:49:34,745 --> 01:49:36,146
[SPEAKER_17]: This is going to get dirty.

1561
01:49:36,186 --> 01:49:37,688
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, this is going to be bad.

1562
01:49:37,768 --> 01:49:38,148
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1563
01:49:38,409 --> 01:49:39,230
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Matt.

1564
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:39,950
[SPEAKER_17]: What's going on?

1565
01:49:42,153 --> 01:49:42,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

1566
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:45,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Say goodbye, Naoki.

1567
01:49:45,577 --> 01:49:46,097
[SPEAKER_16]: You suck.

1568
01:49:46,518 --> 01:49:48,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Naoki is coming off the list.

1569
01:49:49,358 --> 01:49:50,179
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not surprised.

1570
01:49:50,339 --> 01:49:54,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, today some guy in America is going to be off the list.

1571
01:49:54,583 --> 01:49:56,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, I hate America.

1572
01:49:57,125 --> 01:49:59,107
[SPEAKER_09]: My feelings are hurt, so I took a bubble bath.

1573
01:49:59,147 --> 01:50:00,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Calcutta, take me away.

1574
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:03,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Bradley.

1575
01:50:04,271 --> 01:50:05,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Bradley, what's coming up?

1576
01:50:05,868 --> 01:50:10,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since he's only done one song in all of Omani, Captain Jack's.

1577
01:50:11,929 --> 01:50:12,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

1578
01:50:12,409 --> 01:50:13,549
[SPEAKER_02]: One song in all of Omani?

1579
01:50:13,789 --> 01:50:14,910
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of the major people.

1580
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:20,411
[SPEAKER_02]: The Race, Little Boy, Captain Jack, In the Navy.

1581
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:22,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still going?

1582
01:50:22,171 --> 01:50:22,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that still your point?

1583
01:50:23,251 --> 01:50:24,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, Captain Jack's gone.

1584
01:50:25,532 --> 01:50:26,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Goodbye, Captain Jack.

1585
01:50:30,292 --> 01:50:33,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, God, this is hard.

1586
01:50:42,744 --> 01:50:43,405
[SPEAKER_17]: This is hard.

1587
01:50:43,525 --> 01:50:44,245
[SPEAKER_17]: I really don't know.

1588
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:56,133
[SPEAKER_17]: This is hard, but I'm going to have to take Akira Yamakawa off the list.

1589
01:50:57,374 --> 01:50:58,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And Brad has a heart attack.

1590
01:50:59,615 --> 01:51:00,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, Brad.

1591
01:51:03,343 --> 01:51:03,883
[SPEAKER_15]: What's left?

1592
01:51:03,903 --> 01:51:04,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Your last one.

1593
01:51:04,744 --> 01:51:05,484
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no revenge.

1594
01:51:05,904 --> 01:51:06,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wait, wait.

1595
01:51:06,665 --> 01:51:07,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, there it is.

1596
01:51:07,605 --> 01:51:08,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey.

1597
01:51:08,886 --> 01:51:09,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Goodbye, erotic.

1598
01:51:10,767 --> 01:51:11,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you asshole.

1599
01:51:11,828 --> 01:51:12,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate you.

1600
01:51:12,628 --> 01:51:13,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate you.

1601
01:51:13,949 --> 01:51:14,749
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to cut you.

1602
01:51:14,869 --> 01:51:15,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you.

1603
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:16,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cut you.

1604
01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:17,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cut you deep.

1605
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:22,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go ahead and read off the list then for our... I have to post this in the chat room real fast before you read.

1606
01:51:22,554 --> 01:51:23,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Gorgeous and lovely chat.

1607
01:51:23,774 --> 01:51:23,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1608
01:51:24,014 --> 01:51:28,537
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually have to close all my private message windows because people are about ready to vote here.

1609
01:51:29,157 --> 01:51:29,537
[SPEAKER_17]: So once...

1610
01:51:32,799 --> 01:51:33,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Here it goes.

1611
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:39,661
[SPEAKER_17]: There's the list, and you can send me your votes over private message, and Jamie's going to read it off for you right now, for those of you that aren't in the chat room.

1612
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:43,082
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Osamu Kubota, Rea Nagumo.

1613
01:51:43,202 --> 01:51:44,222
[SPEAKER_17]: How did that one survive?

1614
01:51:44,682 --> 01:51:46,582
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to take that one off, but I figured someone else would.

1615
01:51:46,602 --> 01:51:53,064
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Revenge, Bus Stop, Good Cool, Orange Lounge, Tack, DJ Taka, Vincent Damore, and L.E.D.,

1616
01:51:53,784 --> 01:51:54,725
[SPEAKER_17]: So there it is.

1617
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:59,628
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got to pick your absolute favorite and send it to me over private message.

1618
01:51:59,648 --> 01:52:01,349
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to take a really quick break.

1619
01:52:01,869 --> 01:52:02,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Huh?

1620
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:03,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolute, since you said absolute.

1621
01:52:04,171 --> 01:52:05,872
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to do absolute because I said absolute?

1622
01:52:05,932 --> 01:52:06,612
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, fair enough.

1623
01:52:09,614 --> 01:52:12,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Send your votes in right now here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1624
01:52:12,316 --> 01:52:14,117
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to take about four minutes.

1625
01:52:14,137 --> 01:52:16,259
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll do two songs because this is a hard decision for you guys.

1626
01:52:16,279 --> 01:52:18,980
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we're going to come back, read the results, and end the show because we're already at 855.

1627
01:52:19,681 --> 01:52:21,682
[SPEAKER_17]: So here we go on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:21,782 --> 01:52:22,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Vote now.

1629
01:52:22,323 --> 01:52:22,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Vote now, now, now, now.

1630
01:52:47,465 --> 01:52:48,065
Thanks for watching!

1631
01:56:19,488 --> 01:56:28,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1632
01:56:28,076 --> 01:56:34,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1633
01:56:35,383 --> 01:56:43,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, we are back, and I'm trying to prep to go off the air here, but I'm getting very last minute here, but we are going to read the results of the...

1634
01:56:44,801 --> 01:56:47,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Best Bomani Artist Ever!

1635
01:56:48,343 --> 01:56:53,666
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've got the results here and I'm trying to... Sorry, I need a minute here.

1636
01:56:53,946 --> 01:56:58,549
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, I'm going to have to throw on another song real fast because I'm trying to prep for the end of the show here and I'm not ready yet.

1637
01:56:58,569 --> 01:57:01,950
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to play something very fast and we'll be right back.

1638
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:02,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry for the inconvenience.

1639
01:58:19,674 --> 01:58:20,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hello.

1640
01:58:22,096 --> 01:58:22,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Jamie.

1641
01:58:23,718 --> 01:58:25,699
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to do about a million things at once here, but that's okay.

1642
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:26,360
[SPEAKER_17]: We got it.

1643
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:26,940
[SPEAKER_17]: We are back.

1644
01:58:27,661 --> 01:58:32,225
[SPEAKER_17]: And right at the end of the show, we're going to announce the best Bomani artist ever.

1645
01:58:32,725 --> 01:58:39,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Third place was Orange Lounge for best Bomani artist ever.

1646
01:58:39,972 --> 01:58:42,054
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy for that one, because that's our namesake there.

1647
01:58:42,154 --> 01:58:43,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge, third best ever.

1648
01:58:43,915 --> 01:58:45,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Second best Bomani artist ever.

1649
01:58:46,417 --> 01:58:47,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Good, cool.

1650
01:58:47,850 --> 01:58:48,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, cool.

1651
01:58:48,931 --> 01:58:49,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Good, cool.

1652
01:58:50,292 --> 01:58:55,536
[SPEAKER_17]: And first place, this ain't going to surprise a damn person, it won by an absolute landslide.

1653
01:58:55,956 --> 01:58:58,438
[SPEAKER_17]: First place, DJ Taka.

1654
01:58:58,778 --> 01:59:00,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Best Bomani artist ever, so there it is.

1655
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:03,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Poo-poo on everybody who didn't vote for Tak.

1656
01:59:03,702 --> 01:59:04,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody voted for Tak?

1657
01:59:05,343 --> 01:59:06,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody voted for Revenge?

1658
01:59:06,764 --> 01:59:08,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody voted for Osamu Kubota?

1659
01:59:08,185 --> 01:59:08,926
[SPEAKER_17]: I was kind of surprised.

1660
01:59:08,946 --> 01:59:13,810
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I should have taken Taka off so that everyone would vote for Tak.

1661
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:16,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you would have been the evil bitch of Bomani.

1662
01:59:18,658 --> 01:59:20,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, well that's it.

1663
01:59:20,498 --> 01:59:21,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Taka's winner.

1664
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:24,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Just really briefly because we were supposed to do this much earlier.

1665
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:26,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, the shaft update, please.

1666
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:28,780
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll run a little long, they won't mind.

1667
01:59:30,241 --> 01:59:34,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically we've got the perfect attack rules already posted for the upcoming tournament.

1668
01:59:34,982 --> 01:59:41,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Sac Mimani hosts another fabulous tournament that will be held at Sacramento Scandia on Hillsdale.

1669
01:59:41,604 --> 01:59:46,685
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got directions, we have maps, we have the address, we have everything up on...

1670
01:59:47,865 --> 01:59:48,986
[SPEAKER_09]: and SACBEMANI.com.

1671
01:59:49,026 --> 01:59:56,710
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go to S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I.com, there is a link for Shaft and that is the whole section dedicated to that.

1672
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:58,411
[SPEAKER_09]: The only rules we have up are perfect attack right now.

1673
01:59:58,451 --> 02:00:01,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, to be specific, it's accuracy attack.

1674
02:00:01,973 --> 02:00:03,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not a true perfect attack.

1675
02:00:03,834 --> 02:00:06,836
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's true perfect attack, we're only gauging by perfects.

1676
02:00:07,356 --> 02:00:08,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is accuracy attack.

1677
02:00:09,779 --> 02:00:15,065
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have freestyle rules posted by the middle of the week as soon as they're finalized.

1678
02:00:16,046 --> 02:00:17,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure you go there.

1679
02:00:17,868 --> 02:00:21,792
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a discussion going on with psychedbymoney.com forums, so be sure to keep your eye on it.

1680
02:00:21,932 --> 02:00:24,375
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a thread on DDR Freak Under Tournament discussion.

1681
02:00:25,174 --> 02:00:30,559
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not just saying this because I'm involved with the planning of this, but honestly, this is going to be one of the biggest tournaments in history.

1682
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:31,480
[SPEAKER_17]: It really will be.

1683
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:36,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Assuming we get the participation for it, which it sounds like we're going to be getting a lot of support for this.

1684
02:00:37,244 --> 02:00:42,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, if you live far away, you live a ways away, this is going to be worth the trip.

1685
02:00:43,129 --> 02:00:45,271
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be prizes up the wazoo.

1686
02:00:45,291 --> 02:00:46,112
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got door prizes.

1687
02:00:46,472 --> 02:00:48,014
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some really cool door prizes.

1688
02:00:48,034 --> 02:00:49,114
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't even announce them yet.

1689
02:00:49,135 --> 02:00:49,735
[SPEAKER_17]: They're that good.

1690
02:00:50,195 --> 02:00:50,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So...

1691
02:00:51,116 --> 02:00:56,658
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have to... And we've got Loki donating hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs as prizes.

1692
02:00:56,778 --> 02:00:57,579
[SPEAKER_09]: As door prizes.

1693
02:00:57,679 --> 02:00:58,499
[SPEAKER_17]: As door prizes.

1694
02:00:58,699 --> 02:00:59,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody can win this.

1695
02:00:59,459 --> 02:01:00,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Just show up.

1696
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:01,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Just show the fuck up.

1697
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:01,900
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all you gotta do.

1698
02:01:02,401 --> 02:01:07,443
[SPEAKER_17]: So, definitely come to tournament November 9th at Sacramento Scandia.

1699
02:01:07,483 --> 02:01:08,423
[SPEAKER_17]: It's gonna be huge.

1700
02:01:08,943 --> 02:01:09,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Huge.

1701
02:01:09,663 --> 02:01:09,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1702
02:01:11,304 --> 02:01:12,665
[SPEAKER_17]: And also the A-Team Freestyle.

1703
02:01:12,685 --> 02:01:15,246
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're not gonna come for anything else, come for the A-Team Freestyle.

1704
02:01:15,286 --> 02:01:18,187
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanna see what Freestyle was two years ago...

1705
02:01:19,002 --> 02:01:20,482
[SPEAKER_09]: We are having a blast from the past.

1706
02:01:20,502 --> 02:01:22,343
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having a team freestyle mode.

1707
02:01:22,743 --> 02:01:23,803
[SPEAKER_09]: It's limited entry.

1708
02:01:24,143 --> 02:01:29,145
[SPEAKER_09]: We're basically leaving it to, we want past winners of tournaments to participate in at first.

1709
02:01:29,725 --> 02:01:33,086
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we get enough entrants, we'll open it up.

1710
02:01:34,526 --> 02:01:35,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1711
02:01:35,966 --> 02:01:37,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Final thoughts from everybody in the room.

1712
02:01:37,467 --> 02:01:37,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki.

1713
02:01:39,201 --> 02:01:40,441
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have any thoughts right now.

1714
02:01:40,461 --> 02:01:47,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Too much big stuff's happening next week, so we'll probably have a lot more to report on next week, so I can't wait.

1715
02:01:47,543 --> 02:01:47,863
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1716
02:01:48,203 --> 02:01:48,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave.

1717
02:01:49,463 --> 02:01:50,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Kuchaka rules.

1718
02:01:50,923 --> 02:01:51,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Steel drums.

1719
02:01:51,783 --> 02:01:52,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Whee!

1720
02:01:53,504 --> 02:01:54,224
[SPEAKER_17]: And Bradley.

1721
02:01:55,004 --> 02:01:55,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I need power!

1722
02:01:55,924 --> 02:01:56,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Power!

1723
02:01:58,665 --> 02:02:00,065
[SPEAKER_17]: I love Bradley's final thoughts.

1724
02:02:01,565 --> 02:02:03,246
[SPEAKER_17]: My final thought is nothing.

1725
02:02:03,346 --> 02:02:04,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely nothing.

1726
02:02:04,386 --> 02:02:04,846
[SPEAKER_17]: And Jamie.

1727
02:02:05,675 --> 02:02:07,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Wheel of Morality, turn, turn, turn.

1728
02:02:07,738 --> 02:02:09,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us the lesson that we should learn.

1729
02:02:10,583 --> 02:02:13,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And today's moral is... I have no morals.

1730
02:02:13,567 --> 02:02:14,188
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you talking about?

1731
02:02:14,228 --> 02:02:14,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just end the show.

1732
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:16,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, fair enough.

1733
02:02:16,331 --> 02:02:17,293
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to end this show now.

1734
02:02:17,353 --> 02:02:17,994
[SPEAKER_17]: See you guys later.

1735
02:02:18,034 --> 02:02:18,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for listening.

1736
02:02:19,469 --> 02:02:19,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Finish her!

1737
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:20,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Finish her!

1738
02:03:02,223 --> 02:03:05,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
