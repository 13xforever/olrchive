00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a video tape! Put it in! Put it in!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Boring!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain nudity, Orange Lounge may

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,600
contain many four-letter words, hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,480
The last Metroid is in captivity.

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:08,480
The galaxy is at peace.

8
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,560
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Ms. Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
One, Warner's, disco.

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Missed it by that much.

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
How can you tell?

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
I never forget a pussy. Cat.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
Thirty-seven. My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
In a row?

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
You are the weakest thing could bite.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,560
So you get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:54,060
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

21
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,060
Dark Sakura

22
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,060
I hate nature!

23
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,060
I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

24
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,560
Sky

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,060
Do I look like the weather girl?

26
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,060
Everything alright?

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,560
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Orange Lounge Radio

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,560
We are live and this is episode number 14 for September the 29th of 2002.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,560
You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's most incredible radio station of all things, Bimani!

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,560
We are the greatest Bimani Talk radio program ever.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,560
We are the only Bimani Talk radio program ever.

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,560
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Joining me as always is our resident happy bunny.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Everyone, please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakoda.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,560
You smell like butt.

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
We've got a few people around here tonight.

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
I'm going to introduce them one at a time.

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
We've got Matt, also known as Loki.

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Hello.

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
We've got Dave.

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
We had some other people, but they ran away.

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
There's beef in the other room.

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
That's why they ran away.

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Beef is bad.

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,560
They got enticed by some big beef.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Beef is bad.

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
It's hiding in the other room.

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Beef is bad.

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,640
he's like murder and murder tastes good

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,760

You know what you wanna do, believe it or not, I'm still sure I will see you through.

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Even if it's not for you, sure, I will see you through

67

No, no, I won't leave it when I can't keep it strong

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Understand, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

69
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
You need to set me free, keep me from waiting

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
To unlock the truth of life

71
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Even if it's not for you, even if it's for you

72
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,800
They're tied to things that you will never have to find

73
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Your future holds all that you wish for it to have

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Find an emo, have fun while you can

75
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,800
And remember, turn the clock

76
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm the 23rd Megasaur source for useless Bahmani stuff comes our Bahmani science lesson of the

77
00:07:47,800 --> 00:08:00,120
From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bimani stuff, comes our Bimani Science Less

78
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
of the Day.

79
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.

80
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,240
Alright you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a big thanks to 23rd Magus for sending

81
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,440
us that promo we just used to come back in on, unfortunately it came out a little quiet

82
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,460
but we'll work on getting that a little louder for future broadcasts of that promo because

83
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,260
we need more promos on this show because I'm getting lazy, I'm getting lazy so the audience

84
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,240
needs to take care of that for me if they want.

85
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,520
I'm just reading some things in the chat room, if you do want to join our chat room go to

86
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,160
any other side IRC server and just join channel pound orange lounge

87
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,820
and uh... they're just talking about those songs uh... that we played panorama

88
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,140
and shine on

89
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,300
and uh... all sorts of different opinions on that

90
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,100
uh... what do you want to do first

91
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
we want to talk about Max USA or we want to talk about FU

92
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,680
well I'm just trying to self out a positive bit

93
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
okay we're going to talk about Max USA

94
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,760
DDR MAX

95
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,480
basically I've gotten a little bit of information about the release of DDR Max

96
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,800
sure for everyone who's been looking on DDRFreak. You've seen the release of the box art. If

97
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,840
you have not, just go to DDRFreak.com and it should be the second announcement there.

98
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,880
There's a direct link to the box art. I warn you it is a very large image. It's very high

99
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,560
quality though. There's also a few hints on what you might be hearing on the new version.

100
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,360
Yes. You can also check it out over on SoCalKicks.com. One of our faithful listeners, SoCalKicks,

101
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,420
has a site that's pretty much very up to the minute on all the Max USA news, and one thing

102
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,400
that we found out through the cover, and I'm going to pull up the cover because some people

103
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,800
in the room here haven't, ah shit, sorry about that, I haven't pulled up the cover for some

104
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,960
people in the room here, I'm going to do that right now if I can find it, let's see, but

105
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,360
the cover of DDR Max USA is kind of bluish and it gives away some things, it says featuring

106
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,360
dance hits by Darude, Aurora, JS16, and Reel to Reel.

107
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,520
So we kind of get some hints on some licensed songs through that information.

108
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,160
We find out that Aurora did Ordinary World, so that's definitely going to be on there,

109
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,400
and JS16 did Stomp to My Beats, so that'll definitely be on there.

110
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,060
And I do believe, I get bragging rights, because I think last week on this show I said, if

111
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,240
any song turns up in DDR Max USA, it'll be Ordinary World.

112
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:42,360
I don't know about you guys, but I think the legs on that chick look really fucked up in

113
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
the picture.

114
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,580
I mean, it doesn't look right.

115
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,280
If you think about it in terms of the rest of how her body should be, it's just all fucked

116
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
up.

117
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
What the hell?

118
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
They look like parachute pants.

119
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,740
I think that he did a very nice picture, a very nice job with that background.

120
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,700
It's very detailed, like the hand especially.

121
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
very nice rendering and what's also kind of cool about the background you can see

122
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,620
some freeze arrows in there so kind of teases the video from third mix take

123
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,380
that down now so some interesting things there and of course Darude is best known

124
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,700
for a song of theirs called sandstorm which you might have may or may not have

125
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,660
heard now speculation is that that will be the song that will turn up in DDR Max

126
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,140
USA although who knows you have a different you have a different opinion

127
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
Matt, do you?

128
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,140
Well, there's another song that's pretty much the same song.

129
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,140
It's Feel the Beat.

130
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,140
It's got a lot more stuff that they could do with instead of Sandstorm, which is the

131
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,140
same thing repeating over and over and over and over and over and over again.

132
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,140
I actually have an MP3.

133
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:47,140
We can play that later on in the show, if you'd like.

134
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,140
Yes.

135
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,140
This is Sandstorm for those that maybe haven't heard the song before, so if you have an idea

136
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,140
of what you can look forward to, possibly.

137
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
We don't know yet.

138
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,180
Hopefully get confirmation on that very soon in the near future, so there's a little teaser

139
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
of that for you.

140
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,060
And then Reel to Reel did that song, I don't have an audio copy of it unfortunately, but

141
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,740
it goes like, I like to move it, move it, I like to move it, you might know that, you

142
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
know it.

143
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,740
I haven't heard that song at all.

144
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,340
You'd probably know it if you heard it, you'd probably be surprised at what you've heard,

145
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,340
so.

146
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:21,140
We also, I did get, you know, I asked if it was okay for me to say so, the tentative date

147
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,540
is going to be November 5th.

148
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,460
It could possibly be pushed back a week after that, but that's what I have so far as a release date.

149
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,260
So get over to GameStopper or EB or wherever that you like to go and reserve your copy, like now.

150
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,240
November 5th. Buy your copy. Purchase your copy. Spend money on this copy.

151
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,200
And so that's very cool. We got a... hopefully it's tentative release date, but it sounds pretty certain it's

152
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,560
going to be November 5th.

153
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,920
And as mentioned last week in the

154
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,940
October 8th issue of the official PlayStation Magazine will be a demo of DDR Max USA, so

155
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
go check that out.

156
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,860
And actually, that was the other bit of news that was released this week.

157
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,460
Some people have gotten their hands on that demo.

158
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,820
And also, I believe DDR Freak has the news, as does SoCalKicks.com, as does most of your

159
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,640
faithful Bomani news sites out there.

160
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,920
There are some pictures out there of the DDR Max demo, and what it does reveal is that

161
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,880
Secret Rendezvous is going to be one of the songs on Max USA, which is, YES!

162
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,200
You can get your hot lesbian action on with Secret Rendezvous, which is interesting because

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,200
that means there's a Max 2 song in there, so who knows what other Max 2 songs might

164
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
turn up.

165
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,080
Perhaps, I'd like to see, you know, like Burning Heat or Kakumei.

166
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
You want Burning Heat?

167
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Who knows?

168
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,840
I don't want Burning Heat personally, but I'd like to see it in DDR, yes.

169
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
though.

170
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,080
Just to make sure that you get a release of copy, I just think it's funny though how they

171
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,880
replace the kanji with the little three letter acronyms for the, not acronyms, that's not

172
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,680
a good word, but abbreviations.

173
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,080
And standard is apparently STD.

174
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,120
STD, so if you're playing a song on trick, it's now you're STD.

175
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,340
So make sure you wear those latex shoes.

176
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,200
You need to talk about your new shoes that you got, Jamie.

177
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Did my shoes get ash?

178
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,920
You've got burning heat shoes on today.

179
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Okay.

180
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Unfortunately, we don't have our cam on today because it's really dark in here.

181
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,920
I will scan my shoes so that everyone can see and put them up on the SAC-Vimani forums.

182
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,920
But they've got little flames on them, so it looks like the Max2 logo.

183
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
So she's got burning feet, we all say.

184
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm going to replace the laces with black laces so now they're all sleek and cute.

185
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,920
My shoes own, and I got them at the Vans outlet.

186
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,920
The other thing the demo reveals, there's no.5 speed mix.

187
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,920
That was something that was on the E3 demo that's not on this demo.

188
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,920
So who knows if it's going to be on the final release or not.

189
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,240
There are no dark mode.

190
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,960
Rumors saying not because of technical issues,

191
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,600
but who knows what they're going to do.

192
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,800
The demo also did not include foot rankings,

193
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
which was something that's supposedly supposed

194
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,640
to be in the final release.

195
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,800
So that might be added later.

196
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,720
We just don't know yet.

197
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,600
Just saying for the preview, there

198
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,120
are no foot rankings currently.

199
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,960
So that's about all we see for right now.

200
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Let The Beat Hit Em, Look To The Sky, Exotic Ethnic, and Secret Rendezvous, all playable with this month's official PlayStation Magazine.

201
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,960
So, we'll definitely get our hands on that and share our thoughts on it with you once we get it.

202
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
We're still working on it.

203
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Yes.

204
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
So, let's see, any other chat room?

205
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,960
They're saying they want to see, like, Long Train Runnin', The Whistle Song, and, uh...

206
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Foot Rankings will be in the final release.

207
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,280
We have some information in there.

208
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,640
Some insider scoop.

209
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,080
The last thing to be put in is going to be the foot rankings, so they're still working

210
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
on it.

211
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,200
They're encouraging us not to share our thoughts, but to share an ISO of the demo.

212
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
No.

213
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
You've got to go out and buy a PlayStation magazine.

214
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Go out and buy your copy.

215
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,640
Now, this one thing that we're always going to say is that for any release that comes

216
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,720
out in America, make sure that you spend your money and buy the copy because we will not

217
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:25,400
Any other thoughts on Max USA, things that they need to do quickly before the final release,

218
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,560
other songs we hope to see?

219
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,680
Any opinion?

220
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,960
Well actually if you look really really really really really closely in the background of

221
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,040
Max USA, the cover. You notice in really, really, really small print hidden in there,

222
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,640
it says, yes, there will most definitely be Let Them Move in this version. So just, you

223
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,200
know, to warn you guys, watch out for that.

224
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
No.

225
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed by Jason himself that Let Them Move will not be a song,

226
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,320
but I heard a rumor that it might be the training mode song. Who knows?

227
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
It better not be.

228
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I don't know.

229
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
training mode. Like in third mix.

230
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Why don't you just get rid of training mode and give us a couple more songs?

231
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,320
I use training mode to listen to my edits with the clap assist on.

232
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,320
I'm sorry, actually we're confusing lesson mode and training mode.

233
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Yeah, lesson mode, not training mode.

234
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Training mode is the one where you can slow down the song and all that stuff.

235
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Lesson mode is where you learn how to play TDR.

236
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Lesson mode to just keep, you know, like in third mix they had the pimp song, you know, after the game of love.

237
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Did they? Oh yeah, that's right.

238
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,320
It's when you're not quite ready for the STDs, you go to lesson mode.

239
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
And remember, wear latex shoes so you don't catch those STDs.

240
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Yes.

241
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,320
You're like poor little Miss Muffet who sat on her trumpet.

242
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Oh, Black Lab suggests that instead of Max 300,

243
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Let Them Move will be the extra stage.

244
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Everyone will be failing Max because they'll be throwing up or something.

245
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Bleh.

246
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Let them bleh.

247
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Alright, so we started on a positive note. Shall we go to the FUs of the Week? What do you think?

248
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Uh, sure.

249
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Alright. You got one, Jamie?

250
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
Yes.

251
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Alright, let's start off, as we always do, with Jamie's FU of the Week, which turns in always to everybody's FU of the Week. So, here you go.

252
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,320
My FU of the Week goes to Taco Bell.

253
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:28,920
I hadn't eaten a damn thing all day, I get to Taco Bell and I wanted to have a nice chicken

254
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,880
grilled stuff burrito and I wanted a chicken mixed with milk.

255
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,080
My chicken mixed with milk was yummy but I had tomatoes on it but I forgot.

256
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:44,520
Anyway, we get over here to Rob's place and I take a bite into my chicken grilled stuff

257
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,200
burrito and it's beans, all beans, all beans and a little bit of rice and then I found

258
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
one piece of chicken in the whole damn thing

259
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,840
and i paid for chicken

260
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,200
okay that was beautiful

261
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,920
my f-u of the week

262
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,220
is to roseville golf land

263
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,600
yeah that's right i need to change the song here

264
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,280
oh petite love oh boy

265
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,400
what an f-ing cool song

266
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,840
yay okay

267
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,440
my f-u of the week is to roseville golf land

268
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,000
even though they did upgrade both their guitar freaks and drummania machines

269
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,360
says they have eighth and seventh notes respectively

270
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,960
they broke guitar freaks already after one hour

271
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,440
one hour it's a new record

272
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,100
they can't upgrade it's a new record

273
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,640
you've got a new record save it on the memory card

274
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,680
no but

275
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
it's really shitty now

276
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,440
i play drummania a lot and that's cool but if i want to play session mode

277
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,720
too fucking bad

278
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,280
because guitar freaks they already fucked it up and they haven't even started playing

279
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,000
yet. It was open I think for one hour. Actually, if you think about it, it wasn't as bad as

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
when they got it to 7th Mix. The 7th Mix, they couldn't even play it. It just broke

281
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,760
because of some coding. Keep in mind when we got 5th Mix, do you know who installed

282
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,480
that? Who actually got it working? My fiance did. Dan got it working. Cool. So maybe we

283
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,000
should just send Dan over there and say, hey, fix this. Of course that's also why 5th Mix

284
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,520
uh...

285
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,440
uh... that you had any uh... but he's really

286
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,880
actually i don't think i do

287
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
fine

288
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
for what

289
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
i don't know i haven't really been thinking about things to be angry at a

290
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:41,240
uh...

291
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Alright, you lose. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Yeah, yeah, I got it. I got one.

292
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Okay, this F.E.U. goes to the makers of E.J. software, the programs I use for making a wonderful song.

293
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Unfortunately, I have a sample kit, and I wanted to steal samples from him.

294
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,240
And they have a little thing in there to bump the pitch up so that it's, you know, at 140, which is what E.J. uses.

295
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,240
And the damn thing kept crashing every single time, so I have to do that.

296
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,240
And that's kind of weak, but that's it. That's all I got.

297
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,240
I'll have more next week.

298
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Alright. You promise?

299
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
I promise.

300
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Alright.

301
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,240
One thing I do have to say is that Drumminia 7th Mix totally owns.

302
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Kuchaka and Concierto in Blue and the Extra Stage in Japanese, I can't read it.

303
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
They all play the coolest songs.

304
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Okay, I just need to get over there and play it so I can play Another World and have my gax fix.

305
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,640
I'm going to be bringing that song next week and we are going to play Another World on

306
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,260
Orange Lounge because Gaktones, he's pretty.

307
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,260
I have some FUs of the Week.

308
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,160
He's also very, very, very, very, very, very interesting.

309
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,320
I have some FUs of the Week.

310
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,600
My first FU of the Week, as wonderful as they are for hosting this wonderful program, Live365.com

311
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,440
gets my first FU of the Week.

312
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,640
First of all, for playing that goddamn Prodigy ad in the midst of the show.

313
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,400
I'm all for, you know, playing the ads occasionally to help pay the bills, but that Prodigy song

314
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,040
sucks, I'm sorry. Quit playing that ad during my show.

315
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,360
Second F.U. for them is that they keep stats, so we can see, you know, how many people are

316
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,160
listening to the show, how many hours we get and all that. Well, guess what? For every

317
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,760
station on Live 365, they lost last week's stat. And by the way, I happen to know, because

318
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,960
I see live stats as they're coming in, that last Sunday happened to be one of our biggest

319
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,160
nights for the show to date and we don't get any credit for that now so our ratings suck

320
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,440
thanks to life365.com. So FU! So poo poo on them. Everybody, log in twice. Although, thanks

321
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,000
for hosting the show, hey, what can I say, but you fucked up on that one, so poo. Poopy!

322
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,200
Poopy on you. My other FU of the week goes to my 2DX controller, because button number

323
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,040
three and button number seven have been sticking like, like a lot, and I hate it. That's it,

324
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
That's my last F.U. that I can pick up.

325
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
You have another F.U., Jamie.

326
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Oops, wrong one.

327
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
My next F.U. goes toward

328
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,040
HolikR5NY31 yet again.

329
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
I am so close to passing this one.

330
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,040
You know, I had a freakin' full combo on R5

331
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,040
going into right before that one really hard part

332
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
that I always had issues with.

333
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
And I lost it the whole time

334
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
because I can't figure that one part out.

335
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:37,040
But, you know, fuck you to all of the seven star songs. I'm gonna pass one of you. One day. One day I will, I promise. One day my prince will come.

336
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Is that a promise?

337
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Yes. That's what I promise as a threat. Oh, I mean, not a promise.

338
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Max, chat room, any FUs?

339
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,040
The chat room has a ton of FUs right now, so I'm going to get some of those.

340
00:23:50,040 --> 00:24:01,040
But first off, I have to state that actually, our resident comedian in the chat room, PyroMan, is back, and he suggested how you can get a sticky controller.

341
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Just the secret rendezvous video and four hours on Kazop.

342
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Alright, let's get to the FUs from the chat room, shall we?

343
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:18,640
Wait, hold on. This isn't fair. They get a cool song, and I get the T-bug.

344
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,960
Sorry. Life sucks.

345
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,960
No.

346
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,760
SoCalKick says, Fuck you, everyone who is bitching, because for me life has never been

347
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,320
better. And fuck you, everyone who is calling him Fox version 2.0 because his latest picture

348
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,880
makes him look like Fox, even though I rather laugh at the situation and go along with it.

349
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,800
Whatever that means. I think that was a half-insight joke.

350
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,040
JB says, F you to SyFam for being so cheap they can't properly advertise their artists

351
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
like Jennie Rom.

352
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,920
He's such a Jennie Rom porn.

353
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,940
Well, you saw what his new title is on SyFamani?

354
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
What is that?

355
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,940
Drilling Jennie Rom fanboy.

356
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,020
DJ Konami wants to give an F you to the assholes that don't take it seriously when I'm teaching

357
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
them how to play Beatmania.

358
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
Hi, I am DJ Konami.

359
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
You know what?

360
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,360
During our first break we should play that for him.

361
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Maybe we will.

362
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Let's give you your pops.

363
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
Maybe we will.

364
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Oh my god, this is a huge one.

365
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,120
Oh, he sent it three times.

366
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
One is enough.

367
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Don't worry.

368
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,080
23rd Magus wants to give a big F you to Absolutetrick because it caused him much embarrassment

369
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,520
when he failed it on the Max 2 on Wednesday.

370
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Fuck you Absolut.

371
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,040
I also want to say fuck you to Earthlink for screwing with their FTP servers for my site.

372
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,080
And he wants to know if that was fuck instead of fuck.

373
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,080
It was a spelling thing, anyway.

374
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
More F-

375
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Oh, Bradley's here. Hey, what's up, Bradley?

376
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,080
My power went out, so I had to come over here.

377
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,080
You couldn't hear the show at your own house? You had to come over here?

378
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Yeah.

379
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Oh, right on.

380
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,080
There's nothing to do in my apartment without power, so...

381
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
So you want to give a big F you to power?

382
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
I'll get that.

383
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
Fuck your power.

384
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Twin has not only-

385
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Oh my god, he's got a bunch.

386
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
He's got six. Here we go.

387
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,640
F you number one Japan played every other fucking song on fifth mix. That's a few number one

388
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,680
That's a region been if you number two feet of fury beta being pushed back nearly half a month

389
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,160
If you number three a I am for always crapping out if you number four

390
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,960
No one appreciating his mixes all if you number five can't view anything while listening to orange lounge

391
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,860
If you number six people dissing me for not passing into the century maniac with a B

392
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Which mix it depends

393
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:35,560

394
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,820
and waiting on black waiting on black lives if you haven't gotten yet and uh...

395
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,120

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,220
yes those are part of the week correct

430
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,080
hi i was given some more news on uh...

431
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,200
these are

432
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,280
was pictures right now that's the thought though those are all the past

433
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,920
Yeah, that was relating to SoCalCakesPost.

434
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,440
I'd have to say yes, sort of.

435
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,840
We'll look at that during break.

436
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,080
And he did want to point out also,

437
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,640
we have some follow-up on DDR Max USA stuff.

438
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,200
Let's see, from the E3 beta version,

439
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,240
DDR Max USA was announced a new half speed

440
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
would be in the list of modes.

441
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Right now, his absence from the first November issue demo

442
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,120
of Official PlayStation Magazine is

443
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,720
rumored that it was removed for the final version because

444
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,880
of technical difficulties.

445
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,520
The foot rankings confirmed here on socalkicks.com.

446
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,840
People began to worry about that too because it was also absent from the demo, but I can

447
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,200
tell you right now it is one of the last things that's going to be put into the game.

448
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,660
They first have to make all the step charts for all the modes, remember there's doubles

449
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,680
to do as well, and they have to get those done before giving the songs foot rankings.

450
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,380
And also there's two rumors, so we're going to spread dirty rumors around right now, that

451
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,220
The song list was increased by 15 songs, making the total list 80 songs.

452
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,820
And also, rumor that a challenge will make it into DDR Max USA, similar to an Oni mode

453
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,140
perhaps.

454
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,000
So take that all with a grain of salt, it's still Rumor, Rumor, Rumorville.

455
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,940
So that's it.

456
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,260
Yay, and there you have it.

457
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
There you have it.

458
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,260
Now you know.

459
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,260
And now you know.

460
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
And knowing is half the battle.

461
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:32,500
We are going to take a quick break and we will come right back.

462
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,300
I've been requested to play the DJ Konami thing, which I'm going to have to dig up and find.

463
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,780
We'll get to that pretty soon.

464
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,660
We're going to start off with one of my favorite songs from Max 2.

465
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,180
How's that sound?

466
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,180
winner

467
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,540
Dealing, I will always young

468
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Drifting away

469
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,540
I'm flying, I'm gonna head for paradise

470
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,540
Nothing to say

471
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,540
I'm climbing, I wanna see my future rise

472
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:25,100
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!

473
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,100
I know you all know BeatMania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

474
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Listen carefully and try to follow.

475
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,100
The objects will come down from the top.

476
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,100
When it hits the red line, push the button.

477
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,100
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

478
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,100
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

479
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,100
First, hit the white keys.

480
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Now hit the black key.

481
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
Yeah.

482
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
Yeah.

483
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Yeah.

484
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Okay, now a combination of both white and black key.

485
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Yeah.

486
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Yeah.

487
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Yeah.

488
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,100
Yeah.

489
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
Yeah.

490
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
Yeah.

491
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Yeah.

492
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,100
Yeah.

493
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Yeah.

494
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
Yeah.

495
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Yeah.

496
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Don't drop it.

497
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,600
It's gonna be a little weird.

498
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
No reason why you're feeling weird.

499
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
You better think back if you think back.

500
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Easy, huh?

501
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,100
All right.

502
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,600
Let's go on to the scratch game.

503
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,600
When the objects reach the red line, scratch!

504
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
And if you do, don't play it.

505
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,100
If you don't play it, you better.

506
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,100
With a fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.

507
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,100
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

508
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
It's hard, but you can do it!

509
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Okay, effector time!

510
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

511
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Look way below, do you see the foot switch?

512
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,100
That's the effect on and on switch.

513
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,100
To this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

514
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,100
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

515
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,100
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

516
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:50,100
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

517
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,100
This powerful sound system is moving everybody hot!

518
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Alright! Gotta go! Do not rule out your fabulous sound!

519
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,100
On this very good version of the TV Mania!

520
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,100
We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.

521
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,580
?)

522
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:39,020
We think we figured it out.

523
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,200
Orange Lounge Radio.

524
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,620
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 14.

525
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,580
That's an old promo.

526
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,920
I'm starting to play the old promos again, because it's been a while, it's been a while,

527
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,840
so they're fresh again.

528
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,480
It's like a fine wine, you let them age a little bit.

529
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,540
We want to also talk about another new Bimani game that just hit, I believe it is official

530
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:08,520
as of Monday, 2DX8 style is out and about, and unfortunately, and somebody, I accidentally

531
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,020
closed the window, they sent it in a little too late, but Konami wanted to give an F.U.

532
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,500
to Konami because they still haven't updated their official website with any information,

533
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,300
even though the game is supposedly out now. As of Monday, the game was released.

534
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,260
It took them a while to do that with Southern Style too, though.

535
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:30,900
Yeah. Luckily, BomaniStyle.com has a little bit of information on 2DX8 style, which includes

536
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,300
some of the song lists. If I can pull that up here real fast.

537
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:47,300
We've got a bunch of the songs that are released, and some of the non-stop choruses, which I

538
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,800
think is really interesting.

539
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,500
We have a Tran course, that's what I like, I think that's really cool.

540
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,700
There's a Tran course, which consists of Beautiful Days, Alien World, Starmind, G2, and Stoic.

541
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:04,400
Although I think G2 is a scary ass Tran video, in my opinion.

542
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,120
Some of the other non-stop course names that are interesting, Feel, DJ Taka of course,

543
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:15,920
Eurobeat, Super Eurobeat, Vocal Performance, Trance, VJ Hess, that's an interesting one,

544
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,880
Number 5, Newcomer, UG2, Rapid 2, Original, Cinderella, that's an interesting one.

545
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,400
Well that's all, look what that is, look what the songs are, Stick Around, Jelly Kiss, Glorious

546
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,480
Days, are those the Sona tracks?

547
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,640
No I don't think Glorious Days is a Sona song.

548
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:42,440
just kind of happy sounding songs. Piano, Tack, Hirata, Hell, of course, and Saturday

549
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,000
Night. That's a pretty cool chorus, Saturday Night. You got Dancing into the Night, Blowing

550
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,780
My Heart Away, Funky, Bingo, Paradise, Wow Wow, Seven Days, and Please Don't Go. There's

551
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,180
some very interesting genre names in 8th style, which has been getting a lot of laughs out

552
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,480
of people. There's one called Cuddlecore. The Murmur Twins is the name of the song,

553
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,480
Metal House by Sunglasses of Night

554
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
being sung by women.

555
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Oh.

556
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
That's a pretty good one.

557
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,520
Though I did notice that there were a good number that were sauna tracks.

558
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,480
Well sauna would be a female, last time I checked.

559
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,000
You just need to do the sauna course.

560
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,120
Sauna course would be cool.

561
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,640
But unfortunately we don't know much else about 8th Style, we're still waiting to see

562
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,740
if any arcades in the U.S. are going to be getting it.

563
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,360
We know of one that ordered it.

564
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,680
Seven buttons on a turntable and effectors.

565
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,280
Yes, 8th Style will have seven buttons and a turntable.

566
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,780
14 and 2 turntables and it's this little hole that you put your coin in and a big plasma

567
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,520
screen if you're getting a brand new one like we are, well Scandia anyway.

568
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,840
Yeah let's see, what are they saying in chat room?

569
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Some people know more, a few arcades are ordering it, well which ones, don't just tell me a

570
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,560
few tell me which arcades, it's not like that many arcades even have 2DX to begin with.

571
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,360
We happen to know locally where we base Orange Lounge out of in Sacramento that there's an

572
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,120
arcade scandia supposed to be getting eight style they have ordered it we've

573
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,000
seen the invoice so we know apparently there's a few on the East Coast they're

574
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,560
actually going to be picking it up we assume arcade infinity would get it I

575
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,800
wouldn't see why not maybe Sunnyvale Golf Land who knows I think the SVGL is

576
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,340
supposed to have theirs very soon black lab quotes a famous Beck song to

577
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:57,200
turntables and a microphone that would be cracking DJ well was there a

578
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,920
microphone. There's not a microphone in Kraken DJ. Kraken DJ is a cool game. I don't know

579
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,260
why they don't have more of it in places. Kraken DJ, for those who have never played

580
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:11,160
it, it's two turntables and they kind of automatically spin like a real turntable would as you're

581
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,760
playing the game and it's all scratching. There's no buttons at all. You just scratch.

582
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,200
There's a switch in the center. Yeah, there's a switch in the center because you have to

583
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,080
scratch one turntable and you scratch the other one and you have to move it back and

584
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,480
4 or 3 have to blend between the two, so it'll be interesting.

585
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,320
It's just a pretty difficult game.

586
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,520
I think that 2DX is easier than Kraken DJ, by far.

587
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,480
Yeah, I think it's easier too, but I don't know.

588
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,000
I find Kraken DJ fun.

589
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I think it's just the concept of Kraken DJ is a little hard

590
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,720
to grasp at first.

591
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,220
It's weird.

592
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,000
It's different.

593
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,520
The layout is very different.

594
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,680
But isn't it by Sega, if I'm not mistaken?

595
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,080
Yes.

596
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,880
We need to see a home release of that then, I think.

597
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,520
That'll be fun.

598
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,640
But the controller would cost like a million dollars.

599
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,760
I wouldn't be more than 100.

600
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,960
DJ Konami says that San Jose State is also supposed to be getting an 8th mix, so we'll

601
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
see.

602
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
Or 8th style, sorry.

603
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,720
I think they're upgrading the 6th.

604
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,560
I also heard a rumor that BeatMania 7th mix is finally coming out for PS1 on Christmas

605
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,400
Eve is the tentative release date.

606
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
So we'll see.

607
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
It's about freaking time.

608
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,360
Time to get ordering.

609
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,800
So go place your pre-orders for that on your favorite import game site.

610
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,720
But do not buy from BuyRight.

611
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,080
When you're buying at BuyRight, you're buying wrong.

612
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
They will cheat you.

613
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,520
Can I do another Fuck You of the Week?

614
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Sure, go ahead.

615
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,920
I'm not going to cue the music because I'm lazy.

616
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,020
Well, it's an old Fuck You, but my reason's first thing, don't buy at BuyRight.

617
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,880
When I bought my Tekken 4 there, I was expecting to get a Japanese copy so I could have a chance

618
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,120
at reading the manual.

619
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,760
They sent me the Asian release and then wouldn't replace it, and they said, oh, you didn't

620
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
say it was Japanese.

621
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,880
We just said it was import.

622
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,540
I could have bought that at YesAsia.com for about $30 cheaper.

623
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
So BuyRight will cheat you.

624
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,940
They will cheat you.

625
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,620
So don't buy there.

626
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,020
Pyroman said that he held an employee at gunpoint and now Nickelodeon City in Illinois will

627
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:07,420
be getting 8th style, which we all know is probably a load of crap, but it's funny.

628
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,840
Let's change gears a little bit here.

629
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,380
This is a story I want to, unless you guys have anything you want to say about 8th style.

630
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:20,620
I can't play 7 key, let alone 5 key, and all that stuff, so F you to 8 style for being

631
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,060
so damn hard.

632
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,060
There we go.

633
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,060
Practice!

634
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,720
Also, I'd like to point that guy that you just flashed the picture up on the screen

635
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
is very ugly.

636
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,420
We'll get to that in a little bit.

637
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,420
You're a 2DX player, Bradley.

638
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,300
What do you think of 8th style so far?

639
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,300
Looks cool.

640
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,700
I've listened to much of the music so far, but...

641
00:42:41,700 --> 00:43:08,260
Do you think it's going to be the biggest 2DX style ever?

642
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,820
As if the show wasn't already on its way to a train wreck.

643
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:17,400
We're going to talk about, this is interesting, twingalaxies.com, this is a link that was

644
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,020
sent to me at the end of last week's show, I forget who sent it to me, I'm sorry, whoever

645
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,060
sent it to me, just go ahead and give yourself an ego boost in the chat room and thanks.

646
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,980
Twingalaxies.com, the worldwide authority on player rankings, game statistics, and championship

647
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,980
tournaments.

648
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:39,260
Oh, I'm supposed to mention the extra stage for 8th style is a revenge song.

649
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:48,540
They have an article now that the Dance Dance Revolution world record has been set and this

650
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,260
was on July 9th, 2002.

651
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,420
And Loki, this guy that you were saying was very ugly in the picture, that's your world

652
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,700
record holder right here.

653
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,620
So I thought I would read this article for you guys because I think you'll find it interesting

654
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
because we sure did.

655
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,780
On one note, I am pulling my microphone away so that I don't laugh.

656
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,780
Okay, yes.

657
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,780
Please do.

658
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
No, we want to hear your laughter.

659
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:30,420
One of the hottest new series of modern arcade titles to play is the Dance Dance Revolution

660
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,040
series by Konami, with the most current and popular release officially known as DDR Max

661
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,480
2, which in effect is the seventh mix in the series.

662
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,060
For those unfamiliar with the game, players select different songs and become physically

663
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,840
engaged in the game itself.

664
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,760
It makes it sound like the last stage of Nick Arcade when they were swatting flies on the

665
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,760
blue screen.

666
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,120
Judging by the look of this ugly person, he hasn't been engaged in this game very long.

667
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,000
Maybe it's to have an engagement he can get physically.

668
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,840
He'll never get engaged to a girl, but anyway, dancing literally in order to hit the specific

669
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,760
arrow directions on the floor pad with their feet.

670
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,760
This is a game you play with your feet.

671
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,520
This title, along with others such as mocap boxing and police 911, are part of the latest

672
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,760
trend in modern video gaming, physically interactive game play.

673
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,920
Hey, and they are all kamami games, who's our innovator here?

674
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,560
Now they left out Boonga Boonga Revolution, what's up with that?

675
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,920
A boonga!

676
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Boop!

677
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
Anyway.

678
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,920
If they released it in America, they'd just have to call it, you know, Proctology Major.

679
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,920
Or whatever.

680
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
Fingers go up the hole.

681
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Anyway.

682
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Boonga Boonga always gets a laugh on this show.

683
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,920
Back to the article.

684
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,920
We can talk about that until the cows come home.

685
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Moo.

686
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
Making sure.

687
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Okay, I just...

688
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,920
So, back to our article.

689
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,920
Sorry.

690
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,920
Back to the article, yes.

691
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Twin Galaxy.

692
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,440
Twin Galaxy's chief referee, Robert T., I can't say your last name, proclaims gamer

693
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,120
Damien Sarcuni as our first verified and recognized world champion at the DDR Max 2 title with

694
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:14,400
a 5 score song total of 315,802,020 points.

695
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,720
I'm sorry, I can't...

696
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
Why is that funny?

697
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,440
Because I'm top that on standard songs.

698
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,680
This is the thing, if I recall correctly, if you play a 9 foot song, the max score you'll

699
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:36,960
get on a Max 2 is 90 million, correct? Multiply that by 5, that's 450 million. So even if

700
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,760
you fucked up your 5 9-footers completely, you should have a score of at least 400 million

701
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:51,660
points, correct? This guy has the world record with a score of 315 million. That's like four

702
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,960
seven-footers and a six.

703
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,960
Yes.

704
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:00,360
Hell, I could play freakin' Dynamite Raid Basic on stealth five times and still beat

705
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,860
that damn score.

706
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,800
The sirens are going outside.

707
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,480
The world thinks this is madness.

708
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,520
The world record is 315 million.

709
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:17,180
Held by the official Twin Galaxies tournament settings have already been determined for

710
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,960
this title and appear later in this breaking news story, which we'll read.

711
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,300
But before we get into that, let's recap the experience.

712
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,160
The game's record capabilities are unusual in that the scores are not permanently kept

713
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,720
in the game's memory as far as points are concerned.

714
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,880
Well, if you have a memory card, it'll save it to the memory card.

715
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,120
Also, I should mention that one of the rules for entering this world record is you have

716
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,600
to be fucking ugly.

717
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,440
The scores are too safe.

718
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
Matt, go!

719
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Go do it!

720
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,320
The scores are safe if you've got your initials in the machine that has your score beside

721
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,480
it when it pops up on the screen. While his score was world record breaking it wasn't

722
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,920
good enough to place on the top ten. SoCalKicks is going right now, he says he's going running

723
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,540
out with a camera, he's going to take a picture of that. SoCalKicks, you can't do it, you're

724
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,160
not ugly, you're Fox 2.0, remember, you can't do it. And besides that you still owe me that

725
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,680
screen capture so you can get my GameCube in. So sit your ass down. We're going to be

726
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,740
in trouble for that one. Let's see, further machines set to five song attempts use only

727
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:22,320
the sum of the last three songs for the record. To be fair, I'm authorizing two different

728
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:27,440
records to be tracked separately, one for three song and one for five song submissions.

729
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:33,360
Most machines are set to a minute thirty to two minutes per song. I didn't think time

730
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:39,480
ever had anything to do with it, but whatever. Let's see. Further, there are several rest

731
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,840
periods in between songs based on the actions you must do for the setting and song selection.

732
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,540
I have included my ruling on this with the TGTS information below.

733
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,140
So Twin Galaxy, a little bit of Judge Judy action here.

734
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,140
They're making a ruling.

735
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,440
Who's making them an authority on what DDR is?

736
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,720
They have already gotten a lot of their...

737
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,040
Because these guys have been around since the 80s, so they're old and sad.

738
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,360
They've gotten their information so freaking wrong.

739
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,260
I mean, it's sad.

740
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,080
They have no concept of how a DDR machine works.

741
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,080
How can they be considered an authority on something?

742
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:18,280
Let me restate, since 1981, the worldwide authority on player rankings, gaming statistics,

743
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
and championship tournaments.

744
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,840
They must be, you know, they're pretty good at that for me to poop on.

745
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:29,640
I mean, you can't be an authority on something that you apparently know nothing about.

746
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,240
Let's see, uh, let's keep going here, I gotta finish this.

747
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:39,640
Speaking with Damien, as well as fellow DDR fan and Crazy Taxi world champion, JC Padilla,

748
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,720
Those Crazy Taxi and DDR have so fucking much in common.

749
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,960
Because you use your feet on a button.

750
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,600
Because they both are utilized by ugly people in play.

751
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,880
And also some other local expert players.

752
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,240
Yep, but you'll never be the world champion because you're not ugly like that.

753
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,880
I would love to know who the other local expert players were.

754
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,240
We picked up these random eight year olds from the kindergarten room and we reasoned

755
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,320
We reasoned out the rules and you will see below in their entirety and hope to start locking some more scores on it soon

756
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:22,780
One of the most important discoveries is the decision that gamers view using the same song up to five times in a row is cheesy

757
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,120
So to be fair my official ruling takes us into consideration. So if you play five songs in a row, that's cheesy

758
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,160
Chat room is going off on this by the way, I'll get to them in a minute

759
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,920
The game itself is pretty intense

760
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,120
Wow, that was intense!

761
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,640
And some players even brought their own combination water spray and fan handheld device to cool

762
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,040
down in between performances.

763
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,720
Did they buy a Walmart for $2?

764
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:56,840
Along with a Goofy drinking hat filled with SOBY!

765
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,240
An elaborate entourage of people with fans.

766
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,320
I'm picturing one of these fucking dorks wearing those hats with a straw that goes right in

767
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:11,420
mouth a little thing they can squeeze when they're in between songs.

768
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,060
I wonder if this guy did it playing like Dynamite Rave.

769
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,060
Love to me.

770
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,580
That would be funny.

771
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:22,140
I are Dynamite Rave-er world champion, yeah.

772
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:26,560
Though quite the physical game, I am told that players of all ages, shapes, and sizes

773
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,220
have been able to perform well.

774
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,380
Even one player who I am told was in the 300 pound range.

775
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,380
It should also be noted that facial deformities do not affect gameplay at all.

776
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,380
So DDR doesn't discriminate against fat people. That's good to know.

777
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:42,380
Definitely a game where both eye and foot coordination is required.

778
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,380
Well, duh!

779
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,380
So now here are the rules.

780
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:59,380
And I would officially like to thank Damien Sarcuni for not only taking the initiative and becoming our first recognized and verified world champion, but to assist me with creating the rules.

781
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:05,380
So, basically, he made the rules and he's the world champion.

782
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,380
Okay.

783
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,380
Alrighty.

784
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:13,380
Is this like one of the editor's kids or something?

785
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,820
Anyway, the rules.

786
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,820
You want to read the rules, Jamie?

787
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,820
Go for it.

788
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,820
General rules.

789
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:23,220
First, player must be performing in single mode.

790
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,780
So no doubles.

791
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:30,180
Players can compete on either 3-song or 5-song machine setting variations, which is determined

792
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,180
by the arcade proprietor.

793
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:35,420
Now, if I'm not mistaken, there's also a 4-song machine, so those people are just fucked,

794
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,420
huh?

795
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,420
Yep.

796
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,420
All right.

797
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,020
Referees must log the song difficulty and score per song for all 3 or 5 songs.

798
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,340
The referee, do they wear the black and white shirt too and make bad calls?

799
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,380
They walk around playing, you know, blow my whistle, bitch, with their little whistles

800
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,380
there.

801
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,380
Battle, dammit!

802
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,380
Force.

803
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,380
Okay.

804
00:52:52,380 --> 00:53:05,380
Okay. Players are allowed to utilize the entire duration of the game timers in between songs as rest. This includes song selection and setting selection. Okay, yay, whatever.

805
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,380
Fifth.

806
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,380
Players are allowed to utilize the same song no more than twice.

807
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,380
Oh, so they can play the same song twice, they just can't play it more than twice.

808
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,380
Regardless of whether playing three songs or five songs.

809
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,380
Oh my god, I'm gonna cry. These people make me cry.

810
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,380
At this time...

811
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:27,380
Twin Galaxies. Twin Galaxies will not be tracking records on the ONI, AKA hell.

812
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:33,380
First of all, that's incorrect. ONI means ogre. Anyway, hell mode, assuming I spelled that right.

813
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:39,380
Okay, they're stupid. How can you misspell ONI? O-N-I. You can't misspell it. God.

814
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:45,380
First of all, they mistranslated the damn thing. ONI does not mean hell. Okay?

815
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,380
You know, hell is what, Jigoku? Aren't I correct?

816
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,380
Um, yeah, how does Jigoku sound like Oni?

817
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,380
Tell me.

818
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,380
That's one of my pet peeves there.

819
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,380
Keep going, girl. You go, girl. Go on with your bad self.

820
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:06,380
All songs contained within the mix are eligible for selection. I would hope so.

821
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,380
Which means dynamite rave! Love to me! Twice, yay!

822
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:23,380
The following rules are applicable for each of the three song or five song selections. Only one of the settings, difficulty, can be the player's choice. The rest are determined to be the official T, G, G, and F.

823
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,380
Twin Galaxies scoreboard.

824
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:34,380
Difficulty player can choose between light, standard, and heavy. Speed has to be on one. Easiest? My butt! 1.5 is easier than one.

825
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:39,380
Wait a minute! They said speed has to be set to the easiest, which is one. I disagree with that. My God!

826
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,380
Retards! Retards! I hate you.

827
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:46,380
If they say easiest, then I can play it on 1.5, because that's the easiest.

828
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:54,380
Boost set to off, appearance set to invisible, turn set to off, others set to off, scroll set to standards.

829
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,380
They don't say anything at all about free zeros.

830
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,380
So you can't do dark reverse, Jamie? Sorry.

831
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,380
No dark reverse!

832
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:07,380
So why didn't they just say no modifiers since that's pretty much what they're saying here except for difficulty. No modifiers. That's it.

833
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,380
Because there's no modifiers. That's it.

834
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:15,380
This is going to get beautiful. Keep going. Keep going, Jamie. It only gets better from here, folks. Keep going.

835
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:25,380
The following rules apply to the scoring of the title. The Twin Galaxies referee must log for tracking purposes the song selection difficulty chosen and final tally for each of the three or five songs.

836
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,380
songs.

837
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:31,020
At the very end, the TWG referee must manually tally the five-song total.

838
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:36,340
The three-song machines tally for you at the final score screen.

839
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,980
Note that the sum of the last three songs in the five-song selection are not simultaneously

840
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,700
tracked as the three-song record.

841
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:47,500
It is understood that as the five-song machines do not display the sum tally of all five songs

842
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:54,060
at the end, that the discretion and integrity of the TG referee is accepted for such submissions.

843
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,900
song titles are listed in foreign wording for example a song called

844
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,220
okay what the hell is wrong with them

845
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:05,900
they put this, there's a song called Kamumei

846
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,940
okay the song is fucking kakumei it means revolution

847
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,700
okay first of all but you're allowed to play kamumi

848
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,560
you're allowed to play kamumi

849
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,440
okay you want to know what i'm going to do tonight except that i have work

850
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,280
tomorrow yes i got a job anyway

851
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:27,280
I'm going to be drafting a letter to these stupid fucks.

852
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,580
And I'm going to... In the chat room right now, they're all going,

853
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:34,300
rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble.

854
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,060
Okay, these people are idiots.

855
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,300
I'm going to be drafting a letter.

856
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,180
Going item by item.

857
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,660
Why they are wrong.

858
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,740
Black Lab suggested the same thing.

859
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,400
He's with you on that.

860
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
You need to get a mob together.

861
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,400
What if we draft up the, you know, we get a few people...

862
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
I'm talking, give me a speaker and a microphone.

863
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,400
We get the people together, we draft a letter, have all of us who were agreed with this sign it,

864
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,400
and send it in to them to let them know exactly how stupid they are.

865
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:08,400
By the way, if you all take screenshots of us playing the game and all beating that score for you.

866
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
We have a digital camera.

867
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:16,400
Well, we got to keep going here because they have their specific rules submissions here.

868
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,700
I might just post about this later, so we're going to keep going with this.

869
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:46,040
It is the player's responsibility to inform the GG referee what the recognized name of such songs are for

870
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:54,040
Unfortunately, yeah, I believe we did post this in the chatroom, but if they don't, I did say it was on twingalaxies.com, but if they want to see this article for themselves, there it is.

871
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,040
I just posted a link in the chatroom.

872
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:02,040
Uh, yeah, we gotta crank all the shit out of it. No, I'm kidding, don't crank call. Be professional, everybody, be professional.

873
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:08,040
Uh, I believe I was reading now, it wasn't on this page, I thought it was on this page, but I guess it's not.

874
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:13,040
You can videotape it. You can't take pictures, because those could be altered, but you can videotape it.

875
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,040
So all we gotta do is get a camera and we can videotape the whole thing.

876
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:21,040
I would be willing to go out there with a camera and tape one, both of you guys breaking the record. That's fine.

877
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,040
And everybody in the chat room is already wanting to go do it too, so they might beat us to it.

878
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:30,040
But we, if you guys want to be lazy, you don't want to bother with this, we're gonna do it.

879
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:37,040
This week, watch this. Dark Sakura, Loki, and Sky all smash the world record.

880
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,840
and submit our videotape. You in on this too, Bradley?

881
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,120
I don't know if I'm that good.

882
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,600
Bradley, a five-year-old is that good. You're that good, trust me.

883
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,480
Let me just add, I couldn't PA to save my life,

884
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,120
so this ought to be interesting. If I beat this, this guy really sucks.

885
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,120
So not only will you be seeing us all smashing the world record,

886
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,760
but we'll be submitting an open letter, and we'll post about that on our website

887
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,900
this week sometime. We'll post where you can also add your name to the letter or something.

888
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,900
We'll figure something else.

889
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:19,280
And if I could send them like the link to the Konami's seventh, seventh mixed up, ranking

890
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
page.

891
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,280
Ah.

892
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,280
Internet ranking.

893
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Like hundreds, probably hundreds of people have already beaten that score.

894
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,880
A zillion people have beaten that score.

895
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,800
We should probably go ahead and get that pulled up, but go ahead.

896
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,800
You're going to pull up what?

897
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,800
Internet ranking.

898
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,800
What's how you're pulling up?

899
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,800
Internet ranking.

900
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:45,800
Here, yeah, yeah, let me do that. Actually, I wanted to check some of these private messages real fast because there's some things going on here. Okay, nothing new there.

901
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:51,800
And it says that playing it on one speed, you know, that's standard. How is that hard? You know, how is that hard?

902
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,600
I believe

903
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,040
SoCalKicks was already submitting a score of Bastion at a score of C.

904
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,360
No, that's only a hundred eighty five million for what I see. That wouldn't do it, but

905
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,680
that's only D.

906
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,880
See, that's Max. That's a problem.

907
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,680
Max 2 and Max grade differently, so you're not going to be able to get a score on Max

908
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,120
that beats it because they grade completely differently.

909
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,400
But he just wants to show off that he's elite, so there you go.

910
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,400
yeah i don't know if you're in japan dot com has some great stuff too

911
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,980
secrets

912
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,760
so-called kicks to show off his send me all these pictures one show off that he's

913
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,060
lee

914
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:34,680
uh... no you can't call into the show we don't have phone sorry uh...

915
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,760
black lab wants to break the record to black lab come with us

916
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,100
your your local you come with us and break the record with us

917
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,180
so we're all going to uh... break the world record of the latest ddr players

918
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,140
in history history

919
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:51,940
okay black lives like when and where

920
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,940
as if i had a video camera in this house i would go

921
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,260
out to scandia tonight after the show

922
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,940
because they don't close till ten week we'd be able to make it out there but

923
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,220
unfortunately have to do this tomorrow or or sometime during the week

924
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,060
and uh... figure that out

925
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,780
uh... twenty-third maggots wants to point out a hedgehog sleeping in a wet

926
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,660
paper bag beat that score

927
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,300
so we will we want to pull up a seven mixin ranking

928
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,460
the only problem with internet ranking if i remember right it uh...

929
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,900
tracks the percentages, right?

930
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,660
Not the actual scores?

931
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:19,940
I don't know.

932
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,860
Let's see.

933
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,100
Oh, it is scores.

934
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:26,540
There's the ones that were just the average non-OD internet

935
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,900
ranking.

936
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,220
Let's see, I have to find Max2.

937
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,140
There it is.

938
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:35,180
Let's see, here's the Max2 site, and now I'm

939
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,260
looking for internet ranking.

940
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,620
Help me read some Japanese here.

941
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,420
There it is.

942
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,260
Here we go.

943
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,540
Max internet ranking ranking.

944
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,660
we're going to find out the real world champion here

945
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,220
uh... let's see what

946
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,440
do we vote up for one of these one of the separate people

947
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,660
what just anyone of these are what

948
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,560
or they don't have scores

949
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,100
well they don't have the charts anymore that's the problem

950
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,400
uh... well

951
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,460
shit on konami

952
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,920
shit on konami for not having a score so well

953
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,820
but trust me they were much better than that

954
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,000
we guarantee it

955
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,620
maybe oh maybe i can get it from up here

956
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,700
uh... don't do it

957
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,340
looked at these down those yet okay let's see

958
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,660
well there we go

959
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,420
on uh... one of these

960
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,900
let's see a hundred thirty nine million five hundred seventy six four nine five

961
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,780
knots i had to be songs are hard enough i've ever go down like number fifteen

962
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,860
okay here's a documented score right here four hundred and one million eight

963
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,100
hundred forty five thousand three hundred twenty five

964
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,500
that already puts out of the sport of shame so

965
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,900
uh... there's like

966
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,900
All these other scores, look at that, they're all higher.

967
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:45,900
And these, this is a certain set of songs, they're probably not even at all nine footers.

968
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,900
And actually, those are probably just three songs.

969
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,900
No, actually that's including the extra stages.

970
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,900
Oh, including the extra stages this way.

971
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,900
And Kakame.

972
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,900
Wow. Well, poo on twin galaxies.

973
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,900
We're going to take a real quick break, but this break is going to be special.

974
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:09,600
special. We're going to play some original works during this break. Loki has a new one

975
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,800
he's going to play for us, so we're going to get that in. And I wanted to get a new

976
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,480
artist in who hasn't been featured on this show yet. I just have to pull up a song here.

977
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:23,640
This is Takeout Kid, and he's got a song called, it looks like Donkey Kong Remix is the name

978
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,840
of it. Perhaps he'll elaborate on that in the chat room. He's in there right now. And

979
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,760
we're going to play that creation by him. And then we're going to, I wanted to plug

980
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:40,760
his website

981
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,760
So we're going to do some originals this break.

982
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,280
And when we come back, more talk, inventing, and the

983
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,760
typical kind of anger you'd expect from

984
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Orange Lounge Radio.

985
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,760
Oh

986
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,760
The

987
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,760
The

988
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,760
The

989
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,760
The

990
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,760
The

991
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,760
The

992
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,760
The

993
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,760
Oh

994
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:40,640
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

995
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,640
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Ron, and Jessica

996

under sedation live dot org

998
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,640
Hope we'll be together

999
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,640
Now you know that I love you

1000
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,640
Love you, love you, love you, love you

1001
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,640
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

1002
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,640
Not a little bit of you to see

1003
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,640
The cow has been made up of two foots, you

1004
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,640
But not a little bit of me to see

1005
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,640
Baby, know you gotta try a little bit harder

1006
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,640
So you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

1007
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,140
It's nice, a little slight, let's enjoy the moment now

1008
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:00,140
And just have a good time, a good time

1009
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,640
Try it, baby, good, just a little bit of love

1010
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,640
And gonna feel so fine

1011
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,640
Is it really true that you feel the same way too?

1012
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:12,140
And hope we'll be together now

1013
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,140
You know that I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

1014
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:52,620
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1015
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:58,620
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 14, and we've been going off on twingalaxies.com

1016
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:03,220
in their completely made of ass ranking system for Max 2.

1017
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:05,220
There is one word, two syllables.

1018
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:06,220
Yes.

1019
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:07,220
Innane.

1020
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:10,140
And we're all on a rampage to go beat that sometime this week.

1021
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:14,660
Black Lab and Dark Tetsuya over the break, by the way, have also joined in on our campaign.

1022
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:18,060
We are all going to go and smash the world record this week sometime.

1023
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,820
And we're not doing it to be mean, we're just, well, yeah, we're doing it to be mean.

1024
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:26,420
I mean, I don't know, we're doing it to make a point.

1025
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:32,240
I mean, my God, that's like saying, you know, I'm the best kid on the planet because my

1026
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,140
mommy loves me best.

1027
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,660
Honestly, it's like, what's going on?

1028
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:39,200
Anyway, yeah.

1029
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,540
Follow up to last week.

1030
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:51,460
Last week we were going off about Naoki's diary, and all sorts of fun dear diaries were

1031
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,020
submitted by the chatroom.

1032
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,020
What the hell?

1033
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,020
Let's take some more.

1034
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,820
If you guys in the chatroom have more diaries, it's been a week, if you have some more

1035
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:03,780
diary entries, if you think Naoki has some more diary things that he's written, that

1036
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:07,200
he's maybe just not sharing with us, give us some diary entries.

1037
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,300
Submit them to us in the chatroom.

1038
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:13,140
First up, send me a PM, your best Naoki diary entry, and we'll read some more tonight.

1039
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,940
Rob, I don't think that they can see that you're waving your hand, you know, it's like

1040
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:20,820
come on, wave of hand, bringing towards me.

1041
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:28,340
By the way, in defense of Rob, because I can read the kana in it, in Naoki's diary, it

1042
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:37,420
I did have Bemani spelled out with the Kana, B, the extending Kana, Ma, and Ni, so it's

1043
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,420
B-Mani.

1044
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:41,020
According to Naoki, it's B-Mani.

1045
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:45,300
B-Mani, radio program!

1046
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,340
So don't be a bee-itch about it.

1047
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:54,340
Alright, let's read what Naoki wrote this last week in his diary, shall we say?

1048
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:59,340
I've decided to let Paula Terry write the music, and I'm gonna sing!

1049
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,340
You could probably do a better job.

1050
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:07,340
Naoki's Diary. Time has- oh wait, we need some music, don't you think?

1051
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:11,340
Let's find some music. Let's find some good Naoki music.

1052
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:14,340
You think you want ever so- Journey to- let's do Journey to Wonderland.

1053
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,340
Let's make that be Naoki's Diary.

1054
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,340
It's not a Naoki song.

1055
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:26,100
But it's funny, and that's what's important.

1056
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,620
Time has gone.

1057
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:30,620
These days, music games are as common as dirt.

1058
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:35,860
But when DDR started in 1998, DDR seemed like the hardest thing in the world to work on.

1059
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:40,300
Even looking back on it today, I feel exhausted just to try to remember it.

1060
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,340
Now it feels like a sleeping memory deep in my heart.

1061
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,900
That's going to be the next Naoki-san, by the way.

1062
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:46,900
Deep in my heart.

1063
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,400
You know, there was still in my heart, still hurt.

1064
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,400
And, you know, deep and dive and whatever.

1065
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,400
Dive into the butt.

1066
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,900
When we began work on DDR, I started writing four pieces of music for the game.

1067
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,400
But as production advanced and the public waited for the release of DDR,

1068
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,900
only one of my songs, Paranoia, was included in the game,

1069
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:13,400
and a major collaboration was formed with the Mushiba EMI's Dance Mania compilation series

1070
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,900
in order to provide the rest of the music.

1071
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,900
Now, if I remember correctly, it wasn't brilliant to you in the first DDR?

1072
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,900
1.5

1073
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,900
Did he just forget? Oh, it's just 1.5?

1074
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,900
Uh, hello? What about Trip Machine? That's still him anyways.

1075
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:28,900
Oh, wait! He's not Desire.

1076
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,900
Not Desire.

1077
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:34,900
Whatever. Naoki's getting forgetfulness. He's getting old.

1078
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,900
He's got Alzheimer's.

1079
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:41,900
Technically, it wasn't the Naoki personality. It was the Desire personality that wrote that song.

1080
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,900
So obviously he wouldn't have recollection of that one.

1081
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:47,900
Let's see...

1082
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:53,900
The other songs were put on the shelf, and although I was the only person in the world to hear them, they didn't go to waste.

1083
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:59,900
The DDR Max 2 song, D2R, was based on some of the songs left out of the original DDR game.

1084
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:00,900
D2R!

1085
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:01,900
D2R!

1086
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,900
Ah!

1087
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:30,120
The end result is a song that felt very underground

1088
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,480
slash urban.

1089
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,200
These days my music is very different.

1090
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,720
The royal route, high energy dance songs such as Brilliant to You, Can't Stop Falling in

1091
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,920
Love, etc. are my new forte, and although I much prefer them, the underground style

1092
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:58,680
is a projection point in terms of my music.

1093
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:04,000
These days I still try to develop the underground style using the Revenge and Desire labels.

1094
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,920
Paranoia, Trip Machine, and Make It Better appeared in DDR Internet Ranking Kit 1.5 and

1095
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,520
with every maiden voyage, trial, error, and conflict always appeared from time to time.

1096
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,900
Although my music has moved on and evolved, I still look back on these three songs and

1097
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:24,920
realize that if they hadn't existed, much of my current music wouldn't be possible.

1098
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:29,520
In the grand scale of things, these songs are very important to me in my career, especially

1099
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:36,040
when I remember the pressure I was under when I produced them. With the songs completed

1100
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:41,720
and DDR only... Is that Taco Bell coming back up or something there, Jamie? With the songs

1101
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:50,440
completed and DDR only several months from release, I took a deep breath and prepared

1102
01:19:50,440 --> 01:20:00,640
to face the next challenge, DDR's second mix. Let's read some of the submitted things, shall

1103
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:09,040
we? That was it, that was it. Oh, it also revealed that the Max 3 song, there's going

1104
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:16,680
to be a B4U song called Graduation, hooray. Shock of shocks. Oh my God, B4U and Max 3,

1105
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,680
I was expecting that.

1106
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:26,680
Naoki himself, which I believe is just the 23rd Magus disguise, but we won't say anything.

1107
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:31,680
Naoki himself says, Dear Diary, my newest song is called Dynamite, Afro Nova, BD24,

1108
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:36,680
UR, Trip Machine, Deeper and Deeper, Eternal Rebirth, Evolution, KZ, Dirty Mix.

1109
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:41,680
Wow! I'll buy that for a dollar.

1110
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:46,480
says this dear diary I've made a kicking tune for the next DJ Konami tune he

1111
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:50,620

1122
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:42,160
SoCalKick submits a follow-up to last week.

1123
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:48,800
Dear Diary, my English, I would like to know what this blow is.

1124
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,120
And if you missed last week's show, you're just going to have to wait 11 weeks for it

1125
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,120
to turn up in the rebroadcast.

1126
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:57,520
Dear Naoki, to find out what the blow is, take your vacuum cleaner and stick it on your

1127
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,520
groin.

1128
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,520
Press the on button.

1129
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,520
She's gone.

1130
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,720
From suck to blow.

1131
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:08,720
Oh, I've been waiting for this one. Here's one from Pyro Man.

1132
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:12,720
Oh, Pyro, I expected so much better from you, but I'll read this anyway.

1133
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,720
Dear Diary, I hate my life and want to die.

1134
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,720
That's it. Dear Diary, I hate my life and want to die.

1135
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,720
Pyro, you're a funnier guy than that. Come on.

1136
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,720
You let me down, bud. Let me down.

1137
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:26,720
You spent too much time in the whambulance.

1138
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,720
Well, after he told me I still wanted it, I knew he would do a better job than Paula.

1139
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,720
Thank you, SirDungX.

1140
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:38,720
Dart Tetsuya says,

1141
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,720
Dear Diary, I'm having B4U remix Let Them Move for DDR Max 3.

1142
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,720
Then it would be even more out of tune?

1143
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:50,720
Just with more people singing it?

1144
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:54,720
How about a sim update, Loki? Do you want to talk about what's going on in the sim world?

1145
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,720
Yeah, actually quite a bit is going to be happening next week. We have the site opening again

1146
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,720
Team Gwylo, so they're going to be coming up on Tuesday, so everyone look for that on October 1st there.

1147
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:11,720
I don't know what the website's going to be, probably Team Gwylo, but I don't know yet, because they haven't really gotten a host name, so we'll have to wait for that.

1148
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:19,720
And then also I heard rumors that the melting pot's going to be coming back up in about a couple weeks too, so we'll have to watch for that.

1149
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:27,120
Other than that, still waiting for StepMania Beta-6, DWI, it's been quiet, so don't know

1150
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:33,520
anything coming out for that, don't really care, kind of abandoned them, and other than

1151
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:40,000
that, there is some major news, the tourney mix 2 is done, and we have results somewhere,

1152
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,920
we can pull them up, oh, I suppose I can do that.

1153
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,160
We had some locals win, I'm excited for them, we had two locals win, we need to get them

1154
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:55,160
on the show so they can brag.

1155
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:38,440
For

1156
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:44,440
The official placing was Clunk Clunk 1655 from Keyboard Mania.

1157
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,440
That was some of the Seattle folks that did that, I believe.

1158
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,440
I don't remember the exact name, so I just know they're on that board.

1159
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,440
Second place was Flying to Your Soul.

1160
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,440
I have no idea.

1161
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:59,440
Third place was The Great Giana Sisters, which was pretty good from what I played.

1162
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:05,440
Now, Public, this is what was actually voted on by the users themselves, not the judges.

1163
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:10,440
First place went to Soty Choir Remix, which was our agent Chang.

1164
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,440
Second place was Heaven.

1165
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:18,440
Third place was QQQ, and that was done by Moogle Hunter.

1166
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:19,440
Yay, local favorite.

1167
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,440
Congratulations for them.

1168
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,440
Standard, The Great Giana Sisters won for first.

1169
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,440
M, the fake 8th style song.

1170
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,440
The fake 8th style song won for second.

1171
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,440
And Klung Klung 1655 won for third.

1172
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,440
Congratulations to all the winners.

1173
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,440
Turning Mix 3 has been announced for December.

1174
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,440
They're going to be doing that.

1175
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,440
So rules and stuff will be coming out in November.

1176
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,440
So look at that.

1177
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,440
Congrats to you.

1178
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,440
Hold on. SoCalCakes had a...

1179
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,440
His diary entry got chopped up.

1180
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,440
That's why it didn't make much sense.

1181
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,440
So I'm going to pull up the rest of his diary entry.

1182
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,440
He sent it over.

1183
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,440
Ah!

1184
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,440
I opened up a picture of Jenny Rom.

1185
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,440
My bad.

1186
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,440
I was about to say, I'm scared.

1187
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,440
Let's see.

1188
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:10,440
Dear Diary, my hipster experimentation did not go as well as planned.

1189
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:14,860
Paula begged me not to go, saying she would give me this blow and that she could do a

1190
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:15,860
better job.

1191
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:19,500
But the way she said it, I don't even think that she knows what this blow is anyway.

1192
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,060
So I continued to go seek this white American who is going to give me the true form of this

1193
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,060
blow.

1194
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:28,200
Well, I quickly made it to Northern California, where this orange site is based, so it says,

1195
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,060
and my research finally led me to an address.

1196
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:34,480
I knocked on the door and said, yes, I'm American hipster, knows Naoki before I finish the rest

1197
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,480
of my English.

1198
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,960
I would like to know what this blow is.

1199
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,560
Well, after he told me, I still wanted it.

1200
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,000
I knew he would do a better job than Paula.

1201
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,680
Thanks, gee, thanks.

1202
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,760
Shine get.

1203
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,560
I get random, I get these random PMs from people.

1204
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,200
I just got one that says, shine get.

1205
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,500
People are weird.

1206
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:59,860
So now your little thing under your name on the website could be, gives a better blow

1207
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:00,860
than Politary.

1208
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:03,520
Oh, maybe we should do that.

1209
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,660
Better blowing than poli- can you arrange that for me, Jamie?

1210
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:06,660
Yes.

1211
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:07,660
Alright, thank you.

1212
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,380
Oh, Pyro Man sent another one before he left.

1213
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:13,780
Dear Santa, I want a new Politary for Christmas.

1214
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:14,780
I hate you.

1215
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:22,100
I think that Politary's a fembot.

1216
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,300
You think Politary's a fembot, huh?

1217
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:29,300
You know what we just did? We just opened the door for people to send this random shit over private message.

1218
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:35,300
Her, along with the B4U girls and Jenny Rom, they're all friends. Especially Jenny Rom.

1219
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,300
Alright, we're going to take a quick...

1220
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,300
Yes?

1221
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:41,300
Yes, Logie?

1222
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,300
Yes?

1223
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,300
New DDRPC characters. What the hell were they thinking?

1224
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:49,300
It's the gay and lesbian team. I don't know if you noticed.

1225
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:53,300
It's like bondage goth people. I don't even know what the hell it is.

1226
01:27:53,300 --> 01:28:00,300
The chick's a total dyke. I don't know about the guy, but I'm just assuming it's the gay and lesbian team for DDRPC. Hold on, let me pull it up.

1227
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:02,300
It's very scary.

1228
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:15,300
I'm going to KonamiHWI.com slash DDRPC because that's where I can download all the newest and greatest characters.

1229
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,300
And we have the page up.

1230
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:27,860
And I'm going to link that in the chat room for you folks, because I like you.

1231
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:35,580
And they are called Coby and Nicky, and you can see Coby is a cop, and Nicky is just a

1232
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:36,580
dyke.

1233
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:37,580
I don't know how else to explain Nicky.

1234
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:41,140
Yeah, but I didn't know cops were spiked hats with little skulls and stuff.

1235
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:42,780
And he's already got the handcuffs on.

1236
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,900
He's already ready to bust you.

1237
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,540
I'm going to tie you up, okay?

1238
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:48,660
I'm going to tie you up.

1239
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:53,100
he's like he's wearing he's wearing bubbles on his shirt yeah yeah the next

1240
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,980
the next four characters are all like the construction worker is the next one

1241
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:01,740
waiting for the construction worker then the Indian then we're gonna the leather

1242
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:08,620
daddy I bet you anything the Jason Enos one's gonna be leather daddy I'm just

1243
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:13,060
teasing but the rumor is that Jason Enos one's gonna be the last character it's

1244
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,100
It's been spread like wildfire everywhere.

1245
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:21,780
We'll see. We'll see. Of course the chat room saying that

1246
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:25,020
Kobe and Nikki are probably supposed to be ravers or clubbers.

1247
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:28,420
Yeah, big gay ravers and clubbers.

1248
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:32,300
And apparently Jenny Rom...

1249
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,680
Jenny Rom is a sliver slut.

1250
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:40,340
Sliver slut!

1251
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:46,600
Okay, we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and by popular

1252
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,260
demand in the chat room, they're begging us to do it tonight because we haven't done it

1253
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,340
in a few weeks, we're going to do a listless segment tonight for you guys.

1254
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:57,440
We're going to do that and then at the end of the show, Jamie's going to give us the

1255
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:01,940
update on the big, big, big tournament we're going to do here in Sacramento.

1256
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:05,380
The Orange Lounge is one of the many co-sponsors I've called SHAFT.

1257
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:10,300
Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament and Jamie's got all the details for you guys.

1258
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:13,980
By the way, DJ Konami, no Kyle Snyder, please.

1259
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:16,900
There's going to be no Kyle Snyder character in DDRPC, sorry.

1260
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,420
We're going to be doing the

1261
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,720
DDR

1262
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,660
Shaft

1263
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:24,540
update before the end of the show. We're also going to do List List

1264
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:25,740
for Best

1265
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,540
B-Moni Artist.

1266
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,700
So we'll be making our list during this break.

1267
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,340
So stick around.

1268
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:34,220
Stay for our break before we break you.

1269
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,900
Stick around, because we're going to be right back.

1270
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,060
Break down.

1271
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:45,060
in fact I'm saying stick around so much I think I'm just gonna play that

1272
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:18,060
So many nights we end with a completed start

1273
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:27,060
Aren't you really a life that she should have been searching?

1274
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,060
With you, with you, with you

1275
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,060
The universe is on its side

1276
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:37,060
I wanna feel with you, with you, with you

1277
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:41,060
Wherever you are, you see you in my eyes

1278
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:44,060
Why do we speak a lot like this?

1279
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:48,060
I like to share a little more by talking

1280
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:52,060
How can we keep repeating the same old lies?

1281
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:55,060
You and I, let everything be so new

1282
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:59,060
Why do we speak alone like this?

1283
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:03,060
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

1284
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:06,060
Why do we know we'll be together?

1285
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:10,060
I wanna do it, this and that

1286
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:18,060
Man, I wanna do it, now let's do it

1287

Don't go, can't you see that I'm so high for your love

1307
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:53,060
Boy, you gotta get a chance to try me

1308
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:57,060
I'll be just with you and just blow me out

1309
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:00,060
I'm going after yourself, you're such a me

1310
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:03,060
I'm out of state, of what can be

1311
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:05,060
You can be about to smash this on your own

1312
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,060
Honey, don't leave me alone

1313
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:12,060
I'll be your dancing flower, dancing flower, dancing no be

1314
01:35:42,060 --> 01:36:09,100
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 14 and we are getting ready to do our

1315
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,100
list list.

1316
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:14,580
a little bit of debate during the break while people were trying to make our lists here

1317
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:16,700
in the studio.

1318
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:22,260
Trying to think if a singer should be considered a Bamani artist, like could you say Sana on

1319
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,340
your list?

1320
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:27,820
So Brad was in here kind of, wait you've got to talk to the mic.

1321
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:33,940
Or something like Polteri, because she doesn't, as far as I know, doesn't write anything.

1322
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,420
I still count performers.

1323
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,620
Yeah, exactly.

1324
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:40,060
I wouldn't consider them an artist, but whatever.

1325
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:45,980
So we'll say then, favorite Bamani performer, because that would include everybody, and

1326
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:50,860
then that way you can put Sana on your list, because the way I see it, Let the Snow Paint

1327
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:54,700
Me in Seventh Style, I believe is only credited to Sana and nobody else, and even if she didn't

1328
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:58,460
write it, it's because it's from her album, and I believe somebody made the analogy that

1329
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:05,240
Britney Spears is considered an artist of erotic dancing, even though she doesn't really

1330
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,240
write her stuff.

1331
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:10,860
I have to make one quick amendment to the sim update too, Feed a Fury was pushed back

1332
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:16,960
to October 15th, that's the Dreamcast one, and there is a video on the site over at CAGames.com.

1333
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,240
Looks interesting, kind of looks like Disney's Dance Magic mode a little bit.

1334
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,640
It's going to be interesting.

1335
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,160
It's an interesting idea anyway.

1336
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,560
So here we go, we're doing a list, who's participating in today's list?

1337
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,040
I know I am, Jamie is, Loki is, and Bradley?

1338
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,040

1339
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,040
Oh, Brad, you're doing one too?

1340
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,960
Okay, well then we've got five people on the list today.

Nagumo.

1373
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:55,420
Whatever.

1374
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:59,260
You've got to spell that for me, buddy.

1375
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:00,980
Brad?

1376
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:03,180
Spell that for me so I can type it.

1377
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:10,300
That is R-E-O space N-A-G-U-M-O.

1378
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:11,300
And what did they do?

1379
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,300
Everything.

1380
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,780
They did 20 November and...

1381
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:15,780
Oh, okay.

1382
01:39:15,780 --> 01:38:51,740

1383
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:52,740

1384
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,740
Nagumo.

1385
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:54,740
Whatever.

1386
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:59,300
You gotta spell that for me, buddy.

1387
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,020
Brad?

1388
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,020
Spell that for me.

1389
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:03,220
So I can type it.

1390
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:10,340
That is R-E-O space N-A-G-U-M-O.

1391
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:11,340
And what did they do?

1392
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:12,340
Everything.

1393
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:17,540
They did 20 November and instant love.

1394
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:19,180
Alright, alright, fair enough.

1395
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:24,060
pretty much every beat my I didn't know they're they're saying that's DJ Naguro

1396
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:29,420
same person however we did oh I should establish this we did make the rule in

1397
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:34,420
here that people's multiple egos would not fall under their name so Naoki will

1398
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:39,300
not count for everything you either got to put revenge or you know Naoki

1399
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:45,100
underground or whatever Naoki doesn't count for everything so okay yes Brad

1400
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:47,700
you got a number three choice yet no we're going to Bradley Bradley number

1401
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:49,700
I will say Revenge, because I like all of them.

1402
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,700
Revenge, because you like all their songs. Good choice!

1403
01:39:52,700 --> 01:40:04,700
And Revenge is the extra stage song, the special extra stage song, if you like AAA or 7, maybe it has to be a flashing 7 or another.

1404
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:10,700
It's called Sakura and it's a sprit-ule, because they misspelled it.

1405
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:12,700
Any comments from Dark Sakura?

1406
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,700
I'm never going to be able to play that damn song!

1407
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:22,060
All right, my number three choice, and this should come as no surprise for me, but maybe

1408
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:24,180
that I put it so low on my list.

1409
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:27,860
Number three, Erotic, of course.

1410
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:35,220
Bestest Bomani band ever, well, third bestest Bomani band ever, I don't care what you say.

1411
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:39,060
Chat room is begging that one of us put down Jenny Rom, I don't know, I don't know if anybody

1412
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,060
will see.

1413
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:41,060
All right, Brad.

1414
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:48,060
Okay, well, since Matt got my number three real negumo, I'm gonna have to go with Naoki.

1415
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:52,060
Naoki, all right. Any particular reason why?

1416
01:40:52,060 --> 01:41:02,060
Well, it was neck and neck with Taka, DJ Taka and Naoki, but I think Naoki's been more responsible for a lot more of my favorite songs.

1417
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:08,060
All right, fair enough. All right, that's our number three choices. On to the number twos. Jamie.

1418
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:13,060
Number two, well, I have a list here and I'm thinking and thinking and thinking.

1419
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:15,060
I'm actually going to say bus stop.

1420
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:16,060
Bus stop.

1421
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:21,060
Because, okay, I like long train run-in and I liked, you know, Kick the Can.

1422
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:26,060
I really liked it when it was new and I really dig their remixes.

1423
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:30,060
You know, they take some of the things you don't really expect and make them really good remixes.

1424
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:33,060
Hey, I'm going to defend for you.

1425
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:35,060
Well, I'll stand up for you on this.

1426
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:42,060
The Kick the Cam is still a good remix. It's played out as it is. That is a really good remix.

1427
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,060
So I have to agree with you.

1428
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:53,060
Don't forget about how many people were trying to do the Pee Wee Herman tequila dance.

1429
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:55,060
Very true, very true.

1430
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:57,060
Alright, Loki, your number two pick.

1431
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:01,060
My number two pick has to go with Desire, because I love chirp machines.

1432
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:02,060
Desire!

1433
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:03,060
That one's fun.

1434
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:08,660

1447
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,620

brad you're never to choice

01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,720
yesterday my number two is a carry over

1453
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:11,640
i don't want to carry a mocha except for uh... to fifty bpm but

1456
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:23,360
any other injuries one

1457
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:26,160
pretty much everything economic has done

1458
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,960
yeah i feel we got

1459
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,960
That's a great song. But, um, yeah, pretty much everything, except you're right.

1460
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,800
250 B.A.M. is kind of a shit song, but everything else has been wonderful.

1461
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,320
Okay, there you go. Alright, Jamie, number one pick.

1462
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,360
This will come as a surprise to absolutely no one. This is my number one choice.

1463
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:46,400
Tack. Rob had it typed up before I said it.

1464
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:53,000
For people who know me, I have been quoted as saying that if I don't marry Dan, I'm going to marry Tack or Margaret Cho.

1465
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,240
So, that's basically...

1466
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,240
Fair enough.

1467
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:04,520
You know, everything he's done has just, except for Stoic, has made me absolutely orgasmic.

1468
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:08,520
But Tech has Tran, as it shows in the Stoic video.

1469
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:11,040
He's his girlfriend now.

1470
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,360
But Stoic is boring.

1471
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,560
Stoic is a boring song.

1472
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,480
And the video is kind of boring too.

1473
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:23,660
However, every other thing he's done, especially like his, I've been listening to a lot of

1474
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:25,920

1486
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:06,720
that they're made available since he had them up for public on his site.

Captain Jack! Good idea, Captain Jack.

1513
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:29,040
And why do you like Captain Jack?

1514
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:34,040
Because, I don't know. Because he sucks. Whatever.

1515
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,040
Alright. Whatever.

1516
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:39,040
He does have that butt ugly hoochie model with him.

1517
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,040
Because his Captain Jack...

1518
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,040
I thought you didn't like ugly people. What's up with that?

1519
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:48,040
I didn't like Captain Jack, but his Captain Jack video had a lot of women in wet t-shirts and...

1520
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:49,280
all people

1528
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,360
okay next one is bradley

1529
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:13,760
i was really as a fact that where she took it so i think you're going to

1530
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,520
these are not alright

1531
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:19,900
I was going to be very surprised if Taka didn't turn up somewhere, but there it is, Bradley

1532
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:23,040
put down Taka, it's his number one choice.

1533
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:32,040
My number one choice, Vincent DeMoor, no question, Vincent DeMoor is my absolute favorite Bomani

1534
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:34,600
artist, and if you don't like that, you can suck it.

1535
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,880
That's a good one.

1536
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:39,960
Alright, Brad, your number one choice.

1537
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:44,920
I knew, you know, before that Jamie was going to pick TAC, so that would have been my first

1538
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:47,200
because everything TAC comes out with makes me cream.

1539
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:51,400
You all have this game rigged, you all are just picking what the others are going to

1540
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:52,400
pick.

1541
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:57,320
So, instead of TAC, I picked LED, because also everything that it ever does makes me

1542
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,320
cream.

1543
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,320
Oh, good pick.

1544
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:00,320
Good pick, LED.

1545
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,320
I creamed them in the...

1546
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,200
JB punches us all for not putting...

1547
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,400

1548
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:09,240

1650
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:20,480
well that's it

1651
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:21,600
talk is there

1652
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:25,600
Just really briefly, because we were supposed to do this much earlier...

1653
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:29,600
Oh yeah, the shaft update, please. We'll run a little long, they won't mind.

1654
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:34,600
Okay. Basically, we've got the perfect attack rules already posted for the upcoming tournament.

1655
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:41,600
Sakbemani hosts another fabulous tournament that will be held at Sacramento-Scandia on Hillsdale.

1656
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:48,600
We've got directions, we have maps, we have the address, we have everything up on Sakbemani.com.

1657
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:55,700
If you go to S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I dot com, there is a link for SHAFT, and that is the whole

1658
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:56,700
section dedicated to that.

1659
01:59:56,700 --> 02:00:01,580
The only rules we have for a perfect attack right now, well, to be specific, it's accuracy

1660
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:02,580
attack.

1661
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:03,580
It is not a true perfect attack.

1662
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:11,420
If it's a true perfect attack, we're only gauging by perfects, so this is accuracy attack.

1663
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:16,120
We should have freestyle rules posted by the middle of the week as soon as they're finalized.

1664
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:17,900
So make sure you go there.

1665
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:21,360
We have a discussion going on on the site of the money.com forum, so be sure to keep

1666
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,360
your eye on it.

1667
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:25,320
There's also a thread on DDR for you to have a tournament discussion.

1668
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:28,720
And I'm not just saying this because I'm involved with the planning of this, but honestly, this

1669
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:32,780
is going to be one of the biggest tournaments in history, it really will be, assuming we

1670
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:36,620
get the participation for it, which it sounds like we're going to be getting a lot of support

1671
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:37,620
for this.

1672
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:43,280
Honestly, if you live far away, you live a ways away, this is going to be worth the trip.

1673
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:46,520
There's going to be prizes up the wazoo, we've got door prizes.

1674
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:50,260
We have some really cool door prizes, we can't even announce them yet, they're that good.

1675
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:56,840
So we'll have to, and we've got Loki donating hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs as prizes.

1676
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:57,840
As door prizes.

1677
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:58,840
As door prizes.

1678
02:00:58,840 --> 02:00:59,840
Anybody can win this.

1679
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:00,840
Just show up.

1680
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:01,840
Just show the fuck up.

1681
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:02,840
That's all you gotta do.

1682
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:07,560
So definitely come to tournament November 9th at Sacramento-Scandia.

1683
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:08,560
It's gonna be huge.

1684
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:09,560
Huge.

1685
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:10,560
Alright.

1686
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:14,360
And also the A-Team freestyle, if you can't, if you're not gonna come for anything else,

1687
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,360
come for the A-Team freestyle.

1688
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:20,280
If you want to see what freestyle was two years ago, we are having a blast from the

1689
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,280
past.

1690
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:22,280
We're having a team freestyle mode.

1691
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:24,280
It's a limited entry.

1692
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:29,360
We're basically leaving it to...we want past winners of tournaments to participate in at

1693
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,360
first.

1694
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:36,240
But if we get enough entrants, we'll open it up.

1695
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:37,480
Final thoughts from everybody in the room?

1696
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:38,480
Loki.

1697
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,560
I don't have any thoughts right now.

1698
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:44,920
much big stuff's happening next week so you know we'll probably have a lot more

1699
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:51,440

1700
02:01:51,440 --> 02:02:02,080

1701
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:07,160
thought is nothing absolutely nothing and Jamie wheel of morality turn turn

1702
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:15,160

1703
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:19,160
Alright, fair enough. We're going to end this show now. See you guys later. Thanks for listening.
