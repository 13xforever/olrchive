114245	116568	DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio,
129159	130560	Orange Lounge Radio Episode 12
476270	477531	Thank you for watching!
509688	512269	Orange Lounge Radio, we are live here.
513590	514871	Oh, shut up, baby.
514911	516091	The world's not that bad.
517712	519373	How would you like it if I shoved you back in?
524554	525675	So, hello to everybody.
525695	526856	We've got a pretty full room here tonight.
526876	528257	It's going to get hot in here very fast.
528277	529297	This is why we have the lights out.
529337	537303	If you're viewing our webcam, which is at a top secret location, which you can only get in our chat room, then it's going to be very dark in here.
537443	540065	All the images are dark because we don't want to start sweating in here.
541406	542687	It's going to turn into a sauna.
542707	545429	Then we'll all have to take our clothes off and that'll be the nudity.
545529	547811	That'll be the nudity.
547971	548071	Dork!
553479	560526	I would like to apologize for anyone listening to this on the archives because I didn't start the archive recording until that break, so you missed the intro of the show.
560586	569334	But all we were basically saying in the intro was that Mel B and Melody are here tonight, Shark Skrull, Mel B, and all our usual crowd is here tonight.
569414	570936	Oh, you didn't get to say hi yet, Brad.
571036	571556	Anything you want to say?
572737	574059	He's just slurping.
574759	575400	Oh, hey, Molly.
578784	590329	If you do want to join our chatroom, figure out where that secret webcam is, all you've got to do is go to any other side IRC server like irc.eggheads.org and join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
591710	591850	Wee.
593112	594173	So how was your week off, Jamie?
594353	595333	You were gone for a little while.
596134	609801	Well, last week, weekend thingy, I went to a big gathering of a bunch of people, mostly a step squad, a few RTF, a taco outpost, just a bunch of people.
609821	610441	We went bowling.
612182	612702	Bowling's cool.
612762	614023	I sucked so bad.
614643	617444	And then I got to see the crappiest machine in the universe.
617925	618265	What's that?
618505	619445	Stepping Sage.
619806	620046	Woo!
620993	623562	I've never heard of... The most ghetto fabulous machine ever.
623622	627996	I have never even heard of 76... It ain't even ghetto fabulous, it's just ghetto.
629052	630133	It's like ghetto ass.
632674	633014	Okay.
633855	641179	Imagine you have a machine consisting of one large monitor in the center and two smaller monitors on either side.
642020	652666	You have a panel, like any normal dancing stage, except you have two circles in the front, two on the side, and two in the back, making a sort of circle.
653006	653406	Okay.
653626	656788	And then you have two dots on the screen.
657588	660370	and then whatever color goes up, you have to step on the corresponding color.
660490	664132	You know, I think it's like red at the top, yellow in the middle, and blue in the back or something like that.
664152	664732	Weird, okay.
664772	668615	And then you have the crappiest videos playing in the middle one.
669015	675098	All it is, is like, okay, you know at Great America, the karaoke, well, not the one that you actually sing with, the make your own video thing?
675358	675999	Right, okay, yeah.
676019	681842	Where you, you know, dance around in front of a blue screen or a green screen and you have... With those like, just really lame, I know what you're talking about, yep.
682242	686765	Imagine this with like real people, except the people think that they can dress cool and know how to dance.
689256	695578	and they're the type of people who think that they're doing so well that you really don't have the heart to tell them that they suck.
695798	697039	What kind of music is in this game?
697079	697819	I never even played it.
699060	708763	We have Saturday Night, we have The Hustle, we have Santa Maria, which I nearly threw up.
708783	709683	By Samantha Fox?
709923	711344	Yes, but it's not Samantha Fox.
713789	715371	Yeah, they have I Should Be So Lucky by Kylo Ren.
715551	718354	I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.
718614	719215	I know that one.
720156	721337	That's awesome.
721697	722959	And they had Macho Man.
723459	724280	Oh, God.
724320	725121	Which was the worst.
725161	726262	Like limes?
727103	729586	And they had, oh, shoot.
729766	733690	It was another something I don't remember off the top of my head, but this machine just sucked.
734691	741615	And it was sort of thrown away in the corner by the door, you know, like, we really don't have this here, they just make us.
742476	754523	And then, you know, we played with balls all day, and then went back over for 2DX, and I got to see my friend Liz, who I hadn't seen in two years.
754603	763028	I knew her before I... I actually met her at Anime Expo 2000, which was also where I played my first DDR machine.
764349	768273	We'll hear the... Well, you know, you interviewed Kim in these interviews, right?
768653	769014	That you did?
769274	769934	I interviewed Liz.
769995	770895	I interviewed a bunch of people.
770935	771496	Okay, cool.
771576	774739	And Liz is also... She's a Santoki on Step Squad 4.
775139	775560	Ah, right on.
776140	777722	Cool.
777762	779584	I want to talk to Mel and Mel for a minute here.
780876	789784	Now, because they went to the big Disney's Rave Tournament on Friday, which none of us were able to go to, because we all have to work, and then, you know, by the time, at least I do.
789804	790825	What's that?
791005	791865	Oh, you went for that week?
792006	792486	That's right.
792626	794628	Oh, well, you guys... I'm like us unemployed people, why don't you?
795449	796069	I'm sorry.
796349	801494	Well, if I worked in Milpitas, then I could get to the tournament in time, but I work here in Sacramento.
801514	803796	Hey, I'm unemployed.
803916	804536	Don't... But...
808082	811005	Watch out before the unemployed rise up and kill you!
811025	811365	Smoke power!
827043	829164	Okay, well, yeah, quick rundown.
829184	832485	The tourney was on a dancing stage, Disney's Rave.
832925	836447	It was at Milpitas, and it was hosted in one of the party rooms.
836887	839928	And for the Perfect Attack tourney, it was all on doubles.
840529	850053	And because Disney Rave is a rather easy machine to Perfect Attack anything on, like Triple S's are very commonplace, they had set the difficulty to eight.
850693	855255	So it was like, you know, the good old third mix SSR days where four goods and you were out.
856736	858778	and people did fail during the tourney.
859418	862601	Oh, to fail a song on Disney's Rave, that's got to be the biggest heartbreaker.
863202	864063	Not necessarily.
864163	865644	Some of the songs are impossible.
865664	869268	Some of them were ten-footers like Twilight Zone and Ducking Hardcore.
869808	871290	I could just imagine Mr. Bassman.
872351	875914	Bassman is actually relatively easy compared to some of the others.
877122	884764	Wow, so now you came out of hiding, basically your freestyle retirement, and you did a freestyle at this tournament, correct?
885204	885804	Yes, I did.
885944	891206	I finally decided, hey, this is going to be a fun tourney, there's not that much pressure, what the heck.
891546	893026	So yeah, I did the bump.
894306	894707	Right on.
894727	899928	The most ghetto song out there, and I pretty much milked it for its ghetto factor.
900757	912425	Now, the last time Mel B was here on Orange Lounge, about six or seven weeks ago now, the last time he was here, we made an agreement that the next time he enters in a tournament, he needs to do a knee drop and a hand slap.
913334	914896	Did those two things get done?
915236	915776	Yes, they were.
915916	916877	Oh, my God.
918119	922342	And from what I understand, you got criticized by one of the judges for it, right?
922362	927107	Yes, one of the judges was, I wasn't so sure about that hand slap knee drop somewhere in the game.
927147	928928	I mean, I chained it pretty nicely.
928969	930170	I kind of disguised it well.
930190	932692	It wasn't the, like, love to ball hand slap.
933092	937977	I thought I did it with class and style and all those good things freestylers should be doing it with, but no.
939853	944995	So if anybody wants to blame the low points of Mel B's routine, that would be our fault here at Orange Lounge.
945035	945576	So you're welcome.
947857	948597	It was all in fun.
949157	954120	For the turnout I had on a Friday night, there was probably about maybe 20 routines or so thereabouts.
954280	954920	Not too bad.
955180	956160	Yeah, 18, 19.
956220	957901	Yeah, it's cool.
959002	961143	And everyone was just having a good time more than anything.
962143	965864	There was maybe a few dancey routines, but for the most part, everyone was just goofed around.
965904	966965	It's a Disney rave, you know.
967125	968365	How seriously can you make it?
968485	970426	Now, how many Macarena routines were there?
971966	972066	One.
972366	973347	Just one, really?
973787	975067	Did they actually do the Macarena?
976748	977268	Not really.
977288	979329	In fact, the audience did.
979349	989812	Although, the funny thing was, it was Tigger, actually, of all people who did Macarena, and at the end, he pretty much turned it into Love 2 Macarena, complete with hand slaps and all that good schmazz.
990052	990352	Right on.
991806	992286	That was awesome.
992687	994508	So, good tournament?
994588	997570	Do you think they need to do another Disney's Rave tournament in the future?
997630	1001232	Or was it just kind of a one-time, ha-ha, that was funny, let's move on now?
1001292	1004574	Maybe once in a blue moon, like once a year probably.
1004594	1011858	I doubt you'd see anything twice because a lot of people were having trouble enough trying to memorize steps, trying to get it up really for the tourney.
1011938	1012339	Who knows?
1013639	1014040	Right on.
1014980	1015941	Good times, good times.
1016281	1018482	Any other tournaments coming up that you want to tell us all about?
1018903	1020864	Any more appearances you'll be making that you want to plug?
1022164	1026531	As far as I know, you'll probably catch me at a local 7-Eleven or something like that.
1026612	1027453	Just catch me Thursday.
1027513	1029176	I'm getting a Vanilla Coke Slurpee.
1029437	1032702	I'll be at the one on Branham in Monterey in San Jose.
1033083	1033504	Bingo.
1034666	1034966	Woo!
1036196	1039957	But past that, as far as I know, I'm not too sure about any of the tourneys coming up.
1040017	1043979	I know Scandia 2 is probably one of the bigger ones coming up in December.
1044479	1048100	As soon as I know more details about that, hey, I'll pass it on.
1048380	1050221	There's going to be a Sacramento tournament in November.
1051501	1053122	Yeah.
1053162	1053882	To be determined.
1054102	1055843	To be determined in the works.
1057183	1058324	Let's talk to Melody for a minute.
1058524	1058904	How are you?
1060931	1063272	Now you were just here a couple weeks ago, weren't you?
1063452	1065833	Yeah, because I needed donuts and Mongolian.
1065853	1068574	And now I have pants and a jacket.
1069595	1071576	Now I have clothes to go with the Mongolian.
1071776	1074817	Explain why you had to come up to Sacramento this time.
1075297	1075818	This time?
1076198	1078479	Last time was for donuts, this time it was for... Last time was for donuts, this time...
1079299	1083141	I was on a quest to get a pair of pants at Express that I absolutely adore.
1083761	1087383	I called every single Express in Northern California.
1088063	1091104	Only one had them in the right size, and it was here in Sacramento.
1091124	1093205	And I thought, well, hey, now I have a really good excuse to come up here.
1093585	1100768	So we were kicking around the idea anyway, because since the Miggle tourney just happened, we had to inform everyone that, yes, the can't-slot-knee-drop thing had been done.
1100808	1102889	I was like, well, hey, now we have a really good excuse to come up here.
1103189	1104230	Now I'm waiting to see the video.
1104250	1104990	That's what I can't wait for.
1105010	1105090	Okay.
1105870	1107931	There is a three-minute video update.
1107951	1108931	Did I just say three minutes?
1111292	1113233	Yeah, here goes Rosie and Jamal.
1114013	1116994	But it's a wrestling thing.
1117054	1117754	Oh, okay, okay, okay.
1118215	1127598	But if you go on DDRFreak and the MiggleTurney thread, there is a link to a three-minute video on there that has some highlights from the MiggleTurney until the actual videos come up.
1128018	1128418	Ah, okay.
1128438	1133420	But I haven't been able to finish downloading it myself considering my computer crashed IE in the middle of it, so...
1133720	1135061	They're giving a link in the chatroom.
1135101	1139606	If you want to get that three-minute video, it's at evil.facuck.org.
1139646	1142068	And Facuck is spelled, by the way, F-C-U-K.
1142729	1144830	I don't think that has anything to do with French Connection.
1144871	1146472	I think that's an independent side of that.
1147013	1148934	I think French Connection is F-C-U-K.com.
1149495	1150676	I have a Facuck shirt.
1150916	1151497	Facuck Games.
1152017	1152978	I wear that to all the tournaments.
1153078	1153539	I've seen that.
1154019	1154219	Yeah.
1155000	1159543	I didn't even... Man, anyone who downloaded the video, I make a brief one-half-second appearance in it.
1160344	1160924	What are you doing?
1161285	1161905	Are you talking?
1162706	1165608	No, no, I'm, like, watching Corey play Dumb Mania.
1167750	1168430	Right on, right on.
1169311	1176796	And then there's also, uh, you can download it from Oralsay.cx Oralsay.cx is another site you can get it.
1177677	1179879	And everybody's sharing when they appear in the video.
1182000	1186501	See, I have to get my computer to actually cooperate and download it without crashing my browser in the middle of it.
1188297	1190758	Black Lab is in the chat room saying, I appear in it twice, I'm in it twice.
1191038	1195041	I guess it must just be a really fast clip kind of thing where you just got everybody in there at least once.
1195101	1195981	It's kind of cool, actually.
1196061	1197822	I only saw half of it.
1197922	1198682	Did you spot yourself?
1199203	1200664	I have not seen myself yet.
1200724	1201684	Well, maybe you're in the second half.
1202244	1207827	It could be, but... One day we'll bring a video camera in here and we'll do a quick promo or something.
1208448	1208628	Eep.
1209108	1216712	But probably the greatest cameo we saw in the video that we did see from the tourney was a kneeling pad, of all things.
1217461	1218322	It was a cow kneeling pad.
1218362	1218963	True story.
1219023	1221747	I mean, quick rundown for everyone out there.
1222247	1225051	Me and Melody, we were over at Target one night.
1225652	1227894	We was just checking out some stuff.
1228195	1229456	I come by the gardening section.
1229777	1230438	I see these things.
1230458	1231940	They're butterfly knee pads.
1232300	1232660	Literally.
1233061	1233682	Knee pads with...
1235033	1239076	And I thought, dude, that must be like the greatest gift we could give at a tourney.
1239116	1244019	Like, we should give the worst freestyler, you know, a set of butterfly knee pads and just send them on their way.
1244360	1247242	But right next to it, we saw a cow kneeling pad.
1247282	1250444	And since one of our friends is big on cows, you know, we thought that would be cool.
1250484	1251585	And see, that was a kneeling pad.
1251625	1254387	We were already thinking the wrong things with that.
1254467	1259091	So we gave the gift to our friend over at the tourney.
1259151	1262954	And next thing you know, everyone was abusing it and all sorts of.
1264094	1267179	I think the cows saw more action than anyone else that night.
1269262	1271605	Jamie just pissed her pants at something here.
1271645	1272326	It just happened.
1272466	1276452	She just read that the local golf land here in Roseville got a crane game.
1276472	1277413	They got a crane game!
1279014	1281296	Explain your obsession with the crane game for a minute.
1281316	1282396	I'm sorry to change the subject on your melody.
1282416	1284778	First off, Jamie, I'm hiding my keys from you right now.
1284898	1289601	Yeah, you are not... Jamie has to be rationed on how much money she can spend on the crane game.
1289842	1291122	I rape the crane games.
1291203	1294745	Now, it's not one of those... I need to talk to JB for a minute who's telling us about this.
1294805	1297547	It's not one of those shitty cranes for candy type thing, is it?
1297847	1299128	Because that don't count.
1299488	1300429	Yeah, that doesn't count.
1300569	1303151	Give us a quarter so we can give you two cents worth of candy game.
1303431	1305572	The claw.
1305833	1306253	We're talking...
1307125	1308406	I am all over shitty stuffed animals.
1329460	1331541	It's not a crane game unless the animals are shitty.
1331621	1332841	It just doesn't happen that way.
1333321	1338322	It's always choose the worst looking, ugliest piece of crap you see in there and you will get it first try.
1338382	1340703	Don't make fun of my shitty animals!
1340743	1347965	The best thing I ever won, and of all places this was at Spiegel, I got Tyrone.
1349265	1350185	Oh yeah, Tyrone.
1350466	1351186	Tyrone was the best.
1351206	1352466	Where is Tyrone?
1352546	1355727	Tyrone is currently in lockup with his pussies and bitches.
1357833	1364738	Tyrone, by the way, and maybe I'll find during the next break, I'll find a link to a picture of Tyrone and put it in the chat room because I know I have one up.
1365159	1369422	If anybody knows of my secret picture page, it's in there with Sunnyvale Tournament pictures.
1369922	1374506	Tyrone is a little stuffed bear that wears like a little... He's a real beanie bear.
1374666	1376787	...little Hugh Hefner pimp coat.
1377128	1382351	He's a brown bear wearing a deep maroon smoking jacket.
1383192	1385414	And his name literally is Tyrone.
1387276	1388736	He is the coolest bear in the world.
1388997	1391817	He has bitches, thanks to Melody.
1392918	1394338	And he has pussies.
1395438	1398079	You know how hard it is to find little tiny dogs?
1398759	1403541	And just to be wandering around Target saying, wow, I need to get some bitches around here somewhere.
1404361	1407082	Especially when you're in the toy section and all the kids are wandering around.
1407102	1408763	I'm just like, hmm, I need some bitches here.
1408783	1416505	Um, yeah, can I get a price check on bitches on aisle three?
1417842	1420923	Attention Kmart shoppers, we have a sale in the bitches department.
1422184	1426025	Attention all Kmart shoppers, tampons and bitches half off.
1429947	1432688	Excuse me, do we have any bitches here?
1433549	1434989	Is there a bitch in the house?
1436030	1439991	Remind me to never ever drink water at this show again.
1441552	1443333	I nearly choked down my vanilla coke.
1445993	1450755	Yeah, we had some... Some bitches made a mess on aisle three.
1453136	1454597	Can we get the little pink powder?
1455438	1456538	We got a bitch in the line.
1456578	1458019	We need a price check on bitches.
1461541	1462941	We're so easily amused here today.
1463562	1464322	What's for money?
1464382	1465563	I don't care about money anymore.
1465583	1468804	I just want to talk about... I just want to say bitch as many times as I can on the show tonight.
1469064	1470305	Bitch mania 2DX.
1471514	1472395	News Science Collection
1494302	1496164	I had a chance to do it Wednesday night.
1496364	1497265	I didn't tell you about that.
1498005	1501628	Just another stupid mom letting her child run rampant on the thing.
1501668	1504911	And I was like, you need to control your little spawn there.
1506752	1508874	You actually referred to the child as spawn.
1509374	1510595	No, I said their child.
1510855	1513998	Well, there was also the incident with the giggling idiots.
1515149	1521711	Oh, yeah, if you've ever seen the Clerks cartoon, yeah, and the two giggling girls, that's like what these chicks were like, you know.
1522592	1530674	They were sitting over at the little tables, and I was watching, I think, who was it that was playing Parapara?
1530694	1532655	I think it was Sunil that was playing...
1537295	1545061	I don't know if anyone watches DigiCart, but I had a black Gamma Gamma Dawn hat with the little pointy horns on it.
1545621	1547623	And I went, I like your hat!
1549164	1551086	Calling for another, and finally one of them came over and said, I like your hat.
1551126	1551826	I go, thank you.
1552587	1553208	And so she walked off.
1553528	1560854	And then they pointed to the African that was on my purse and I go, and one of them came over and I was like, she's like, would you eat your dog?
1561714	1562155	Go away.
1564517	1565238	You wanted to kill them all.
1565258	1569622	You know what this is kinda turning into here, I think?
1579890	1580971	I think we need to get into this.
1581231	1585733	I think we need to get into the FU of the week.
1587014	1588115	Let's have at it, shall we?
1588415	1591277	Do you have another one you want to start us off with, Jamie?
1591297	1594638	Because I've been getting a lot in the chat room that I can talk about.
1594718	1595979	I don't really have one myself.
1596600	1597200	Let's hear it, Jamie.
1597240	1598841	Let's hear your FU of the week.
1599705	1606089	My first one, of course, goes toward those, you know, crappy, giggling, stupid, moron, stupid fucks at Rizvalgatan.
1606729	1609791	My other fuck you of the week goes toward idiots in general, because I hate them.
1610492	1613053	Especially idiots... What?
1616876	1619397	That's rather vague in general, but I kinda like it.
1619417	1621739	Well, no.
1622975	1627743	There's the people who will fall for just about anything that you put in front of them.
1627763	1631649	Okay, I will narrow down this level of idiocy to sheep.
1633091	1638119	To the people who will blindly follow one voice and think that they are the end all.
1639048	1643571	You know, the little... You know, there's nothing wrong with, you know, fanboys and fangirls.
1643871	1654157	There's a thing with people who are fanboys and fangirls to the exception of all else, who will take anything that they hear on TV, anything on the radio, by the way, do everything I say, anything that they...
1654757	1662124	They read and act like it is, you know, the absolute scripture that they need to live their lives by.
1662585	1666488	Oh my god, I must buy this thing for the sake of my American pride.
1666949	1669331	Oh my god, orange is the new red.
1670252	1670833	Exactly!
1671813	1673915	If you ever saw Josie and the Pussycats, one of those ever.
1675317	1678440	But that is exactly the thing that I... And there's the people...
1679235	1686001	who think, oh, well, you know, my life isn't very important, so I'm going to make up something really stupid so I can get on CNN.
1687142	1691045	But no, I'm not talking about, you know, about... Oh, my God.
1691245	1695789	I'm going to tell a waitress at Shoney's that my van has a bomb in it, and I'm going to go blow something up.
1696069	1696790	Oh, my God!
1699712	1700953	Boy, that killed the conversation, didn't it?
1701254	1701934	Anybody else in here?
1702054	1704736	Oh, are you done with your... No, I just don't like stupid people.
1704997	1705257	Okay.
1705577	1706378	Any other rants you have?
1708442	1711003	All right, then we've got Loki's got his round.
1711023	1711643	Let's hear it, Loki.
1712523	1717745	All right, my first FU of the week goes to the new version of DWI, which I'll go over that later.
1718145	1718465	Yes.
1718545	1720246	But damn thing didn't work again.
1721166	1722147	Not much of a surprise.
1722187	1724007	They just can't program it right for some reason.
1724047	1725748	I guess it's just incompatible with my computer.
1726768	1731590	My second FU of the week would have to go to... By the way, Loki, happy birthday.
1731610	1731830	Hello.
1732406	1732606	Yes.
1732766	1735487	Your little party you had last night was quite nice.
1735568	1736468	Thank you for reminding me.
1736568	1738029	That's my second FU of the week.
1738109	1738969	It's to 9-11.
1739249	1739790	God damn it.
1739910	1742451	I had that birthday 21 years before that.
1743851	1744572	It's not fair.
1745052	1748053	Everyone's like, oh, your birthday's on 9-11.
1748134	1748794	I'm sorry.
1751015	1751795	That must suck.
1751915	1752376	I'm not.
1752456	1752956	Fuck you.
1755819	1761764	Yeah, so pretty much every year from now on, everyone at my work and all that stuff, they actually forget my birthday because of 9-11.
1761784	1762605	So, yeah.
1763406	1766909	So that feeds to 9-11 and the new version of DWI.
1767449	1769331	You know what I'm going to do just for you, Loki?
1769371	1777698	Because you have to go through that every year on your birthday, I'm going to change your song that you have to hear all the time.
1778859	1779359	So, uh...
1782028	1785910	We'll have this be your FU song in the week for the future.
1785970	1786610	How's that sound?
1789231	1790611	This moment of political incorrectness.
1790631	1795473	Speaking of political incorrectness, or correctness or whatever, my music, please.
1795553	1796134	Oh, okay, sorry.
1796734	1804037	I have requests for my song since, you know, that Drop the Bomb doesn't really work with 9-11.
1804477	1805877	Maybe you can change it to Crash.
1807098	1809379	Anyway, yes, Jamie, you have FU of the week.
1810772	1817654	My other one, it's also directed in a similar fashion toward the whole 9-11 thing.
1817794	1820094	For people who saw my big rant in my live journal.
1820754	1823775	It's actually directed toward consumerism in general.
1824075	1826035	I am a consumer whore!
1826275	1826996	And how!
1828296	1833137	This goes toward all those people who are trying to make a quick buck off a tragedy.
1833357	1833917	Fuck you!
1834657	1836037	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
1836298	1837498	Go to hell and die there.
1837978	1838318	Thank you.
1838892	1841913	and just to add to that, they named it a holiday.
1842273	1843653	It's now Patriot's Day.
1843993	1845213	No longer will it be called 9-11.
1845293	1847934	Doesn't that sound like the greatest sale at JCPenney's?
1849114	1851035	Patriot's Day sale, yay!
1851375	1854235	But that's awesome because I get that day off every year, hopefully.
1858376	1858796	Whatever.
1860977	1863097	Any other FUs on anything in general?
1864678	1865278	Mel B's got one.
1867573	1869956	I don't have male music, but I'll find male music really fast.
1869976	1870416	Let's see.
1870476	1871337	Male music, male music.
1871377	1872958	What would work for male music?
1872998	1876942	Let's try... I will.
1876962	1877042	Word.
1884344	1885244	Excellent choice, my man.
1885404	1887725	Anyway, I got one big F for you, actually.
1888305	1892026	And this is not just one person, not even one day, it's a whole damn city.
1892527	1893707	It's the city of Milpitas.
1894087	1898508	I don't know most of you who've been out there in a while, but apparently there was a problem about a month ago.
1898548	1901469	Yeah, a month and a half, two months ago.
1901489	1905391	Apparently a pipe that was a pump to...
1907483	1913606	Here, since I know the story, there's a saltwater pond apparently on the edge of Milpitas in San Jose.
1914286	1916547	And it's like 650 acres.
1916627	1917108	It's huge.
1917588	1921490	And it has lots of nice little organisms and crap in it.
1921910	1923271	And the pump broke.
1924702	1930788	And it's been very warm in the area, and lots of nice little organisms and stuff in there.
1930808	1932709	Ha ha, smells like poopy.
1933330	1935171	Um, try like bad sushi.
1936152	1936953	Constantly.
1939475	1942538	Really horrible, and it just smells all day long.
1944059	1949124	I, that feels so bad for people like who work at- Like worse than the sushi place at the Metreon?
1950894	1952455	I'm just kidding, I've never had that before.
1952515	1955037	Yeah, seriously, I mean... Trying to think of an easy place to knock.
1956458	1958600	I feel so bad for people who work at, like, Dave & Buster's.
1958640	1961862	They gotta sit out there all day long and, like, inhale this in.
1962182	1971489	They just get headaches and, man, I just couldn't... You gotta wonder, though, because I've actually, I've been to Illuminations, the candle store, you know, and I've asked the chicks that work there, you know, doesn't it get annoying after a while smelling like candle?
1971509	1975272	And they say they get used to it, so you gotta wonder if Dave & Buster's people get used to the raw sushi smell.
1976025	1980546	I actually, since I'm like the nice person that I am, I actually talk to the doormen when I go in at Dave Buster's.
1980586	1982586	I say, how the hell do you live with this smell?
1982606	1985687	He says, you know, we get headaches all the time.
1985727	1986427	We can't stand it.
1986727	1987987	They actually still smell it.
1988067	1992128	Believe me, I will run from my car to the door and get in as fast as I can.
1992488	1994028	Mel and I were in Milpitas getting gas.
1994088	1995269	He opened the window to my car.
1995309	1997589	I started screaming at him, shut the damn window!
1998009	1999809	It's gonna smell like fucking fish in here!
2002910	2005131	But yeah, so in general, fuck you Milpitas.
2007232	2008252	I can't even continue.
2011374	2014135	Alright, now we've got to get to the FUs of the week from the chatroom.
2014155	2016596	This is turning into an awfully long segment every week, but okay.
2016616	2017676	We're negative.
2017776	2018116	Whatever.
2018136	2019617	It's the people's FU.
2020257	2022578	It's the people's choice, the people's FU.
2023699	2025660	Let's go to the FUs from the chatroom, shall we?
2028101	2028941	Twin says...
2031632	2036715	FU to Windows XP because it's crashed on him again and it's making me format his drive again this week.
2037616	2038556	And Tim says hi to Jamie.
2038976	2039397	Hi!
2040377	2044119	SoCalKick says his FU of the week is childproof safety caps.
2044519	2048722	It took him seven tries to open the new bottle of pills that he got today in a new bottle.
2049922	2054165	And yet, the childproof bottle will keep the adults out, but kids can get it at first try.
2056066	2058729	Mommy, what's this blue candy?
2059089	2073443	That's the crack, put it back DCB has a fuck you of the week and he says it's to his parents Typical T-Gangs there For not letting him buy 2DX because it's too expensive
2074938	2079942	So now he's stuck with a 2DX controller and nothing to play except for five key games, which get boring fast.
2081483	2083705	I recommend Sixth and Core, because it's almost just like 2DX.
2083725	2087068	When I was your age, we didn't have this beat mania stuff.
2087508	2089790	We had to play on the Power Pad.
2091351	2092872	It was Power Glove.
2092893	2093853	The Power Glove.
2094334	2095895	It's so bad.
2096756	2099838	All we had was Excitebike and Gyromite.
2101599	2103181	Dude, Rob the Robot was the shit.
2105014	2106295	I just like it because it's named Rob.
2107495	2107856	Anyway.
2111518	2113219	Let's talk to Black Lab.
2113259	2113719	His F.U.
2113739	2124685	of the week is Denny's for their slow-ass service that caused him to be two hours late in getting home from the Disney rave tourney, thusly getting him in deep shit with the parents.
2125145	2125666	Fuck Denny's.
2126346	2126946	He didn't care.
2127306	2128287	Loki's got an F.U.
2128347	2129448	of the week right behind him.
2130734	2137175	Well, speaking of Denny's, I don't know what it is about Denny's, but every time I go in there, they have to do one of two things.
2137315	2142296	Either A, forget something I ordered, or B, make fun of my shirt.
2143677	2146237	Normally I have a shirt on there, and it'll have like a phrase.
2146357	2149078	One time I had one that said, I hear voices and they don't like it.
2149378	2150638	Do you really hear voices?
2150938	2151838	Why don't they like me?
2152399	2153999	I was like, go away.
2154019	2156099	I hear one really annoying voice right now.
2156119	2156759	Cram it.
2157260	2159280	So F you to Denny's, because they suck.
2159680	2160260	All right, fair enough.
2160680	2161841	Carols is better anyway.
2162441	2165122	If you ever go to the Carols in Roseville, ask for Mary Lou.
2165142	2165842	She's a sweetie.
2165882	2166962	Yes, she is, and tip her well.
2167062	2167542	Tip her well.
2169903	2170403	Three more.
2170463	2171123	Three more FUs.
2171684	2173684	23rd Magus says... Oh, he wants two.
2175265	2180926	He says a continued fuck you to Boom PlayStation... Oh, PlayStation 2 USB converters.
2181306	2182147	Controller converters.
2182827	2186728	And also a good-sized FU to the Player One keys on RVGL's Hip Hop Mania.
2187779	2188300	You know what?
2188380	2191782	I would have to second that, except the way that I play, I really don't have an issue with it.
2193104	2197107	Joe Mama says, F you from school for being morons.
2197207	2199469	They gave him three detentions for nothing.
2199669	2200610	Yeah, fuck them.
2201631	2202071	Huh.
2202751	2205954	I somehow wonder if he really did nothing.
2207716	2209297	Oh, I was only late a couple times.
2209317	2210097	That's not that bad.
2210438	2211118	I don't know what he did.
2211319	2212740	We gotta know, what did he really do?
2212760	2214501	He did something bad.
2214521	2216082	Yeah, I really didn't hit anybody.
2217339	2220340	Oh, JB says F you to Karos for being slow.
2222180	2222840	F you, JB.
2222900	2223900	That's my F you.
2224040	2230722	No, we have to add IHOP to that list because we had some slow ass service there after me the other day.
2231062	2234903	Joe Mama got detention because he quote unquote missed a class.
2236163	2238243	Oh yeah, and furthermore from all IHOP.
2239083	2241544	Did he miss a class because he was out back smoking pot or what?
2242648	2248891	I don't know, but to continue that IHOP thought, I'm just thinking, that's the four reasons why we gotta have a raw chicken and waffles up in NorCal.
2249331	2249951	Please.
2250271	2251452	A chicken and waffle!
2252092	2252853	Amen to that.
2253253	2253853	You know what?
2254193	2254413	Yes.
2254593	2258555	That's it, just one day, come to my house, I will make you French toast.
2259115	2260056	Cause I rule like that.
2262659	2263679	It's not the same.
2263919	2265100	My French toast owns.
2265460	2266660	I've never had my French toast.
2267160	2268221	It's just not the same.
2268261	2270041	They add crack to their chicken and waffles.
2270181	2271722	I'm talking about IHOPing.
2271762	2273583	Kero's and Denny's and those crappy places.
2273943	2275303	I've moved on to Roscoe's.
2275363	2275763	Sorry.
2279088	2281670	We gotta take this show down to SoCal sometime.
2281690	2283451	We're gonna tape a show in SoCal at some point.
2283671	2284051	Somehow.
2284651	2285472	AI chip anyone?
2286452	2288073	Do you guys want to take our recorder?
2288113	2290495	If you guys live closer by, I'd let you take the recorder and tape fun stuff.
2290515	2293256	We're going to AI for a while, but I don't know if we're gonna see anyone entertaining.
2293537	2296778	We could take it on rides at Disneyland and start screaming randomly or something.
2296999	2297459	You know, cause...
2298732	2300453	Now I'm thinking of how I could make this work.
2300473	2304594	I might be able to let you guys borrow the remote unit for a while if you guys want to tape your adventures.
2304614	2307596	Unfortunately, they won't let recorders or anything into the prices right.
2307616	2309636	Well, I mean the rest of your adventures if you go to AI or whatever.
2309656	2310757	Oh, we're going to AI.
2311677	2312597	A live review of Martial Beat.
2312617	2316359	A live review of Martial Beat, complete with punching and sweating and all that good schmack.
2316499	2318560	And everybody was kung fu fighting.
2319500	2321461	And the woman in my head was kick punch.
2322301	2324642	Well, actually, we should do a review for Punch Mania.
2324682	2325922	They have it at Florin now.
2326123	2329404	That's what I hear is that Florin Mall here in Sacramento got Punch Mania.
2329664	2330905	That's the Fist of the North Star one.
2330925	2332125	The Fist of the North Star one, yep.
2333045	2336607	Yeah, the ghetto-ass fucking mall got Punch Mania.
2336787	2338248	So the gang members can train.
2339428	2340148	I drove by there.
2340188	2341329	That place was scary.
2342889	2345531	It is very scary and desolate looking, but they have Pump It Up.
2346211	2346971	They do have Pump It Up.
2347531	2348612	Ooh, Pump It Up.
2348632	2349912	Bounce with me, bounce with me.
2350092	2351093	Bounce with me, bounce.
2351193	2351433	Okay, okay.
2352492	2353494	Yeah, yes.
2354175	2357221	Oh, speaking of... Oh, I see you're telling me to do a segue.
2357301	2357882	Okay, yes.
2358343	2359285	Let's do this segue.
2359786	2362331	This is something we've actually talked about on the show before.
2363010	2363911	But this is interesting.
2363951	2370296	I find this interesting only because this is a story that is actually posted on Konami's site in the UK.
2370356	2372338	This is Konami Amusement of Europe.
2372699	2377443	This is their stance on the Konami versus Andamiro, which is the company that makes Pump It Up.
2377763	2380085	This is their words on that whole lawsuit.
2380105	2380946	And this is why it's interesting.
2381266	2385450	I think this is the first real comment I've seen from Konami on this whole thing.
2385510	2386771	So let's read this, shall we?
2387768	2388928	This is from Konami's site.
2388948	2402512	It says, Konami's legal eagles have always had their hands full defending Dance Dance Revolution's genre, spawning style from being copied all over the world, but this latest attempt by company Andamaro, they call it Andamaro, has evened them slightly taken aback.
2403452	2411175	This time it appears the Korean company's strategy was to claim they actually invented DDR in the first place, despite the fact it took them almost two years to make their complaint.
2411835	2412055	Ooh.
2412862	2418744	It's kind of interesting because they're kind of taking jabs at Andamiro, which you don't usually see in company press releases.
2418764	2420485	But of course, in Europe, everything's tabloid.
2420525	2423126	It's all about, you know, at least from what I've seen.
2424426	2429728	The parties have been involved in legal disputes since then in front of the Korean and the U.S.
2429808	2430168	courts.
2431049	2434910	Now that's interesting because I don't think we've ever heard before that this thing's been in the U.S.
2434970	2437011	courts, but this says it has.
2437914	2444556	Namiro started manufacturing and distributing Pump It Up Dance Simulation Game, which was very similar to Konami's Dance Dance Revolution during September 1999.
2445857	2451979	Konami filed a complaint with the Seoul District Court seeking an injunction against the production of Pump It Up.
2452714	2453674	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2474036	2479403	The reason was that Konami infringed the patent and Amiro had been assigned from a third party in the U.S.
2479923	2482186	The case was scheduled for jury trial this month.
2482246	2482947	So, interesting.
2483307	2490195	And Amiro filed a complaint against Konami seeking an injunction against the distribution of Dance's Revolution in the United States.
2491076	2491557	No U.S.
2491617	2492238	mixes lately.
2492698	2493019	Hmm.
2494141	2495062	So that opens the door.
2514437	2516238	Yep, so that's that.
2516358	2520159	That's an official word from Konami of the UK.
2520439	2523280	And says some very interesting things in there we might not have known before.
2523300	2524521	Anybody want to comment on this story?
2524601	2525441	Have anything to say about it?
2525881	2526342	Yes, Loki.
2527822	2529483	Does that mean we're going to see some U.S.
2529523	2530363	pump-it-up machines?
2531363	2534485	I think pump-it-ups have already kind of been distributed in the U.S.
2534505	2537546	You seem to know about this, Mel?
2537826	2539807	I know they've kind of been hawking the machines to U.S.
2540147	2540707	arcades.
2541340	2557282	But of course, there's companies out there that hawk the mechs too, like US arcades too, so I don't know if Animero's necessarily launched in the US, but... Well, it has been targeted in the US for a while, I mean, like, if you went to... I forget what the major arcade game convention is in Vegas...
2560194	2560594	DarkSakura,
2590554	2593376	about a year ago when I did a big interview for DDR Spotlight.
2593396	2594778	Right, I remember reading that.
2595178	2600041	And, you know, like, kind of off the record, we were talking about, well, how come you would never see, like, Konomics or anything in Arcade yet?
2600382	2607267	Yeah, it told us, basically, it would have been a really bad move to put out, like, during this whole lawsuit, to put out a new US mix.
2607627	2611810	You know, so Adamir would be saying, you know, what kind of, you know, strategy is that?
2611850	2615873	You know, you're being sued for something, and you're already putting out a new Arcade mix?
2615893	2616794	That's, you know, not right.
2616894	2617795	It wouldn't look good.
2618234	2618414	Right.
2618694	2623057	But now this kind of opens the door here, it looks like, sounds like, so who knows what might happen.
2623097	2628961	I'm guessing probably someone else is going to distribute the Konami game since, yeah, I guess Konami shut down its coin off.
2629081	2636885	Oh yeah, I think it's a given somebody's going to step in and fill in that void and we'll see something coming from Konami in the near future.
2637286	2637786	Possibly.
2638026	2638506	We'll see.
2639107	2641428	Maybe in the future we can get Jason on this show.
2641448	2642569	We've got to work on that.
2642589	2645871	We've got to try and smooth him to get him on this program at some point.
2645951	2647532	Well, I've got pretty good, you know,
2651576	2655359	I was about to ask, what's going on?
2655379	2656761	Do you want to update us on DDR Spot?
2656781	2664308	I keep forgetting you're a major part of the DDR Spot group, so you want to say any plugs for DDR Spot, what's going on there?
2664488	2670252	Well, right now, yeah, our site is down for more maiming because we're going for a new launch right now.
2670292	2672793	We're basically tweaking a few things on the back end.
2673173	2676015	We're targeting something to probably late this week.
2676035	2677536	We're about to launch everything.
2677576	2679077	It's going to have a new look, new feel.
2679257	2679517	Cool.
2679858	2685461	It's going to have quite a few new goodies and a lot of things that haven't been there before and haven't been really on any other DDR sites.
2685641	2688623	One thing I have to ask, you can say no comment if you want, forums.com.
2689525	2690165	And try that again?
2691046	2694227	We're looking at something alternate to forums, actually.
2694767	2705671	I don't know if I'm necessarily at liberty to say it right now, but I will say there will be a way you can interact with all members without having forums.
2705912	2711974	There's a way to interact one-on-one with either the members, the lurkers, or with the staff itself.
2712154	2714235	Don't want to get you in trouble, so we'll just say tune in to win.
2714275	2714495	Wow.
2715948	2718952	Alright, so DDRspot.com coming back very soon.
2718992	2719552	Keep an eye on it.
2719572	2721374	I'm sure they'll announce that everywhere.
2721434	2723697	We'll mention it on this show for sure once we see this back up.
2723977	2724498	Yeah, wonderful.
2724538	2726520	And maybe we'll have the staff here sometime as well too.
2726620	2727261	Looking forward to that.
2727281	2728483	We've got to get that to work sometime.
2728523	2729123	That'll be awesome.
2729764	2731666	Alright, how about a quick break everybody?
2731706	2732567	Let's take a really quick break.
2732587	2732988	We'll come back.
2733936	2734636	What do I get to break?
2735277	2735437	What?
2735737	2736558	What do I get to break?
2739520	2740440	That dish, no.
2741381	2743282	I wanted to start, actually there's something I wanted to play.
2743302	2744923	I want to start this break off with something.
2745784	2747305	Loki, explain the background on this.
2747345	2751548	This is the good version of the song you were talking to me about earlier.
2751668	2754590	Alright, this song that's going to be played is Instant Love.
2754670	2757712	It was basically a training stage in Beatmania 3.
2757752	2757812	Now...
2759793	2760193	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
2780054	2781215	The guy did 20 November.
2781915	2783096	DJ Nagarero.
2783236	2783416	Yeah.
2783796	2785417	So anyways, I'm going to try to find his CD.
2785477	2788238	I think he actually put out a CD because I was visiting his website.
2788538	2792560	And we're trying to find that, import it, and maybe there'll be a clean version of Instant Love we can listen to.
2792640	2794521	But I have no guarantees on that.
2794541	2795822	But just listen to the backgrounds.
2796062	2800686	So this is the one time we're going to make an exception and actually play Let Them Move, because this is a good version.
2800706	2812315	Yeah, just try not to be annoyed by DJ Konami telling you how to play Beatmania, but just listen to the background and... Okay, so just, you know, preface, there's going to be instructions on how to play Beatmania, in case you didn't know.
2812936	2816098	After that... I'm sorry?
2816659	2821723	Well, for any of the old school hip-hop heads, I think DJ Konami looks straight up like a broke-ass Fab Five Freddy.
2822395	2824296	Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!
2851238	2855861	I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.
2856521	2859103	Listen carefully and try to follow.
2859984	2862085	The object will come down from the top.
2862405	2866268	When it hits the red line, push the button.
2867288	2870350	When it hits the red line, turn the table.
2871051	2871711	You get it?
2872091	2873812	Alright, let's practice.
2904773	2905333	Easy, huh?
2905473	2908294	Alright, let's go on to the scratch game.
2908314	2910854	When the objects reach the red line, scratch!
2910874	2914435	With the fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.
2940655	2941335	and the turntable.
2941616	2943417	It's hard, but you can do it!
2945018	2945218	Okay!
2945338	2946378	Effector time!
2946418	2947799	Here's the spec of the new Beatmania!

3288447	3290708	Yo, and it goes a little somethin' like this, yo
3295393	3303921	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
3303961	3309866	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
3310827	3312268	Just go up the street and take a left.
3312528	3315491	No, anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3315531	3316391	Will you be my neighbor?
3317092	3318413	Won't you be my neighbor?
3318794	3320175	Didn't that guy retire finally?
3321364	3321785	What?
3322045	3322966	At least he didn't die.
3322986	3326148	I say he didn't die.
3326168	3326989	That's not an oh thing.
3327009	3328130	That's an oh good thing.
3328230	3331613	But eventually he is, and you just brought up that thought in my head.
3331673	3335076	We're all going to... Melody, I'm sorry, but we're all going to die.
3336117	3338639	Everyone's still traumatized Captain Kangaroo is gone, so...
3339571	3341032	I mean, we're Mr. Green Jeans.
3341152	3344475	I mean, I know people still coming up to me asking where the heck he is.
3344495	3345236	What am I supposed to say?
3345256	3346276	No, Mr. Rogers did not die.
3346477	3347317	He's not dead yet.
3347577	3349819	Someone on Sesame Street really recently just died.
3349839	3353542	I think the guy who played Gordon, I think he just died very recently.
3353582	3355263	I hope not Linda the Deaf Lady, I hope.
3355283	3355864	She was my favorite.
3355904	3357545	I don't think so, but like within the past couple weeks.
3357825	3358306	Gordon died?
3358326	3360508	Why is it always the brother that always got to get killed first?
3361408	3361909	Man.
3363029	3365151	Another instance of a man keeping you down.
3370424	3376420	You can address those cards and letters to Mel B. Remember, if you want the proof, go to BurtIsEvil.com
3378280	3379101	Yes, it exists.
3379201	3381663	Oh, they're reminding us about the HIV positive Muffet.
3381783	3382523	Muffet.
3384165	3385186	Little Miss Muffet.
3385206	3386567	Little Miss Muffet.
3386627	3395214	I'm sorry.
3395354	3395694	I'm sorry.
3395714	3396835	That was very bad of you.
3401919	3405382	Well, Little Miss Muffet should be choosy on which tuffet she's sitting on now, shouldn't she?
3406866	3410648	She can't just sit on any tuffet, just walks down the street and treats her to a nice dinner.
3411688	3414870	And who knows how many seats have been on that tuffet.
3416991	3418651	She should have had that tuffet tested.
3419832	3422113	She's learned how to squat on that tuffet.
3427996	3428596	I'm sorry.
3431537	3431938	Anyways...
3433668	3434869	Oh, shit, we all need to breathe.
3434889	3436771	I think I'm actually tempted to play a song.
3437191	3440374	Well, now that the show has grown to a complete and total halt.
3441075	3446559	DJ Konami, which is actually DCB under a new name, wants to warn you all that Goat Say sat on that tuffet.
3450823	3453105	For those who don't know Goat Say, all I have to say...
3454455	3455556	That's, that's go say.
3456497	3458139	That was me bending over and pretending, yeah.
3458659	3458919	Anyway.
3458939	3462262	I don't want to keep your ass on the chair.
3462823	3464084	You just sit on your tuffet there.
3466326	3468148	Keep your tuffets to yourself, bitch.
3469869	3471711	Yeah, yes, where were we?
3472772	3473212	Tuffets.
3473813	3475214	AIDS, something about, no, anyway.
3477036	3477596	Nothing with HIV.
3478579	3479919	Oh yeah, the Muppet with HIV.
3480119	3482480	I actually have a Healing Vision AIDS mix.
3482900	3483560	HIV mix.
3483880	3484220	What?
3484340	3485900	That sounds very politically incorrect.
3486220	3489421	Oh yeah, it says this DWI will give you AIDS.
3489901	3493342	And it's just a really crappy remix of Healing Vision and Max 300.
3493682	3498342	They purposely made it bad and made the set file impossible just because they were frustrated with all the remixes.
3499463	3506264	Oh, they don't like the Healing Vision remixes so they just went... They just don't like any of the remixes so they just got pissed off and made a HIV mix.
3510423	3511424	Right.
3511624	3512104	Right.
3531773	3538938	Okay, well, first of all, I recorded over old interviews, so I'm really not sure exactly.
3540659	3542380	I trimmed it up, so everything should be okay.
3542620	3545142	But you have to explain why you sound really stoned in the thing.
3545722	3551846	I think I was going on four hours of sleep, and I was really tired, and then I was traumatized by stepping state.
3552647	3553667	Okay, so stepping state.
3553687	3556509	So if you have any questions, okay, there, the cam should be better now.
3557149	3558290	I sound really retarded.
3558771	3559271	Oops, wait.
3560248	3562470	Actually, you're going to see an old picture on the cam real fast.
3562510	3564911	It'll probably update soon, so just sit tight.
3564992	3565532	Cam's working.
3566713	3569014	Okay, let's play these interviews, alright?
3570095	3578021	This is the Orange Lounge interviews for Sunday, September 7th.
3579402	3579482	8th.
3580222	3580303	8th.
3580323	3583125	The 8th.
3583265	3584225	Just remember, stepping stage.
3584405	3585106	It's all about stepping stage.
3585286	3586267	I was so tired.
3589488	3597313	This is the first of the interviews for Orange Lounge Radio, which, you know, we had the battery case off of the recorder, so it's kind of messed up.
3597373	3599935	So, we're going to go ahead and try this again.
3600395	3606479	So, go ahead and, you know, once again, we have someone who's no stranger to Orange Lounge interviews.
3607280	3609862	So, go ahead and state your info.
3611843	3613684	Con, Kiyoki, Su, Step Squad Family.
3613864	3615305	Second interview for Orange Lounge.
3615906	3616926	Completely sober this time.
3617307	3617547	Yes!
3617567	3617707	Yes!
3618752	3620873	That's not necessarily a good thing, is it?
3621933	3622573	No, not really.
3623233	3627455	I actually have Jenny here who gave me her... He's sober, but the question is, were you?
3628455	3628955	Yes!
3629595	3630816	Okay, just checking.
3630836	3631996	...on my arm when I was drunk.
3632376	3634857	She claimed she didn't draw on me, but my humor's a little hazy.
3634877	3635277	I drew on him.
3636217	3636978	Can you comment on that?
3638618	3639798	All I wrote was my email.
3640119	3642159	I was the one who drew the squid on the back of your forehead.
3642399	3642999	I mean, head.
3643980	3645540	I drew the eyes on the back of your neck.
3645560	3647261	Yeah, I remember that.
3648871	3650431	People are still wondering what the hell that was.
3650992	3652652	Who was it that beat you over the head with my bat anyway?
3653012	3653853	That was Ron Kitty.
3653893	3655833	She did not make it today, but she's here in spirit.
3657034	3657654	Ah, yes.
3658914	3666657	So, um, go ahead and, uh, you know, give your daily recap for our, uh, fun event today with the First Step Squad and etc.
3668257	3669317	Hmm, well, let me see.
3669577	3674399	Considering I was probably the first one up at six in the morning, lack of sleep, next thing to being high...
3675862	3684705	Me and Jay actually had to clean up the house a little bit, but then after that 12 o'clock rolls around, Step Squad, RTF, and Otaku Outpost rolled out to the Holiday Bowl.
3685385	3687026	From there, good times.
3687466	3691387	We actually rigged the machine, so the last round, everyone got a strike.
3692087	3694268	That was cool, but it's sad that they shut everything off.
3694328	3694668	Yes.
3695248	3701450	Yeah, they ran out of pins, so everyone who bowled rolled a strike.
3705272	3711014	On the last one, is that like the most ghetto bowling alley around that they actually ran out of pins?
3712115	3713275	It's super ghetto.
3713375	3715336	Scott's stepping stage.
3715596	3717917	I think there's nothing that can go lower than that.
3719564	3722707	They want a clarification as to what exactly this event is that you were at.
3722907	3732276	Basically, we had Cece down visiting from SoCal, and we had Liz visit.
3732316	3736499	Well, she lives in California, but she was going to school in Washington State.
3737240	3740403	So they were both in town, and we had a big gathering.
3741324	3743385	I think it started off as just Step Squad, but it grew.
3744426	3744667	Okay.
3745728	3745908	Guys.
3746813	3751114	I wasn't bowling, so I really wouldn't care about that, but that sucked.
3751154	3754515	I would have loved to see the picture of everyone, last frame, triple strike each.
3755335	3760036	They should have done that for ours, because mine were just like, oh, we're bowling, and I sucked, my score sucked.
3760897	3763957	Well, maybe, well, the thing was, they ran out of 10, so, yeah.
3764738	3766698	Oh, well, I can't score anyway.
3767238	3767538	Sniff.
3767958	3774160	Anyway, we have another couple people with us, so, yes, you.
3775131	3781513	So go ahead and state your, you know, name, everything for our lovely, brilliant listeners.
3783354	3788076	Hi, I'm Hattori Hanzo, and I'm doing... Yes, Mel, very fast.
3788676	3793057	There's just nothing like butter enough for your listeners to brighten your day.
3793638	3796439	Those lovely, wonderful people out there that we adore.
3796799	3798059	Well, we do love our listeners.
3798880	3801821	It's one thing to love your listeners, another thing to love your listeners.
3801861	3802681	They're brilliant to you.
3806209	3809112	Mel Bellby just sends sloppy wet kisses to you all.
3809592	3811874	Soda right now, and I'm feeling alright.
3814996	3817198	And I see that is a Valencia orange soda.
3817578	3819380	It is, and it's very good.
3819500	3820281	You should try one.
3820821	3821962	Is it your tasty beverage?
3823303	3828828	Well, since, you know, there aren't no other beverages to choose from, I think I'll just stick with the orange soda.
3829708	3831730	Thank you.
3832871	3835053	That was the sound of a laugh on the head.
3836128	3843071	Um, so, um, go ahead and then if you'll state your name and everything for the list.
3843111	3844611	Jamie, quick, there's a wap on your head.
3846652	3847893	By the way, I need to explain.
3848313	3853475	We were sitting outside in the backyard in lawn chairs, just lounging, going, I'm tired.
3853795	3853975	With a 40?
3854015	3854755	With a 40?
3855195	3855515	I'd have 40.
3857496	3859957	But, you know, Hanzo had orange soda.
3860937	3861638	I had milk tea.
3862878	3864159	No, it was more like a 16 ounce.
3867586	3868026	If you want to.
3869227	3869647	Hello.
3870527	3871728	My name is Jin.
3872348	3873348	However, I'm not male.
3873488	3874068	I'm a female.
3875349	3876549	That was weird.
3876569	3877810	The tape did a funny thing there.
3877970	3883572	The guy with the... Yes, don't you know Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game?
3883672	3887213	I don't know.
3887774	3888494	What happened there?
3888674	3889394	Hey, excuse me.
3889414	3891435	This is coming from the person who had the screen...
3894442	3900744	I made a reference that said, don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game.
3901004	3902445	And people got the reference.
3902945	3903845	Who plays Puzzle Fighter?
3903965	3904185	Me.
3905046	3905826	Who plays Devilot?
3905846	3905966	Me.
3907190	3908011	Devilot Super 8.
3908491	3910033	Yes, that was one of my old AOL names.
3911574	3915257	I smell the D9, like, third mix Korean gates, you know?
3916358	3923164	You've got the failed scream like what Melfi has on his signature.
3923284	3923744	Uh-oh.
3923885	3924545	Care to comment?
3924605	3925146	Care to comment?
3925906	3926666	Oh, run that by you again.
3926686	3927026	Here we go.
3927046	3927826	Let's listen to it again.
3928807	3930447	Run back a little.
3931127	3934808	I smell the denied, like, third mix Korean gates, you know?
3935708	3939489	You got the failed screen like what Mel B has on his signature.
3939509	3941569	He doesn't have that anymore.
3941609	3942069	Any comment?
3943450	3944330	Hey man, what can I say?
3944370	3945530	The world revolves around me.
3946190	3950511	You can take anything in the world, you can take six steps, and it comes back to me.
3950851	3951771	Oh, like Kevin Bacon?
3951811	3954532	Yeah, but kosher.
3958812	3960493	Mel B, the B don't stand for bacon.
3964615	3967376	I think after Disney tourney everyone thinks the B stands for bling.
3970077	3971438	The gate was the best thing ever.
3971938	3972578	I'm not kidding.
3973398	3976580	It's a clank and you know your... And you know your thread is locked.
3978195	3981237	So, anyone have any comments for listeners?
3982438	3982858	Anything?
3983678	3983878	Yeah.
3984519	3985699	Hanzo, keep talking your shit.
3985719	3988661	I'm going to jack you like I jacked that ice cream truck earlier with Jay Kinetic.
3990182	3990802	I missed that.
3991703	3994844	I don't want to know how you're going to jack Hanzo.
3994885	3995725	There's pictures.
3995825	3997226	Gary from RTF has them.
3997906	3998126	Yes?
3999087	4003529	I just have to say that half of everybody who was in that house did go and hump the ice cream van.
4004010	4004150	What?
4005504	4006444	Explain now.
4006765	4008325	I didn't even go out there.
4008345	4010506	I was like, oh, I have milk tea and 2DX, I'm happy.
4011226	4013767	So I didn't even go out there.
4013807	4014968	You didn't hump the ice cream man?
4015208	4015548	No!
4016608	4017749	I had 2DX to hump.
4017829	4021791	I mean, I'm... I fear.
4022091	4022551	I fear.
4023051	4023411	Greatly.
4024472	4027413	Yeah.
4027473	4031354	I don't know what the hell this idiot's talking about.
4031434	4032775	You were doing the solo run when we did it.
4034628	4035529	Yeah, you weren't here.
4035589	4037870	Everybody ran outside and decided to rape the ice cream man.
4038911	4040451	Then what does that have to do with me?
4041232	4041732	You missed it.
4042313	4044034	You didn't get to join in on the fun.
4044634	4045875	I was... You got here.
4046295	4047155	The black sheep.
4047175	4048636	He was the one that was left out.
4048976	4050617	You're just saying that because I'm black.
4053559	4056000	Don't make me cornroll your hair, dammit.
4058922	4061183	And this is the love of Step Squad here.
4063365	4063805	And he left.
4064520	4066221	This is a comment from the chat room right now.
4066661	4067881	Mmm, raping and ice cream.
4072142	4075223	I hope not.
4075283	4076324	We have this on tape.
4081545	4083846	This is the real world, Step Squad edition.
4084666	4088887	On a closing note, Jamie, I'm waiting for Jay's birthday so we can roll up to Sacramento.
4089107	4090128	We're having rum jello.
4092628	4093949	What's this innocent look you're giving?
4095013	4098054	I have to make some jello shots.
4098894	4099194	Oh, okay.
4099754	4100875	Speaking of which, where's Brad?
4100915	4102775	Because it's his 21st birthday today, by the way.
4103215	4107316	Brad's out playing 2DX, I guess, but... Happy birthday, Brad!
4107456	4108776	We've got to make jello shots for him, too.
4108956	4109917	Anyway, oh yes, back to the interviews.
4109937	4111297	Yeah, no, I'll go.
4111857	4112077	Okay.
4112577	4117259	If everybody pitches him a dollar, I will cornroll Khan's leg.
4118559	4118839	Here.
4120119	4121260	It's a nice little rose.
4121280	4122080	It's pretty.
4122100	4122920	Oh.
4123590	4123930	How?
4124891	4134678	He doesn't have... What was that?
4134778	4135198	Run away!
4137840	4139561	We have another absentee.
4139601	4142523	Well, you heard it here first on Orange Lodge Radio.
4143023	4143284	Yay.
4144985	4145805	That was weird.
4147687	4148627	Our thoughts exactly.
4151735	4153337	That's what you get when you get sleep deprived people.
4157492	4159033	I should delete it out of the silence, but I didn't want to.
4159053	4161715	This is the second interview for Orange Lounge Radio.
4162355	4165718	And go ahead and, you know, state your name, no nickname.
4165738	4167739	I feel like I'm about to fall asleep.
4169440	4171341	I had actually taken a nap outside.
4171442	4174143	This is Jamie doing NPR Orange Lounge.
4174183	4174824	That's what this is.
4174864	4176685	This is the NPR edition of Orange Lounge.
4176785	4180188	I had already taken, like, a ten minute nap outside in one of the lounge chairs.
4180288	4181308	A ten whole minutes?
4181488	4181909	No!
4183241	4184402	Idea for our listeners?
4185222	4189243	Oh, Liz, I usually go by Santoki on message boards and such.
4190284	4191304	And you're visiting from where?
4191964	4196766	Oh, actually, I live in California, but I'm on summer vacation from school in Seattle.
4198647	4200707	And you've been with Step Squad for how long?
4201688	4204349	Since March of 2001.
4206089	4207450	Before there was DDR.
4207850	4211011	Well, before it was all over the place anyway, I guess.
4212165	4215407	That's been like four years at least.
4215887	4220890	It has to be more than that because I was living in Alabama when I first knew you online.
4221090	4223191	Oh my god, memories.
4226413	4228734	Do you have any words to say for listeners?
4229715	4230856	What's your DDR experience?
4232034	4235195	My DDR experience isn't really that much.
4236355	4242617	I used to just play for fun, but I haven't actually been on a machine in a year or so.
4243218	4250780	But I usually play for fun when friends are around, but I haven't competed in tournaments or anything.
4251520	4252761	Do you have any other favorite games?
4254181	4255161	No, not really.
4255421	4257322	Usually puzzle games, actually.
4258562	4260283	So do you have any final words for the listeners?
4262406	4263367	No, not really.
4263847	4264187	Sorry.
4265208	4265748	Go to college.
4265909	4266289	All of you.
4266409	4267770	You're illiterate.
4268390	4271053	Get an education because it's very important.
4271273	4273194	You can't spend your whole life playing games.
4274115	4274515	I can.
4275056	4279539	Wow!
4280420	4280840	Whoa.
4280860	4282041	The end.
4282481	4283722	That was the last interview.
4284223	4285083	What's all this then?
4285264	4286104	Just leftovers.
4286124	4286545	Bye.
4288721	4290002	Is there anything in here?
4290022	4291823	Yeah, this is everyone trying to say goodbye.
4291843	4296425	Yeah, this is the goodbye.
4299367	4300508	Hi, Orange Lounge.
4301028	4305290	Yeah, Sapporo was good, and Orange Lounge kicks ass, and you should listen to it.
4306511	4311374	SSF, RTF, Mountain Mike's, ASS, and fucking Nazi.
4314015	4314936	All I have to say is,
4315865	4318966	If Orange Lounge starts playing Fozzy, I'd have to hurt someone.
4319666	4320506	That will not happen.
4321186	4322427	Thank the gods.
4324567	4326328	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
4326468	4329248	Play more Orange Lounge songs, like every day, all the time.
4329868	4330509	Yeah, we do.
4330969	4331269	Yes!
4332929	4335550	Oh, and that brings an end to Jamie's interviews.
4336070	4337670	Very random, but very cool.
4337710	4339351	Thank you for getting that for us, Jamie.
4339691	4340631	We appreciate it.
4341630	4344012	I took a nice long nap when I got home.
4346033	4346873	She's okay now.
4346913	4351016	If you're worried about Jamie, she's eating a couple donuts and she's got the sugar back in her.
4351076	4351776	She's okay now.
4351836	4357880	It's too bad I didn't record Jessica and I singing Absolute on the way home.
4360222	4362223	We were in full Katimu style.
4363294	4367477	I was singing a little bit of Summer Vacation there when somebody on one of the tapes there mentioned Summer Vacation.
4369918	4373200	Anyway, yeah, my horrible impression of Summer Vacation.
4373240	4377103	I'm going to have to get those vocals, that guy doing the vocal version of Dropout and all that stuff.
4377123	4378804	I'm going to have to get that sometime, play it on the show.
4378864	4379204	We got them?
4379604	4380565	All right, get them for us.
4380585	4382907	I remember they were on some website, but they're probably archived by now.
4383527	4384087	All right, cool.
4386189	4386229	Um...
4387381	4388781	Let's talk about this.
4389261	4393582	This would be an interesting interview I thought you all would be interested in hearing about.
4394163	4397023	This is from Metropolis Magazine.
4397123	4398124	Metropolis, I'm sorry.
4399584	4402585	I've got a great career in radio ahead of me, don't I?
4403805	4405685	Rob is very edumacated.
4406606	4408226	I dropped out of college.
4408286	4409166	Look at me now.
4409246	4410026	I'm a star.
4410526	4412267	So smart, SMRT.
4414195	4417697	Team Smart, SMRT for live, yo!
4417977	4419738	Hooked on phonics, worked for Rob.
4420059	4421660	Hey, SMRT, let me think.
4421720	4427803	Sacramento, Metro Office, Radio Talent.
4428103	4428544	There we go.
4429504	4431686	Sacramento, Metro Office, Radio Talent.
4431746	4432166	Smart.
4433727	4434507	SMRT.
4434567	4435768	He's a real fart spiller.
4436248	4436408	What?
4436468	4437409	I mean, fart filler.
4443192	4443693	Ah, boy.
4444793	4447614	We've got an... Brad!
4448114	4449234	Happy birthday, Brad.
4449514	4450254	Brad, come here.
4451114	4451574	Come here.
4454015	4455995	Hold on, we're going to get to that in a minute.
4456535	4458216	Who wants to give Brad his birthday spankings?
4459976	4461776	Irene, let's administer those birthday spankings.
4461816	4462216	You're on air.
4462737	4463017	Okay.
4464597	4465437	Bend over, baby.
4467638	4468438	And close your eyes.
4468478	4469438	It might hurt a little bit.
4472664	4473605	Back up to the camera.
4473625	4474345	Beep, beep, beep.
4474366	4475446	Can everybody see?
4475506	4479829	Do we have... Okay, spanking, spanking.
4479889	4484233	Because it's great radio, alright.
4484273	4484593	Ready?
4484633	4485233	Here we go.
4485333	4485614	Yes, he's 21.
4485694	4486694	Okay, here we go.
4501425	4506670	Ooh, ah, ooh, hey, hey, ow, ow, why?
4507350	4508451	Why me?
4509112	4510754	Oh, God, no.
4515598	4516319	Yeah, I don't get it.
4516339	4517059	You like it at home.
4517179	4518240	I thought we were at 21 by now.
4523743	4525523	and 1 million to grow on.
4525543	4527684	Alright, alright, alright.
4527704	4529404	I think Brad's starting to like this.
4529644	4531105	I was so close, I was.
4531485	4531985	You can stop.
4532685	4533886	You can stop grabbing me yet.
4535166	4536467	She'll spank the monkey later.
4537667	4538227	Whoa!
4539327	4539968	What was that comment?
4540248	4541568	She'll spank the monkey later.
4542268	4542928	Are you guys leaving?
4543829	4545469	Alright, have fun at food.
4545489	4546430	Oh, you guys are coming back?
4546530	4546770	Okay.
4547890	4548870	Are you guys going to Dairy Queen?
4549270	4551011	I want the chicken strip thing.
4552262	4553602	Okay, I'll share yours.
4553662	4555283	Anyway, yeah, great radio, huh?
4555303	4556023	Totally derailed.
4556443	4557843	Oh, yes, interview.
4558143	4558623	Oh, yes.
4559724	4561764	From Metrolopis Magazine.
4562624	4564445	Metrolopis.
4565305	4566885	Papadopolis Magazine.
4567705	4570366	Weren't those the neighbors on Three's Company?
4570506	4571446	No, it was Webster.
4571946	4572586	Oh, Webster.
4575467	4577227	The Papadopoli.
4578448	4580528	This show's never going to get on track, I'm sorry.
4581531	4584233	I'm trying to find an actual Paula Terry song to play in the background.
4584273	4585113	Oh, I found one, yay.
4585574	4587515	We have an interview with Paula Terry.
4588015	4590817	Yes, and this is about life in Japan.
4593319	4598922	Yes, for those who don't know Paula Terry, she's the singer that likes to torture us all in her DDR music.
4598942	4600383	She can't hold a key.
4603305	4605827	Let's hear, uh, where are you from, Paula Terry?
4606753	4608114	Sydney, Australia Sydney, Australia
4624600	4625901	And what brought you to Japan?
4626441	4628663	When I was in Sydney, I had friends who lived here.
4628903	4632266	At the time, I had the travel age.
4632726	4634988	When I was a child, I lived in France for four years.
4635508	4639991	So at that stage of my life, back in Sydney, I felt I wanted to travel again.
4640392	4643234	Also, I wanted to know anything about Japan.
4644014	4647797	I met these girls who had worked holidays in Japan.
4648237	4648798	They worked in...
4649602	4654466	Clubs and you come up to them and say, well, you're a singer.
4654486	4656207	They have foreign singers in these clubs.
4656728	4658529	You can give me a visa and make money.
4658669	4659770	Why not work in Japan?
4660170	4664113	So I went out and took the risk and I've been here ever since.
4664333	4665695	Wow, that's really nice, Paula.
4665955	4667416	Okay, now doing Paula's voice.
4667456	4668677	The next question will be Jamie.
4669558	4671219	Everybody can do Paula's voice on one question.
4671259	4671819	I'll do this.
4672220	4672760	Okay, Jamie.
4673320	4673881	I'm sorry, Paula.
4676523	4677704	How long have you been singing?
4678896	4684051	Well, my brother's an opera singer, and my brother's, like, a classical guitarist.
4684753	4685856	So I'm from the musical family!
4688183	4692186	I love singing from being a little girl, but I really only started out to learn it when I was 16.
4693888	4695509	And I skipped a line.
4695549	4695969	No, you got it.
4696490	4698591	And my mother sent me an opera singing teacher.
4698932	4701554	I love opera, but it wasn't for me.
4702454	4704696	When I was 20, I decided to study jazz singing.
4704956	4706237	I really love funky jazz music.
4706518	4708299	Oh, play that funky jazz music, white girl.
4708319	4709620	I love other funky things, too.
4711502	4715505	Okay, now doing the voice of Paula will be Mel B. So, um...
4716678	4718201	How long have you been boinking Naoki?
4718983	4721968	I'm just kidding.
4724593	4725676	Where do you sing, Paula?
4727063	4733125	permanent booking at the Intercontinental Hotel on Tokyo Bay on Thursdays and Fridays from 7.30 p.m.
4733205	4734145	to 11 p.m.
4734685	4736286	I sing accompanied by a penis.
4741167	4741587	It's great.
4741647	4742488	We play everything.
4742648	4749109	Then on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I play in a Ginza at a piano ball, which is a totally different style, a slightly older audience.
4750390	4751390	Who's doing Paula's voice next?
4753291	4754351	Oh, Melody, you pooper.
4755023	4755844	Okay, we're back to Matt.
4755884	4756084	Okay.
4756544	4758365	What sort of things do you sing, Paula?
4758926	4762688	My repertoire goes from 30s to the 90s.
4763108	4764269	I see you've been smoking, Paula.
4764289	4773495	I have to keep up with the times.
4773615	4778118	Recently, everywhere I worked, people were requesting some songs from Titanic.
4778318	4780340	So I had to buy the CD and learn it.
4780800	4782081	I also sing to carpenters.
4782870	4784671	But I don't try to imitate the originals.
4785272	4788354	I try to sing them in a different style.
4788834	4789475	That would be key.
4790856	4792457	To keep myself interested.
4792757	4795539	I also really sing the standard jazz tunes like Summertime.
4796019	4798721	You can do that in any number of styles.
4799322	4799662	Okay.
4800042	4802244	Next, Jamie doing Paula's voice again.
4802704	4804625	Paula, are you planning to stay in Japan?
4808868	4809369	Right here, yes.
4810999	4813300	Uh, yeah, uh, I guess.
4815760	4817060	Yes, I am.
4817580	4824902	I just finished recording of my first CD, which comes out September 2-3.
4826402	4829403	It's called, uh... Just Break Away.
4830703	4831883	Uh, what's that mean?
4833144	4839225	So, I'm going to wait around and see how well that does.
4840502	4842424	I'm very pleased with it.
4843165	4849790	If it goes well, I'll stay longer in the United States.
4851152	4852773	Anything is possible in Japan.
4852793	4854635	It's an incredible place.
4860396	4866858	Waking up with a bit of a hangover, having a bad hair day, and not being able to blend into the background.
4867198	4869459	I just can't seem to be inconspicuous.
4869859	4876461	It may be half paranoia, but I often feel that people are staring at me.
4876901	4878361	Oh my god, you sounded like Vera.
4879902	4882063	Like from In Living Color.
4883283	4884103	Hi.
4884183	4885324	I'm so embarrassed.
4889284	4891607	Paula, do you organize your CDs alphabetically?
4892127	4893048	Definitely not.
4893289	4894710	I favor total disorder.
4895171	4896752	They're all in piles on the floor.
4896933	4898434	I have a drawback full of CDs.
4898735	4903140	I don't play them often, but the ones that I like best are the ones in the piles.
4903580	4905142	Are we actually going to do this whole interview here?
4905182	4907625	Let's see if we can find some interesting questions here.
4909907	4910448	Let's do this one.
4911269	4912650	Okay, it's like a game show.
4912690	4915872	You have to spend the rest of your life trapped on the Yamanote line.
4916332	4919634	You're allowed to take one book, one CD, and one luxury item.
4919714	4920414	What would they be?
4922655	4923956	First, I need tampons.
4926037	4927058	I need Naoki's hat.
4931140	4937904	I'd like to record a CD of my favorite songs.
4939031	4943616	from Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, right up to the 90s, the brand new heavies.
4943736	4944517	Hey, that's a good group.
4944537	4944958	She has taste.
4948400	4951704	Okay, uh... Let's do this one here.
4951884	4952725	Last question, last question.
4953226	4957050	What's the weirdest thing you've ever seen or experienced in Japan, Politary?
4957411	4961595	A lot of weird things have happened to me here, but one thing in particular comes to mind.
4961996	4965960	I was told this story by a friend who worked in a hostess club where I was singing.
4966201	4969004	The hostesses were all blonde, gaging, and they said...
4969584	4971545	That there was one man... Whatever!
4971986	4972806	Go fuck yourself!
4973747	4982692	Anyways, so they were saying that there was this one man who used to come in and beg them to sell a piece of their pubic hair for 10,000 yen per piece.
4983053	4990337	So these girls would go in and use the toilets and pluck hair out of the heads and rub it until they were curly and looked authentic.
4990677	4992058	And then they would come back and sell it.
4993019	4994620	Paula, you're so clever!
4995458	5002903	By the way, I don't want to really go into this thing with me and, uh, Naoki, but, uh, let's just say I'm sitting on his tuffet there.
5004765	5015012	Or, actually, he, well, yeah, my tuffet and, uh, yeah, there's some definite tuff, uh, touchy in there and stuff, and... Okay, I'm gonna go now.
5015332	5016273	We'll see you!
5016493	5019215	Hey, look over here.
5021670	5025471	And on that note, I think we need to take a break and let this show try to find its life again.
5025591	5029612	So, we'll be back.
5030232	5030932	Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
5031372	5034652	The chat room is just kind of, I can feel that blink from the chat room.
5034672	5035993	Just blink, blink, blink, blink.
5036273	5038113	What the fuck are these people doing?
5038773	5041514	My speakers are crying right now.
5042814	5044154	I'm going to go Kmart and get me some bitches.
5044294	5045234	You are my destiny!
5045255	5047675	You are my destiny!
5050615	5057172	We're going to take a quick break, do a request that I saw in the chat room last break, and another little fun song, and we'll be right back.
5087942	5089168	So you can be my my my my
5122307	5151802	Honey, what we call love I still don't think of you at first My family still comes above If you wanna capture me It's as simple as can be Mr. Lennon said it, all you need is Mr. Lennon said it, all you need is Mr. Lennon said it, all you need is Love, my love, my love, my love, my love My love, my love, my love, my love
5222386	5223471	and all that is.
5371174	5372196	Thanks for watching!
5403354	5405196	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5455475	5460299	From Step Squad to Orange Labs, this DDR sucks!
5460659	5463761	Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!
5484680	5490184	Okay, we were looking at the, somebody wanted to see the statistics for the station during the break.
5490225	5490905	We were taking a look.
5491626	5498931	A lot more listeners in Japan recently, so a big hello to our friends overseas in Japan who started the addiction and it looks like we're just finishing it.
5499852	5504756	If there's any truth to those rumors that DDR is dying in Japan, but somebody must still love it over there.
5504876	5509600	I guess 2DX is a very big game over there still, as well as Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, very big.
5510180	5511140	Still, from what we hear.
5511220	5512541	Of course, I guess we don't really know.
5512941	5521865	But if anybody over there wants to email us, if you can write in English, because I don't know much Japanese, but if you do send Japanese... Many people in Japan know English very well.
5522145	5523465	It's required learning for school.
5523705	5531588	Obviously, if they're going to understand me giving the email address, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, give us a holler about what DDR and the Belmonte scene is like over there.
5531608	5532309	We'd love to hear about it.
5532749	5533789	I'm being brought food.
5533829	5534650	Isn't that lovely?
5535370	5535730	It is great.
5536570	5540834	So anyways, since you're eating and you're eating, I guess I could do the sim scene update.
5557622	5558202	Some update.
5558542	5558803	Okay.
5559663	5559963	All right.
5560043	5563004	Well, actually, we actually have some new versions of stuff out there.
5563825	5568987	As you probably remember from my FU message of the week, DWI 203.
5569627	5570307	It's brand new.
5570668	5573349	There is one feature, though, I absolutely love in it.
5573709	5579071	It's the fact that every time you rebuild your song list, it exports a HTML file with your entire song list.
5579591	5585194	So now I can actually update my song list and post it so people can see how many damn songs I actually have, which is...
5586014	5588276	1,218 right now.
5590478	5594441	Chatroom is saying, Slinky in the chatroom says, Stepmania Max 3 is coming out tomorrow.
5594661	5598564	I don't know if that's BS or what, but... Why would Slinky lie to us?
5598604	5599185	He loves us.
5599265	5605570	I don't know, but I play... Actually, though, I have to give props to Stepmania because it saved my party last night.
5606531	5613776	Because since... For some reason, I don't know what it is, but some versions of DWI, they don't work my pads, and they don't work with...
5615157	5616959	with my visualizations in the background.
5617380	5627172	So I had to find something to work with my pads, and luckily I had a beta 6 of Step Mania 5, I believe, or 3 or whatever, and it worked, and it worked well.
5627553	5628374	I was very pleased.
5628955	5631478	So we played on Step Mania all last night, and it was awesome.
5632875	5636238	Other than that, DDRPC, two new characters have been released.
5636479	5638660	Our fourth set of new characters.
5639021	5640002	No pantsless rage?
5640742	5641803	No pantsless rage.
5643265	5644385	No three-titted at me.
5644966	5649750	It was Rico and... Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
5651051	5652212	Ah, some chick, I don't know.
5652713	5653914	Rico and some chick.
5654715	5656136	Rico and his hoe, okay.
5656896	5657117	So...
5658801	5663203	So, that was that, and they have like white hair and look stupid, whatever.
5663643	5665463	So, that's some new stuff there.
5665483	5666404	We go not so sloppy.
5667304	5670865	Other than that, um... We go ugly.
5671625	5673466	Other than that, let's see, uh... Sylvia.
5674926	5676527	Whatever, Sylvia is ho.
5676747	5677687	It's the same thing.
5678808	5680208	Oh, Sylvia, yes.
5681088	5683889	But, um... See, last night, party.
5684289	5685350	That was very fun.
5685510	5685690	We got...
5687096	5689637	Tell us about your little party while I shove chicken strips in my mouth.
5689797	5690057	Okay.
5690437	5692017	Well, I had a party last night for my birthday.
5692037	5693978	You know, I had a little Beemani party there.
5694018	5694938	Got to play on the Sim.
5695698	5700899	Some of the popular songs there were Break Your Neck from Busta Rhymes.
5701139	5702900	Peanut Butter Jelly, the baseball band.
5702920	5704000	Yeah, Peanut Butter Jelly.
5704040	5706580	They loved that remix from Tourney Mix 2.
5707060	5707741	That was pretty good.
5707821	5708061	No, wait.
5708161	5708901	No, that's not Tourney Mix 2.
5708941	5710641	That's something else.
5710661	5711581	But anyways, it's out there.
5712642	5713442	There was also...
5714682	5715002	I voted a poop.
5740323	5740903	Whoopie on that!
5741223	5741864	Big pile of the PCs.
5741944	5750707	So I assume that since Tourney Mix 2 has been judging for about, well, close to a couple weeks now, that pretty soon we'll have results of who won that.
5750787	5753147	I don't... No, I guess look for that.
5754908	5755408	Jamie won.
5757009	5757509	Huh?
5758849	5761890	Anyways... I have the update from the other room.
5762831	5763251	Okay.
5763791	5765731	I owned everybody in Tekken 4, thank you.
5765852	5767072	Well, I just owned Dave.
5768752	5769233	Big Cans Part 2
5790545	5791546	Yeah, something like that.
5791826	5792707	Big hands part two.
5793788	5796810	See, other than that, some news, well, just some reminders.
5797351	5801234	It looks like Team Guilo, their site's coming up October 1st, so look for that.
5801314	5808439	I think, I'm not sure what their actual address is going to be, because Team Guilo got bought up by some guy.
5808559	5809020	I don't know.
5809160	5812703	There's nothing there, but they bought the domain name, so who knows for that.
5813023	5815485	DWI, Insane... Okay, that's my FU of the week.
5815845	5817146	Fuck you to Cyber Squatters.
5817286	5818087	I hate that shit.
5819861	5823822	Unless they've got a valid use for the name Team Guilo, they shouldn't be allowed to buy that domain name.
5824382	5828203	Julia Roberts needs to take them to court because she got her domain name and she knows how to do it.
5828903	5829163	That's all.
5829404	5829604	Okay.
5830384	5835205	Anyways, DWI Insanity is going to be coming back up probably later this week.
5835245	5839646	They said one or two weeks about a week ago, so I guess we can look for that.
5840066	5842527	And that's pretty much it for now.
5845327	5845627	Whee!
5846608	5847148	I'll have gold.
5847228	5847568	Thank you.
5849841	5851964	Freestyle Fridays
5867762	5872344	I don't freestyle very well at all, so I haven't been paying too much attention to this, but I said I'd go watch sometime.
5872764	5877747	But I guess a bunch of the good freestylers in town trying to get together and just have some fun little challenges and things like that.
5878047	5880268	What are some fun ways to get people together?
5880288	5882749	Does it have to be scheduled things?
5882769	5885090	Could it just be everybody just kind of convening at one place?
5885650	5886550	Like the bar cheers?
5886610	5891112	We used to have our big gathering when we were trying to unlock stuff on Max 2 before they put in the code.
5891253	5891913	Uh-huh, true.
5892113	5894214	You know, which pissed me and a bunch of people off.
5895171	5899074	But, you know, that was something that got the community together, was that common goal.
5899114	5905279	You know, there's other Max 2 machines where people don't know how the machines work well enough to put in the code, I guess, if you're, you know, retarded.
5905940	5915408	But, you know, there's all kinds of, you know, there's mini tourneys, there's our, you know, every so often bit money party that people randomly throw at random houses.
5917249	5919411	Well, you guys going to any fun parties in the Bay Area?
5919431	5920572	What do they do in the Bay Area?
5920652	5922193	What kind of get-togethers do you guys do over there?
5922554	5924095	Because we know we do it here in SAC, but...
5925485	5929473	Well, you know, at Scandia over by Susan Valley or wherever it is.
5929873	5931837	They have their Friday Night Fever and, I mean...
5932538	5940883	Even people like RTF from the Bay Area, a lot of them, Friday nights, they make the roadie up there because the freestyle pod over there is so intense out there.
5940903	5943264	It's such, things are really picking up over there.
5943645	5958754	As far as get-togethers, I guess, for people like RTF Steps, well, we've gotten to a point where we like doing stuff, not just in B-Mind, we like doing sports stuff, like we either have to take a game of basketball or we'll have a big football game, which we are actually coming up, which is coming up soon, I think in early October.
5959634	5964117	No, it's a fun thing to just throw people around instead of stepping on arrows, you know.
5965678	5968680	I liked the whole bowling thing from last Sunday.
5969841	5970161	Cool.
5970741	5973663	Any other fun get-togethers you guys have been to that have been Bomani-related?
5975287	5976628	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5998738	5999899	Thanks for watching!
6016613	6018296	and just make sure there's no drama.
6019177	6021360	Anybody that's going to cause drama in your group, get them out.
6021821	6029292	You know, why don't they just do like, that'd be pretty cool, is, you know, they have like hacker conventions and conventions for everything.
6029472	6030494	What about BimaniCon?
6032589	6033930	Okay, this is a good topic.
6034030	6037391	Why hasn't there been a big national Bomani convention yet, do you think?
6037592	6042994	Do you think it's because the tournaments kind of take care of that on a smaller scale, so there's no need or desire for something national?
6043214	6056100	Do you think it's just because the Bomani audience is mostly, now I know just about all of us, in fact, yes, all of us in this room are an exception, but the Bomani community is largely a high school base, which can't really afford to take the time to travel out of town for a weekend.
6056460	6058021	What do you think the reasons are behind that?
6058061	6060763	First and foremost, I've been going to conventions for seven years now.
6060783	6061303	Uh-huh.
6062003	6062443	DarkSakura.com
6085269	6092835	You couldn't do, I think, a convention on just Beimani alone without, you know, without having it Beimani Plus.
6093596	6107547	You know, as far as a convention setting goes, I mean, it's not like you can sit there and watch, you know, go to a room and watch, you know, movies of people playing DDR or, you know, like you have movie rooms at anime sci-fi conventions or... You'd have a room that's like, oh my gods, meet Jason Enos and Mel B. Yeah.
6112109	6114680	I think my importance level has just shot down 60 notches.
6117573	6127719	I don't think for Baymani alone, as far as a convention setting, that it would be enough.
6128359	6131421	You could maybe have your little small get-together.
6132302	6141146	If it was something associated with, say, the release of a new game, something press-related, that might draw a crowd, I think.
6141727	6144168	But you couldn't have BaymaniCon every year.
6144208	6145369	I don't think that it would be big enough.
6146286	6151970	Okay, well then maybe they can, instead of just Bomani, have like an amusing music gaming convention or something like that.
6151990	6160116	Because then you have Bomani stuff, you've got, you know, the Pump It Up, Parappa, all the music games, you know, Parappa and all that.
6161929	6166692	Well, a music gaming... I can see where a music gaming... Well, there is Classic Gaming Con that happens in Las Vegas.
6167252	6167973	That's cool.
6168173	6168653	That's cool.
6169073	6171795	I guess if Classic Gaming Con can pull it off.
6171815	6177198	But they also have the betas, the prototypes, you know, old games that were supposed to come out that never did come out.
6177398	6182181	And I think that basically anything that was coming out for Beimani has come out except for, you know, Smomics.
6183542	6189326	The Smop one that was supposed... There was supposed to... There's a group called Smop in Japan.
6189366	6191247	There's basically like the Japanese version of...
6191667	6195828	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6211772	6214073	That has to be the worst Beaumontium I've ever played.
6214133	6217634	I mean, I like some of the music, don't get me wrong, but just the interface and everything, I didn't care for it.
6217714	6217934	Okay.
6218334	6219115	Just want to share.
6219155	6225697	Seeing, since I do have all the Dreams Come True stuff and the True Kiss Destination, I have to say, all of those suck.
6226817	6227678	They both suck.
6228018	6229018	They're just awful.
6229298	6231539	All their music just is very awful.
6231879	6237241	I mean, aside from Sexy Planet and, like, Celebrate Night, they just, they all suck.
6238782	6239582	I liked Africa.
6239662	6241343	That's the one song I liked on True Kiss Destination.
6241363	6241843	That was a cool song.
6241863	6243924	Okay, but they've got one song called The Monster.
6244364	6246445	The monster is coming.
6246525	6247785	It's just, like, so awful.
6248746	6251387	But, like, yeah, OHA is pretty fun.
6251647	6254468	I mean, but other than that, it's just crap.
6256288	6258349	However, the beat meaning of Future Dreams Come True is pretty cool.
6260205	6261425	You know, I don't know.
6261585	6266506	I guess maybe you could, but I'm thinking in terms of the broad spectrum of different conventions I've been to.
6267367	6272548	You know, I don't think you'd have enough to make anything larger than, you know, a one-day convention.
6273708	6275048	I don't think it would be anything.
6275209	6277369	So tournaments are pretty much as big as it's going to get.
6277709	6278169	I think so.
6279690	6282770	And then we could go back to that national tournament talk, but I think we even talked about that.
6282970	6285031	Actually, I think that was a talk last time Mel B was here.
6285051	6285591	We talked about that.
6286983	6290065	Just, uh, probably wouldn't be big enough, unfortunately.
6290085	6297909	You'd have to have huge prizes to entice people who want to fly all the way out to, you know, Las Vegas, uh, Bay Area, wherever you would choose to hold the tournament.
6297949	6299030	Just, I don't know if it's possible.
6300030	6304413	Well, it's not so much about incentive and prizes, but it's also, I mean, the thing a lot of people...
6305453	6305914	and many more.
6319669	6326011	We're quite at the level of networking where we can have a bunch of arcades all in sync, all on the same page, getting it all together.
6326051	6334194	I'm not saying it can't happen, but there's just a lot more things people overlooked that have to be taken into account for such a thing to happen.
6335134	6339055	It would definitely take a lot of work, and I don't know that many people would be willing to do it.
6339115	6340516	Twins got a good idea for incentive.
6340576	6343237	Have it a strip DDR competition.
6343477	6343897	I'll judge.
6344677	6344937	I'll judge.
6348754	6354930	Also, another suggestion to make the convention more popular was to be a Bomani slash Hentai convention.
6355712	6356935	That would definitely...
6357614	6357734	S.S.R.
6357754	6358355	Strip Strip Revolution
6379487	6395596	I bought at least two of my, I have at least three Bin Money related products that I've purchased at Anime Expo, one of them being my second mixed step book, and a dance pad, and one of my versions of DDR, I think.
6395616	6399598	I think it was, one of them or the other, I don't know.
6400658	6401919	I have like a ton now, so.
6404065	6408615	Okay, well, I think we're going to take a really quick break, and then we're going to come back, and we're going to wrap up the show.
6409236	6411160	So... Wrap it up and what?
6411180	6415369	We're going to wrap it up, and we'll be right back.
6416918	6417999	What are we going to play in the break?
6418059	6419279	Oh, let's play one of your mixes.
6419299	6420820	You want to tell me a mix you want to play?
6420860	6422740	Or not one of your mixes, but one of the mixes you brought.
6423020	6423120	Okay.
6423140	6425942	You want to tell me which one you want to have the listeners hear?
6426002	6426242	Yeah.
6426402	6428462	Actually, what I was going to do is introduce this one.
6429063	6431364	Back in Fifth Mix, they had a competition, I guess.
6431444	6434405	I haven't really heard much about it, for a Paranoia remix.
6434645	6438166	And this guy who goes by the name STM won that competition.
6438306	6443088	Well, I happened to find his website, and he has a Piano Ambient version of Max Unlimited.
6443548	6448470	Now, you have to listen to the background there to fully get all of it, but you will catch some of what it is.
6448571	6449311	But just listen to it.
6449391	6453113	It doesn't sound anything like you've heard before for Maximum Limited.
6454233	6455534	Alright, here we go.
6456634	6456954	Music
6495586	6496268	Thanks for watching!
6545962	6547243	Thanks for watching!
6591966	6593447	Thank you for watching!
6644063	6645785	Thank you for watching!
6725618	6729744	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo Demends It
6731048	6732889	Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 12.
6732929	6734669	When are we going to have Bongo back on this show?
6734909	6736650	Whenever Bongo's not working on a Sunday.
6736930	6738550	I better talk to my man.
6739471	6740431	Let Bongo have the day off.
6740711	6742432	That kind of got a lot of reaction in the showroom.
6742452	6743432	Kind of some mixed reaction.
6744092	6747854	Majorly positive for the Max Unlimited.
6747914	6748914	Again, a career in radio.
6749034	6749874	Far ahead for me.
6750995	6751555	Shut up.
6752235	6754276	The Sacramento Metropolis Radio.
6754296	6755096	I'm the co-host.
6755156	6755816	I can't shut up.
6756996	6757357	Smirked.
6759763	6761244	A lot of mixed reactions in the chatroom.
6762904	6764685	Kind of mostly positive.
6765645	6767566	Kind of depressing though, don't you think?
6767606	6769827	That song was kind of, I don't know, the way it was.
6769907	6771288	I just feel like throwing myself off.
6771428	6774329	I mean, Max Unlimited is depressing enough as it is because I can't pass it.
6774629	6776830	But, you know, well, I can't on basic.
6779902	6782543	Even in the chatroom, they said, Orange Lounge made me sad today.
6783043	6783863	We're sorry.
6784303	6784883	We love you.
6785203	6787544	Just remember, little Miss Muffet sat on the tuffet.
6787604	6789324	Now she has HIV.
6791185	6791825	Where's my red?
6793325	6794485	I was just commenting in the middle of that.
6794505	6798746	It was funny because Mel B was sitting here reading scripture during that little passage.
6798766	6801387	Would you like to share a little bit of that with us here, Mel?
6801407	6805768	Would you like to share some of your voiceover talent with the Max song?
6810899	6812961	Follow the light at the end of the tunnel.
6812981	6813861	Do not resist.
6814502	6815463	You shall be saved.
6815643	6816523	Not.
6817984	6821507	They'll be... 9 o'clock, I guess.
6823769	6825310	Very pretty, thank you.
6827151	6829353	That's kind of like the 5-9 piano version.
6829453	6830274	Yeah, we have an amen!
6830394	6830694	Woot!
6832936	6834277	Why don't you play it this way, please?
6837093	6844395	That's kind of like the 5ix9ine piano version we have in rotation on the Bomani Music and More program, which is always playing on the station when we're not here.
6844455	6846176	Pretty sad remix of that, too.
6846316	6848317	So is Bomani getting all depressed?
6848397	6850577	Is it the angsty phase?
6850717	6853458	Is it the suicidal goth phase of Bomani?
6853538	6855939	It will stay angsty as long as Politary keeps singing.
6858540	6861001	Everybody will want it to slit their wrists after listening to her.
6862458	6866101	At least we have Silhouette of My Mind, and that makes me happy in a sad and a gothy way.
6866362	6869845	Yeah, Silhouette of My Mind, another little slit your wrist song there from Imani.
6870045	6872347	That is a happy song if you listen to the lyrics.
6872387	6876110	Yeah, it's a happy song, but it sounds really... But I'm happy being all by myself.
6876150	6877391	I'm happy being sad.
6879673	6881615	I am quite enthusiastically upset.
6884597	6885338	Anyway...
6886095	6888196	Anyway, I guess that's it.
6888216	6889516	I guess we're going to wrap up the show now.
6890756	6892917	So, any final thoughts from everybody here in the room?
6895278	6895938	I have donuts.
6896278	6896818	You have donuts.
6896878	6897198	Right on.
6897599	6898159	Matt, Loki.
6900219	6901260	I don't like Politary.
6902160	6903120	Neither do I. It's okay.
6903440	6904061	She scares me.
6904361	6905361	Bradley, you have anything to say?
6905381	6907702	Maybe.
6908082	6908302	Maybe.
6910327	6912788	Special guest Mel B, anything you want to say?
6913349	6916150	I had no idea DJ Konami sounded like Dick Vitale.
6916430	6917851	Either way, I think he's dope.
6919312	6919672	Right on.
6920012	6922774	And Sharks Girl, Mel D, anything you want to say to our listeners?
6923134	6923554	Yawn.
6924055	6924435	Yawn.
6924995	6928957	I've driven like 280, 300 miles today so far.
6928977	6930158	I still have to drive home.
6930178	6931559	You got two more hours to go.
6933059	6934440	And I got to drive tomorrow.
6934480	6936441	I get to drive to Frisco tomorrow, so that'll be fun.
6937142	6937362	Wee!
6939039	6941701	Okay, um, what else?
6941921	6944884	There was one other quick thing I wanted to say before the show was over, and now it's slipped my mind.
6945364	6945644	Damn it.
6945944	6946965	It's slit your mind?
6946985	6954671	I actually had a quick comment on someone who wrote something about glow sticks and ghosts being in a freestyle routine.
6954711	6954971	Yes.
6955211	6966780	Funny enough, I don't know if I mentioned this before, but when I was at an Omaha freestyle tourney back in April 20th of earlier this year, someone did do a glow stick routine with ghosts, and funny enough, he failed within 15 seconds.
6968041	6969802	Somewhere, I believe, justice was served.
6971723	6972863	That's kind of sad in a way.
6973204	6979607	I'm still not sure that anything involving lights and DDR is going to top Fuzzy Hat with candles on Healing Vision.
6980387	6982268	And the number 420, either.
6985329	6987270	Oops, I gotta switch CDs here real fast.
6987290	6987851	Somebody fill.
6989051	6991132	Fill, fill, filler, fiddler, fiddler, fiddler.
6991152	6991693	Who's Phil?
6995074	6995995	Bimani is cool.
6996035	6996495	Keep playing.
6998419	6998639	Right?
7000361	7001922	This DDR sucks!
7001962	7003203	That really bugs me.
7003403	7004264	We are in joy.
7004464	7005084	Why aren't you?
7006165	7007767	We expect you a nice play again.
7009528	7014332	And now, new from Konami, the Politary sings the classics.
7015453	7015913	Oh yes.
7016754	7021077	Such wonderful... Such wonderful songs.
7026301	7027002	Move!
7027543	7028204	Move!
7029185	7030827	Let them move!
7032569	7034332	Oh yes, that's... Shine Get!
7036495	7038337	I think that's an appropriate note to end the show on.
7038417	7039178	Shine Get!
7039398	7039939	Shine Get!
7039999	7041060	Thanks for listening, everybody.
