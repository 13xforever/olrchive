00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,200
You have no morals darling.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,700
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and scorching case of purpose.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,700
Kiss my grass, nuge.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,200
Mecha lecha hai, mecha haini hoe.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,600
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Me too!

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Fuck are you?

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm working on it.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,900
Loser.

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,500
Lame.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
I'm a fart of my face.

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,700
Breathing.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,400
Grasping.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,000
Heaving.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,800
Grasping.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,500
Heaving.

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,400
Whatever.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,100
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,400
while I go listen to my written experience record.

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Da da da da da da.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,700
I am your singing solid ground.

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:38,300
Live, but not really, from Roseville Golf Land here, this is Orange Lounge Radio.

33
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,200
This is a special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, I should say.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,700
It's so special, it rides the short bike.

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,200
It's episode number 10.5.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,300
We're calling it 10 and a half.

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
Episode 10 and a half of Orange Lounge Radio.

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,200
Because this isn't Sunday, but we're fooling you.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,300
This is our special Labor Day edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

40
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,100
Because we refuse to labor the day before Labor Day.

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,780
Yes, Jamie and I are going to be taking the weekend off, so as you're listening to this

42
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,700
right now, Jamie and I are off somewhere vacationing.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
I don't want to know what you're off doing.

44
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
Somewhere sunny.

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,900
This is something I know who you'll be with.

46
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,180
Actually, well actually at the point that you're listening to this, probably Sunday

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,620
night at 7 o'clock, I'm probably going to be in Sunnyvale actually, so I might be getting

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,620
interviews and things like that.

49
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,620
Take me.

50
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,540
I wish I could, but I'm spending all weekend and you know.

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,260
I'll just make Dan take me.

52
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
It's a private getaway.

53
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
You should make Dan take you.

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,060
And now Dan's gonna be here tonight, correct?

55
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,560
Somewhere.

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,460
We're gonna have to get an interview with him at some point.

57
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,160
Oh, God.

58
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,660
So...

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,360
For those who are uninformed, Dan is my significant other,

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,660
also known as the great and terrible Dan Man X,

61
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,360
also known as Gunstar Hero,

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,960
for people who have seen me mention that, so...

63
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,460
Right on.

64
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,460
So, yes, also known as Big Hater of Bimani.

65
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,260
He is not a big hater of Bimani.

66
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,860
He's the one who got all, you know, who, like, you know,

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,060
creamed his pants when he's played Guitar Freaks.

68
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,760
Guitar Freaks.

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,360
There you go, Guitar Freaks is where it's at.

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,080
Visual no, nobody's allowed to vision

71
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,920
So, yeah, we're it's gonna be a very experimental show tonight, it might not even be two hours long

72
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,800
It might be a weird kind of segment. We're kind of trying to divvy this up in a little segment

73
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,280
So Brad is our timekeeper right now. He'll let me know when we hit 40 minutes for the first segment, right?

74
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,140
We hit yes. Yes. Yes. In fact, we are now at a minute and a half right on

75
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,140
So, um, I'm gonna introduce everybody that's sitting out.

76
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,140
Now, I guess we should explain the layout.

77
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,140
I wish this was TV sometimes.

78
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,140
So we're gonna explain the layout of Rozo Golf in a little bit.

79
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
Webcam, webcam.

80
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,140
No webcam tonight.

81
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,140
In fact, there hasn't been a webcam any week except the first week.

82
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
We gotta get that fixed.

83
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,140
But we will, we promise.

84
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,140
Actually, um, episode 11 next week is gonna be a very different show

85
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,140
because we're gonna have a new intro.

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,140
Yes.

87
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,140
I've already got one planned out.

88
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,140
And hopefully a new site and everything.

89
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,140
Oh, you don't like the idea of a new intro?

90
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
No, I love the intro.

91
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,140
It has right now.

92
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,980
Well, we might we might dig it out of the archives occasionally. We'll use it for tonight's show

93
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
We get the look from Irene

94
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,500
Anyway, I'm gonna introduce the people that are up here upstairs right now because we get some people here that we don't normally

95
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,100
Get on the show because when we tape at the quote unquote studio also known as my office on Sundays

Say hello to our timekeeper tonight, Brad.

142
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
We are now at four minutes and a half.

143
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Four and a half minutes.

144
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
We only have two more hours to go, basically.

145
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Weeee!

146
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Weeee!

147
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
That's a lot of time to talk into a microphone.

148
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
We may not either. We do this every Sunday night, you know.

149
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,820
you know.

150
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,820
Oh my god, you're crazy!

151
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,060
Can you believe we actually are able to talk about Bimani and a little bit else too, in

152
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
two hours?

153
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,060
Wow, that's a lot of time talking about Bimani.

154
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,060
When we get tired of talking about Bimani, we do list lists, and it's usually Bimani.

155
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,060
Yeah, I was gonna say, wait, Bimani, what's that?

156
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,060
We have more people!

157
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
Oh, more people!

158
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,980
Come, come, come over to the microphones and introduce yourselves.

00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Introduce yourself.

160
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
Look in the microphone.

161
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980

Hello Rai Rai!

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
No.

173
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
What was the question?

174
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
She's not an alcoholic.

175
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Are you an alcoholic?

176
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,980
No.

177
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
So what...

178
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980

179
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,980

180
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,140

185
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Ooh.

186
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
She's a Para goddess.

187
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Para-list!

188
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,000
she's a paragoddist. She's gonna teach me some more because I don't know any, I

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,840
know a few, but I look dumb when I do them. I need to know more. I clap and wave my hands. And shake your butt.

190
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,160
And shake my butt to deluxe. I know deluxe. That was like the first one I learned. No, actually the first one I learned.

191
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,720
That was like the fifth one I learned. No, the first one I learned was boom boom fire because that's

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,200
everybody's first para. And then like a virgin. Not mine. My first was Night of Fire.

193
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Yeah, mine too. Mine was 100. 100. One more whore. 101 is the upgraded version. 101 is the upgraded version to 100.

194
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,200
I still always thought it sounded like they were saying one more whore. One more whore.

195
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,200
So, you weren't at the show, the live show on Sunday. I was in Vegas. Yeah, tell us about, tell us about Vegas.

Oh, we're going to introduce Ted. Ted doesn't even know what's going on here.

217
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Introduce yourself.

218
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Hi, I'm Ted.

219
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,000
Do you have any idea what we're doing right now Ted?

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I have no idea what you guys are doing right now.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's about as much as I know.

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You gotta talk in the mics more or else we don't hear ya.

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What?

225
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Double mics.

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What are you talking about?

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's a mushroom.

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He's a fuck guy.

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Haha.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Anyway, more for my Vegas story.

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Cause I am the mic whore now.

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,960
I just want to warn the listeners that there's a Tonight Show very different, very random.

234
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,420
Could be the best show we ever do.

235
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
Could be the fucking worst.

236
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
You can hear a burp.

237
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,660
Anyway, oh, yeah, there's more about burp later. Anyway

238
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,420
No, no, I want a dog in one of the crane games once again

239
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,100
I raped the crane game and I want a dog in named him burp now did the rate did the crane game call the police did?

240
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
It's oh, bye. Bye. Bye later

241
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,160
I was she left

242
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,460
you know who I feel that one of our regular listeners slinky also known as will was here and like ready to be on the

243
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,060
Show and you know, we were supposed to start taping at 730 tonight

244
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,340
And well, you know we we got here and we thought oh, we'll play one bimani game

245
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,540
and then we'll tape and then one kind of turned into five and

246
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,580
By the time we were ready to tape slinky's parents showed up and took him home

247
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,020
So I know last I saw him he was you know napping in the the sumo game. Oops. So sorry slinky

248
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,780
We'll get you on another show. We love you parents

249
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,760
Maybe away from the show. Oh you guys have to get going. Well, wait before okay

250
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,700
We'll take a break from the biggest story

251
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,500
You want to plug your your new role-playing game that's coming out?

252
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Because this is pretty cool. You want to plug it?

253
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Okay, I guess so. My new game that I made after three years of work with me as the sole programmer,

254
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,500
my friend Steve as the sole artist, is an epic-sized role-playing game in 2D.

255
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
It's an epic computer game.

256
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,500
It's actually a parody of a lot of RPGs, and it's all funny, and it's all cool, and it's all awesome.

257
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
It's in beta testing right now, and I've gone through about 400 different beta versions.

258
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,500
But I'm getting good feedback, starting to get some good feedback, and pretty soon it's going to be released public.

259
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,900
Look, I have played the game, it's very cool. Imagine kind of like Dragon Warrior, but like Bitchy.

260
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:57,300
Actually, it's a lot like Earthbound as well, which wouldn't surprise me because Earthbound is, as some may or may not know, is Rick's most godly RPG ever.

261
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,900
My favorite game of all time.

262
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,500
The battles really remind me of Earthbound battles.

263
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,300
Uh-huh. Shmack.

264
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,500
Do you get a bat as a weapon?

265
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:14,500
You actually get several bats as a weapon. You can have a rock as a weapon, or you can have a stick with a little nail poked through it. That's what it's called, a stick with a nail poked through it as a weapon.

266
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
No orange bat of justice?

267
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
No, but there's a hammer of justice that you get in the courthouse.

268
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Cool. Oh, you know the always clever deer carcass, right? The animal carcass you can use to fight with?

269
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah, that's true. That's actually roadkill. You can use roadkill. And the theory is that it stinks so bad it's bound to hurt your enemies.

270
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,900
indian and and and i think that they got out

271
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,300
the car dot yeah that's actually the notice the double chin there was a name

272
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,460
by soon jeff

273
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,460
uh... which he always got a dog off

274
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,460
sisters

275
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,500
so it's really powerful is very very powerful and yeah i think i got out of

276
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,820
the people with your daughter that

277
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,340
that's embarrassing adults and they see a guy that

278
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,540
exactly

279
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,540
at what myself

280
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,100
i don't want daily are there any

281
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,340
are there any of the money references in the game did you try it all incorporate

282
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,740
DDR taking over my fucking life thing in there or...

283
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,940
uh...

284
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,820
you know what there's so many jokes in there so many

285
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,540
megabytes of

286
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
just text jokes

287
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,220
uh... that i can't even imagine that i didn't stick a few bimani jokes in there

288
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,900
right on so any expected time release like in time for christmas to put under

289
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,740
the tree i'm hoping actually did to be done with it by uh... the end of

290
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,820
september

291
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,380
i'm thinking as far as that goes we're getting really close to done yeah bug

292
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,900
Counts we're not getting anything back at all. Well. I haven't played it the new one yet, so we'll see

293
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm the stickler on beta testing so we'll see we're done with that

294
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,460
We're moving on to Cedric the Littlest Demon where you fight the devil then you fight Mitch in limbo

295
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,460
And then you fight not I'm sorry Nietzsche

296
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,340
Limbo and then you have to fight God in heaven, and then you win the game when you can kill God

297
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,580
So we're hoping that that killing the god

298
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,020
Are you selling on this black matrix II though have you ever heard of black matrix?

299
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,280
No, uh-uh.

300
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:00,520
Black Matrix is an RPG where, in their universe, God and Satan fought, and Satan won.

301
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Ooh, cool.

302
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,020
So you play as the slave of a dominatrix.

303
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm down with that, yo.

304
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Um, is it going to be something you have to pay for, or is it going to be completely free, or what's the deal?

305
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,520
QDRPG is going to be totally free, depending on how many people we get playing it.

306
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,520
We may or may not do Cedric free as well, but QDRPG 2, which is going to be completely different,

307
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,920
have absolutely nothing to do with QDRPG 1 whatsoever. As most, as most old Nintendo

308
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,800
sequels didn't like, like Castlevania 2, nothing like the first at all. Uh huh, yeah, they're

309
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,440
gonna be completely different, it's gonna be a completely different idea, we're definitely

310
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,660
gonna charge for that, and we're actually, the game after that's gonna be 3D. But we

311
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,320
still get free copies, right? Always gonna get free copies from all my friends, always.

312
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,800
Alright guys, but you guys listening have to pay, haha. Alright later, thanks for interviewing.

313
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,400
And we'll let all our listeners know when QDRPG is released and where you can get a

314
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,280
copy of it if you like them rpg-type games and before we change the subject

315
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,880
i don't think rick brought it up i have to give some credit to timmy timmy did an

316
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,880
awesome job on the soundtrack on this game it's if you like uh technoish type

317
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,800
of music and stuff like that it's it's great it's got good music and uh

318
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,520
probably the best thing that i like about this game it's just full of great

319
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,480
jokes and cheesy shit like that you gotta play it it's not gonna be like

320
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,400
diablo style graphics or anything if that's what you're expecting but it's

321
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,220
It's just, it's like, it's 8-bit goodness is what I kinda, it's a cross between Super

322
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
Nintendo and Nintendo.

323
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
It's a little more than 8-bit.

324
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,220
Yeah, maybe like 10-bit.

325
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,220
Three and a half!

326
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
You wanted to say something, Irene?

327
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:36,180
Oh, did he say something about fighting Nichi on there, the philosopher guy?

328
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
That's gonna be in the next game.

329
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah, that's what I mean.

330
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
In the next game.

331
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,180
Yep.

332
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,180
The philosopher guy or whatever?

333
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,180
I guess, yeah.

334
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,180
Knowing Rick, yeah.

335
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,000
it would be rather wrong to like fight him with the Bruce's philosopher song in

336
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,680
the background and then you'll get was represent who's very ready stable the

337
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,520
armies yeah run by Jesus and Santa the holidays and such stuff like that it's

338
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,920
it's great just different references throughout the entire game it's good

339
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,280
stuff so back so yes they get to the biggest trip well we wanted we wanted to

340
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,000
make sure we got Rick's plug on the air for you had to go so okay well anyway I

341
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
I was in Vegas and y'all weren't.

342
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,320
So basically when we first got there,

343
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
it was basically all the moderators hanging out together.

344
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,360
Well, I mean, we were all of us moderators anyway.

345
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,280
We went to the food court to hang out.

346
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,080
I played $10 worth of nickels and then won like five of it

347
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,280
back on video poker, which I apparently own at.

348
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,800
And then my total winnings for the whole week,

349
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,100
it was like $2.95, which is part of my cab there.

350
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,600
Notable.

351
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
Is that how much a foot long those hot dogs

352
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,480
I did not buy an elephant penis. They were selling these hot dogs that were like two

353
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,640
feet long and really fat so they were being referred to as elephant peni. As the cock

354
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:02,120
of the elephant. Anyway, so as it went on that night we went to the Rio for the gigantic

355
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,280
humongous seafood buffet. It was like 30 bucks but you could get sashimi, Maine lobster,

356
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,680
You know, Kalamari, all kinds of cool awesome seafood.

357
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,800
And then, you know, that night at the Rio, there was this awesome Perfect Attack showdown

358
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,920
between Pot Guy and Anowon, or Nor as he's also known.

359
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:31,080
There's also, Blue was also showing off some pretty, pretty awesome double skills, you

360
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,720
know, going up into the sixes and sevens on some of those.

361
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,000
I, of course, raped the crane machine there and ended up giving up a lot of my stuff.

362
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,060
Walking back, we were going back inside of the hotel and all of a sudden I hear,

363
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
TDR Freak!

364
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,340
And that's when our Stalker fanboys DJ Bubbles and his friend found us, who I guess apparently

365
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,360
they came from out of town to find us and buy coffee for us or something.

366
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Cool.

367
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,880
But the next day, well, I didn't fall asleep until after 7am for some reason because I

368
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,280
was really tired. Too much excitement. We went to the Game Land arcade, which was freaking

369
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:18,280
amazing. That arcade, I played Mambo-a-Go-Go there. Mambo! No, forget this, for two tokens

370
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:26,720
a play. DDR Max 2 for two tokens a play. Right on. Beat Mania 3, six core, for two tokens

371
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:35,100
play. Radiant Silver Gun for one. We apologize to your speakers. That was

372
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,580
literally my reaction. I had played the photo game in Biohazard Gun Survivor 2

373
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,860
which was really amazing. The arcade owned and of course we were showing up

374
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:51,700
the, well I didn't, but the locals were sort of sitting there you know mouth open

375
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,740
watching

376
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,480
as uh... some of the more notable freestylers namely uh...

377
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,260
meldy deejay ball

378
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,460
uh... story making excited over there

379
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,100
past memories of boomtown

380
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,700
in reno

381
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,580
you know they were they were showing their stuff and uh...

382
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,900
and then everybody went back to some people wanted to guess the old

383
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,500
no we i i heard about

384
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,700
well i heard about

385
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,860
that i guess there was some kind of pump it up challenge going on

386
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,400
that was friday night i was fighting apparently one of the locals got really

387
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,960
pissed off

388
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,680
you still have a spotlight doesn't matter

389
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,040
and he was basically getting out of a prop cycle so i was happy

390
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,640
uh... his pops i close the best game ever

391
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,880
but in town

392
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,500
uh... anyway back to saturday night uh...

393
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,920
uh... iguana girl islander and i all it's a strategic experience that up with

394
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,060
my friend, um, uh, Tiara and her, uh, her man, Rick, which you have to do.

395
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,200
If you ever go to Vegas, whether you're a fan of the show or not, it's just the

396
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,420
coolest thing in Vegas, I think shut up.

397
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,620
Well, we went sober once and then we, we had a warp core breach.

398
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,540
We basically between the, the three of us, between me, Iguana girl and Islander,

399
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,240
we had, um, a large, they, they shared a large one and a small one.

400
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,460
and then I had a small one all to myself.

401
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,000
And, ooh, okay, I just got given a tape, so I got a tape.

402
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,840
Tall just showed up.

403
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,680
You wanna say hello to everybody in the...

404
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,960
Your CD's in the car.

405
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,920
In, what up, my niggers?

406
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,760
Oh.

407
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,540
Anyway.

408
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,440
You can address those cards and letters to Tall,

409
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,080
courtesy of Tall's house.

410
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,360
I was telling a story.

411
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,760
Sorry, yes, finish your story.

412
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,560
Anyway, so after my friends left,

413
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,300
We had this drunken walk over to Circus Circus so Iguana Girl could play the old machine

414
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,140
up in the Midway, which was ass on the right player's side because half the buttons didn't

415
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
work.

416
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,300
That's the same machine that I played DDR on for the very first time with Circus Circus.

417
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
You lost your DDR Virginity.

418
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Yes, lost my DDR in...

419
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
It's a USA machine.

420
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:04,420
Now the 1.5 is downstairs and actually has a good pad, last time I played, but anyway.

421
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
There was more...

422
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,660
No, we don't have 4th Plus yet.

423
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:13,040
There was more staying up until all hours of the morning and playing a taboo, drunken

424
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,780
taboo which was like the absolute winner and that actually had the quote of the evening

425
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:24,420
which was, it's like a penguin but it's in this place where the British used to send

426
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:29,940
their criminals and that was trying to get them to say kangaroo.

427
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,140
Yes this is, because you know taboo, you have a list of five words that you cannot use to

428
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,100
to describe your main word that's on the thing, and you have a timer.

429
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,180
Like, I used penguin twice.

430
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,820
I was using penguin for tuxedo, and I used penguin.

431
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,940
It's like, it's colored like a penguin, but it's equine for a zebra.

432
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,440
What?

433
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,740
You know, mine made sense.

434
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,220
I don't know where you'd get, you know, kangaroo.

435
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,860
Kangaroo?

436
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,620
I'm lost.

437
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,100
And the other best one, it's like, I was trying

438
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,220
to get someone to say the word blow, and the quote was,

439
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,620
it's like, if I wanted you to suck my cock,

440
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,140
you would be giving me a blank job.

441
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:12,460
so did they get it yes actually they got it and our team actually did get the the kangaroo so

442
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,860
that was we just started we just started listing off australian you know animals like koala kangaroo

443
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:27,180
so anyway um the next the next day was um you know we all checked out and a bunch of people went to

444
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,740
this other buffet and i went to all you can eat sushi with my friend and hung out at circus circus

445
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,500
and got to play Tsurugi which is the best game ever it's basically um it's like mocap boxing in

446
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,740
um and uh police 911 only you have a sword with a light sensor and you get to you know cut people

447
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,940
in half and cut off their head and cool us name is blade of honor uh apparently dj aba found a

448
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,220
techno motion machine at um Excalibur in the basement but i didn't get to play it unfortunately

449
00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:03,180
And I played Pump It Up Perfect, but it was, you know, a crappy broken one, and they had

450
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:10,860
a brave firefighters machine, Ferrari F-355, you know, the full three monitor one.

451
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,780
New York New York had an awesome arcade for the casinos.

452
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,940
But the best arcade you went to would be that game?

453
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
Oh, Gameland.

454
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,500
Gameworks is ass, except they have Sonic Fighters there.

455
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,340
Tekken 4 on a projection TV with a couch with controllers attached to it

456
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,880
Oh cool. This is good for people to know because Vegas is a big tourist spot. You know everybody guitar freaks there

457
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,460
It sucks in the DVR is a USA machine, and they overpriced everything

458
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,160
It's like a dollar fifty for planning with a machine. Oh, it's like the metreon

459
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,140
Yeah, but it's like ass at least it's you know the decor is better, and they play good trance in the background

460
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,760
How many places did you guys go all over the damn city?

461
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Did you get to see any showgirls or, you know, did you go to any TV bars?

462
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Dude, this one drag queen showgirl gave me a flyer and people were collecting pictures of the boobs.

463
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Did you get any free prawn?

464
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,760
I didn't want any free prawn because there was like...

465
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
The free prawn in Vegas is stupid.

466
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:14,760
It was like they were all ugly and they were fake boobs and one of them was a man because you could see the Adam's apple.

467
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:24,720
apple anyway so that this is actually starting to lead into my fuck you of the

468
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:34,880

471
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,840
was on his cell phone and he kept bumping into her but she didn't say

472
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,080
anything about it and then he bumped into me and knocked me into a pole so I

473
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,200
turned he was you know just doing he's like oh I'm on this little cell phone

474
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,120
things that make you look like you're talking to yourself and you ride the

475
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,800
short bus forever so he like you saw any like it was completely oblivious to the

476
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:12,440
what I fucking hate people who do that shit anyway so um so anyway um we um we

477
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,120
uh I turn around and said you know excuse me you need to watch what you're

478
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,040
doing you know I thought something's like oh I'm having five conversations at

479
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,920
once and then he just started walking off so like that's an excuse we were

480
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,040
over there laughing at him when they told him to turn off his cell phone

481
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,480
before takeoff because apparently he didn't hear that either and then there

482
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,320
was this guy behind me whose kid kept kicking me in the back of the chair I

483
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,280
I kept looking at the kid and I was just talking to Jessica, you know, minding my own business was like, yeah

484
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,560
my fight was okay except I kept getting kicked in the butt and he's like stop whining and apparently he kept bitching when I

485
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,840
driving him out listening to my, you know, Luna C

486
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,360
compilation. He was, you know, he was a fucktard. So fuck him and fuck the guy on the cell phone and

487
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,560

488
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,080
Which, okay, I didn't get any sleep last night, so forgive me for slurring a little bit and

489
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
being tired and bitchy.

490
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
She just sounds a little drunk.

491
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
She's a little hungover.

492
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,560
And I'm PMSE, so don't give me any bullshit.

493
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,240
Anyway, um, I tried to get out of it.

494
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
I couldn't get out of it.

495
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:22,560
So I hop on the bus at 10am, go all over freakin' Sacramento to try to get to, um, basically

496
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,080
it's where Stockton Boulevard and Broadway meet, but it's like another block past that.

497
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,580
at 50th and Broadway. I got down there, kept napping on the bus. I got there at a quarter

498
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,140
after one. This is from getting on the bus at 10. Wow. And I was there for 30 minutes.

499
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,640
The guy was so condescending and was talking down and I probably had more brain in my butt

500
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:50,220
than he did in all of his head. So, you know, basically I got out of there as fast as possible

501
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,760
and got home at like a quarter after five o'clock and decided and just wolf

502
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,920
down all these espresso beans so I'm a combination of tired and hyper so fuck

529
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Rob isn't being nice this week.

530
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
The penguin has a Fuck of the Week.

531
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,920
And I played Max Unlimited so many fucking times.

532
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm guessing over 30.

533
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm so pissed off, and so is my legs.

534
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,920
And he fails on the same note every fucking time.

535
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Fails the same note every fucking time.

536
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:50,200
time it's sorry a lot of anger here no we sympathize I mean I've been there so

537
00:28:50,200 --> 00:29:01,280

540
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,400
Roosevelt Golf Land for not having fourth plus yet even though we're here

541
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,680
right now he just pretty much loitering is what we're doing we're just sitting

542
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,120
upstairs we're in the party area right now where you a lot of party and going

543
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,680
up on yeah this employee came by and looked at us funny earlier like are they

544
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,320
supposed to be here apparently so because we have the microphones and is

545
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,800
that any different than usual they always look at us funny true that's when

546
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,400
we're playing. That's when Rob's playing Deluxe. Let's go interview employees, that sounds

547
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,980
like fun. Well we can do that in a later segment. I think actually what I want to do, maybe

548
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,740
next segment, is maybe just be mobile. Since we have a mobile unit here, maybe we'll walk

549
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,900
around and tour Golf Land and give our opinions on the games. We'll talk about every single

550
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:01,600
thing that is broken. Like everything? Yeah, like everything. So it'll be a nice long day.

551
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,040
got two hours to fill

552
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,060
since we just kinda got off the whole vegas thing i was recently in vegas and i

553
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,020
happen to come across a dance dance revolution tournament

554
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,660
alright they had um...

555
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,820
uh... perfect attack and a freestyle tournament and they had forty slots for each

556
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,500
i got like eleventh

557
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,220
like the eleventh slot for freestyle so i was good there i definitely got to play

558
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:30,160
but i got forty one on the perfect attack and that pissed me off

559
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,020
and somebody somebody dropped out so i got forty so i'm like yes but i played

560
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,240
last

561
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,660
so you know i was waiting for like what four hours to play some like that so you

562
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,340
know i get there and i play my freestyle and i did great i loved it i had fun i'd

563
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,620
did all three the songs perfectly

564
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,580
and then the guy that goes after me does a fucking backflip

565
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,940
over the freakin rail and goes through and hits is

566
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,500
i don't know how he did it but i got second there so i got a cd i got a cd

567
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,260
player

568
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,060
And then Imperfect Attack, I played the last, and I triple-a'd a couple of songs.

569
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,960
And that was, um...

570
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,900
Wow, you know?

571
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,700
So I got first place, five hundred bucks. And there's, um...

572
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,160
You know, that's my story.

573
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,040
Sweet! Congratulations.

574
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,380
I didn't know we had a local that owned the Vegas tournament. That's news.

575
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,540
I've noticed that there's a different breed of freestyle in Vegas, you know.

576
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,800
Thanks, Sock.

577
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,660
Hey there.

578
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,400
The views and opinions of our guests.

579
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,920
yeah uh... the vegas freestylers suck okay

580
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,160
and i've noticed lots of lots of eighteen action going on so when i broke

581
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,000
out my new freestyle love to me i had a crowd

582
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,760
i found a place for my freestyle vegas here i come

583
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,920
that was a dynamite raid

584
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,800
this announcement now when we have our tournament at uh... hopefully we know

585
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,160
we're trying to get it for some game room

586
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,600
because they didn't maybe

587
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,040
it that we may have a particular issue maybe a new machine coming in that we

588
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,120
we want to have another tournament on. I can't say anything about it. Can't say until it

589
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,720
comes in, but. But if we have, we're either going to have it here or there, here at Roseville

590
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,680
Golf Land or there, if ever I hear back from management. Anyway, um, I'm going to try to

591
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,000
contact them again, but back to what I was saying. One of the freestyle segments is going

592
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,320
to be 18 style freestyle. Oh God. So you will be encouraged to pull out your best knee drops,

593
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,600
hand plants, backflips, but no matrix walk. Aw, no matrix walks. It's pretty much going

594
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,600
the replacement for improv freestyle is just uh... Yes, because improv was where it was a novel idea, the novelty belongs in the library.

595
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:40,600
It was a novel idea, just a lot of shitty entrants, and sorry to those who entered improv freestyle. There were some good ones, but a lot of you got up there and PA'd.

596
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,600
It wasn't necessarily that the skill was bad, it was that they got some ass steps. You know, we...

597
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I don't know if it was ass steps or me, but mine really sucked.

598
00:32:50,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Actually, part of the problem was that, you know, our bad, we picked, I should just say my bad, blame me, I was in freestyle, I thought, oh, four to six feet songs, people can improv those, those aren't too bad.

599
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Whoops, I probably should have done like two and three foot songs and one foot songs. Actually, if I ever do another improv freestyle tournament, it's all gonna be beginner songs on USA, as far as I'm concerned.

600
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,600
I can only improv on Heavy. I love improv, and that's how I make all my freestyles, it's improv over and over and over again.

601
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Were you playing last October? Were you playing in October?

602
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,600
No, I haven't gotten to play in any of the Sacramento tournament.

603
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Well, there's going to be another one coming up by the end of the year.

604
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,600
Also, if it's a Folsom game room, I have no way to get there.

605
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,600
We'll find a way. Somebody here at the table will get you.

606
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
We work things out.

607
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
You're on the board, right?

608
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
I am.

609
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Yeah, we'll get you there somehow.

610
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,600
I posted on the whole series.

611
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,840
Yeah, yeah, so well

612
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,600
Oh, but I do want to say one improv freestyle that I liked a lot of the tournament was Bradley

613
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,040
Yes, for those who see he did little bitch

614
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,680
And just he just kind of got into it at the end. He was just like you're

615
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,680
Great. I loved it. And he didn't say hi say hi Oh

616
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
The little bitch himself Bradley, yes

617
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,000
How was your move you just moved recently to get get a little closer to golf land? Yes, it was good

618
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,920
So I'm still unpacking so moving things around you had to move out of the town of sorority life and get get into

619
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,900
Get into the little cluster Rosa golf. Oh, yeah, cuz he was in Davis where you know, they filmed sorority life. So

620
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,280
Yes

621
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,460
Let's talk to Anita cuz we haven't talked to her much during this show yet

622
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,880
We got a spotlights on you all lights on you girl. Come here. Tell us about where you're from

623
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
You're from a little hick town up north

624
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,420
Yes, I'm from Yuba City.

625
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,820
Yes! I went to the police and got yelled at.

626
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,460
Now you want to give a little plug because I know Yuba City has a little

627
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,100
team of regulars up there that play and I love the name of this team by the way.

628
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,380
So tell us about the team up there. Okay, our team is called the

629
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,060
token stealing toddler stompers.

630
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,380
Awesome name. Best name ever. Yes. I hate golf land

631
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,540
for the sole reason that you have to babysit your freaking tokens.

632
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:13,540
Yes, yes. We got sick and tired of doing that. We actually inspired this new setup of plastic tokens,

633
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,540
but we don't use those anymore because there's not enough people.

634
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Like, you know, when you got like a thousand tokens up on the machine,

635
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,540
if everybody has their own color-coded token, then you can tell who's, you know, in line.

636
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,540
They were using licenses at Gameworks so that people wouldn't run off with their cards.

637
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
Oh.

638
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,540
You know, ID cards, student IDs, licenses.

639
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
Yeah.

640
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,540
And explain why, what do you mean by cards? Because some people may not have been to Gameworks ever.

641
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:45,540
They use token, instead of tokens they use those little credit cards like the Metreon uses.

642
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,540
So you were saying about your team.

643
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:56,540
Oh yeah, token stealing toddler stompers was inspired by a little incident that happened at one of our arcades.

644
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:02,380
A little kid got into a little trouble and we sort of, well, one of our girls, her name

645
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:08,340
is May, and she ended up pushing the little kid a little bit.

646
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
Just a little bit.

647
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
Just a tiny bit.

648
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
Just a tad.

649
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,340
A touch.

650
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
Because he would not leave her alone.

651
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,920
And his father came, caused a ruckus.

652
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,540
Ever since then we've decided to call ourselves token stealing taller stompers because she

653
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,060
was accused of stomping on this kid, basically.

654
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,240
So anyway, that's how it started.

655
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,680
So how is the scene in a little, because for those who don't know, Yuba City is kind of

656
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,220
one of those towns that's like, it's just kind of there on the side of the road in the

657
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,220
middle of nowhere.

658
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,940
Actually, now it's getting bigger because it has the Sacramento Amphitheater in the town,

659
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,260
so it's getting a little bit more notoriety that way.

660
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,700
But how is it playing DDR like in the middle of nowhere, where you've got to really drive

661
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,460
a long way to get something outside of DDR?

662
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:55,520
Well, I work in Sacramento, so driving's not too bad for me, but we do have a Max 2 now,

663
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,500
so that is a lot of fun.

664
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,060
Everybody has a freaking Max 2 now.

665
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
What is up with that?

666
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Illegal kits.

667
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,060
I mean...

668
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Happy kits.

669
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,540
Ooh, my boots.

670
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,540
My legs hurt.

671
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,900
My boots and my leg, bootleg.

672
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,140
Oh, yeah, same.

673
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:17,420
It's the, hey, we like to think that we're legal kits, yeah.

674
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,300
They're the great pretender.

675
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,060
Well, it's really not that bad in Yuba City altogether.

676
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,980
There's the folks, I mean, as DDR communities go,

677
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,620
we've got a lot of really great people there.

678
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,380
We used to have two places to go.

679
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,580
Now, we only have one.

680
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,060
But the people who work there are really good to us.

681
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,380
They listen to us.

682
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,740
If we want the machine turned up, they're happy to do it.

683
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,300
And we've never had problems there.

684
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,220
So it's really great, yeah.

685
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,300
That sounds like a dream come true.

686
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,540
In fact, yeah.

687
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,900
What was that again?

688
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,460
It's unlike here at Golf Land, where

689
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,540
when we ask them to turn it up, they turn it down

690
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,660
to half volume.

691
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,980
Exactly.

692
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,940
That's because they're backward ass here.

693
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,700
But we're not complaining, are we?

694
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,980
Because we're getting fourth plus.

695
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
I am complaining.

696
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,220
I am very much complaining.

697
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,140
Are we going to complain when they get fourth plus,

698
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,100
though, to replace USA?

699
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,180
USA will be gone and replaced with fourth plus.

700
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,620
Isn't that wonderful?

701
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,900
Somewhat, yes.

702
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,180
Yes.

703
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,060
You can play conga feeling to your heart's content.

704
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,340
know everything on USA is gonna be on there. This is my outlook on this, because USA is

705
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,860
where the newbies go to play, right? So they take USA, we got Max 2. But we got 4th+, we're

706
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,140
gonna wanna play Max 2 and 4th+, where the newbies gonna go. Yeah, they're gonna play

707
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,180
all 4th+, immediately, and you get to play up next. They're gonna go to hell, that's

708
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,140
where they're gonna go. Yeah, but see, see here's- No, they're gonna go play Spiderstomp.

709
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,840
We'll just set them to play Spiderstomp. No, but see, but see, here's the other thing.

710
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,860
The people at Sunsplash are also very stupid at making it so that you can't fail on your

711
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:51,180
first song if it's on you know little or not little brother uh you know standard

712
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,540
the first standard basic it's it's stupid and so that's still one song

713
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,140
where you have to wait and stuff and and and watching them hurts I swear it hurts

714
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,100
to see them suck so bad because I I mean some of them have the basic idea we all

715
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,820
started off somewhere at the top yeah but we also I I'm gonna say I'm hoping

716
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,340
that we all started off higher than some of the people to play here you know just

717
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,180
jumping around on the freaking pad. I know none of us would be the where we

718
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,280
are today if we started there because we would have given up long ago well no no

719
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,860
mercy with Ted but Ted I guess yeah I started off at home do you think that's

720
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:30,660
something the announcer should start saying like oh my eyes are bleeding your

721
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:37,480
dance is like burning your dance makes Captain Jack cry we have more intros to

00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,000

00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:59,140
She just lost about 70% of her bar in like 3 seconds.

836
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:06,140
There she goes. Oh, not too bad.

837
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:14,140
You're not doing as bad as she said you were going to do, Jamie.

838
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:20,140
Uh-oh, she got danger. Uh-oh. Come on, Jamie. Go, Jamie, go.

We have an internet radio show. Would you like to say some words for our listeners?

862
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:45,380
Um, actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys

00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,580
can go walking around recording stuff oh we're just recording ourselves yeah I

864
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:54,140
mean we actually do a show online that promotes the line of the music games and

865
00:51:54,140 --> 00:52:01,780
we advertise this place for free yeah so and then the shit hits the fan well we

866
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:10,260
could go outside I guess if if you'd rather not us tape in here okay all

867
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,620
right we're getting some manager we might possibly hate golf land we might

868
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,580
possibly get kicked out of the

869
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,580
still have to end the show early because of this we'll have to see what it what's

870
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,600
gonna happen here

871
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,860

that has bemani

875
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,220
yeah we might

876
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,800
make our business elsewhere

877
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,620
we might have to go to fulsome game room or some place that would let us do a show there

878
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,500
i don't know

879
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,620
we'll see

880
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:51,140
and he's going to the list and stopping on

881
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,060
something to know really suck what if they took the tape

882
00:52:55,060 --> 00:53:00,220
no then they'll make them pay by anyone

883
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:04,820
so we're eagerly awaiting what's gonna happen here

884
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:11,820
we could run away

885
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,700

887
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,660
i know where's the fun in that so we'll see what happens

888
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,140
because i if they did

889
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,100
if they did throw us out for trying to do our show i i doubt we'd come here

890
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,700
very much in the future

891
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,460
so we'll see

892
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:30,460
what's gonna happen when uh... mister manager comes back

893
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,220

898
00:53:52,740 --> 00:54:00,720

901
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,480

902
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,720
let's see what's going on

903
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,200
oh okay oh we thought that guy was the manager

904
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,800
that would be the day can we get that on tape

905
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,800
So you enjoy working in Gulfland?

906
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,800
She can't comment on tape or else she'd get in trouble.

907
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
But I'm sure she'd say nothing but good things.

908
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
Yes, Gulfland is winner.

909
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,800
Except maybe the little kids who destroy things around here, who knows about that.

910
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Like, yeah.

911
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,800
Do I have to go for the taping or not?

912
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,800
No, we don't know because the manager's got to come downstairs and...

913
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,800
I know, he's going to decide you guys to tape him.

914
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,800
Really? Even though a lot of people film home videos and stuff here?

915
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,960
Same difference, only audio.

916
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,520
Alright, alright, she's not going to talk, she's not going to talk.

917
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,840
We'll see what happens. This is interesting, we weren't expecting this

918
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,520
development.

919
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,560
Well maybe we should take another quick break then.

920
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,800
Do we want to take a quick break? Well no, because I kind of want to get this on air, whatever happens.

921
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,520
So we'll see. What are we leaving? No, we're going to see what happens. The manager's coming down.

922
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,600
You can always go like in and out or something.

923
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,080
True. We can finish up the show somewhere else.

924
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,440
we'll see what happens

925
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,000
by freaking ten

926
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,940
ten o'clock

927
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,720
i think they're closing at ten now so we have a lot of the bad things going on

928
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,160
on the mania

929
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,660
do you want to go listen to brad playing the mania and now what is it very many

930
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,920
years i don't even know that song

931
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,440
it's crimson

932
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,760
why are they allowed to take us and use us for the commercials but we're not

933
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,560
allowed to take them

934
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,680
maybe

935
00:55:50,680 --> 00:56:00,100
don't know I don't know they probably think we're profiting off of this no we

936
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:10,920
pay for do our show I know this is this is the guy we'll see what happens we

937
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,160
think

938
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:19,200
we don't know what's gonna happen we're recording an internet radio show just

939
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,040
We run an internet radio show every Sunday night and we're basically taking the Sunday

940
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,760
off so we decided to do a live show at our favorite Wednesday hangout because we come

941
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,840
every Wednesday and we didn't think that there would be an issue with it if there is so we're

942
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
sorry.

943
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:42,600
Right now, I'll go ahead and do it, I thought you had a filming crew here, but usually we

944
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,640
don't have a problem with it, we just like to book it in advance so we can know what

945
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,820
the interviews about, and that kind of a thing.

946
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,820
Oh, we're just a bunch of dumb kids that are not doing anything special, so.

947
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,820
This is spontaneous, really.

948
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:59,820
And also, I recognize your kids, you know, in the group, so that's always a big plus.

949
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,820
So, we want to promote, you know, a good hangout environment.

950
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,820
Oh, definitely.

951
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,820
Well, cool.

00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,900
harder every income on possibly live on by possibly yeah so it sounds like they

990
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,300
like to know about these kind of things in advance because

991
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,740
well they want to do their own little promotions with it i don't know we

992
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:59,220
should call five minutes ahead and say, hey, we're gonna come, you know, record and stuff, so yeah.

993
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:04,660
But yeah, that was... That's, that's going on the best stuff. I hope we picked up his audio. I'm kind

994
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,540
of afraid that we didn't get the Golf Line employee's audio. That might have come out

995
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:12,100
kind of crappy for the listeners. Yeah. It's an experimental show tonight, as I promised. It would

996
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:17,380
be... You know, we know what we could do. We can just dub over voices if we didn't pick it up.

997
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,180
Maybe when we, maybe what we could do is come back and do that segment in a later show like

998
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,140
the best of will do with voice settings by aryan no you should put in like step

999
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,600
from rejected i'm feeling bad and you know what i'm kind of worried about

1000
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,060
though what if this guy actually tunes in and listens though because what do we

1001
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:37,280
do we sit around and we say it offline never updates their machines and they

1002
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,620
they're all dirty and things like that now oh well we come here and give our

1003
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,520
money that's right so what the hell does he wear a bunch of fat hypocrites

1004
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:50,000
because we've asked off plan but we're the right to complain even if we do pay

1005
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,600
of money god damn it so oh they're all coming back oh jamie's jamie's doing some pr work here

1006
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:01,280
oh boy talking talking to the manager yay oh she's trying to sell the tournament right now

1007
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:08,000
hey right on yeah so jamie is jamie going all right he's going bye-bye irene will fill in his

1008
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,760
co-host while you're gone yeah well hey jamie's gonna go uh work things out some promising news

1009
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,240
maybe oh now this is so this guy is really awesome he's done so much stuff he turned up the

1010
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,460
the prepare machine actually i would you recognize this guy is that what and

1011
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,000
they'll say here about this employee here says say his name over the air

1012
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,200
search or saying good things on doing

1013
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,160
very good employee here he sees the one employee we've run into that will fixed

1014
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,680
games we ask them to be fixed he has a thing as they are broken he fixes them

1015
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,440
like prepare was turned on there's a game called uh... similar next to it

1016
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,820
was about five times sluts pepper machine so my my

1017
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,620
thing was to go and turn off the sumo machine but now prepare you can hear

1018
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,740
from upstairs it's it's insane a lot and i love it

1019
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:51,900
and then this guy this guy has made all kinds of stuff that he's letting us do

1020
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,200
this thing here

1021
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,140
and uh... it sucks that he's he's leaving pretty soon don't know where to

1022
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:00,840
go and why don't i don't know he's on he's uh... not going to be working here

1023
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,960
for too much longer so what he's trying to do

1024
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,900
is get james name and number

1025
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,980
possibly even like you know the URL for the boards into the right hand so that

1026
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,860
these trends will continue to happen on a regular basis

1027
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,660
that right on all

1028
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,860
oh you made us

1029
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,800
body

1030
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,100
well

1031
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,260
how can i not recognize the mole i i i i i i i think that

1032
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,140
i was going to ask him but i was like i don't know you might have been weird

1033
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,420
did you did you hear that whole little crisis is going on downstairs

1034
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,380
we're trying to do

1035
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,660
by a group of people out there was going on

1036
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,220
we were trying to do our little online stick program that we do here and we

1037
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,660
almost got stopped but

1038
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:40,060
thanks to the nice employee that the bahmani appreciating employee the way

1039
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:43,560
We lucked out tonight. Good thing we didn't have one of the bad managers here.

1040
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,560
It was great.

1041
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,260
Yes, and Tal's doing all the introductions here.

1042
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,760
We're meeting somebody new from the board for the first time, so this is exciting.

1043
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,260
Hello.

1044
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:00,060

1045
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,560
Now we're...

1046
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,760
You know Loki and Linky style.

1047
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,680
well they were just introduced me a lot of this is a lot i lost i lost the co-host

1048
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,240
for this is kind of weird though i mean that they know that my head they went to

1049
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,660
the office a lot the door this i don't know if they want

1050
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:21,160

all mike it's going to kill

1053
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,000

1054
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,960
noises

1055
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,640
it's hard to let us know like he's now

1056
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,800
uh...

1057
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,080
all

1058
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,600
overall

1059
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,840
that's going to go up on the audio i don't know

1060
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,480

1077
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,000
particularly retarded edit

01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,520
for max three hundred now after the free to think of the book fifty fucking

1079
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,520
billionaire

1080
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:41,000
i can't no way to do that ever first off i didn't make the edit this guy get

1081
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,060
needed that actually it was one of the ones that was in the data bank on

1082
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,040
fitness

1083
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,680
about ninety percent of the nyoki edits that nyoki pick are all done by him he's

1084
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,720
the same guy plays that they made a edit swing and i'd love it so awesome

1085
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,040
yeah but do you think that it is fucking off the house in any

1086
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,360
they didn't say that she writes this pretty dear i mean is that he made

1087
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,820
sense but i feel like she did actually fight

1088
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,160
it's in this

1089
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,960
uh... i've got some good news actually came by low and the melting pot are

1090
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,920
coming back up october first redesigning the site

1091
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,440
uh... what happened was is there a switching servers or something and

1092
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,080
one they did that someone bought the main name

1093
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,520
for who who says it has someone but team bryler's dot coms name and so now they

1094
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,880
had to change it or something, but they're actually still up. You just have to type in

1095
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:31,360
their IP address in order to find it. So they're still up and they said they're going to be

1096
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:38,040
done with the site and everything October 1st. As far as other SimNews, really no new

1097
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:43,440
versions of anything. Turning Mix, I guess, is still going because their media section

1098
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,380
is down on DDR, East Coast Invasion. Yeah, I won't be entering this time because I'm

1099
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:52,160
busy with everything else. I swear to God, I never have enough free time to actually

1100
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,000
sit down and make, you know, a decent step file. Or I don't have the patience or just

1101
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,720
don't care. One of those. And also DDRPC still no new characters, so that sucks.

1102
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,620
That was interesting because they released, we thought they were going to kind of be doing

1103
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:09,900
them every Friday. They released What's His Name and What's Her Face on the first week.

1104
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:15,280
And then Valencia and Guy were the second. Yes. And then there were no third ones. No,

1105
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:21,980
nothing, so. Yeah. Wow. This is, I'm still kind of in shock over this interesting turn

1106
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,660
the show's taken where Jamie's, uh, gone into the office to talk about God knows what with

1107
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:30,360
the manager. You know, I'm kind of getting worried. Do you think we need to send a rescue

1108
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,120
mission? No, you know, actually this might be good because they're talking for a long

1109
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:37,740
time. Yeah, maybe they're talking about a tournament. Yes, I know. Actually they are

1110
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:41,860
talking about the tournament. Really? Yes. From when I was walking by and coming up here

1111
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:45,920
I heard him talking about the tournament, so. I heard the word tournament. Interesting.

1112
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,540
So we'll see what happens. Did you hear the words, ugh, ugh, ugh? Stop it! Jamie, you

1113
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:58,500
Hit Brad once you hear this. It's all Brad that's doing all of these funny noises, but my girlfriend's ratting me out. How's that?

1114
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,140
Hey

1115
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,680
Gosh, get it later. Yes. Yes Joe

1116
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:08,140
and if man if the what's-his-name bands us, I'm gonna be pissed

1117
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:14,640
Imagine if we all get banned from golf land for this then they won't get any money darn shucks

1118
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,060
I'll just have to take my business elsewhere

1119
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:21,060
I'll be able to afford an apartment, move out, and actually get on with my life.

1120
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:26,060
Maybe, you know, tune up my car and that kind of stuff. That'd be cool.

1121
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:32,060
This is like the addiction recovery thing. They all ban us from Golf Land, you know.

1122
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,060
I'm gonna cut you off.

1123
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,060
Hey, there's plenty of other places to play DDR, okay?

1124
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,060
Right? Right, Rod?

1125
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:43,060
I guess. Sure. Hello? Is anybody there?

1126
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:49,060
But see, that's the thing. I don't really know if there would be a tournament here seeing how anal they are.

1127
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:55,060
I mean, every single encounter with Golfland employees has been anal, anal, anal.

1128
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,060
Except for the nice manager who helps us out tonight.

1129
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,060
Yes, he's very nice.

1130
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:02,060
Except for him. He's pretty cool, but everyone else has been kind of anal and stupid.

1131
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:06,060
Did you notice he looks kind of like an overweight Owen Wilson?

1132
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,060
But he's very nice.

1133
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,060
Yes, but he's got that face like Owen Wilson.

1134
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,880
you might be telling him that date and time to listen to this very show

1135
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,900
i hope not

1136
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,780
and i hope you're going to edit this out of the way that the case in all these

1137
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,260
comments and i think i think you're wrong

1138
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:28,260
this is what i know i think

1139
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,660
and this is now low-key talking

1140
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,940
little kids are going to kick my ass

1141
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:38,740
love to kick my ass so yeah i was kicked by a little kid about the money

1142
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:41,640
They don't kick my ass, they just threaten to kick my ass.

1143
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,640
I don't know why, it's not like I look like a little kid or something.

1144
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,640
You know where we are? We're in the upstairs part of Golf Land,

1145
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,340
and we're surrounded, we're in the happy birthday section, or the party section, whatever,

1146
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,640
and there's all these drawings of dragons with really huge nostrils.

1147
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,640
Like, what the hell?

1148
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,240
Okay, what's up with that dragon right there?

1149
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,640
I mean, he looks like there's a bulge coming out of his stomach, and I don't think it's his stomach.

1150
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,840
They all look crazy, they all look...

1151
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,440
And he's having a very happy birthday.

1152
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,040
It's a nostril-saurus or something, God, it's like, crazy.

1153
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,320
That's what I find you with the shorts and burning cupcake.

1154
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,200
Burning cupcake?

1155
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,120
Look out, he's coming right for us!

1156
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,360
That's burning heat, my friend. See, now, all those things that you would assume

1157
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,920
are, like, confetti, those are actually spots he's seen because he's on acid. I mean, look at his eyes.

1158
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:32,920
Yeah, I could have, like, telephoned operator. There's two conversations going on right now, this show isn't in stereo.

1159
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,820
Oh, yeah

1160
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:41,420
Yeah, so I like telephone operator as I was continuing my conversation. Yes. Yes. Yes

1161
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:46,980
So let's get um, interesting talk on I don't know. What are we English? I like ass

1162
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,160
Let's get our money

1163
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,320
Ass is good bread. Oh

1164
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,320
Money

1165
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:01,920
The money's neat and fun and I think the money's super but not laser done this show drunk. Um, I know

1166
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,560
We should have gotten more people like playing DDR actually and playing, you know

1167
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,560
Hip-hop mania and drum mania. It's an audio thing

1168
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:18,880
Visual aids don't help. Yes, but we could get very good. I'd rather undermine your intelligence

1169
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,220
Thank you, Ted, but what is it? Your powers of observation are great

1170
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:28,660
I'm sorry, you have to read 8-Bit Theater, anyway, or maybe not, yeah, so anyway.

1171
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,780
Over your head, it's probably too advanced for you for a simple month.

1172
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:35,100
So let's start talking about that.

1173
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,740
Yeah, you know, keyboard mania is fixed and working, I noticed, I went down there and

1174
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:39,740
played it.

1175
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:40,740
No, the right side is.

1176
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,340
Yeah, the left side has this tendency to make new chords.

1177
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:47,100
We need to tell Dwayne or whatever the hell his name is about it.

1178
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,700
Dwayne the nice guy, Dwayne the nice guy, Dwayne the nice guy, Dwayne the nice guy.

1179
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,200
His name's Bob, okay.

1180
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,700
Dwayne.

1181
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,500
It's Bob.

1182
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,000
Dwayne.

1183
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,500
Bob.

1184
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,000
Dwayne.

1185
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Dammit, it's Bob, okay?

1186
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,500
Dwayne.

1187
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,000
Dwayne.

1188
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,500
Bob.

1189
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,000
Dwayne.

1190
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,500
Bob.

1191
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,000
Dwayne.

1192
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:01,500
Bob.

1193
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,000
You know-

1194
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:08,800
You know, I hope we don't get sued for, like, saying all these people on the radio, but, you know, we have no money and can't get blood out of turnips, so, you know, you'll never take me alive.

1195
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,700
That was a cheesy saying.

1196
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:18,100
You know, I come in and I saw that and I'm like, wow, it's on, it's working, and the keys are all intact, oh my god.

1197
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,700
Keyboard mania is, I guess, okay.

1198
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:25,260
Just wait one minute, I mean, just wait one, uh, let me, uh, start over.

1199
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,860
Just wait a second, there'll be little kids pulling the keys off any minute now.

1200
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:30,640
Oh, no.

1201
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:32,560
No.

1202
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,060
Oh, yeah?

1203
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,780
Yeah, for about a month, actually.

1204
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:42,540
I was, I was just thinking, now, if, like, to be honest, just say, say, if we ever got banned,

1205
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,540
how would they support themselves during the winter?

1206
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,860
I mean, no one comes in here other than us.

1207
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,900
Who would keep, you know, who would run this place?

1208
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,900
How would they get the money to run this place?

1209
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:56,900
I think something like that would happen. We're their only source of income in the winter.

1210
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,900
Except for maybe, you know, three dollars off Pac-Man or something.

1211
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,900
But, um, you know, and that's like a week.

1212
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:07,900
Okay, so, what's gonna happen is they're gonna, we're gonna be, we get banned.

1213
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:12,900
They're gonna be going without us for about a couple of months and realize that they're in debt or something, you know?

1214
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,900
Well, let's just put it this way. I mean, I spend unusual, you know,

1215
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:21,040
time coming here about fifteen to twenty dollars and tokens every time which is

1216
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,620
why I don't like coming down here all the time because it's really hard in my

1217
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:31,600
account yeah I'm poor but anyways yes so if you know they just cut me off shit

1218
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:36,640
man look at Q's are man if I stop coming there I like spend 15 grand there over

1219
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,320
four years okay so sad I have to say though I'm very dishonest when it comes

1220
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,680
with two ways I get my tokens I came here tonight played a few games DDR

1221
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:52,600
maybe four five six of them two of those being doubles i came with no money i'm a scrounger

1222
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:57,720
as it were okay so they don't make any money off me so banning me how do you scrounge tokens

1223
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,960
exactly you go around baking people or you found him on the ground or why i find the machine or

1224
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:07,160
what he asked me uh you know oh some machines broken tonight i don't tell him i tell him the

1225
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,680
ones that i want to play that are broken not the ones that are broken that i get money out of

1226
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:17,800
Uh-huh see I don't shame shame. I'm I'm I don't steal up a donation

1227
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,200
Wait wait you're gonna feed this this

1228
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,960
Give the money to people who actually okay. I I spend money. I spend

1229
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:37,520
Wow, that's like giving to the Salvation Army, that was incredible.

1230
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,520
Thank you.

1231
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,520
Ring ring ring, here's my bell.

1232
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,480
Well, thanks for being a shout out you want to give here on our little program.

1233
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,600
Well, it was good to meet everybody.

1234
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,600
I do exist.

1235
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,600
I am Vandalous.

1236
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,600
Right on.

1237
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,600
And I'm out.

1238
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
Well, thanks for coming.

1239
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,600
Nice seeing you.

1240
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,600
Goodbye, Vandalous.

1241
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,600
Later.

1242
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,600
Yeah, the one person Anita's back.

1243
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,600
Did you see anything that happened to us downstairs?

1244
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,600
We got accosted by the man.

1245
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,600
The employee came up to us and said,

1246
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,600
I don't think you're supposed to be doing the show here.

1247
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,600
I still don't believe that he exists.

1248
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,600
I think it was just an elaborate hologram.

1249
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,600
Okay.

1250
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,600
Anyway, as I was telling Anita,

1251
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,600
and finally the manager came out,

1252
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,600
but we got the cool manager tonight

1253
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,600
who likes the Bamani crowd and does things for us.

1254
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,600
So, but Jamie's in his office right now.

1255
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:30,840
now and we don't know what's going on. She's been in there for quite a while there's there's been a

1256
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:37,280
recent plague of child deduction hey hey hey Jamie's no Jamie's not a child it's just just it's been

1257
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:42,360
in this community and stuff so in as we discovered on last week's under station live she has the

1258
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:49,960
voice of a child but she's she's not a child sorry Joe that's scary so we don't know what's going on

1259
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:56,100
We're just gonna keep this show going. We said it would be an experimental show ten point ten point five and and shit boy

1260
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:58,820
This is a train wreck radio live

1261
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,220
This show was brought to you by ass here

1262
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,480
That's my ass

1263
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:10,480
God, I don't want to touch that my good ass. Are you trained? That's gross. You're nasty on your ass

1264
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,520
You know and they're getting that rubbing noise on the air by the way

1265
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,860
That's what it sounds like to be against my ass.

1266
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,860
I hope you all enjoyed.

1267
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,460
I don't ever want to go back there.

1268
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,460
There's something...

1269
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,460
There's a bad party.

1270
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,460
Don't blow into the microphone.

1271
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:27,980
You know what's wrong with this show?

1272
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:28,980
There's no donuts.

1273
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:29,980
That's why!

1274
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:30,980
None of us are hyper.

1275
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:34,620
We could go downstairs and get overpriced cardboard pizza.

1276
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,620
No.

1277
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,620
I'm pretty hungry.

1278
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:37,740
Maybe.

1279
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:38,740
Not enough for cardboard pizza.

1280
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,140
Sometimes though, sometimes though, if you go right before closing you can get free cardboard

1281
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:43,140
pizza.

1282
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:44,140
Wow!

1283
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,140
It's like saying you get free shit.

1284
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:47,940
God, I love free shit, I know.

1285
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,740
That's like when you're driving down the street, and they have like the big signs that say,

1286
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,140
you know, free dirt!

1287
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,100
I know!

1288
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,100
Free pie!

1289
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,720
And the pie is also evil.

1290
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,260
It's worse than cardboard pizza, it's foam pizza, come on.

1291
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:00,860
Fertilizer for sale.

1292
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:01,860
Exactly!

1293
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,740
Like, who gives a damn?

1294
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:04,740
Yeah, exactly.

1295
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:05,740
Oh, oh.

1296
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:06,740
Charn!

1297
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,740
Nope.

1298
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,740
Oh, did you think, do we have a Jamie?

1299
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:09,740
Oh, I see.

1300
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,740
What?

1301
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,740
Nope.

1302
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,740
I thought we had a Jamie sighting.

1303
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:13,740
Nope, not yet.

1304
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:14,740
A Jamie sighting, what is she like an alien or something?

1305
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,740
No, I'm starting to wonder what happened.

1306
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,740
It's a Jamie, oh my god.

1307
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:20,740
When we go into our next break, we won't come back from that break until Jamie's back.

1308
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,740
Oh, somebody else is going into the office now.

1309
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:22,740
Oh.

1310
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:23,740

1315
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:28,740
All right.

1316
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,740
What is going on?

1317
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:30,740
Take advantage of nobody being downstairs.

1318
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:31,740
That's what I did earlier.

1319
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,740

1320
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:33,740

01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,160
Yeah

1358
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,960
My fuck you of the week is

1359
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,040
DVD region codes I

1360
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:58,840
Don't know what you guys think about this, but I can't stand them. I usually don't have a fuck you

1361
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,740
I'm usually really mellow.

1362
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,740
I really, usually things don't bother me.

1363
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:04,240
She usually has the darn you.

1364
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,240
You're just kidding.

1365
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,240
What?

1366
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,240
But for the past several weeks.

1367
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,240
Tell me, have you never been mellow?

1368
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:14,240
So sad.

1369
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,240
Have you ever been lonely?

1370
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,240
Have you ever tried?

1371
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,240
Okay, okay, all right.

1372
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,240
All right, anyway, I'm sorry to cut you off.

1373
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:27,740
Okay, well, see, I don't understand region codes because

1374
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:31,580
I suppose they were invented to avoid piracy, correct?

1375
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,580
Yes.

1376
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,020
Well, they didn't do it.

1377
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:39,780
All that they succeeded in doing is screwing over people like me who want to buy nice DVDs

1378
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:42,780
from other countries that don't have any English translations.

1379
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:48,980
Well, you know, I have a Japanese PlayStation 2 so I can play DVDs with the Japanese region

1380
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,420
and I bet if I hooked things up right I could do a dub.

1381
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:52,420
So...

1382
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:53,420
Ooh!

1383
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,420
You should give me a call.

1384
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,420
We'll talk.

1385
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:56,420
You're gonna do a dub?

1386
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,420
No, not a dub.

1387
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:03,660
Not like I'm gonna actually talk and do the dub. I'm gonna like put it in the VCR and tape hit record and

1388
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,300
Be a good dubber

1389
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,420
Life is on

1390
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,100
Stop it

1391
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:16,960
If you don't get that show started dubbing company a dubbing company what we call it

1392
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,700

1396
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:50,180

1397
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,180
Who would you want to do the voice for?

1398
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,180
Akane Tendo from Ranma.

1399
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,180
Give us a sample of what your dub would sound like.

1400
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,180
Uh, I don't know any of her lines.

1401
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:03,180
I'm feeling fat and saucy.

1402
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,180
You are? I'm sorry, Ralph.

1403
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,180
Say, would you like to go to a movie?

1404
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,180
Ouch. Ouch.

1405
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,180
Yo!

1406
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,180
I hate you.

1407
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,180
I know what voice you'd like to do.

1408
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,180
Who's the name of the main character from La Blue Girl?

1409
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:18,180
Shut up.

1410
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:26,180
I thought it was LA. Or I would do Ranma Chan, the girl side of Ranma. I could do one from her.

1411
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:31,180
I'm going back to China, so suck on that old man.

1412
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:33,180
Excellent.

1413
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,180
They're clapping in the background.

1414
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:37,180
They love you. They really love you.

1415
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:43,180
Thank you, thank you. Yeah, I think that would be cool. That would be the ultimate job, but I think only Canadians do that.

1416
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:47,380
Come on, you haven't heard the new Funimation Dragon Ball Z dubs then yet, have you?

1417
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,380
They're from Texas.

1418
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,820
Are they good?

1419
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:50,820
They're from Texas.

1420
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:51,820
Oh, okay, so that's no.

1421
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:55,620

1452
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,300
It looks like Owen Wilson, an overweight Owen Wilson.

1453
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,900
That is lanky style.

1454
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,020

K-Y.

1457
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,260
My emphasis on the K-Y.

1458
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:15,740
You know, I saw this license plate that said K-Y lady.

1459
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,900
Like, who wants to advertise that you're the K-Y lady?

1460
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,100
Oh, here's somebody who hasn't been on this show yet tonight.

1461
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:25,100
Everybody say hello to Somnia Megasex, also known as Ryan.

1462
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:25,820
Hello, Ryan.

1463
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:26,620
What is this?

01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:27,820
Like, live broadcast for him?

1465
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,860
And Dan the man's coming up too.

1466
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:34,420
Now this is going to be interesting because we're going to have to explain to Dan what happened to Jamie.

1467
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:38,340
We don't know what happened to Jamie.

1468
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,540
I don't know what happened to Jamie either. But we lost your fiance Dan.

1469
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:44,580
We lost Jamie.

1470
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:49,220
Dan comes in, come tell us the gossip on Jamie once she's not here.

1471
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:52,900
She's in the office right now with the manager.

1472
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,020
She's completely insane.

1473
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:56,780
How so?

1474
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,880
You know her.

1475
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,340
That was Dan, the man, ladies and gentlemen.

1476
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,640
This is quite true.

1477
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:06,020
So, yeah, did you see us downstairs at the beginning of this segment?

1478
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:08,020
We almost all got arrested.

1479
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:09,060
Really? No, I'm just kidding.

1480
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,560
Oh, damn. This is how the story changes, like, you ever play telephone?

1481
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,920
No, one of the employees came up to us and said, oh, what do you guys do? And I said it was a school project, you know.

1482
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,440
This is really redundant for our listeners.

1483
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,060
Yeah.

1484
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:24,300
Because that's the only school I know about.

1485
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:28,200
yeah rodney my charm school so i'm the only one here

1486
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,360
that actually looks like i'm in high school because i am

1487
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,920
and what are we were just your cousins

1488
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,120
yes you're all you know i'm i don't know if you are

1489
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,600
you're all my you're all my parents all of you

1490
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,920
i'd like to write down now watch my damn car

1491
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,560
so long story short manager came down but it was the good manager the nice

1492
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,880
manager support and i hear golf on the one employee the lights

1493
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,760
of the money players and now they're in office right now we think they're

1494
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,400
talking about a tournament possibly but we don't know he not to spread rumors

1495
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,800
prematurely but you know what i have a turn i don't know if we're on a radio

1496
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:06,200
and we're spreading rumors or anything like that right ok no one listens to the

1497
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,920
show or ok opa

1498
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,480
yeah this show is on every sunday night from uh... seven o'clock till nine

1499
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,200
o'clock you don't even know yet big pots

1500
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,680
like like how do i listen to it

1501
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,660
how do you listen to it well this is kind of redundant for our listeners are already

1502
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:20,320
listening

1503
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:24,200
we're just going to go to our website they may not know the website h t

1504
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:29,820
uh... if you look at my signature on sac baumanni or d r freak and sky high

1508
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,560
and that's the website

1509
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,620
just like the old secretary monier just like the old one except this orange

1510
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:48,900
lounge idea

1511
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:52,660
right and i was in on its hands you know what something maybe the listeners of

1512
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,700
this live show don't know

1513

when we're not on the air to live talk show we got the money music a more plan

Mexicans kick-ass why is that cuz they'll sell you liquor Mexican?

1544
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,600

1558
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:47,500
his age I can believe it out if you want I'm trying to find a clever way to say

1559
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:51,860
how old I am but I told enough old enough to not to know better than to

1560

1562
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:07,180
The reflex is a...

1563
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:11,180
You just let your feelings show

1564
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:14,180
Life is a mystery

1565
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:17,180
Guys won't give it to me until I'm 18 because it's child abuse

01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:25,020
You've got to do it all right

1632
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:27,020
You are the light of my heart

1633
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:33,020
You are the light of my heart

1634
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:40,020
Oh, whether you would see me there

1635
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:47,020
Oh, whether you would see me there

1636
01:37:47,020 --> 01:38:15,020
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1637
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:25,940
Alright, and we're back from that little break we took of music. Hope you enjoyed it. And

1638
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:34,020
Jamie is back. Jamie has a headache. Now, oh my gosh, what went on in there? Just being

1639
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:39,060
so enthusiastic. Basically, we're a go. We're gonna have a tourney here. That's what you're

1640
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,540
speculating out here. Probably setting up some kind of tournament for Rosalind. That's

1641
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:49,760
And I can't go into too much detail right now, but it's initial right on we're going to get us going now

1642
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,160
You didn't have to do anything naughty to make that happen right no

1643
01:38:53,160 --> 01:39:00,540
No, you know I had to ask did my fiance's downstairs. I know he called you insane during the last break. Don't you know it?

1644
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:07,780
He lives with me. Do you have any retorts? Oh now you guys if I'm insane Dan's like freaking retarded

1645
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:09,980

1648
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,480
Golf Line's closing in a few minutes, so as soon as they close, we're going to end the

1649
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,480
show.

01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:28,160
You guys have anything you want to say, goodbyes or anything like that?

1651
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,940
Sayonara.

It's been really fun doing the show and the money all the way loot rock on.

1670
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:05,200
Did you want to give a shout out to your, your friends, this new shirt, this new shirt

1671
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:08,120
you're wearing here in honor of my step squad family.

1672
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:12,880
I need to go ahead and let you guys know I am wearing my shirt tonight and about it's

1673
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:13,880
not TV.

1674
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:16,720
Iguana girl and I both had a Heineken in your honor on the plane.

1675
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:21,800
Of course we were too broke on the way back to have one other woman, but we had, we had

1676
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:32,760
one for our Step Squad homies, so, yo. Right on. Holla! I guess in reference to the promo

1677
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:37,160
that Step Squad did at Mt. Mike's Journey. So how are you liking this Wednesday night

1678
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:40,720
taping? Ted loves it. He wants us to do this more regularly, more often. As long as we

1679
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:45,760
let him know in advance, I guess. Who do we have to let know now? Well, now that you have

1680
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:51,120
an inn. Ooh. You have an inn. Um, I guess we'll just let him know a week before. Okay,

1681
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:55,640
this is a burning question. Loki says his name is Bob. I think it's- Dwayne. Dwayne.

1682
01:41:55,640 --> 01:42:01,720
Ah, Loki's wrong. Would you win like a dollar? Loki was just being an ass. He was being an

1683
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:06,960
ass, but I'm right. Uh, moral of the story, you're right. Yes, exactly, as always. I'm

1684
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,680
hungry. Well, I suppose this is an idea we can continue to do in the future if, um, you

1685
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:14,200
know, we want to take another week off or whatever, cause that happens sometimes. Weeks

1686
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:20,760
off or nice yep we saw like sleep go to bed early one night I guess yep maybe I

1687
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,800
can convince Dan to have a barbecue and I guess I can have you know barbecue

1688
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,600
tofu or something since I'm having you know barbecue up some shrimp for me or

1689
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:32,440
something bye everybody thanks for coming

1690
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:38,000
of course when we're doing this here at golf land and pre taping we can't really

1691
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,320
interact with our chat room right now like we can't experience like I'm sure

1692
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:48,640
SoCalKicks is in the chat room right now and he's promoting USA and yelling at us when

1693
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:54,060
we're dissing Konami in any way and Twen probably has some new Hell remix that he's distributing

1694
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:55,060
amongst the folks.

1695
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,320
How did we get about our resident joker?

1696
01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:01,480
Our resident joker is probably in there, Pyro is probably saying some things and talking

1697
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:04,120
about how boring we are tonight because we're not talking about 3-TittedEmmy.

1698
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,480
Pantsless rage, yo.

1699
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,720
Pantsless rage, he bounces.

1700
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:11,400
And Slinky's probably just very bitter that he's not here.

1701
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,400
We miss you Slinky!

1702
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,400
It's...

1703
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,400
I don't know, what else is there to say right now?

1704
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,400
Any other Bemani news going on?

1705
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:25,400
I haven't eaten anything today, except a cupcake and some chocolate covered espresso beans

1706
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:29,400
and this like, orange creamsicle Dutch ice drink thingy.

1707
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,400
Yum!

1708
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,400
I'm nutritious today, that's probably why I have a headache, my god.

1709
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:39,400
I have Evangelion Redeath though, that's awesome, I'm gonna watch the hell out of that tonight.

1710
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:40,400
Good stuff.

1711
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:52,400
Apparently though, I think that the lovely people at Gravity, who basically made Ragnarok online, has blocked the servers.

1712
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,400
I could not get on. I'm going to try again.

1713
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:01,400
I can only read like the Kana where it says server word not works.

1714
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:06,400
So I need to figure out the rest of it out.

1715
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:12,800
I'll have an update on my addiction online RPG, so yay.

1716
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,440
Right on.

1717
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,240
I'm sure everyone's so interested.

1718
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,040
Well, you know, if people are online

1719
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,200
and they're not listening to our show

1720
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,960
and they're not listening to the Bollywood Music Amore,

1721
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,360
I don't know why they wouldn't be.

1722
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,240
But, you know, those are fun things to do.

1723
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,360
I played right back.

1724
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,800
I turned off the background music.

1725
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,680
See, this is one reason we are on a modem-friendly stream,

1726
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,080
even though we know a lot of people are on DSL these days.

1727
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,880
We reach out to the modem, the folks still on modem,

1728
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,700
and those on dsl can still

1729
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,860
do other stuff they're not there but i was not a sucked down when they came to

1730
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:45,760
let down i would be on dial-up listening and playing ragnarok so i'll hour and i

1731
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:50,400
think you know it's possible that you know believe in yourself

1732
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,800
and then you have to leave the music that's not bad at it

1733
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,340
i gotta believe

1734
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:58,360
dojo casino it's all in the mind

1735
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:02,000
as we get a lot of looks we were trying to enter in the last thing that when you

1736
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,920
We were trying to say things to our Japanese listeners because we noticed that there are people in Japan listening every week

1737
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:11,580
So I wanted to say something like a hello or something, but none of us knew Japanese. So you have anything you want to say?

1738
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:17,240
Nihonjin no minna san. Domo arigatou gozaimashita.

1739
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:20,080
Shite kudasai.

1740
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:26,520
She just told me to go to hell. I think if I said it as properly as I could I said

1741
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:32,440
And everyone of our Japanese listeners, we thank you very much for listening, and please

1742
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,440
keep listening.

1743
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,440
And not just Japan, but worldwide.

1744
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,440
Canada, we got a lot of listeners.

1745
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:37,440
Unfortunately, I forgot my French.

1746
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,440
Up there in Canada.

1747
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:42,920
Yeah, give a shout out to our Canadian moderators, yo, for DBR Freak.

1748
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:46,640
And Europe, also our Chile, of course.

1749
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,640
Can't forget Chile.

1750
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:52,240
And to all of our moderators in Alabama and the Mideast, and for all the people who didn't,

1751
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:55,720
you know, the moderators who didn't get to go, we missed you there.

1752
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:00,960
I just have to say right now, Mad Love to my fellow DDR Freak moderators, I had a wonderful

1753
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,700
time with you guys.

1754
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:07,080
And Mad Love to Melody for coming from out of town and entertaining me and being the

1755
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,680
guest on last week's show.

1756
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,680
Is that...

1757
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,960
It looks good that Melody came.

1758
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:11,960
We were having a...

1759
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,960
I had to talk to her on the phone.

1760
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,160
Oh yes, that's right, while we were in the mall to talk to Melody.

1761
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:20,760
We were at a strip mall, in the cab on the way to strip mall to go to game land.

1762
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:24,960
It was kind of a support group because she had her... her boyfriend was out of town and

1763
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,840
one of my best friends was out of town in vegas so uh...

1764
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,320
you know we had to have a support group of uh... you know or pouting is we're

1765
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,720
not in vegas time but

1766
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:36,000
i'm i'm going to get to vegas at some point in the next few months so just a

1767
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,300
warning you vegas folk i will take the tape recorder

1768
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:39,680
unfortunately

1769
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,560
uh... we didn't

1770
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,620

1771
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:45,880

1772
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:48,660
uh... disinter use down there like she did an awesome job of the dollar many

1773
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:50,500

1774
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,640
uh... but

1775
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:56,440
I did make a mention to a couple of my fellow moderators that I'd love to have them on the show.

1776
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,440
Rad! Good.

1777
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,440
And you know, of course I always want to have Mel back on.

1778
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:05,140
Uh-huh. And there is a possibility in the future we'll have a few of the members from RTF on the show in the future.

1779
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:06,140
It's gonna be very cool. I'm hoping so.

1780
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:06,940
I'm hoping so too.

1781
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:10,640
I would love to get Rain on. I would love to get, you know...

1782
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:13,940
I would love to just have an RTF show, have the guys there.

1783
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,940
Have like, you know, my Step Squad people here.

1784
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:20,140
Right. And even if we can't get you guys here, you know what, we travel too.

1785
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:23,060
as is shown from Jamie going out of town last week, going to Vegas.

1786
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:26,820
We might go out to SoCal. I might be going to SoCal in a few weeks.

1787
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:30,140
So we'll be doing some taping down there if I go down there. I'll be sneaking off in Rob's

I'm dying, I'm dying.

1800
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,140
We're trying to go back.

1829
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:38,240

01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:41,060

uh... i think that uh...

1842
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:12,380
One thing, that video right there, the Evangelion, it's an anime, it reminds me of something I just got about two weeks ago.

1843
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:12,880
Oh.

1844
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:13,380
Okay.

1845
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:17,380
You might want to check your local grocery outlet, as I do, every now and then.

1846
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:18,380
Grocery outlet.

1847
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:21,380
I found the entire series of Bubble Gum Crisis there for two dollars.

1848
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:23,380
Dub or sub?

1849
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:24,380
Both.

1850
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:25,880
Awesome, DVDs?

1851
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:26,380
Yes.

1852
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:27,880
I will check.

1853
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:31,380
Although I already have, you know, two of the laser discs.

1854
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:32,880
Wow, man.

1855
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,880
And Bubble Gum Crisis laser disc and...

1856
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,380
I'm just saying though, um...

1857
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:43,700
Recently, the one down in Rockland here on Sunrise has been getting all kinds of DVDs

1858
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:46,180
and books, good books, computer games even.

1859
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,180
All kinds of stuff.

1860
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,180
Just two dollars.

1861
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,180
Everything.

1862
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:50,180
I will check it out.

1863
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:51,180
Thank you for the info.

1864
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:52,180
All right.

1865
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:53,180
Any of you who live anywhere near here.

1866
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:55,180
You heard it on Orange Lounge Radio first, y'all.

1867
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:57,860
So do we have any more things to say to the listener?

1868
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:58,860
All right.

1869
01:50:58,860 --> 01:50:59,860
I'm going to hand it back to Rob now.

1870
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:00,860
All right.

1871
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:01,860
Y'all.

1872
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:02,860
Hi.

1873
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:03,860
So did you hear the news about why Jamie was in the office for so long?

1874
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:05,480
I was eavesdropping, yes.

1875
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:09,620
I did hear a little bit, but what did you hear? I heard something about attorney. Yes

1876
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:16,920
It is official once again aiming for the November ish range. You know not committing to a day yet

1877
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:21,840
We don't probably want to avoid turkey weekend or maybe not because a lot of people be off school turkey weekend

1878
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,220
So maybe that's something to look at who knows?

1879
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:32,680
Speaking from experience last year went on vacation a lot of occasion not so soon. We'll see the tickets to turkey are really expensive

1880
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:43,600
I'm thinking either weekend before or weekend after Turkey as in like not the ones immediately

1881
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:50,560
next to it but like way after or right proceeding you know why don't hopefully um but it is

1882
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:56,640
official we will be having tournament here at Roseville Golf Plan what else can we talk

1883
01:51:56,640 --> 01:52:01,680
about to close the show out here with I have a really bad headache really why stop I don't

1884
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:04,680
I don't know. Probably because I haven't hardly eaten anything and haven't slept with any.

1885
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:06,680
Well, we need to go eat before we go home.

1886
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:07,680
I need to eat.

1887
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,680
Here's your bad joke. Well, we're gonna go eat then.

1888
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:12,680
Let's go, like, you know, on a rampage and, you know, be cannibals or something.

1889
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:13,680
Hey, when you guys-

1890
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,680
Baby!

1891
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,680
Post something on, uh, Sacramento Money, man.

1892
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:19,680
Well, we're- not just Sacramento Money, because it's not just gonna be a Sacramento thing, it's gonna be everywhere.

1893
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:22,680
We'll post on Sacramento Money, we'll post on DDR Freak.

1894
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:28,680
Hell, you give me- you email us at OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com, we'll come spam your local board, even if you're in, like, Taiwan.

1895
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:32,680
We're going to plug our tournament on your board because it's going to be the biggest damn thing ever.

1896
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:35,680
We'll have to use one of those online translator services to be able to post.

1897
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,680
My horrible, horrible Babel fish.

1898
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:41,680
No, I found a really nice Japanese one, but I'll be posting that on our forums.

1899
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,680
Make it big and shiny, you know, so I can find it.

1900
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,680
Hold on.

1901
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:47,680
Because I'm retarded and I can't browse.

1902
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:48,680
You'll know. Trust us.

1903
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:52,680
About that translator, yeah, I really like it. It's cool.

1904
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,680
Oh, the new one? The new one you found? Tell them about this.

1905
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:58,240
man i don't remember the set up top of my head but it is it's actually a

1906
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,120
japanese translation program

1907
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:04,020
well translation website uh... and he has a japanese native site

1908
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:05,800
that will translate

1909
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,500
and japanese text to english nearly flawlessly or if you want to page

1910
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,240
through it

1911
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:13,340
it will have to leave the kanji katakana hit it up

1912
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:16,800
and put english text underneath it and you can even read fan fiction with that

1913
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,640
thing is so good while on top of that also translates english to japanese and

1914
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:23,740
a fairly reasonable patterns you can actually put something under look

1915
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:25,800
relatively literate

1916
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:29,900
have you guys heard the news about why jamie was in the office for so long

1917
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:32,880
from what i understand she was talking with the tech right

1918
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,340
we are going to be having tournament here

1919
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:37,100
winner cause i just spent a good

1920
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:40,500
ten minutes talking with mr tech guy to fix every bmani machine

1921
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,180
because like

1922
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:45,360
i was talking to him and he's like hey you know the soul caliber is broken

1923
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,820
and says i have you would you mind coming with me we have a nice tour of the

1924
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:49,960
arcade i'd like to take you on

1925
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,000
oh that's sweet

1926
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,720
and he's like, hang on, let me get my clipboard.

1927
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,660
It was lots and lots of happy fun.

1928
01:53:56,660 --> 01:54:01,300
Yeah, I have to say, I want to give him a major kudos,

1929
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:04,920
you know, the kudos are the size of Roseville Golf Land.

1930
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,340
We give Roseville Golf Land a lot of crap on this show.

1931
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:10,160
Well, maybe a little bit, but uh...

1932
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:14,040
Really, this is the best arcade in town. This is the best arcade in town.

1933
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:17,880
One of the great places to play. But someone should let Shiggle Boss know that

1934
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:21,080
the people are big deal don't actually know what he's talking about

1935
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:24,600
in regards to four plus that's really a good i talked to a doing that and he's

1936
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:25,620
like uh...

1937
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:27,960
you know i just don't know about that today it would lead to believe that

1938
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:32,000
jamie told him that i have a good

1939
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,360
that means that because i thought you might have no other talking about but

1940
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,400
uh...

1941
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,840
i decided like the kind of my care

1942
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:42,260
paid to do you know i came he was in the office for so long

1943
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:43,640
uh...

1944
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:44,980
i didn't like you know i did

1945
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:46,780
letters that they should be in fact

1946
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:48,460
that i have no did you have your

1947
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:49,900
but yeah i'm so

1948
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:53,820
