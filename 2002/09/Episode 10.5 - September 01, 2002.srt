1
00:00:01,728 --> 00:00:04,249
[SPEAKER_15]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:19,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Our live talk program begins now.

3
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:29,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

4
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:46,143
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn you, stop calling here!

5
00:00:46,323 --> 00:00:47,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't it 4215, pussywaves?

6
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:48,063
[SPEAKER_12]: You bitch!

7
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:52,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Now let me check this, it goes 212, fuck you!

8
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:54,446
[SPEAKER_12]: You have no morals, darling.

9
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:59,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching kiss of purpose.

10
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:01,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Kiss my great nooch.

11
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.

12
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too!

14
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:08,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Fucker, yeah?

15
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on it.

16
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:10,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Loser.

17
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:11,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Lame!

18
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:13,633
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the kind of my face...

19
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:19,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Breathing breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.

20
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:25,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

21
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:30,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I am your singing telegram.

22
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:35,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Live, but not really, from Roseville Golf Land here.

23
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,288
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Orange Lounge Radio.

24
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:41,170
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, I should say.

25
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,811
[SPEAKER_22]: It's so special it rides the short bus.

26
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's episode number 10.5.

27
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:47,254
[SPEAKER_04]: We're calling it 10 and a half.

28
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 10 and a half of Orange Lounge Radio.

29
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Because this isn't Sunday, but we're fooling you.

30
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:55,418
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our special Labor Day edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

31
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,740
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we refuse to labor the day before Labor Day.

32
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:01,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Jamie and I are going to be taking the weekend off.

33
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:05,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you're listening to this right now, Jamie and I are off somewhere vacationing.

34
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:07,109
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to know what you're off doing.

35
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere sunny.

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I know who you'll be with.

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, at the point that you're listening to this probably Sunday night at 7 o'clock, I'm probably going to be in Sunnyvale, actually.

38
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:20,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might be getting interviews and things like that.

39
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:24,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could, but I'm spending all weekend and, you know.

40
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:26,035
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just make Dan take me.

41
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:27,055
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a private getaway.

42
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:28,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you should make Dan take you.

43
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:30,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Dan's going to be here tonight, correct?

44
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:30,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Somewhere.

45
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,498
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to get an interview with him at some point.

46
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,159
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God.

47
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:44,966
[SPEAKER_22]: For those who are uninformed, Dan is my significant other, also known as the great and terrible DanmanX, also known as GunstarHero for people who have seen me mention that.

48
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:45,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

49
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:46,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes.

50
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:48,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Also known as Big Hater of Bimani.

51
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,331
[SPEAKER_22]: He is not a Big Hater of Bimani.

52
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:55,016
[SPEAKER_22]: He's the one who got all, you know, who, like, you know, creamed his pants when he played Guitar Freaks.

53
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,317
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

54
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:57,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Freaks is where it's at.

55
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,379
[SPEAKER_22]: Visual.

56
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,264
[SPEAKER_22]: No, nobody's allowed to vision dance with me.

57
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:02,944
I won't.

58
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:05,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

59
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:05,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I just...

60
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:10,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's going to be a very experimental show tonight.

61
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,037
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not even be two hours long.

62
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:13,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a weird kind of segment.

63
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,999
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of trying to divvy this up into little segments.

64
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Brad is our timekeeper right now.

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,381
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll let me know when we hit 40 minutes for the first segment, right?

66
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

67
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:24,464
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we are now at a minute and a half.

68
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:25,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

69
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm going to introduce everybody that's sitting out.

70
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I guess we should explain the layout.

71
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:33,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish this was TV sometimes, but we're going to explain the layout of Roseville Golf Club a little bit.

72
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:33,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Webcam, webcam.

73
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:35,530
[SPEAKER_04]: No webcam tonight.

74
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,972
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, there hasn't been a webcam any week except the first week.

75
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:39,773
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to get that fixed.

76
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:40,193
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will.

77
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:40,674
[SPEAKER_04]: We promise.

78
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:46,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, episode 11 next week is going to be a very different show because we're going to have a new intro.

79
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:48,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already got one planned out.

80
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully a new site and everything.

81
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you don't like the idea of a new intro?

82
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:53,022
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I love the intro.

83
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,043
[SPEAKER_02]: It has right now.

84
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:57,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we might dig it out of the archives occasionally.

85
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:58,086
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll use it for tonight's show.

86
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:00,468
[SPEAKER_22]: We get the look from Irene.

87
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:00,608
[SPEAKER_22]: Fine.

88
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:14,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm going to introduce the people that are up here upstairs right now because we get some people here that we don't normally get on the show because when we tape at the quote-unquote studio, also known as my office, on Sundays we don't always get the same people.

89
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:22,468
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have some of your old favorites joining us tonight besides the lovely DarkSakura and I. We haven't even introduced ourselves like we do at the beginning of every show.

90
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:23,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, they know who we are.

91
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:24,129
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what it is?

92
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,431
[SPEAKER_22]: If they don't by now, then they must have been living under a rock.

93
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get to cheat tonight.

94
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:33,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the computer screen in front of me with the script, the opening script, and what we're going to talk about.

95
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:34,833
[SPEAKER_22]: So we still have to plug the chat room.

96
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because there will be people in the chat room right now.

97
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:38,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can talk about us while we're not paying attention.

98
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, talk shit about us behind our back right now.

99
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, Rick's playing with my wood.

100
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:43,014
You've got wood.

101
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:44,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I like wood.

102
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,435
[SPEAKER_22]: That was Rick.

103
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:47,275
[SPEAKER_22]: He's playing with my wood.

104
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:48,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you learn lots about Rick on this show tonight.

105
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to introduce everybody.

106
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go around and introduce everybody.

107
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:53,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Irene, lovely Irene, who's been on many, many shows.

108
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:53,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess.

109
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm an old favorite.

110
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you need to change your Depends, dear.

111
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:04,947
[SPEAKER_04]: We have everybody's favorite DDRaholic say hi to Anita.

112
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.

113
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:09,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you don't even know what we're doing, right?

114
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:10,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard Orange Lounge before?

115
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:11,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you even know...

116
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:12,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of it.

117
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:17,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sat through about two or three episodes.

118
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Biggest torture of your life, huh?

119
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,725
[SPEAKER_22]: It was so terrible, I just couldn't tear myself from the computer.

120
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,607
[SPEAKER_22]: A train wreck so bad you feel like you're in the middle of it.

121
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course we have the always awesome Rick.

122
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, this is Rick, also known on the boards as Rick.

123
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:34,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Rick.

124
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:36,155
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Rick.

125
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:36,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that so?

126
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,016
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have any words for our listeners?

127
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just like to say that I'm Rick.

128
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:41,358
[SPEAKER_22]: He's Rick.

129
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:42,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm back again.

130
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:42,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Read the dang thing.

131
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I ask questions, read the dank back.

132
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:10,097
[SPEAKER_04]: True words were never said.

133
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:11,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Or else, fuck you.

134
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, fuck you.

135
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,524
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a funny man tonight.

136
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,026
[SPEAKER_19]: Motherfucker!

137
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to our timekeeper tonight, Brad.

138
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,273
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now at four minutes and a half.

139
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:23,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

140
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Four and a half minutes.

141
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,021
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have two more hours to go, basically

142
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:50,079
[SPEAKER_22]: When we get tired of talking about Mimani, we do List List, and it's usually Mimani.

143
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:51,879
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I was going to say, wait, Mimani, what's that?

144
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,800
[SPEAKER_22]: We have more people.

145
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, more people.

146
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Come over to the microphones and introduce yourselves.

147
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:57,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Introduce yourself.

148
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Look in the microphone.

149
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:00,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Say your name.

150
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:00,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

151
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:02,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And who are you, miss?

152
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:03,404
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Soonja.

153
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:04,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Soonja.

154
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:05,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

155
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:06,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are?

156
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:08,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, I'm Rai Rai.

157
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:08,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Rai Rai.

158
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you an alcoholic, too?

159
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:10,508
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

160
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:12,068
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the question?

161
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:13,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you an alcoholic?

162
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:16,847
[SPEAKER_22]: I like Holic.

163
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:19,928
[SPEAKER_04]: What games do you girls like to play here at Golfland?

164
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,909
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to play DDR.

165
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:25,150
[SPEAKER_18]: She likes to play DDR.

166
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,770
[SPEAKER_18]: And what about you?

167
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I like playing Para.

168
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:30,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, she's a para goddess.

169
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Paralist.

170
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,826
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to teach me some more because I don't know any.

171
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:37,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a few, but I look dumb when I do them.

172
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:37,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to know more.

173
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:38,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's barely.

174
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I clap and wave my hands.

175
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:40,929
[SPEAKER_22]: And shake your butt.

176
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And shake my butt to Deluxe.

177
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Deluxe.

178
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like the first one I learned.

179
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:45,491
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually the first one I learned.

180
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,451
[SPEAKER_22]: That was like the fifth one I learned.

181
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:49,673
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the first one I learned was Boom Boom Fire because that's everybody's first para.

182
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:50,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Like a Virgin.

183
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:51,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Not mine.

184
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:54,255
[SPEAKER_22]: My first was Night of Fire.

185
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:55,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, mine too.

186
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:57,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine was 1-0-0.

187
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:57,440
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-0-0?

188
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,620
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-0-0-0.

189
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,563
[SPEAKER_22]: One more whore.

190
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,386
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-0-1 is the upgraded version.

191
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:09,547
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-0-1 is the upgraded version to 1-0-0.

192
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,529
[SPEAKER_22]: I still always thought it sounded like they were saying one more whore.

193
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,250
[SPEAKER_22]: One more whore.

194
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So you weren't at the show, the live show on Sunday.

195
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:19,719
[SPEAKER_22]: I was in Vegas.

196
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:21,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about Vegas.

197
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:23,604
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like an awesome trip.

198
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:24,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us all about it.

199
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:28,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Imagine 16 DDR Freak moderators sharing a room.

200
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,310
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

201
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:02,370
[SPEAKER_22]: But no, there would just be random comments.

202
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone would go, oh, motherfucker.

203
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,811
[SPEAKER_22]: And someone would go, oh, you got three points.

204
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:05,271
[SPEAKER_22]: You flamed.

205
00:09:05,991 --> 00:09:06,911
[SPEAKER_22]: Or, you're post-whoring.

206
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:07,672
[SPEAKER_22]: You're talking too much.

207
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:10,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, does somebody walk around and filter people?

208
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:12,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you're like, oh, shit, I messed up.

209
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,833
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone would go, poopy.

210
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:28,258
[SPEAKER_22]: No, but basically the first night when we got there, the first thing that happened is Evian, Colin, he came in, looked at Doreen, Miss Toy, and goes, oh, DarkSakura.

211
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:34,608
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, so once again, we get the, oh, I thought you were Asian for me, so.

212
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:38,491
[SPEAKER_04]: For those out there that don't know, DarkSakura is a honker.

213
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're going to introduce Ted.

214
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:44,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Ted doesn't even know what's going on here.

215
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:46,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Ted.

216
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any idea what we're doing right now, Ted?

217
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:50,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea what you guys are doing right now.

218
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:52,002
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about as much as I know.

219
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

220
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:55,424
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to talk into the mics more or else we don't hear you.

221
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:56,605
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

222
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:56,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to...

223
00:09:57,686 --> 00:10:02,027
[SPEAKER_22]: What are you talking about?

224
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,087
[SPEAKER_22]: He's a mushroom.

225
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:04,028
[SPEAKER_22]: He's a fuck guy.

226
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:04,528
[SPEAKER_22]: Ha ha.

227
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:06,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, more for my Vegas story.

228
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:06,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

229
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:08,729
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I am the mic whore now.

230
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:09,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to warn the listeners out there.

231
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:11,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's show, very different, very random.

232
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be the best show we ever do.

233
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be the fucking worst.

234
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,850
[SPEAKER_22]: You can hear a burp.

235
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,270
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

236
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:17,111
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah.

237
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:18,231
[SPEAKER_22]: There's more about burp later.

238
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:18,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

239
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:20,391
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

240
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:25,957
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I won a dog in one of the crane games because, once again, I raped the crane game and I won a dog and named him Burp.

241
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:28,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, did the crane game call the police?

242
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it say... Oh, bye, Ry-Ry.

243
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:31,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Later.

244
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:32,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

245
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:33,264
[SPEAKER_04]: She left.

246
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:40,371
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who I feel... One of our regular listeners, Slinky, also known as Will, was here and, like, ready to be on the show and...

247
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,332
[SPEAKER_04]: We were supposed to start taping at 7.30 tonight.

248
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:47,974
[SPEAKER_04]: We got here and we thought, oh, we'll play one Bomani game and then we'll tape.

249
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Then one kind of turned into five.

250
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:53,696
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time we were ready to tape, Slinky's parents showed up and took him home.

251
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:54,777
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't last I saw him.

252
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:57,278
[SPEAKER_22]: He was napping in the sumo game.

253
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:58,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

254
00:10:58,518 --> 00:10:59,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Slinky.

255
00:10:59,058 --> 00:10:59,999
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get you on another show.

256
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,159
[SPEAKER_22]: We love you.

257
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:01,779
[SPEAKER_22]: Parents.

258
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

259
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Take them away from the show.

260
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you guys have to get going?

261
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:08,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait, before... Okay, we'll take a break from the Vegas story.

262
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:11,507
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to plug your new role-playing game that's coming out?

263
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is pretty cool.

264
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:13,408
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to plug it?

265
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I guess so.

266
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:23,716
[SPEAKER_03]: My new game that I made after three years of work with me as the sole programmer, my friend Steve as the sole artist, is an epic-size role-playing game in 2D.

267
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,178
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an epic computer game.

268
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:27,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a...

269
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Warrior, Bitchy

270
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:57,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's a lot like Earthbound as well, which wouldn't surprise me because Earthbound, as some may or may not know, is Rick's most godly RPG ever.

271
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:58,821
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite game of all time.

272
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:01,422
[SPEAKER_04]: The battles really remind me of Earthbound battles.

273
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:05,324
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you get a bat as a weapon?

274
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:16,161
[SPEAKER_03]: you actually get several bats as a weapon you can have a rock as a weapon or you can have a stick with a little nail poked through it that's what it's called a stick with a nail poked through it as a weapon no orange bat of justice?

275
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:19,306
[SPEAKER_03]: no but there's a hammer of justice that you get in the courthouse

276
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,521
[SPEAKER_03]: The Deer Carcass The Double Chin

277
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely powerful.

278
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a very, very powerful item, yeah.

279
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:51,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a gaga, because if you hit people with your gaga, that's embarrassing as well as... It makes you go gaga.

280
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:51,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

281
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:53,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I wet myself.

282
00:12:53,577 --> 00:12:54,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, huh?

283
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:54,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Daily.

284
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:57,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any Bamani references in the game?

285
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you try at all to incorporate the DDR taking over my fucking life thing in there, or...

286
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:04,464
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

287
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:05,946
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many jokes in there.

288
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:15,233
[SPEAKER_03]: So many megabytes of just text jokes that I can't even imagine that I didn't stick a few Bomani jokes in there.

289
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:15,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

290
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:17,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So any expected time of release?

291
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in time for Christmas to put under the tree?

292
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:23,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm hoping actually to be done with it by the end of September.

293
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking as far as that goes.

294
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,581
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting really close to done.

295
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:27,882
[SPEAKER_03]: The bug counts.

296
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:30,024
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not getting anything back at all.

297
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:33,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I haven't played the new one yet, so we'll see.

298
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the stickler on beta testing, so we'll see.

299
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:45,577
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as we're done with that, we're moving on to Cedric the Littlest Demon, where you fight the devil, then you fight Nietzsche in Limbo, and then you have to fight God in Heaven, and then you win the game when you can kill God.

300
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:49,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're hoping that killing the God game will be cool.

301
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,362
[SPEAKER_22]: That's only on this Black Matrix-y, though.

302
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:53,083
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you ever heard of Black Matrix?

303
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:54,104
[SPEAKER_03]: No, uh-uh.

304
00:13:54,444 --> 00:14:00,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Black Matrix is an RPG where, in their universe, God and Satan fought, and Satan won.

305
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:01,470
[SPEAKER_22]: Ooh, cool.

306
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,871
[SPEAKER_22]: So you play as the slave of a dominatrix.

307
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:05,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm down with that, yo.

308
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:08,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be something you have to pay for?

309
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be completely free?

310
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:10,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what's the deal?

311
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:12,279
[SPEAKER_03]: QDRPG is going to be totally free.

312
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on how many people we get playing it, we may or may not do Cedric free as well.

313
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:23,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But QDRPG 2, which is going to be completely different, has absolutely nothing to do with QDRPG 1 whatsoever.

314
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:26,608
[SPEAKER_04]: As most old Nintendo sequels did.

315
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:28,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Castlevania 2.

316
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing like the first at all.

317
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they're going to be completely different.

318
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,651
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a completely different idea.

319
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,972
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely in charge for that.

320
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:34,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually the game after that is going to be 3D.

321
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:36,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But we still get free copies, right?

322
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Always going to get free copies from all my friends.

323
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:38,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.

324
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But you guys listening have to pay.

325
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:41,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for interviewing.

326
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:48,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll let all our listeners know when QDRPG is released and where you can get a copy of it.

327
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:52,606
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like them RPG type games, you guys want to comment?

328
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:55,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we change the subject, I don't think Rick brought it up.

329
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:56,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to give some credit to Timmy.

330
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:59,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Timmy did an awesome job on the soundtrack on this game.

331
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:03,390
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like techno-ish type of music and stuff like that, it's great.

332
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got good music.

333
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:10,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably the best thing that I like about this game, it's just full of great jokes and cheesy shit like that.

334
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:10,914
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta play it.

335
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:15,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be like Diablo-style graphics or anything, if that's what you're expecting.

336
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:19,140
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's 8-bit goodness.

337
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:22,083
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cross between Super Nintendo and Nintendo.

338
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:23,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little more than 8-bit.

339
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:24,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, maybe like 10-bit.

340
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:26,947
Three and a half!

341
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You wanted to say something, Irene?

342
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:33,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did he say something about fighting Nietzsche on there?

343
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,012
[SPEAKER_02]: The philosopher guy?

344
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:37,093
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be in the next game.

345
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:37,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I mean.

346
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:38,893
[SPEAKER_02]: In the next game.

347
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:41,094
[SPEAKER_02]: The philosopher guy or whatever?

348
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:41,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, yeah.

349
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:42,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Knowing Rick, yeah.

350
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:44,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

351
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:50,419
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be rather wrong to fight him with the Bruce's Philosopher song in the background.

352
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:54,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Ehh, Manuel Kett was real pissed that he was very ready, stable.

353
00:15:54,566 --> 00:16:00,511
[SPEAKER_08]: The armies, yeah, run by Jesus and Santa, the holodeus and such, stuff like that.

354
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:03,573
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great, just different references throughout the entire game.

355
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:05,236
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good stuff.

356
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,196
[SPEAKER_20]: So, back to my Vegas thing.

357
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:08,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, let's get back to the Vegas trip.

358
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:11,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we wanted to make sure we got Rick's plug on the air before he had to go, so.

359
00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:12,357
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

360
00:16:12,897 --> 00:16:15,718
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, anyway, I was in Vegas and y'all weren't, so.

361
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:16,818
So.

362
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:23,199
[SPEAKER_22]: No, basically, when we first got there, it was basically all the moderators hanging out together.

363
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,239
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, we were all of us moderators anyway.

364
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,540
[SPEAKER_22]: We went to the food court to hang out.

365
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:33,401
[SPEAKER_22]: I, like, played $10 worth of nickels and then won, like, five of it back on video poker, which I apparently own at.

366
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:55,749
[SPEAKER_22]: and then um yeah like my total winnings for the whole weekend was like two dollars and ninety five cents which is part of my cab fare um notable how much a foot long those those hot dogs i did not buy an elephant penis they were selling these hot dogs that were like two feet long and really fat so they were being referred to as elephant peni as the cock of the elephant anyway

367
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:04,084
[SPEAKER_22]: So as it went on that night, we went to the Rio for the gigantic, humongous seafood buffet.

368
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:10,588
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like 30 bucks, but you could get sashimi, Maine lobster, calamari, all kinds of cool, awesome seafood.

369
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:23,752
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and then, you know, that night at the Rio, there was this awesome Perfect Attack showdown between, um, uh, Potguy and, um, uh, Enoan, or Nor, as he's also known.

370
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:33,596
[SPEAKER_22]: There's also, uh, uh, Blue was also showing off some pretty, pretty awesome, um, uh, double skills, you know, going up into the sixes and sevens on some of those.

371
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:34,076
[SPEAKER_22]: Right on.

372
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:34,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Um.

373
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:38,139
[SPEAKER_22]: I, of course, raped the crane machine there and ended up giving up a lot of my stuff.

374
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Walking back, we were going back inside of the hotel and all of a sudden I hear, DDR Freak!

375
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:48,708
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's when our Stalker fanboys, DJ Bubbles and his friend, found us.

376
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,192
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess apparently they came from out of town to find us.

377
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:56,934
[SPEAKER_22]: and buy coffee for us or something.

378
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:57,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

379
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:02,895
[SPEAKER_22]: But the next day, well, I didn't fall asleep until after 7 a.m.

380
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,535
[SPEAKER_22]: for some reason because I was really tired.

381
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much excitement.

382
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,736
[SPEAKER_22]: We went to the Game Land Arcade, which was freaking amazing.

383
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:13,637
[SPEAKER_22]: That arcade, I played Mambo a Go-Go there.

384
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:15,277
[SPEAKER_22]: Mambo!

385
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:16,277
[SPEAKER_22]: No, forget this.

386
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,598
[SPEAKER_22]: For two tokens a play.

387
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:29,809
[SPEAKER_22]: DDR Max 2 for 2 tokens of play, Beat Mania 3 6-core for 2 tokens of play, Radiant Silver Gun.

388
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We apologize to your speakers.

389
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:36,161
[SPEAKER_22]: That was literally my reaction.

390
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:40,662
[SPEAKER_22]: I got to play the photo game in Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, which was really amazing.

391
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:57,826
[SPEAKER_22]: The arcade owned, and of course we were showing up the, well, I didn't, but the locals were sort of sitting there, you know, mouth open, watching as some of the more notable freestylers, namely Mel B, DJ 8-Ball.

392
00:18:58,446 --> 00:18:59,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the story making you excited over there?

393
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Past memories of Boomtown in Reno.

394
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:05,227
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

395
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:09,155
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, they were showing their stuff, and...

396
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:20,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And then everybody went back because some people wanted to go see O. No, I heard about, well, I heard about that I guess there was some kind of pump it up challenge going on.

397
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:22,001
[SPEAKER_22]: That was Friday night.

398
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:25,103
[SPEAKER_22]: Apparently one of the locals got really pissed off.

399
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:28,485
[SPEAKER_22]: He's like, you're stealing my spotlight, those are my arrows.

400
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:31,607
[SPEAKER_22]: And he was basically getting owned.

401
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,448
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I found a Prop Cycle, so I was happy.

402
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:37,090
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Prop Cycle is the best game ever by Namco.

403
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:40,472
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, back to Saturday night.

404
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:50,060
[SPEAKER_22]: Iguana Girl, Islander, and I all went to the Star Trek experience and met up with my friend Tiara and her man Rick.

405
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Which you have to do if you ever go to Vegas.

406
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:55,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're a fan of the show or not, it's just the coolest thing in Vegas, I think.

407
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:57,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

408
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:58,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, we went sober once.

409
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:02,408
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we had a warp core breach.

410
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:14,873
[SPEAKER_22]: We basically, between the three of us, between me, Iguana Girl, and Islander, we had a large, they shared a large one and a small one, and then I had a small one all to myself.

411
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:18,895
[SPEAKER_22]: And, ooh, okay, I just got given a tape.

412
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:19,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Tal just showed up.

413
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:20,936
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to say hello to everybody?

414
00:20:20,956 --> 00:20:21,616
[SPEAKER_22]: Your CD's in the car.

415
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And what up, my niggers?

416
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:31,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway... You can address those cards and letters to Tal, courtesy of Tal's house.

417
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:34,093
[SPEAKER_22]: I was telling a story!

418
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, yes, finish your story.

419
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:36,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway...

420
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:51,357
[SPEAKER_22]: So after my friends left, we had this drunken walk over to Circus Circus so Iguana Girl could play the old machine up in the Midway, which was ass on the right player side because half the buttons didn't work.

421
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,280
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the same machine that I played DDR on for the very first time with Circus Circus.

422
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Lost your DDR virginity.

423
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, lost my DDR virginity.

424
00:20:57,243 --> 00:20:58,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a USA machine now.

425
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:00,906
[SPEAKER_22]: The 1.5 is downstairs and actually has a good pad.

426
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:01,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Last time I played.

427
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,588
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway...

428
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:14,876
[SPEAKER_22]: There was more, no we don't have 4th Plus yet, there was more staying up until all hours of the morning and playing Taboo, Drunken Taboo, which was like the absolute winner.

429
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:26,883
[SPEAKER_22]: And that actually had the quote of the evening, which was, it's like a penguin, but it's in this place where the British used to send their criminals and that was trying to get them to say kangaroo.

430
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:37,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, this is... Because, you know, Taboo, you have a list of five words that, you know, you cannot use to describe your main word that's on the thing, and you have a timer.

431
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:39,654
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, I used penguin twice.

432
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:46,557
[SPEAKER_22]: I was using penguin for tuxedo, and I used penguin... It's like, it's colored like a penguin, but it's equine for a zebra.

433
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:47,377
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

434
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:48,658
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, mine made sense.

435
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,178
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know where you get, you know, kangaroo from.

436
00:21:50,198 --> 00:21:50,558
[SPEAKER_22]: Kangaroo?

437
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,339
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm lost.

438
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,860
[SPEAKER_22]: And the other best one, it's like...

439
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,601
[SPEAKER_22]: I was trying to get someone to say the word blow.

440
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:57,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I read that one online.

441
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:03,063
[SPEAKER_22]: And the quote was, it's like, if I wanted you to suck my cock, you would be giving me a blank job.

442
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:06,944
[SPEAKER_22]: So... Did they get it?

443
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:08,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, actually, they got it.

444
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:12,085
[SPEAKER_22]: And our team actually did get the kangaroo.

445
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:18,707
[SPEAKER_22]: So that was... We just started listing off Australian animals like koala, kangaroo.

446
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:20,808
[SPEAKER_22]: So... Anyway, um...

447
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:34,542
[SPEAKER_22]: The next day was, you know, we all checked out and a bunch of people went to this other buffet and I went to All You Can Eat Sushi with my friend and hung out at Circus Circus and got to play Tsurugi, which is the best game ever.

448
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:37,523
[SPEAKER_22]: It's basically, it's like mo-cap boxing and...

449
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:44,834
[SPEAKER_22]: Police 911, only you have a sword with a light sensor and you get to, you know, cut people in half and cut off their head.

450
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:45,274
[SPEAKER_22]: Cool.

451
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:45,594
[SPEAKER_22]: The U.S.

452
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:46,654
[SPEAKER_22]: name is Blade of Honor.

453
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:51,716
[SPEAKER_22]: Apparently DJ Abba found a Tegno motion machine at Excalibur in the basement.

454
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:52,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

455
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:54,336
[SPEAKER_22]: But I didn't get to play it, unfortunately.

456
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:55,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

457
00:22:57,288 --> 00:23:02,071
[SPEAKER_22]: And I played Pump It Up Perfect, but it was a crappy, broken one.

458
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:07,255
[SPEAKER_22]: And they had a great firefighters machine, Ferrari F9355, the full three monitor one.

459
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:09,456
[SPEAKER_22]: New York had an awesome arcade for the casinos.

460
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,621
[SPEAKER_04]: But the best arcade you went to would be that game.

461
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:18,742
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, Game Land.

462
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:21,344
[SPEAKER_22]: GameWorks is ass, except they have Sonic Fighters there.

463
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:26,388
[SPEAKER_22]: And Tekken 4 on a projection TV with a couch with controllers attached to it.

464
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:27,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

465
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,411
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good for people to know, because Vegas is a big tourist spot.

466
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:31,932
[SPEAKER_22]: Do not play Guitar Freaks there.

467
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:32,532
[SPEAKER_22]: It sucks.

468
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:35,474
[SPEAKER_22]: And the DVR is a USA machine, and they overprice everything.

469
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,376
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like $1.50 for a play on a USA machine.

470
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's like the Metreon.

471
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:40,138
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but it's like ass.

472
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:43,200
[SPEAKER_22]: At least it's, you know, the decor is better, and they play Good Trance in the background.

473
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:44,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

474
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:47,004
[SPEAKER_22]: How many places did you guys go?

475
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:48,866
[SPEAKER_22]: All over the damn city.

476
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get to see any showgirls?

477
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:55,435
[SPEAKER_22]: This one drag queen showgirl gave me a flyer.

478
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:59,921
[SPEAKER_22]: And people were collecting pictures of the boobs.

479
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:01,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get any free prom?

480
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:07,075
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't want any free prawn because there was like... The free prawn in Vegas is stupid.

481
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:13,498
[SPEAKER_22]: It was like they were all ugly and they were fake boobs and one of them was a man.

482
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:15,099
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you could see the Adam's apple.

483
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,740
[SPEAKER_22]: Ew!

484
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:24,924
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, so this is actually starting to lead into my fuck you of the week.

485
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:28,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we don't have the music backdrops tonight, so we'll just have to hum it.

486
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:30,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can edit it in.

487
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:32,104
[SPEAKER_22]: This is fucked up!

488
00:24:32,984 --> 00:24:34,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, anyway, we can edit that in.

489
00:24:35,164 --> 00:24:48,188
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, so, my fuck you of the week starts off with us getting out, with Iguana Girl Jessica and I getting on the plane, and this like really rude asshole was on his cell phone, and...

490
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:50,677
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

491
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:16,557
[SPEAKER_22]: We, um, we, uh, I turned around and said, you know, excuse me, you need to watch what you're doing.

492
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:17,298
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I fussed at him.

493
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:20,380
[SPEAKER_22]: He's like, oh, um, I'm having five conversations at once.

494
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,661
[SPEAKER_22]: And then he just started walking off.

495
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:27,925
[SPEAKER_22]: So, um, we were over there laughing at him when they told him to turn off his cell phone before takeoff because apparently he didn't hear that either.

496
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:33,127
[SPEAKER_22]: And then there was this guy behind me whose kid kept kicking me in the back of the chair and I kept looking at the kid.

497
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:39,348
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was just talking to Jessica, you know, my business was like, yeah, my fight was okay except I kept getting kicked in the butt.

498
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:40,448
[SPEAKER_22]: And he's like, stop whining.

499
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:45,910
[SPEAKER_22]: And apparently he kept bitching when I drafted him out listening to my, you know, Luna C compilation.

500
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,890
[SPEAKER_22]: He was, you know, he was a fucktard.

501
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,150
[SPEAKER_22]: So fuck him and fuck the guy on the cell phone.

502
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:56,572
[SPEAKER_22]: And my other fuck you of the week goes to the unemployment development department.

503
00:25:56,832 --> 00:25:57,192
[SPEAKER_22]: Ha ha ha.

504
00:25:57,632 --> 00:26:03,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Which, okay, I didn't get any sleep last night, so forgive me for slurring a little bit and being tired and bitchy.

505
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:04,395
[SPEAKER_04]: She just sounds a little drunk.

506
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:05,155
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a little hungover.

507
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:09,076
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm PMS-y, so don't give me any bullshit.

508
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:13,258
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, I tried to get out of it.

509
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:14,018
[SPEAKER_22]: I couldn't get out of it.

510
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:15,519
[SPEAKER_22]: So I hop on the bus at 10 a.m.

511
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:26,035
[SPEAKER_22]: Go all over freaking Sacramento to try to get to... Basically, it's where Stockton Boulevard and Broadway meet, but it's like another block past that.

512
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:27,356
[SPEAKER_22]: It's at 50th and Broadway.

513
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:30,579
[SPEAKER_22]: I got down there, kept napping on the bus.

514
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:33,021
[SPEAKER_22]: I got there at a quarter after 1.

515
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:34,862
[SPEAKER_22]: This is from getting on the bus at 10.

516
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:36,083
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

517
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:38,124
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was there for 30 minutes.

518
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:44,009
[SPEAKER_22]: The guy was so condescending and was talking down, and I probably had more brain in my butt than he did in all of his head.

519
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:44,969
[SPEAKER_22]: So...

520
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:59,613
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, basically I got out of there as fast as possible and got home at like a quarter after five o'clock and decided and just wolfed down all these espresso beans so I'm a combination of tired and hyper.

521
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,573
[SPEAKER_22]: So, fuck EDD.

522
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck them right in their stupid ass.

523
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:04,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck the guy on the cell phone.

524
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:07,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck anybody who acts like that on their cell phone.

525
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:11,475
[SPEAKER_22]: And fuck the stupid guy from Burbank who sat behind me.

526
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:12,816
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck him.

527
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:13,796
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck them all.

528
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:15,258
[SPEAKER_22]: May they die.

529
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:42,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck Absolute.

530
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:48,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And Matt, also known as Loki, who just showed up, has a fuck you of the week as well.

531
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes to my fucking laptop because it won't read my card writer.

532
00:27:54,163 --> 00:27:57,665
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole reason I bought the damn laptop is to use my card writer on it.

533
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:00,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it doesn't work, then what the hell did I get a crappy laptop for?

534
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:01,147
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll buy it from you.

535
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:02,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

536
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:05,117
[SPEAKER_11]: That changes everything.

537
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:06,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

538
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:07,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Scratch that from the list.

539
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:10,039
[SPEAKER_04]: My fuck you of the week, I don't have one.

540
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:11,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't think of anything.

541
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,121
[SPEAKER_04]: If I think of one later in the show, I'll mention it.

542
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:15,162
[SPEAKER_04]: My fuck you of the week is you don't have a fuck you of the week?

543
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:15,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

544
00:28:18,843 --> 00:28:20,684
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob isn't being nice to this week.

545
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:22,825
[SPEAKER_20]: The Penguin has a fuck of the week.

546
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:26,187
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've played Max Unlimited so many fucking times.

547
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,773
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm guessing over 30, I'm so pissed off, and so is my legs.

548
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:35,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And he fails on the same note every fucking time.

549
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:38,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Fails the same note every fucking time.

550
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,922
[SPEAKER_08]: It's... Sorry.

551
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:42,803
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of anger here.

552
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:43,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll kill you.

553
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:43,804
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

554
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:44,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll kill you.

555
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:45,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, he killed me.

556
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,189
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we sympathize.

557
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:50,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've been there so many times.

558
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the first time I tried to beat Max 300.

559
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:52,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

560
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,143
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

561
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:13,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And one more, fuck Brazil Golf Land for not having 4th Plus yet.

562
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we're here right now, just pretty much loitering is what we're doing.

563
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:18,222
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just sitting upstairs.

564
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:20,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the party area right now.

565
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:23,927
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of partying going up on Yahoo.

566
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:28,491
[SPEAKER_04]: This employee came by and looked at us funny earlier, like, uh, are they supposed to be here?

567
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:30,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Apparently so, because we have the microphones.

568
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:32,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that any different than usual?

569
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:33,416
[SPEAKER_05]: They always look at us funny.

570
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:34,497
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

571
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:35,298
[SPEAKER_22]: That's when we're playing.

572
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:38,072
[SPEAKER_22]: That's when Rob's playing Deluxe.

573
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go interview employees.

574
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:40,833
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like fun.

575
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:42,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we could do that in a later segment.

576
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:42,894
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

577
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:48,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I think actually what I want to do maybe next segment is maybe just be mobile.

578
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:53,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we have a mobile unit here, maybe we'll walk around and tour Golfland and give our opinions on the games.

579
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:55,858
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about every single thing that is broken.

580
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Like everything?

581
00:29:58,038 --> 00:29:58,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like everything.

582
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:01,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be a nice long segment.

583
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we've got two hours to fill.

584
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Wee!

585
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:13,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we just kind of got off the whole Vegas thing, I was recently in Vegas, and I happened to come across a Dance Dance Revolution tournament.

586
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:19,402
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a Perfect Attack and a Freestyle tournament, and they had 40 slots for each.

587
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:23,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the 11th slot for Freestyle, so I was good there.

588
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:24,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely got to play.

589
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:29,630
[SPEAKER_08]: But I got 41 on the Perfect Attack, and that pissed me off.

590
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:33,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And somebody dropped out, so I got 40.

591
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:35,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm like, yes, but I played last.

592
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:39,736
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I was waiting for like, what, four hours to play, something like that?

593
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:43,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I get through and I play my freestyle, and I did great.

594
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:43,979
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved it.

595
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:44,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I had fun.

596
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:46,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I did all three of the songs perfectly.

597
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:54,886
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the guy that goes after me does a fucking backflip over the freaking rail and goes through and hits his... I don't know how he did it.

598
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:57,848
[SPEAKER_08]: But I got second there, so I got a CD player.

599
00:30:58,328 --> 00:31:02,370
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in Perfect Attack I played last, and I triple-hit a couple of songs.

600
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:04,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was, um...

601
00:31:04,992 --> 00:31:05,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, you know.

602
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:07,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got first place, 500 bucks.

603
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:10,918
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's, um, you know, that's my story.

604
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:11,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Sweet!

605
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:12,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulations.

606
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:15,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know we had a local that owned the Vegas tournament.

607
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:16,024
[SPEAKER_04]: That's news.

608
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:20,108
[SPEAKER_22]: I've noticed that there's a different breed of freestyle in Vegas, you know.

609
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Exosauce?

610
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:23,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey there.

611
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,222
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you know.

612
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:26,103
[SPEAKER_08]: The views and opinions of our guests.

613
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:30,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the Vegas freestylers suck.

614
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:34,768
[SPEAKER_22]: I've noticed lots of A-Team action going on, so when I broke out, my new freestyle loved me.

615
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:35,408
[SPEAKER_22]: I had a crowd.

616
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:37,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I found a place for my freestyle.

617
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Vegas, here I come.

618
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Dynamite Rage.

619
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:48,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'm making this announcement now when we have our tournament at, hopefully, you know, we're trying to get it at Folsom Game Room.

620
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:48,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

621
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:53,366
[SPEAKER_22]: because we may have a particular machine by then.

622
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:56,308
[SPEAKER_04]: There may be a new machine coming in that we want to have another tournament on.

623
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:57,889
[SPEAKER_22]: Can't say anything about it.

624
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:59,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't say until it comes in.

625
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,572
[SPEAKER_22]: But we're either going to have it here or there, here at Roseville Golf Land or there, if ever I hear back from management.

626
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:08,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, I'm going to try to contact them again.

627
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:14,338
[SPEAKER_22]: But back to what I was saying, one of the freestyle segments is going to be a team style freestyle.

628
00:32:14,358 --> 00:32:14,598
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God.

629
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:22,225
[SPEAKER_22]: So you will be encouraged to pull out your best knee drops, hand plants, back flips, but no matrix walk.

630
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:23,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, no matrix walks.

631
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much going to be the replacement for improv freestyle.

632
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:30,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, because improv was where it was a novel idea, the novelty.

633
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:34,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a novel idea, just a lot of shitty entrants.

634
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And sorry to those of you that entered Improv Freestyle.

635
00:32:37,312 --> 00:32:40,173
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some good ones, but a lot of you got up there and PA'd.

636
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:43,275
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't necessarily that the skill was bad, it's that they got some ass steps.

637
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:49,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was ass steps or me, but mine really sucked.

638
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:58,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, part of the problem was that, you know, our bad, we picked, I should just say my bad, blame me, I was in freestyle.

639
00:32:58,272 --> 00:33:01,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, oh, four to six feet songs, people can improv those, those aren't too bad.

640
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:06,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, I probably should have done like two and three foot songs and one foot songs.

641
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:11,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, if I ever do another improv freestyle tournament, it's all going to be beginner songs on USA as far as I'm concerned.

642
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:13,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only improv on Heavy.

643
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:15,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I love improv.

644
00:33:15,564 --> 00:33:17,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how I make all my freestyles.

645
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:18,766
[SPEAKER_08]: It's improv over and over and over again.

646
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:20,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you playing last October?

647
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you playing in October?

648
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:25,430
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I haven't gotten to play in any of the Sacbimani tournaments.

649
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's going to be another one coming up by the end of the year.

650
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:31,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if it's at Folsom Game Room, I have no way to get there.

651
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:32,875
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll find you a way.

652
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:34,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody here at the table will get you.

653
00:33:34,877 --> 00:33:35,937
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on the board, right?

654
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:36,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

655
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:38,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll get you there somehow.

656
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I posted on the whole series.

657
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:41,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

658
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:43,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

659
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:43,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

660
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:43,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

661
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:44,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Well.

662
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:49,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but I do want to say one improv freestyle that I liked a lot at the tournament was Bradley.

663
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:50,529
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

664
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:52,170
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who didn't see, he did Little Bitch.

665
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just kind of got into it.

666
00:33:54,773 --> 00:33:56,194
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end, he was just like, rawr.

667
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:57,635
[SPEAKER_22]: It was great.

668
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:58,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.

669
00:33:58,216 --> 00:33:59,597
[SPEAKER_22]: And he didn't say hi, so I said hi.

670
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:00,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

671
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:01,298
[SPEAKER_22]: Whee!

672
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,420
[SPEAKER_04]: The Little Bitch himself, Bradley.

673
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:03,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

674
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Whee!

675
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,870
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your move?

676
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,411
[SPEAKER_04]: You just moved recently to get a little closer to Golfland.

677
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:10,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it went good.

678
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still unpacking stuff, moving things around.

679
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:19,936
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to move out of the town of sorority life and get into a little closer to Rosa Golfland.

680
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:22,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, because he was in Davis where they film sorority life.

681
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:25,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.

682
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:25,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

683
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:29,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk to Anita, because we haven't talked to her much during this show yet.

684
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Spotlight's on you!

685
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Spotlight's on you, girl.

686
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:32,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here.

687
00:34:33,483 --> 00:34:34,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about where you're from.

688
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:36,784
[SPEAKER_04]: You're from a little hick town up north.

689
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:40,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm from Yuba City.

690
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:42,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

691
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:51,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you want to give a little plug, because I know Yuba City has a little team of regulars up there that play, and I love the name of this team, by the way.

692
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:52,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us about the team up there.

693
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:56,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, our team is called the Token Stealing Toddler Stompers.

694
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome name.

695
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Best name ever.

696
00:35:00,571 --> 00:35:00,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

697
00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:06,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate Golf Land for the sole reason that you have to babysit your freaking tokens.

698
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:07,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

699
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:09,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we got sick and tired of doing that.

700
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:13,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually inspired this new setup of plastic tokens.

701
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't use those anymore because there's not enough people.

702
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:19,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know when you got like a thousand tokens up on the machine.

703
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,647
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody has their own color-coded token...

704
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can tell who's, you know, in line.

705
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,810
[SPEAKER_22]: They were using licenses at GameWorks so that people wouldn't run off with their cards.

706
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:28,851
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh!

707
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:31,292
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, ID cards student IDs licenses.

708
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:32,013
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

709
00:35:32,994 --> 00:35:35,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And explain why, what do you mean by cards?

710
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some people may not have been to GameWorks ever.

711
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:45,061
[SPEAKER_22]: They use token, instead of tokens, they use those little credit cards like the Metreon uses.

712
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:49,189
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you were saying about your team.

713
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

714
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:56,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Token Stealing Tyler Stompers was inspired by a little incident that happened at one of our arcades.

715
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:07,705
[SPEAKER_02]: A little kid got into a little trouble, and we sort of, well, one of our girls, her name is May, and she ended up pushing the little kid a little bit.

716
00:36:08,185 --> 00:36:08,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.

717
00:36:08,946 --> 00:36:09,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a tiny bit.

718
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:10,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

719
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:34,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So how is the scene in a little, because for those who don't know, Yuba City is kind of one of those towns that's like, it's just kind of there on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere.

720
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:40,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, now it's getting bigger because it has the Sacramento Amphitheater in the town, so it's getting a little bit more notoriety that way.

721
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:47,928
[SPEAKER_04]: But how is it playing DDR like in the middle of nowhere, where you've got to really drive a long way to get something outside of DDR?

722
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:52,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I work in Sacramento, so driving's not too bad for me.

723
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:57,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have a Max 2 now, so that is a lot of fun.

724
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:58,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody has a freaking Max 2 now.

725
00:36:58,995 --> 00:36:59,756
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up with that?

726
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:00,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Illegal kids.

727
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:03,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, happy kids.

728
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:04,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my boots.

729
00:37:04,518 --> 00:37:05,378
[SPEAKER_04]: My legs hurt.

730
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:06,559
[SPEAKER_04]: My boots and my leg.

731
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:07,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Boot leg.

732
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,081
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah, same.

733
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:16,143
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the... Hey, we like to think that we're legal kids.

734
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:17,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

735
00:37:17,343 --> 00:37:18,204
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the great pretender.

736
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:22,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really not that bad in Yuba City altogether.

737
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:28,600
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks, I mean, as DDR communities go, we've got a lot of really great people there.

738
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have two places to go.

739
00:37:32,302 --> 00:37:37,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we only have one, but the people who work there are really good to us.

740
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:37,723
[SPEAKER_02]: They listen to us.

741
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:42,345
[SPEAKER_02]: If we want the machine turned up, they're happy to do it, and we've never had problems there.

742
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:43,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

743
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really great, yeah.

744
00:37:45,206 --> 00:37:46,567
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a dream come true.

745
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:47,647
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact...

746
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what was that again?

747
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:55,145
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unlike here at Golfland, where when we ask them to turn it up, they turn it down to half volume.

748
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:56,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

749
00:37:56,966 --> 00:38:01,491
[SPEAKER_22]: That's because they're backward ass here, but we're not complaining, are we?

750
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:03,833
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we're getting 4th Plus.

751
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:04,814
[SPEAKER_22]: I am complaining.

752
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very much complaining.

753
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:09,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to complain when they get 4th Plus, though, to replace USA?

754
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:11,140
[SPEAKER_04]: USA will be gone, replaced with 4th Plus.

755
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that wonderful?

756
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:13,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, somewhat, yes.

757
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:14,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

758
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:16,845
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play Konga, feel into your heart's content.

759
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:19,087
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I know, everything on USA is going to be on there.

760
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:20,208
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my outlook on this.

761
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:22,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Because USA is where the newbies go to play, right?

762
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So they take USA, we got Max 2.

763
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:28,495
[SPEAKER_08]: But we got 4th Plus, we're going to want to play Max 2 and 4th Plus.

764
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are the newbies going to go?

765
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:32,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're going to fail 4th Plus immediately and you get to play up next.

766
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,040
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to go to hell, that's where they're going to go.

767
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,122
[SPEAKER_22]: No, they're going to go play Spider Stomp.

768
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,844
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll just send them to play Spider Stomp.

769
00:38:39,504 --> 00:38:41,765
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but see, here's the other thing.

770
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:51,709
[SPEAKER_08]: The people at Sunsplash are also very stupid in making it so you can't fail on your first song if it's on, you know, little, or not little, rather, you know, standard, the first note.

771
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, standard, basic.

772
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:59,311
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stupid, and so that's still one song where you have to wait and stuff, and watching them hurts, I swear.

773
00:38:59,892 --> 00:39:02,573
[SPEAKER_08]: It hurts to see them suck so bad, because...

774
00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:05,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, some of them have the basic idea.

775
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,278
[SPEAKER_08]: But we all started off somewhere.

776
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:13,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but we all... I'm going to say, I'm hoping that we all started off higher than some of the people that play here.

777
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:16,069
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just jumping around on the freaking pad.

778
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I know none of us would be where we are today if we started there, because we would have given up long ago.

779
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:23,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no mercy with Ted, I guess.

780
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,258
[SPEAKER_22]: I started off at home.

781
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's something the announcer should start saying?

782
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh, my eyes are bleeding.

783
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:32,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Your dance is like burning.

784
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Your dance makes Captain Jack cry.

785
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:39,348
[SPEAKER_22]: We have more intros to do, more people to show up.

786
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:41,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Give us your name and your nickname and a little bit of your history.

787
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:45,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Any history you want to give.

788
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be DDR.

789
00:39:46,278 --> 00:39:49,461
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give the black book history or your job history.

790
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:51,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Surgical, medical history, whatever.

791
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:53,394
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Eric.

792
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:54,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Punk Knight.

793
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:56,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a history.

794
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I just kind of appeared here, you know.

795
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, I'll do his history.

796
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:04,300
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the leader of a... A cult?

797
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,501
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not a cult.

798
00:40:06,241 --> 00:40:12,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, not really a terrorist group, but let's just say they get jobs done.

799
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:16,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Called the Triple F ETA, Former Fast Food Employees Turned Assassins.

800
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:18,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

801
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:29,476
[SPEAKER_05]: See, other than that, he does his own music, he's totally into punk rock and that kind of stuff, and metal, and that kind of cool shit.

802
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you know me better than I do.

803
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:32,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here, somebody else.

804
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:35,641
[SPEAKER_22]: I need to make an announcement, Rob gave me a quarter, so I'm getting candy.

805
00:40:37,283 --> 00:40:39,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Speak, speak, I demand you.

806
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,847
[SPEAKER_02]: If I give you two quarters, will you get me some candy too?

807
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:44,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a shy one?

808
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:48,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll speak for them.

809
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:51,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, I'm Melanie.

810
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,740
[SPEAKER_19]: I used to go on the boards by Carefree Mel.

811
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,161
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm very quiet, so I'm not going to say much.

812
00:40:57,602 --> 00:40:57,962
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

813
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:00,643
[SPEAKER_04]: That voice sounds so familiar.

814
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:03,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, Mel, you sound really hot.

815
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:04,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

816
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:05,886
[SPEAKER_04]: This is radio, you know.

817
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:07,227
I know.

818
00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:09,048
Isn't it cool?

819
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:12,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Mel, you're dating Punk Night, right?

820
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,751
[SPEAKER_04]: He's so dreamy.

821
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:21,598
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it that you like about Bunk Nye?

822
00:41:21,618 --> 00:41:22,879
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it that attracts you to him?

823
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,861
[SPEAKER_19]: It's his one eye!

824
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:35,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And your response to that?

825
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:38,169
[SPEAKER_05]: It hurts.

826
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:43,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, he's also into Invader Zim, because Invader Zim rocks.

827
00:41:43,473 --> 00:41:44,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's it.

828
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

829
00:41:47,011 --> 00:41:47,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonan.

830
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:48,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonan altogether.

831
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:49,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just Invader Zim.

832
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonan Vasquez is a god.

833
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:54,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Jonan Vasquez is the godliest god of all gods.

834
00:41:56,258 --> 00:42:08,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, we're going to take a quick break here and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio episode 10 and a half semi-live from Roseville Golf Land here on Wednesday night.

835
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,028
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taping a little early so we can have the weekend off.

836
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:11,309
[SPEAKER_22]: Add candy.

[SPEAKER_04]: So this is 3-2-1 stars, the Jamie mix.

853
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:28,832
[SPEAKER_04]: She had a 9 combo.

854
00:49:31,974 --> 00:49:32,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 11.

855
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:33,335
[SPEAKER_04]: She got double digits.

856
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:40,741
[SPEAKER_04]: She just lost about 70% of her bar in like 3 seconds.

857
00:49:59,031 --> 00:49:59,592
[SPEAKER_04]: There she goes.

858
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:00,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not too bad.

859
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,022
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not doing as bad as she said you were going to do, Jamie.

860
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:15,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh, she got danger.

861
00:50:15,386 --> 00:50:15,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

862
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:16,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Jamie.

863
00:50:16,507 --> 00:50:16,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Go, Jamie, go.

864
00:50:21,471 --> 00:50:23,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, failed.

865
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:25,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks.

866
00:50:25,603 --> 00:50:30,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we are back, and we're on the lower level now, where all the games are.

867
00:50:30,813 --> 00:50:32,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you start the clock for me, by the way?

868
00:50:33,257 --> 00:50:33,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, that's alright.

869
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:36,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, that's not bad for suck.

870
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:38,966
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're walking around the bottom level.

871
00:50:38,986 --> 00:50:43,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to walk around and look at the various stuff that Golfland has here?

872
00:50:43,027 --> 00:50:44,868
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do that once I'm done putting my initials in.

873
00:50:44,948 --> 00:50:46,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's going to put her initials back in.

874
00:50:46,328 --> 00:50:48,608
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

875
00:50:48,648 --> 00:50:53,069
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a special edition because we decided to take Labor Day weekend off.

876
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:55,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought we'd tape the show a little early.

877
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's actually Wednesday night.

878
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,730
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at Golfland.

879
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are taping live.

880
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:00,071
[SPEAKER_04]: No do-overs.

881
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:02,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like it was a live show.

882
00:51:02,371 --> 00:51:03,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Except we have lots of toys here.

883
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:06,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brad likes toys, right?

884
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:08,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Mmm, toys.

885
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:10,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do we want to do?

886
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,009
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to walk around and give a little tour of Delphi?

887
00:51:12,029 --> 00:51:13,269
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to do anybody publicly.

888
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,730
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm holding a bench of stuff.

889
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:17,751
[SPEAKER_22]: Who wants to hold my wood?

890
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:20,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for volunteering for that, Ted.

891
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:21,572
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got a funny... Hi.

892
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:24,893
[SPEAKER_22]: What are you guys exactly recording for?

893
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:25,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're doing a school project.

894
00:51:25,974 --> 00:51:27,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

895
00:51:28,435 --> 00:51:28,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

896
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:29,635
[SPEAKER_04]: For Oakmont High.

897
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:35,130
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're doing an online radio program.

898
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,310
[SPEAKER_22]: We have an internet radio show.

899
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,731
[SPEAKER_22]: Would you like to say some words for our listeners?

900
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:48,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys can go walking around recording stuff.

901
00:51:48,094 --> 00:51:49,074
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just recording ourselves.

902
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:53,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, we actually do a show online that promotes the line of the music games.

903
00:51:54,136 --> 00:51:55,496
[SPEAKER_22]: And we advertise this place for free.

904
00:51:55,656 --> 00:52:00,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so... And then the shit hits the fan.

905
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:04,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we could go outside, I guess, if you'd rather not us taping here.

906
00:52:06,295 --> 00:52:06,895
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure.

907
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,756
[SPEAKER_18]: You've got to talk to the manager.

908
00:52:08,936 --> 00:52:09,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

909
00:52:10,236 --> 00:52:10,516
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

910
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:12,316
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to talk to the manager.

911
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We might possibly.

912
00:52:13,437 --> 00:52:14,237
[SPEAKER_04]: We hate Golf Land.

913
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:18,458
[SPEAKER_04]: We might possibly get kicked out of the show, have to end the show early because of this.

914
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:20,258
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to see what's going to happen here.

915
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:21,938
[SPEAKER_22]: We can fill up with music.

916
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:23,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can fill up something.

917
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:26,659
[SPEAKER_22]: I will play more Beatmania for your listening pleasure.

918
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:27,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We can figure something out.

919
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:28,480
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll listen to the Brad mix.

920
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,560
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

921
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:29,720
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

922
00:52:36,003 --> 00:52:40,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have to go to Folsom Game Room or someplace that would let us do a show there.

923
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:41,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

924
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:41,948
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

925
00:52:45,851 --> 00:52:51,816
[SPEAKER_22]: And he's going through the list and stopping on something tack.

926
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:52,797
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what would really suck?

927
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:53,778
[SPEAKER_04]: What if they took the tape?

928
00:52:55,799 --> 00:52:57,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Then that would make them buy us a new one.

929
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:02,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're eagerly awaiting what's going to happen here.

930
00:53:03,468 --> 00:53:04,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, this is somewhat funny.

931
00:53:04,908 --> 00:53:05,608
[SPEAKER_04]: We could run away.

932
00:53:05,628 --> 00:53:12,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, what were you saying?

933
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, where's the fun in that, though?

934
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, where's the fun in that?

935
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens.

936
00:53:16,711 --> 00:53:22,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if they did throw us out for trying to do our show, I doubt we'd come here very much in the future.

937
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:26,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what's going to happen when Mr. Manager comes back.

938
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,411
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if there's anything interesting new or going on in the Mamani world right now, news-wise.

939
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,215
[SPEAKER_22]: We haven't had Matt's sim update.

940
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:39,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I bet Matt has a Matt's sim update.

941
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,162
[SPEAKER_04]: We should get him over here.

942
00:53:41,306 --> 00:53:43,468
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're being stared at by an employee.

943
00:53:43,548 --> 00:53:44,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, are we?

944
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:46,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is he waving?

945
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,591
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, he waved and he walked off.

946
00:53:47,831 --> 00:53:49,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we got the go ahead.

947
00:53:49,612 --> 00:53:50,493
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go interview him.

948
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:51,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah?

949
00:53:51,614 --> 00:53:51,934
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

950
00:53:52,614 --> 00:53:54,456
[SPEAKER_04]: That manager looks like he's 16 years old.

951
00:53:54,956 --> 00:53:56,577
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that's the manager.

952
00:53:56,597 --> 00:54:02,301
[SPEAKER_02]: If the manager's some like 500 pound like sumo wrestler, I'm getting out of here.

953
00:54:02,341 --> 00:54:03,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I gotta go.

954
00:54:03,802 --> 00:54:05,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well, she's coming back.

955
00:54:05,323 --> 00:54:07,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if she's going to give us an update or what's going on.

956
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:10,210
[SPEAKER_22]: Who was the manager?

957
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're going to see what's happening.

958
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:12,553
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's step away from the machine.

959
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what's going on.

960
00:54:14,776 --> 00:54:17,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

961
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we thought that guy was the manager.

962
00:54:21,544 --> 00:54:23,026
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be the day.

963
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:25,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we get that on tape?

964
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:28,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So you enjoy working at Golf Land?

965
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:32,977
[SPEAKER_04]: She can't comment on tape or else she'd get into trouble.

966
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:34,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure she'd say nothing but good things.

967
00:54:35,258 --> 00:54:36,619
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Gothland is winner.

968
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:39,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Except maybe the little kids who destroy things around here.

969
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:39,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows about that?

970
00:54:40,161 --> 00:54:40,421
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

971
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:42,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a go for the taping or not?

972
00:54:43,102 --> 00:54:45,223
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't know because the manager's got to come downstairs.

973
00:54:45,303 --> 00:54:49,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think he's going to decline you guys from taping.

974
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:49,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

975
00:54:49,885 --> 00:54:53,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though a lot of people film home videos and stuff here?

976
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:56,848
[SPEAKER_22]: Same difference, only audio.

977
00:54:57,388 --> 00:54:57,888
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, all right.

978
00:54:57,908 --> 00:54:58,489
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not going to talk.

979
00:54:58,509 --> 00:54:59,069
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not going to talk.

980
00:54:59,089 --> 00:54:59,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

981
00:55:00,618 --> 00:55:01,398
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

982
00:55:03,419 --> 00:55:04,059
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting.

983
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,439
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't expecting this development.

984
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:08,519
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, maybe we should take another quick break then.

985
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:09,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to take a quick break?

986
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, because I kind of want to get this on air, whatever happens.

987
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

988
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,620
[SPEAKER_22]: What, are we leaving?

989
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:15,521
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're going to see what happens.

990
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:16,441
[SPEAKER_04]: The manager's coming down.

991
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:19,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something.

992
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:20,642
[SPEAKER_22]: True.

993
00:55:20,662 --> 00:55:23,082
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we can finish up the show somewhere else.

994
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:23,722
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

995
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:27,063
[SPEAKER_04]: You're back here by freaking 10.

996
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:28,563
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 o'clock.

997
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:34,596
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they're closing at 10 now, so... We have more of the Brad mix going on on Beatmania.

998
00:55:36,157 --> 00:55:37,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to go listen to Brad play on Beatmania?

999
00:55:38,177 --> 00:55:38,637
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, no.

1000
00:55:38,737 --> 00:55:39,138
[SPEAKER_04]: What is he playing?

1001
00:55:39,158 --> 00:55:39,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's hurting my ears.

1002
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:40,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know that song.

1003
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:42,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Crimson.

1004
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:47,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they allowed to tape us and use us for their commercials, but we're not allowed to tape them?

1005
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe... I don't know.

1006
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:52,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1007
00:55:53,982 --> 00:55:55,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

1008
00:55:57,193 --> 00:55:59,114
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably think we're profiting off of this.

1009
00:55:59,714 --> 00:56:01,555
[SPEAKER_22]: No, we pay to do our show.

1010
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:07,337
[SPEAKER_02]: We pay out of pocket.

1011
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:08,058
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the guy.

1012
00:56:09,038 --> 00:56:09,818
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

1013
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:11,239
[SPEAKER_04]: We think.

1014
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,290
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know what's going to happen.

1015
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,371
[SPEAKER_22]: We're recording an internet radio show.

1016
00:56:19,091 --> 00:56:19,652
[SPEAKER_22]: Just our group.

1017
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:28,495
[SPEAKER_22]: We run an internet radio show every Sunday night and we're basically taking the Sunday off so we decided to do a live show at our favorite Wednesday hangout because we come every Wednesday.

1018
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:32,236
[SPEAKER_22]: And we didn't think that there would be an issue with it.

1019
00:56:32,276 --> 00:56:33,236
[SPEAKER_22]: If there is, we're sorry.

1020
00:56:35,822 --> 00:56:37,503
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now, I'll go ahead and do it.

1021
00:56:37,983 --> 00:56:40,384
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought you had a filming crew here.

1022
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:40,965
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1023
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,486
[SPEAKER_21]: But usually we don't have a problem with it.

1024
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:45,087
[SPEAKER_21]: We just like to book in advance.

1025
00:56:45,687 --> 00:56:50,109
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we can know what the interview's about and that kind of a thing.

1026
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're just a bunch of dumb kids and we're not doing anything special.

1027
00:56:52,971 --> 00:56:53,931
[SPEAKER_13]: This is spontaneous, really.

1028
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:57,993
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, I recognize your kids, you know, in the group.

1029
00:56:58,013 --> 00:56:59,794
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's always a big plus.

1030
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:03,296
[SPEAKER_21]: So we want to promote, you know, a good hangout environment.

1031
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:04,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, cool.

1032
00:57:04,617 --> 00:57:05,718
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to give a plug to Golfland?

1033
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:06,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Any specials going on right now?

1034
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:08,960
[SPEAKER_21]: Any specials going on right now?

1035
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,942
[SPEAKER_21]: We always have specials you can call in advance to find out what they are.

1036
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Family night special or laser tag specials.

1037
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:15,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget Arcade Mania.

1038
00:57:16,425 --> 00:57:18,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Arcade Mania, yeah, Saturday mornings.

1039
00:57:19,587 --> 00:57:20,587
[SPEAKER_08]: On this Saturday, by the way?

1040
00:57:21,828 --> 00:57:22,709
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure.

1041
00:57:22,729 --> 00:57:24,490
[SPEAKER_21]: They canceled it last Saturday, didn't they?

1042
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:28,753
[SPEAKER_22]: This past Saturday, wasn't it something having to do with a private party?

1043
00:57:30,189 --> 00:57:32,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for letting us do our crappy show.

1044
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:33,190
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it.

1045
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a near crisis.

1046
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,896
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just doing your job.

1047
00:58:00,217 --> 00:58:01,998
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a promotion for you in the future, honey.

1048
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,381
[SPEAKER_04]: A near crisis averted.

1049
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:08,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we ought to get out of people's way now.

1050
00:58:08,582 --> 00:58:09,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to take this back upstairs?

1051
00:58:09,923 --> 00:58:11,424
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's get back upstairs and get out of the way.

1052
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:12,605
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get out of people's way.

1053
00:58:12,665 --> 00:58:15,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going back upstairs, so if any of the guests want to come back upstairs as well.

1054
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:17,729
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to fail GM's quiz?

1055
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:18,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1056
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:20,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that was a great radio moment.

1057
00:58:20,451 --> 00:58:20,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you my daddy?

1058
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you my daddy?

1059
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:27,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently I'm one of your kids, Rob, as the manager pointed out.

1060
00:58:27,215 --> 00:58:35,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is kind of interesting because we didn't think anything like that would happen, but I guess a true Orange Lounge spontaneous moment there.

1061
00:58:35,701 --> 00:58:41,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as I said, we were not going to stop tape tonight, no matter what happens, unless that guy came down the stairs yelling and screaming, Stop the tape!

1062
00:58:41,545 --> 00:58:42,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop the tape!

1063
00:58:42,106 --> 00:58:44,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if he kicked me in my ass, would you keep rolling?

1064
00:58:44,627 --> 00:58:47,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, scream harder, Irene, come on, get some realism.

1065
00:58:47,409 --> 00:58:48,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly, quite possibly.

1066
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:48,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1067
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:54,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like they like to know about these kind of things in advance because, well, they want to do their own little promotions with it.

1068
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:54,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1069
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:58,784
[SPEAKER_02]: We should call five minutes ahead and say, hey, we're going to come, you know, record and stuff.

1070
00:58:58,804 --> 00:58:59,284
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1071
00:59:02,357 --> 00:59:03,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going on the best of.

1072
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:04,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we picked up his audio.

1073
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of afraid that we didn't get the Golfland employees' audio.

1074
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,622
[SPEAKER_04]: That might have come out kind of crappy for the listeners.

1075
00:59:09,162 --> 00:59:09,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1076
00:59:09,622 --> 00:59:11,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an experimental show tonight, as I promised.

1077
00:59:11,944 --> 00:59:14,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be... You know what we could do?

1078
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:18,549
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just dub over voices if we didn't pick it up.

1079
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:22,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe what we could do is come back and do that segment in a later show, like in a best of.

1080
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,814
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do with voice dubbings by Irene.

1081
00:59:25,154 --> 00:59:26,875
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you should put in stuff from Rejected.

1082
00:59:27,135 --> 00:59:28,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling fat and sassy.

1083
00:59:29,577 --> 00:59:30,938
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm kind of worried about, though?

1084
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:33,140
[SPEAKER_04]: What if this guy actually tunes in and listens, though?

1085
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what do we do?

1086
00:59:34,261 --> 00:59:39,726
[SPEAKER_04]: We sit around and we say, Gothland never updates their machines, and they're all dirty, and things like that, and now, uh-oh.

1087
00:59:40,366 --> 00:59:43,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we come here and give our money anyway, so what the hell does he care?

1088
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:47,132
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a bunch of fat hypocrites because we bash Gothland, but we're here anyway.

1089
00:59:47,152 --> 00:59:48,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the thing.

1090
00:59:48,353 --> 00:59:50,996
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the right to complain even if we do pay our money, goddammit.

1091
00:59:51,736 --> 00:59:52,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're all coming back.

1092
00:59:52,897 --> 00:59:55,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jamie's doing some PR work here.

1093
00:59:55,819 --> 00:59:56,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, boy.

1094
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking to the manager.

1095
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1096
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's trying to sell the tournament right now.

1097
01:00:01,923 --> 01:00:02,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, boy.

1098
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:02,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

1099
01:00:02,784 --> 01:00:03,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.

1100
01:00:03,124 --> 01:00:03,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1101
01:00:03,785 --> 01:00:05,206
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Jamie, is Jamie going?

1102
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:06,194
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1103
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:07,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's going bye-bye.

1104
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:09,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Irene will fill in as co-host while you're gone.

1105
01:00:09,477 --> 01:00:09,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1106
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:12,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, Jamie's going to go work things out.

1107
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Some promising news, maybe.

1108
01:00:14,842 --> 01:00:16,784
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy is really awesome.

1109
01:00:16,824 --> 01:00:17,845
[SPEAKER_08]: He's done so much stuff.

1110
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:19,146
[SPEAKER_08]: He turned up the Peripera machine.

1111
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I do recognize this guy.

1112
01:00:21,528 --> 01:00:22,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say it here.

1113
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:23,330
[SPEAKER_04]: This employee here.

1114
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:24,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I just say his name over the air?

1115
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:25,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1116
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:25,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1117
01:00:25,512 --> 01:00:26,292
[SPEAKER_04]: We're saying good things about him.

1118
01:00:26,312 --> 01:00:26,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Dwayne.

1119
01:00:27,233 --> 01:00:28,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good employee here.

1120
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:32,637
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the one employee we've run into that will fix games when we ask them to be fixed.

1121
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,379
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as they are broken, he fixes them.

1122
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:37,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Pera Pera was turned down.

1123
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,062
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a game called Sumo next to it.

1124
01:00:39,462 --> 01:00:46,327
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about five times as loud as the Pera Pera machine, so my thing was to go and turn off the Sumo machine, but now Pera Pera, you can hear it from upstairs.

1125
01:00:46,427 --> 01:00:48,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It's insanely loud, and I love it.

1126
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:51,330
[SPEAKER_08]: And this guy has made all kinds of stuff happen.

1127
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,793
[SPEAKER_08]: He's letting us do this thing here, and it sucks, though.

1128
01:00:54,973 --> 01:00:56,154
[SPEAKER_08]: He's leaving pretty soon.

1129
01:00:56,394 --> 01:00:56,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no!

1130
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:57,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's he going?

1131
01:00:58,275 --> 01:00:58,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1132
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:11,444
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not going to be working here for too much longer, so what he's trying to do is get Jamie's name and number, possibly even the URL for the boards, into the right hand so that these tournaments will continue to happen on a regular basis.

1133
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:13,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

1134
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:15,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you made a spotting!

1135
01:01:15,827 --> 01:01:16,147
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1136
01:01:17,168 --> 01:01:18,850
[SPEAKER_04]: How could I not recognize the mullet?

1137
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a feeling.

1138
01:01:21,472 --> 01:01:25,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask him, but I was like, I don't know, he might think I'm weird.

1139
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:28,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that whole little crisis that was going on downstairs?

1140
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:28,998
[SPEAKER_04]: We were trying to do...

1141
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:30,950
[SPEAKER_04]: A group of people out there.

1142
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:31,531
[SPEAKER_04]: What was going on?

1143
01:01:31,832 --> 01:01:41,044
[SPEAKER_04]: We were trying to do our little online schtick program that we do here, and we almost got stopped, but thanks to the nice employee, the Bomani appreciating employee, we lucked out tonight.

1144
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:43,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Good thing we didn't have one of the bad managers here.

1145
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:44,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

1146
01:01:44,608 --> 01:01:46,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Tal's doing all the introductions here.

1147
01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:51,509
[SPEAKER_04]: We're meeting somebody new from the board for the first time, so this is exciting.

1148
01:01:51,529 --> 01:01:55,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hello.

1149
01:01:55,871 --> 01:01:57,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya is his name on the board.

1150
01:01:57,972 --> 01:01:58,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1151
01:02:00,193 --> 01:02:03,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know Loki.

1152
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:03,875
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Loki.

1153
01:02:04,215 --> 01:02:05,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And Linky style.

1154
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:07,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, they were just introducing people.

1155
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,177
[SPEAKER_04]: This is odd.

1156
01:02:08,237 --> 01:02:09,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost the co-host.

1157
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:11,098
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of weird, though.

1158
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:12,799
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this might be a good thing.

1159
01:02:12,819 --> 01:02:14,540
[SPEAKER_04]: They went to the office and locked the door.

1160
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,461
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't know if they locked the door.

1161
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:20,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie went off with Mr. Golfland Guy, and I haven't seen her yet.

1162
01:02:20,643 --> 01:02:21,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're getting a 4-plus for us.

1163
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:22,845
[SPEAKER_02]: We better not tell Dan.

1164
01:02:22,885 --> 01:02:25,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope she didn't have to put out to keep the show going.

1165
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:26,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1166
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:27,310
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to kill you.

1167
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:27,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1168
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:28,532
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to kill me.

1169
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:29,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

1170
01:02:29,953 --> 01:02:30,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

1171
01:02:30,935 --> 01:02:32,416
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Brad making the noises.

1172
01:02:33,057 --> 01:02:35,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Address those cards and letters to Lanky style.

1173
01:02:36,201 --> 01:02:38,903
[SPEAKER_04]: We almost got kicked out of Golf Land for filming here.

1174
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:40,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not filming, taping.

1175
01:02:40,084 --> 01:02:40,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it filming.

1176
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,855
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an idea, Loki.

1177
01:02:54,176 --> 01:03:00,397
[SPEAKER_02]: If we weren't going to pick up the audio from the employees here, we were going to dub it over with rejected lines.

1178
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:01,318
[SPEAKER_02]: We should anyway.

1179
01:03:02,438 --> 01:03:04,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all up to Rob.

1180
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:04,959
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

1181
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:08,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too much work to do that kind of dubbing with the time I have to put this show on by Sunday.

1182
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll voiceover it.

1183
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:12,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just voiceover it then.

1184
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:14,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I'm leaving pretty soon tomorrow.

1185
01:03:14,764 --> 01:03:16,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably going to get all this done tonight.

1186
01:03:16,065 --> 01:03:16,446
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1187
01:03:16,886 --> 01:03:17,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Bran.

1188
01:03:17,487 --> 01:03:19,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the biggest idiot ever.

1189
01:03:19,368 --> 01:03:19,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1190
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:20,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

1191
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:21,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow.

1192
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:23,091
[SPEAKER_04]: My tooth.

1193
01:03:23,992 --> 01:03:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk.

1194
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:26,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any sim news for us?

1195
01:03:26,955 --> 01:03:27,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1196
01:03:27,415 --> 01:03:31,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, have you seen Loki's most ridiculously retarded edit for Max 300?

1197
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:31,839
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1198
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,442
[SPEAKER_07]: After the freeze, the thing comes up with 50 fucking billion arrows.

1199
01:03:35,803 --> 01:03:36,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1200
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:38,605
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way to do that ever!

1201
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:40,187
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I didn't make the edit.

1202
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:41,568
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy Gatton made the edit.

1203
01:03:41,728 --> 01:03:45,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Gatton actually was one of the ones that was in the databank on 5th Mix.

1204
01:03:46,052 --> 01:03:50,437
[SPEAKER_05]: About 90% of the Naoki edits that Naoki picked are all done by him.

1205
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,721
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the same guy that made that edit, Swingman, that I love, that's so awesome.

1206
01:03:54,761 --> 01:03:57,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but dude, this Max edit is fucking off the hook.

1207
01:03:58,104 --> 01:03:58,825
[SPEAKER_07]: It's insane.

1208
01:03:58,845 --> 01:04:00,266
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy should write steps for DDR.

1209
01:04:00,306 --> 01:04:03,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if he made steps for iFeel and all that shit, it'd actually be fun.

1210
01:04:03,848 --> 01:04:04,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sim news.

1211
01:04:05,729 --> 01:04:07,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some good news, actually.

1212
01:04:07,271 --> 01:04:10,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Team Guilo and the Melting Potter are coming back up October 1st.

1213
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:11,533
[SPEAKER_05]: They're redesigning the site.

1214
01:04:12,314 --> 01:04:17,278
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened was they were switching servers or something, and when they did that, someone bought the domain name.

1215
01:04:18,138 --> 01:04:18,478
[SPEAKER_06]: For who?

1216
01:04:18,718 --> 01:04:23,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So someone bought TeamGuilo.com's name and so now they had to change it or something.

1217
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,800
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're actually still up.

1218
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,642
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to type in their IP address in order to find it.

1219
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:33,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're still up and they said they're going to be done with the site and everything October 1st.

1220
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:34,844
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as...

1221
01:04:36,264 --> 01:04:39,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Other sim news, really no new versions of anything.

1222
01:04:40,786 --> 01:04:45,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Tourney Mix, I guess it's still going because their media section is down on DDR East Coast Invasion.

1223
01:04:46,109 --> 01:04:49,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I won't be entering this time because I'm busy with everything else.

1224
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:54,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to God, I never have enough free time to actually sit down and make a decent step file.

1225
01:04:54,954 --> 01:04:56,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I don't have the patience or just don't care.

1226
01:04:57,635 --> 01:04:58,055
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those.

1227
01:04:58,356 --> 01:05:00,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And also DDR PC, still no new characters.

1228
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:05,338
[SPEAKER_04]: That was interesting because we thought they were going to be doing them every Friday.

1229
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:09,339
[SPEAKER_04]: They released What's His Name and What's Her Face on the first week.

1230
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:11,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what, Valencia and Guy were the second?

1231
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:12,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1232
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,661
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there were no third ones.

1233
01:05:15,101 --> 01:05:18,742
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing.

1234
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:26,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still kind of in shock over this interesting turn the show's taken where Jamie's gone into the office to talk about God knows what with the manager.

1235
01:05:27,031 --> 01:05:28,554
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm kind of getting worried.

1236
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:30,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we need to send a rescue mission?

1237
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:33,384
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, actually this might be good because they're talking for a long time.

1238
01:05:33,404 --> 01:05:35,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe they're talking about a tournament.

1239
01:05:35,127 --> 01:05:35,888
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be good.

1240
01:05:35,908 --> 01:05:36,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know.

1241
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:38,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, they are talking about the tournament.

1242
01:05:38,731 --> 01:05:39,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1243
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:39,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1244
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:42,992
[SPEAKER_05]: From when I was walking by him coming up here, I heard him talking about the tournament.

1245
01:05:43,432 --> 01:05:44,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard the word tournament.

1246
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:45,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1247
01:05:45,873 --> 01:05:46,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what happens.

1248
01:05:47,293 --> 01:05:50,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear the words... Stop it!

1249
01:05:50,874 --> 01:05:53,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you can hit Brad once you hear this.

1250
01:05:53,355 --> 01:05:56,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's all Brad that's doing all of these funny noises.

1251
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,157
[SPEAKER_04]: My girlfriend's ratting me out.

1252
01:05:58,177 --> 01:05:58,597
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?

1253
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:00,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey.

1254
01:06:00,698 --> 01:06:01,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Gosh.

1255
01:06:01,518 --> 01:06:02,498
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get it later.

1256
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:03,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1257
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:03,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Joe.

1258
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:05,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And if...

1259
01:06:05,871 --> 01:06:08,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, if the what's-his-name bans us, I'm going to be pissed.

1260
01:06:10,115 --> 01:06:12,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if we all get banned from Golfland for this.

1261
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:13,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they won't get any money.

1262
01:06:13,698 --> 01:06:14,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Darn.

1263
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:14,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Shucks.

1264
01:06:14,878 --> 01:06:17,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just have to take my business elsewhere.

1265
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:21,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be able to afford an apartment, move out, and actually get on with my life.

1266
01:06:21,164 --> 01:06:25,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, you know, tune up my car and that kind of stuff.

1267
01:06:25,387 --> 01:06:25,868
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be cool.

1268
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:29,352
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like the addiction recovery thing.

1269
01:06:29,372 --> 01:06:30,734
[SPEAKER_02]: They all ban us from Golf Land.

1270
01:06:31,014 --> 01:06:34,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cut you off.

1271
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:37,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there's plenty of other places to play DDR, okay?

1272
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1273
01:06:39,446 --> 01:06:39,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Ron?

1274
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:40,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

1275
01:06:40,888 --> 01:06:41,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1276
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:41,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1277
01:06:42,009 --> 01:06:42,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Is anybody there?

1278
01:06:45,424 --> 01:06:46,124
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, that's the thing.

1279
01:06:46,184 --> 01:06:48,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know if there would be a tournament here, seeing how anal they are.

1280
01:06:49,566 --> 01:06:55,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, every single encounter with Golfland employees has been anal, anal, anal.

1281
01:06:55,328 --> 01:06:57,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for the nice manager who helps us out tonight.

1282
01:06:57,529 --> 01:06:58,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he's very nice.

1283
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for him, okay?

1284
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:02,252
[SPEAKER_05]: He's pretty cool, but everyone else has been kind of anal and stupid.

1285
01:07:02,412 --> 01:07:05,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you notice he looks kind of like an overweight Owen Wilson?

1286
01:07:07,054 --> 01:07:07,914
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's very nice.

1287
01:07:08,694 --> 01:07:10,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but he's got that face like Owen Wilson.

1288
01:07:10,535 --> 01:07:13,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that Jamie might be telling him the date and time to listen to this very show?

1289
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:13,837
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1290
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:15,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope not.

1291
01:07:15,935 --> 01:07:17,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you're going to edit this out of the show.

1292
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:19,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if that's the case, then all these comments have been made by Punk Night.

1293
01:07:19,937 --> 01:07:21,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say anything wrong.

1294
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:24,319
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Punk Night talking.

1295
01:07:24,399 --> 01:07:24,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey!

1296
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:25,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Mel!

1297
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi!

1298
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,181
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is now Loki talking.

1299
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:32,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Little kids are going to kick my ass.

1300
01:07:32,942 --> 01:07:35,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Little kids love to kick my ass.

1301
01:07:35,623 --> 01:07:38,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I get my ass kicked by little kids all the time.

1302
01:07:38,744 --> 01:07:40,665
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't kick my ass, they just threaten to kick my ass.

1303
01:07:41,696 --> 01:07:43,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, I sound like I look like a little kid or something.

1304
01:07:43,717 --> 01:07:44,378
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where we are?

1305
01:07:44,398 --> 01:07:46,339
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the upstairs part of Golf Land.

1306
01:07:46,839 --> 01:07:50,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're surrounded, we're in the happy birthday section or the party section or whatever.

1307
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:54,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all these drawings of dragons with really huge nostrils.

1308
01:07:55,025 --> 01:07:55,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what the hell?

1309
01:07:55,745 --> 01:07:57,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what's up with that dragon right there?

1310
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he looks like there's a bulge coming out of his stomach.

1311
01:08:00,248 --> 01:08:01,589
[SPEAKER_02]: They all look crazy.

1312
01:08:01,629 --> 01:08:04,911
[SPEAKER_02]: They all look... He's having a very happy birthday.

1313
01:08:05,591 --> 01:08:07,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nostril-saurus or something.

1314
01:08:07,693 --> 01:08:08,914
[SPEAKER_02]: God, it's like crazy.

1315
01:08:08,934 --> 01:08:09,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you an impersonator?

1316
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:12,215
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one behind you with the shorts and burning cupcake.

1317
01:08:12,835 --> 01:08:14,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Burning cupcake?

1318
01:08:14,616 --> 01:08:16,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Look out, he's coming right for us!

1319
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:18,757
[SPEAKER_04]: That's burning heat, my friend.

1320
01:08:18,777 --> 01:08:24,819
[SPEAKER_05]: See, now all those things that you would assume are like confetti, those are actually just spots he's seen because he's on acid.

1321
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:25,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at his eyes.

1322
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of look like a telephone operator.

1323
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:31,242
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two conversations going on right now.

1324
01:08:31,282 --> 01:08:32,282
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is in stereo.

1325
01:08:32,322 --> 01:08:32,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah?

1326
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:39,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I like Telephone Operator as I was continuing my conversation with Ted.

1327
01:08:39,972 --> 01:08:40,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1328
01:08:40,493 --> 01:08:40,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1329
01:08:41,273 --> 01:08:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1330
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:43,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get interesting talk on.

1331
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:44,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1332
01:08:44,614 --> 01:08:46,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that English or what?

1333
01:08:46,474 --> 01:08:47,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I like ass.

1334
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:49,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get our Bimani talk on.

1335
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:50,395
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be Brad again.

1336
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:51,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Ass is good.

1337
01:08:51,676 --> 01:08:51,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad?

1338
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:54,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Bimani.

1339
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:57,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Bimani's neat and fun.

1340
01:08:57,097 --> 01:08:59,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I think Bimani's super, but not laser knife.

1341
01:09:00,018 --> 01:09:01,079
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have done this show drunk.

1342
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:02,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1343
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:11,074
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have gotten more people playing DDR, actually, and playing, you know, hip-hop mania and drum mania.

1344
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:12,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an audio thing.

1345
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:15,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Visual aids don't help.

1346
01:09:15,806 --> 01:09:16,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but we could give reports.

1347
01:09:16,807 --> 01:09:17,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good, Einstein.

1348
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:19,088
[SPEAKER_08]: We could undermine your intelligence and such.

1349
01:09:19,108 --> 01:09:20,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ted.

1350
01:09:20,849 --> 01:09:21,189
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

1351
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:23,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Your powers of observation are great.

1352
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:25,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you have to read 8-bit theater.

1353
01:09:25,252 --> 01:09:27,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, or maybe not.

1354
01:09:27,553 --> 01:09:30,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so anyway... It's probably too advanced for you.

1355
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:38,200
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's start talking about... Yeah, you know, keyboard media is fixed and working, I noticed.

1356
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I went down there and played it.

1357
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:43,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the right side is... Yeah, the left side has this tendency to make new chords.

1358
01:09:43,343 --> 01:09:43,904
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to tell...

1359
01:09:44,784 --> 01:09:46,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Dwayne or whatever the hell his name is about it.

1360
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:48,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwayne the nice guy.

1361
01:09:48,509 --> 01:09:49,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwayne the nice guy.

1362
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:50,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwayne the nice guy.

1363
01:09:50,951 --> 01:09:51,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwayne the nice guy.

1364
01:09:51,712 --> 01:09:52,774
[SPEAKER_05]: His name's Bob, okay.

1365
01:09:53,154 --> 01:09:53,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Dwayne.

1366
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:54,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Bob.

1367
01:09:54,636 --> 01:09:54,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwayne.

1368
01:09:55,136 --> 01:09:55,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob.

1369
01:09:55,597 --> 01:09:55,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Dwayne?

1370
01:09:56,378 --> 01:09:57,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it, it's Bob, okay.

1371
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:57,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Dwayne?

1372
01:09:59,124 --> 01:09:59,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob, is it?

1373
01:10:00,445 --> 01:10:01,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob.

1374
01:10:01,705 --> 01:10:08,789
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I hope we don't get sued for saying all these people on the radio, but we have no money and can't get blood out of turnips, so you'll never take me alive.

1375
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:10,689
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a cheesy saying.

1376
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:17,332
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I come in and I saw that and I'm like, wow, it's on, it's working, and the keys are all intact.

1377
01:10:17,432 --> 01:10:18,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1378
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:20,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Keyboard mania is, I guess, okay.

1379
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:21,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait one minute.

1380
01:10:21,975 --> 01:10:25,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just wait one... Let me start over.

1381
01:10:25,437 --> 01:10:26,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait a second.

1382
01:10:26,298 --> 01:10:28,920
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be little kids pulling the keys off any minute now.

1383
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,201
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been working.

1384
01:10:30,401 --> 01:10:30,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

1385
01:10:32,222 --> 01:10:32,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Now... Oh, yeah?

1386
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:34,864
[SPEAKER_08]: For about a month, actually.

1387
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:35,324
[SPEAKER_08]: If...

1388
01:10:37,146 --> 01:10:44,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking, say if we ever got banned, how would they support themselves during the winter?

1389
01:10:44,617 --> 01:10:46,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no one comes in here other than us.

1390
01:10:47,061 --> 01:10:49,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would run this place?

1391
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,888
[SPEAKER_08]: How would they get the money to run this place?

1392
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:54,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I think something like that would happen.

1393
01:10:54,612 --> 01:10:59,615
[SPEAKER_08]: We're their only source of income in the winter, except for maybe $3 off Pac-Man or something.

1394
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:02,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's like a week.

1395
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:07,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so what's going to happen is we get banned.

1396
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:12,584
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be going without us for about a couple of months and realize that they're in debt or something.

1397
01:11:12,704 --> 01:11:14,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's just put it this way.

1398
01:11:14,325 --> 01:11:22,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I spend unusual time coming here about $15 to $20 in tokens every time, which is why I don't like coming down here all the time

1399
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:25,994
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard on my account, yeah.

1400
01:11:26,994 --> 01:11:27,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm poor.

1401
01:11:27,895 --> 01:11:31,379
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, yeah, so if, you know, they just cut me off.

1402
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:31,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, man.

1403
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:33,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at Qzar, man.

1404
01:11:33,441 --> 01:11:37,404
[SPEAKER_05]: If I stop coming there, I'd like spend 15 grand there over four years.

1405
01:11:38,185 --> 01:11:39,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that sad?

1406
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:44,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say, though, I'm very dishonest when it comes to the ways I get my tokens.

1407
01:11:44,349 --> 01:11:50,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I came here tonight, played a few games of DDR, maybe four, five, six of them, two of those being doubles.

1408
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:51,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I came with no money.

1409
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:53,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a scrounger, as it were.

1410
01:11:53,735 --> 01:11:58,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so they don't make any money off me, so banning me... How do you scrounge tokens, exactly?

1411
01:11:58,297 --> 01:12:02,260
[SPEAKER_08]: You go around begging people, or you found them on the ground, or you hacked the machine, or what?

1412
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,261
[SPEAKER_08]: He asked me, you know, oh, some machine's broken tonight.

1413
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:06,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't tell him.

1414
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:10,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I tell him the ones that I want to play that are broken, not the ones that are broken that I get money out of.

1415
01:12:11,382 --> 01:12:11,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah.

1416
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:12,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Sick.

1417
01:12:13,003 --> 01:12:13,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame, shame.

1418
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't steal.

1419
01:12:16,744 --> 01:12:17,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, a donation.

1420
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:21,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, you're going to feed this?

1421
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:25,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Give the money to people who actually spend it.

1422
01:12:25,706 --> 01:12:26,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I spend money.

1423
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:27,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow, I see.

1424
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:31,389
[SPEAKER_13]: He stole his token.

1425
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, gee.

1426
01:12:33,591 --> 01:12:33,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1427
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:34,272
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1428
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:36,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's like giving to the Salvation Army.

1429
01:12:36,594 --> 01:12:37,374
[SPEAKER_04]: That was incredible.

1430
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:37,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1431
01:12:37,775 --> 01:12:38,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Ring, ring, ring.

1432
01:12:38,435 --> 01:12:38,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my bell.

1433
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:42,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for being on the show.

1434
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:44,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Any shout-outs you want to give here on our little program?

1435
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:46,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was good to meet everybody.

1436
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:47,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I do exist.

1437
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:48,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Vandalus.

1438
01:12:48,884 --> 01:12:49,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

1439
01:12:49,305 --> 01:12:49,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm out.

1440
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:51,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for coming.

1441
01:12:51,387 --> 01:12:51,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice seeing you.

1442
01:12:52,447 --> 01:12:53,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye, Vandalus.

1443
01:12:53,528 --> 01:12:53,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1444
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:57,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the one person Anita's back.

1445
01:12:58,022 --> 01:13:00,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see anything that happened to us downstairs?

1446
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:03,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We got accosted by them.

1447
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:08,088
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the employee came up to us and said, I don't think you're supposed to be doing this show here.

1448
01:13:09,008 --> 01:13:10,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I still don't believe that he exists.

1449
01:13:10,429 --> 01:13:12,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was just an elaborate hologram.

1450
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:13,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

1451
01:13:15,549 --> 01:13:21,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, as I was telling Anita, and finally the manager came out, but we got the cool manager tonight who likes the Bomani crowd and does things for us.

1452
01:13:21,918 --> 01:13:26,604
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but Jamie's in his office right now, and we don't know what's going on.

1453
01:13:27,545 --> 01:13:29,088
[SPEAKER_08]: She's been in there for quite a while.

1454
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:32,366
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been a recent plague of child reduction.

1455
01:13:33,186 --> 01:13:34,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's not a child.

1456
01:13:35,627 --> 01:13:38,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been in this community and stuff.

1457
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:43,209
[SPEAKER_04]: As we discovered on last week's Understation Live, she has the voice of a child.

1458
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,530
[SPEAKER_04]: But she's not a child.

1459
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:45,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jo.

1460
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:46,911
[SPEAKER_04]: That's scary.

1461
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:51,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we don't know what's going on, but we're just going to keep this show going.

1462
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:56,294
[SPEAKER_04]: We said it would be an experimental show, 10.5, and shit, boy.

1463
01:13:56,314 --> 01:13:58,875
[SPEAKER_04]: This is train wreck radio live.

1464
01:13:59,884 --> 01:14:01,785
[SPEAKER_04]: This show was brought to you by ass.

1465
01:14:01,985 --> 01:14:02,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Here.

1466
01:14:03,225 --> 01:14:04,005
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my ass.

1467
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:06,026
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I don't want to touch that microphone.

1468
01:14:06,346 --> 01:14:06,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Ass.

1469
01:14:06,986 --> 01:14:08,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you trying to... That's gross.

1470
01:14:09,227 --> 01:14:10,707
[SPEAKER_04]: You're nasty on your ass.

1471
01:14:13,368 --> 01:14:15,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're getting that rubbing noise on the air, by the way.

1472
01:14:18,269 --> 01:14:20,430
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it sounds like to be against my ass.

1473
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:21,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you all enjoyed.

1474
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:23,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ever want to go back there.

1475
01:14:24,851 --> 01:14:26,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't blow into the microphone.

1476
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,712
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's wrong with this show?

1477
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:28,832
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no donuts.

1478
01:14:29,605 --> 01:14:30,366
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why!

1479
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:31,567
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us are hyper.

1480
01:14:31,587 --> 01:14:34,289
[SPEAKER_04]: We could go downstairs and get overpriced cardboard pizza.

1481
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:34,530
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1482
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:36,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty hungry.

1483
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:36,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1484
01:14:37,612 --> 01:14:39,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Not enough for cardboard pizza.

1485
01:14:39,154 --> 01:14:42,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes though, if you go right before closing, you can get free cardboard pizza.

1486
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:43,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow!

1487
01:14:43,818 --> 01:14:45,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like saying you get free shit.

1488
01:14:45,699 --> 01:14:47,541
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I love free shit.

1489
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:51,685
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like when you're driving down the street and they have the big signs that say, you know, free dirt.

1490
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:52,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1491
01:14:53,987 --> 01:14:54,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Free pie.

1492
01:14:54,909 --> 01:14:56,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pie is also evil.

1493
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:57,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worse than cardboard pizza.

1494
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:58,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It's foam pizza.

1495
01:14:58,533 --> 01:14:58,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1496
01:14:59,214 --> 01:15:00,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Fertilizer for sale.

1497
01:15:00,836 --> 01:15:01,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1498
01:15:01,637 --> 01:15:03,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, who gives a damn?

1499
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1500
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:08,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did we have a Jamie?

1501
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:09,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

1502
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:11,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we had a Jamie sighting.

1503
01:15:11,691 --> 01:15:12,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, not yet.

1504
01:15:12,392 --> 01:15:13,192
[SPEAKER_02]: A Jamie sighting?

1505
01:15:13,212 --> 01:15:14,353
[SPEAKER_02]: What is she, like an alien or something?

1506
01:15:14,413 --> 01:15:14,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1507
01:15:15,034 --> 01:15:16,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to wonder what happened.

1508
01:15:17,116 --> 01:15:17,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Jamie.

1509
01:15:17,696 --> 01:15:17,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

1510
01:15:17,956 --> 01:15:20,979
[SPEAKER_04]: When we go into our next break, we won't come back from that break until Jamie's back.

1511
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:22,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, somebody else is going into the office now.

1512
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:22,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1513
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:23,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

1514
01:15:23,861 --> 01:15:24,482
[SPEAKER_04]: A group thing.

1515
01:15:24,862 --> 01:15:26,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1516
01:15:26,784 --> 01:15:27,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, my gosh.

1517
01:15:27,765 --> 01:15:28,065
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1518
01:15:28,165 --> 01:15:28,565
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on?

1519
01:15:28,605 --> 01:15:30,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Take advantage of nobody being downstairs.

1520
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:31,628
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I did earlier.

1521
01:15:31,648 --> 01:15:31,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy.

1522
01:15:32,008 --> 01:15:32,709
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, take care.

1523
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:35,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now we've got to keep this show going.

1524
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:36,152
[SPEAKER_04]: What to talk about now?

1525
01:15:37,653 --> 01:15:41,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I could give one of our frequent listeners a call, because I said I would at some point tonight.

1526
01:15:41,817 --> 01:15:42,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1527
01:15:42,157 --> 01:15:43,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get it on the radio?

1528
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:44,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to do it on the radio.

1529
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:46,861
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know how well this is going to turn out, so we'll see.

1530
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, we can play a game if you want.

1531
01:15:48,963 --> 01:15:49,303
[SPEAKER_04]: We can.

1532
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:49,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1533
01:15:49,744 --> 01:15:53,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to find my phone, my super-duper phone unit.

1534
01:15:53,907 --> 01:15:56,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is experimental radio, as I said.

1535
01:15:56,129 --> 01:15:57,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how this is going to go.

1536
01:15:58,251 --> 01:16:08,016
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did say at some point in the evening I would give one of our early listeners to the show, early supporter of the show Damn it, Brad, don't call me Hey, go on What?

1537
01:16:09,096 --> 01:16:13,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad's calling me on my phone So, Rob, how you doing?

1538
01:16:13,898 --> 01:16:14,299
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

1539
01:16:14,959 --> 01:16:17,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good So how's the show going?

1540
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:22,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard you're doing a radio show Yes, and there's a delay on cell phones, did you know that?

1541
01:16:22,382 --> 01:16:22,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that cool?

1542
01:16:23,303 --> 01:16:25,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can get some real funky echo thing out of this Yeah, let's do it

1543
01:16:31,104 --> 01:16:34,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk into your cell phone, Rob.

1544
01:16:34,586 --> 01:16:34,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1545
01:16:35,427 --> 01:16:35,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1546
01:16:36,928 --> 01:16:38,549
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so cool.

1547
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:42,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We're breaking people's speakers as we speak.

1548
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:43,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I said we'd call.

1549
01:16:43,793 --> 01:16:45,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, back to the track.

1550
01:16:45,995 --> 01:16:48,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we're going to give somebody a call here.

1551
01:16:48,957 --> 01:16:50,338
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try calling...

1552
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:51,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, what?

1553
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:54,301
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a backup topic if this doesn't work right away.

1554
01:16:54,581 --> 01:16:56,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, we're going to try making the phone call.

1555
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:57,882
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the backup topic if we have to.

1556
01:16:58,362 --> 01:17:03,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm going to do my best to try to understand what the guy's saying, but I don't know how this is going to go.

1557
01:17:03,364 --> 01:17:04,764
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dialing right now.

1558
01:17:05,224 --> 01:17:07,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get him on the phone first, so fill in for me.

1559
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:07,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1560
01:17:08,365 --> 01:17:10,446
[SPEAKER_02]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1561
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:16,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's a cute bag, though.

1562
01:17:16,997 --> 01:17:17,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I am here.

1563
01:17:17,878 --> 01:17:18,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And my name is Chaos.

1564
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:20,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Rap is to me like music is to Amadeus.

1565
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Wolfgang, the famous composer.

1566
01:17:22,901 --> 01:17:25,422
[SPEAKER_04]: It's telling me the number's not available.

1567
01:17:25,943 --> 01:17:27,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1568
01:17:27,303 --> 01:17:29,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, that's experimental radio right there for you.

1569
01:17:29,505 --> 01:17:30,185
[SPEAKER_04]: The number didn't work.

1570
01:17:30,265 --> 01:17:30,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

1571
01:17:30,585 --> 01:17:31,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now what's on your mind?

1572
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:32,026
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll go.

1573
01:17:32,066 --> 01:17:33,007
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, Anita?

1574
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:34,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have a fuck you.

1575
01:17:35,148 --> 01:17:35,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, okay.

1576
01:17:36,329 --> 01:17:36,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Such language.

1577
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:38,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck me or fuck... No, I'm just...

1578
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:42,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well... I'd buy that for a dollar.

1579
01:17:42,547 --> 01:17:43,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1580
01:17:43,428 --> 01:17:44,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifty cents!

1581
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:48,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got... Okay.

1582
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:52,378
[SPEAKER_02]: My fuck you of the week is... DVD region codes.

1583
01:17:54,429 --> 01:17:57,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you guys think about this, but I can't stand them.

1584
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually don't have a fucky.

1585
01:17:58,872 --> 01:18:00,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm usually really mellow.

1586
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:02,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, usually things don't bother me.

1587
01:18:02,695 --> 01:18:03,916
[SPEAKER_02]: She usually has a darn you.

1588
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:06,798
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just kidding.

1589
01:18:07,478 --> 01:18:08,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the past seven weeks.

1590
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:09,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell me, have you never been mellow?

1591
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:15,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever been lonely?

1592
01:18:16,885 --> 01:18:19,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever tried?

1593
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:20,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay, all right.

1594
01:18:22,168 --> 01:18:23,429
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, I'm sorry to cut you off.

1595
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:31,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, see, I don't understand region codes because I suppose they were invented to avoid piracy, correct?

1596
01:18:31,677 --> 01:18:31,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1597
01:18:32,782 --> 01:18:33,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they didn't do it.

1598
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:42,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what they succeeded in doing is screwing over people like me who want to buy nice DVDs from other countries that don't have any English translations.

1599
01:18:43,309 --> 01:18:51,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I have a Japanese PlayStation 2, so I can play DVDs with the Japanese region, and I bet if I hook things up right, I could do a dub.

1600
01:18:53,036 --> 01:18:53,777
[SPEAKER_04]: You should give me a call.

1601
01:18:53,797 --> 01:18:54,197
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk.

1602
01:18:56,677 --> 01:18:57,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, copying.

1603
01:18:57,718 --> 01:19:00,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like I'm going to actually talk and do the dub.

1604
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:04,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put it in the VCR and hit record and dub that one.

1605
01:19:04,341 --> 01:19:05,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'd be a good dubber.

1606
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:10,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is a mystery.

1607
01:19:10,444 --> 01:19:10,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it!

1608
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:13,625
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't get that joke.

1609
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:15,106
[SPEAKER_02]: We should start a dubbing company.

1610
01:19:15,366 --> 01:19:16,186
[SPEAKER_04]: A dubbing company?

1611
01:19:16,286 --> 01:19:17,027
[SPEAKER_04]: What would we call it?

1612
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:19,848
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dubbers?

1613
01:19:20,428 --> 01:19:22,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacra Dubbers.

1614
01:19:22,609 --> 01:19:23,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacra Dubbers.

1615
01:19:25,697 --> 01:19:26,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Dubber Mentals.

1616
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:27,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Dubbers Incorporated.

1617
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:30,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Dubbers.

1618
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:32,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Dubby Dub.

1619
01:19:32,979 --> 01:19:33,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub-a-Dub.

1620
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:35,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame.

1621
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:35,860
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1622
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:36,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that'd be good.

1623
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub-a-Dub.

1624
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:41,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Dub-a-Rub.

1625
01:19:41,521 --> 01:19:41,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1626
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:45,962
[SPEAKER_02]: We should seriously all, you know, do dubbing for anime.

1627
01:19:46,183 --> 01:19:46,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1628
01:19:46,563 --> 01:19:49,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to be an anime voice person thing.

1629
01:19:50,104 --> 01:19:51,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would you want to do the voice for?

1630
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:54,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Akane, Tendo from Ranma.

1631
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a sample of what your dub would sound like.

1632
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:00,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know any of her lines.

1633
01:20:01,559 --> 01:20:02,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling fat and saucy.

1634
01:20:04,021 --> 01:20:04,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You are?

1635
01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:05,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Ranma.

1636
01:20:05,643 --> 01:20:07,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, would you like to go to a movie?

1637
01:20:07,705 --> 01:20:08,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.

1638
01:20:08,585 --> 01:20:08,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.

1639
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:09,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo!

1640
01:20:11,068 --> 01:20:11,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

1641
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:13,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what voice you'd like to do.

1642
01:20:14,111 --> 01:20:16,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the name of the main character from La Blue Girl?

1643
01:20:18,299 --> 01:20:19,480
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their name?

1644
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's La?

1645
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was LA?

1646
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:24,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I would do Ranma-chan, the girl side of Ranma.

1647
01:20:25,282 --> 01:20:26,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do one from her.

1648
01:20:26,942 --> 01:20:30,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going back to China, so suck on that, old man.

1649
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:31,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

1650
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

1651
01:20:33,165 --> 01:20:34,525
[SPEAKER_02]: They're clapping in the background.

1652
01:20:34,845 --> 01:20:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: They love you.

1653
01:20:35,866 --> 01:20:36,806
[SPEAKER_02]: They really love you.

1654
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:37,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Cowduken

1655
01:21:05,745 --> 01:21:09,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, that's... I'm gonna fry some Twinkies with this fireball here or something.

1656
01:21:09,668 --> 01:21:10,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what the hell?

1657
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:11,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1658
01:21:11,329 --> 01:21:12,650
[SPEAKER_02]: From Texas, you know.

1659
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over here in California.

1660
01:21:14,171 --> 01:21:14,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Hire me.

1661
01:21:14,952 --> 01:21:18,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so any other, like, fuck yous of the week?

1662
01:21:19,456 --> 01:21:19,936
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mine.

1663
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:20,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done for now.

1664
01:21:21,357 --> 01:21:21,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1665
01:21:21,797 --> 01:21:24,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't... Where'd my fucking co-host go?

1666
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:25,580
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my question.

1667
01:21:25,941 --> 01:21:26,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll find out.

1668
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:30,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We will find out after the next break because we'll stop tape until we find out what happened to Jamie.

1669
01:21:31,285 --> 01:21:32,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wanna know.

1670
01:21:32,045 --> 01:21:32,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned.

1671
01:21:32,646 --> 01:21:33,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what are we paying her for anyway?

1672
01:21:33,907 --> 01:21:35,208
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying her?

1673
01:21:35,848 --> 01:21:36,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you didn't know?

1674
01:21:36,528 --> 01:21:37,309
[SPEAKER_04]: We give favors.

1675
01:21:38,009 --> 01:21:39,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we had this discussion.

1676
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,290
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not getting paid.

1677
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,290
[SPEAKER_04]: You may not be, but she is.

1678
01:21:43,751 --> 01:21:45,611
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like taking all of our money, you know.

1679
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:49,533
[SPEAKER_02]: She has these sponsors and she's getting all the money and not giving it to us.

1680
01:21:49,673 --> 01:21:51,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Jamie's a black hole and she takes all of our money.

1681
01:21:52,113 --> 01:21:52,474
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1682
01:21:53,274 --> 01:21:54,074
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Brad.

1683
01:21:54,094 --> 01:21:56,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Address those cards and letters to LankyStyle.

1684
01:21:56,555 --> 01:21:57,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Care of... Anyway.

1685
01:21:58,256 --> 01:21:59,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Care of what, Rob?

1686
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:01,697
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I trail off and don't finish my thought.

1687
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:01,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1688
01:22:03,675 --> 01:22:06,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Bomani, since this is a Bomani show.

1689
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:08,180
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea, yes.

1690
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about Bomani do you want to talk about?

1691
01:22:09,902 --> 01:22:12,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, let's talk about, um, stuff.

1692
01:22:12,745 --> 01:22:14,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys turn off the microphone on accident?

1693
01:22:14,226 --> 01:22:14,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, no.

1694
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:16,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought maybe the battery ran off for a minute or something.

1695
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:19,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that would be... We're okay, we're okay.

1696
01:22:19,992 --> 01:22:22,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit, this thing's been on pause the whole time.

1697
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:22,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Darn.

1698
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:24,764
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

1699
01:22:25,725 --> 01:22:26,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that stupid.

1700
01:22:27,106 --> 01:22:29,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So about, like, if we do have a second tournament, let's talk about that.

1701
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:31,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be SCAT 2?

1702
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:32,291
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1703
01:22:32,351 --> 01:22:35,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be STAB, Sacramento's Tournament and Bowling.

1704
01:22:35,394 --> 01:22:36,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the idea.

1705
01:22:36,855 --> 01:22:39,758
[SPEAKER_04]: If we did it at CCL, we'd do STAB, Sacramento's Tournament and Bowling.

1706
01:22:39,798 --> 01:22:40,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's going to happen.

1707
01:22:40,818 --> 01:22:42,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not give out all of our secrets.

1708
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:42,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1709
01:22:44,955 --> 01:22:46,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, some stupid laser tag game thing.

1710
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,381
[SPEAKER_04]: L-A-N-K-Y.

1711
01:23:07,101 --> 01:23:07,601
[SPEAKER_04]: K-Y.

1712
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:08,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Emphasis on the K-Y.

1713
01:23:09,322 --> 01:23:15,145
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I saw this license plate that said K-Y Lady.

1714
01:23:15,785 --> 01:23:17,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, who wants to advertise that you're the K-Y Lady?

1715
01:23:17,906 --> 01:23:19,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here's somebody who hasn't been on this show yet tonight.

1716
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:24,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody say hello to Somnia Magus X, also known as Ryan.

1717
01:23:25,149 --> 01:23:25,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Ryan.

1718
01:23:25,869 --> 01:23:26,370
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this?

1719
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:27,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, live broadcast?

1720
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:29,151
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dan the Man's coming up, too.

1721
01:23:30,871 --> 01:23:34,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is going to be interesting because we're going to have to explain to Dan what happened to Jamie.

1722
01:23:34,933 --> 01:23:36,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know what happened to Jamie.

1723
01:23:38,475 --> 01:23:41,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what happened to Jamie either.

1724
01:23:41,236 --> 01:23:44,958
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost your fiance, Dan.

1725
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:45,838
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost Jamie.

1726
01:23:45,878 --> 01:23:48,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Darren, come tell us the gossip on Jamie while she's not here.

1727
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:52,041
[SPEAKER_04]: She's in the office right now with the manager.

1728
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:53,842
[SPEAKER_04]: She's completely insane.

1729
01:23:55,102 --> 01:23:55,563
[SPEAKER_04]: How so?

1730
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: You know her.

1731
01:23:58,871 --> 01:24:00,272
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Dan the Man, ladies and gentlemen.

1732
01:24:00,292 --> 01:24:00,732
[SPEAKER_06]: This is true.

1733
01:24:01,332 --> 01:24:02,192
[SPEAKER_06]: This is quite true.

1734
01:24:19,491 --> 01:24:19,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1735
01:24:21,113 --> 01:24:23,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the only school I know about.

1736
01:24:24,297 --> 01:24:26,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob's in gay charm school.

1737
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:30,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the only one here that actually looks like I'm in high school because I am.

1738
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:32,027
[SPEAKER_08]: And what are we?

1739
01:24:32,087 --> 01:24:33,148
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just your cousins?

1740
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:35,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you're all of my cousins.

1741
01:24:35,551 --> 01:24:36,372
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you are, Rob.

1742
01:24:38,736 --> 01:24:39,576
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all my parents.

1743
01:24:39,736 --> 01:24:40,076
[SPEAKER_08]: All of you.

1744
01:24:40,517 --> 01:24:40,837
[SPEAKER_08]: All of you.

1745
01:24:41,737 --> 01:24:42,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, son.

1746
01:24:42,618 --> 01:24:43,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Now wash my damn car.

1747
01:24:44,999 --> 01:24:50,282
[SPEAKER_04]: So, long story short, manager came down, but it was the good manager, the nice manager that supports Mamani here at Golf Line.

1748
01:24:50,302 --> 01:24:52,683
[SPEAKER_04]: The one employee that likes the Mamani players.

1749
01:24:52,983 --> 01:24:54,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're in the office right now.

1750
01:24:54,364 --> 01:24:56,185
[SPEAKER_04]: We think they're talking about a tournament, possibly.

1751
01:24:56,285 --> 01:24:56,785
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't know.

1752
01:24:57,305 --> 01:25:00,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to spread rumors prematurely, but yeah, it looks like we're going to have a tournament at Golf Line.

1753
01:25:00,507 --> 01:25:04,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like we're on the radio and we're spreading rumors or anything like that.

1754
01:25:05,089 --> 01:25:05,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1755
01:25:05,289 --> 01:25:05,549
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

1756
01:25:05,569 --> 01:25:06,429
[SPEAKER_04]: No one listens to this show.

1757
01:25:06,449 --> 01:25:06,830
[SPEAKER_04]: We're okay.

1758
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:07,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, pa.

1759
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:09,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1760
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:12,671
[SPEAKER_04]: This show is on every Sunday night from 7 o'clock till 9 o'clock Pacific time.

1761
01:25:12,711 --> 01:25:14,572
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even know, you big putt.

1762
01:25:15,232 --> 01:25:16,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how do I listen to it?

1763
01:25:16,673 --> 01:25:17,293
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you listen to it?

1764
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:20,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is kind of redundant for our listeners who are already listening.

1765
01:25:20,314 --> 01:25:22,134
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're just going to go to our website.

1766
01:25:22,174 --> 01:25:23,114
[SPEAKER_04]: They may not know the website.

1767
01:25:24,795 --> 01:25:28,416
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at my signature on Sack Bomani or DDR Freak, I'm Sky High.

1768
01:25:28,436 --> 01:25:29,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Sky High?

1769
01:25:30,397 --> 01:25:31,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Sky High.

1770
01:25:31,357 --> 01:25:32,537
[SPEAKER_06]: No, kill me, please.

1771
01:25:32,657 --> 01:25:34,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Not DJ Mako, please.

1772
01:25:36,205 --> 01:25:43,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in my signature, but the website is orangelounge.sky.cx And that's the website.

1773
01:25:44,612 --> 01:25:46,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like the old Sac of Imani.

1774
01:25:46,173 --> 01:25:48,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like the old one, except it's orangelounge, not DDR.

1775
01:25:49,036 --> 01:25:50,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and no one commented on it.

1776
01:25:50,677 --> 01:25:51,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1777
01:25:51,618 --> 01:25:53,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Something maybe the listeners of this live show don't know.

1778
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,463
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're not on the air doing a live talk show, we've got Imani Music and More playing 24 hours a day.

1779
01:25:58,563 --> 01:26:01,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Mania tracks, 2DX, DDR.

1780
01:26:03,064 --> 01:26:07,732
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta give me a second of like an hour or two each day where I can just run to the next stop.

1781
01:26:07,752 --> 01:26:09,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to say anything to our listeners?

1782
01:26:09,595 --> 01:26:10,437
[SPEAKER_04]: You got an opportunity here.

1783
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:16,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's, yeah, as Irene jumps to unplug my mic.

1784
01:26:16,532 --> 01:26:19,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, uh, I don't got to say that much.

1785
01:26:19,613 --> 01:26:21,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the community doesn't know.

1786
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:24,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, this is a nationwide show.

1787
01:26:24,114 --> 01:26:24,594
[SPEAKER_04]: International.

1788
01:26:24,614 --> 01:26:25,675
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got listeners in Japan.

1789
01:26:25,975 --> 01:26:29,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to say hello to our listeners in Japan because I see there's people from Japan listening every week.

1790
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:29,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1791
01:26:30,176 --> 01:26:30,716
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really awesome.

1792
01:26:30,756 --> 01:26:32,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a couple from Chile, apparently.

1793
01:26:33,037 --> 01:26:33,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Chile.

1794
01:26:34,758 --> 01:26:38,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to remind everyone in Chile, your big gay representative is here today.

1795
01:26:40,074 --> 01:26:40,774
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1796
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:42,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky's up in the game.

1797
01:26:43,836 --> 01:26:44,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1798
01:26:44,397 --> 01:26:45,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1799
01:26:47,258 --> 01:26:48,179
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know any Japanese.

1800
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:48,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie does.

1801
01:26:48,419 --> 01:26:52,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a little bit, but it's like tourist Japanese and they'd probably get all pissed off and stuff.

1802
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:53,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Anita does.

1803
01:26:53,422 --> 01:26:57,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Say something nice to our Japanese listeners.

1804
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:00,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for saying good evening.

1805
01:27:00,787 --> 01:27:02,207
[SPEAKER_04]: She just told us to fuck off.

1806
01:27:02,327 --> 01:27:02,888
[SPEAKER_04]: What's her problem?

1807
01:27:04,764 --> 01:27:05,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexico is where it's at.

1808
01:27:31,778 --> 01:27:33,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Mexicans kick ass.

1809
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:33,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?

1810
01:27:33,938 --> 01:27:34,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they'll sell you liquor?

1811
01:27:34,819 --> 01:27:35,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Mexican.

1812
01:27:37,639 --> 01:27:39,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was because of all the gas you got after you ate their food.

1813
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:41,940
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1814
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Only if you eat it.

1815
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:46,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Only if you consider Taco Bell to be Mexican food.

1816
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:48,442
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to get rid of the gas, drink the water.

1817
01:27:49,942 --> 01:27:50,222
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1818
01:27:50,362 --> 01:27:51,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, wait.

1819
01:27:52,503 --> 01:27:53,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried that.

1820
01:27:53,963 --> 01:27:54,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried that, Ted.

1821
01:27:55,063 --> 01:27:56,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it worked for me.

1822
01:27:57,524 --> 01:27:57,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1823
01:27:58,524 --> 01:27:59,004
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a joke.

1824
01:28:00,102 --> 01:28:00,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Play along, Ted.

1825
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:03,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Anita's tattoo.

1826
01:28:03,825 --> 01:28:05,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Anita has a tattoo on her arm.

1827
01:28:05,266 --> 01:28:06,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I never knew that.

1828
01:28:06,467 --> 01:28:07,607
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a bad mama.

1829
01:28:07,707 --> 01:28:08,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1830
01:28:08,888 --> 01:28:09,829
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a dragon, right?

1831
01:28:09,969 --> 01:28:10,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1832
01:28:10,689 --> 01:28:11,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah.

1833
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:12,911
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1834
01:28:12,951 --> 01:28:15,292
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a three-toed dragon from Japan.

1835
01:28:15,312 --> 01:28:16,813
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, dude.

1836
01:28:16,913 --> 01:28:18,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I got it in San Antonio, Texas.

1837
01:28:19,835 --> 01:28:20,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It's balls or orange.

1838
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:21,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean ball.

1839
01:28:22,217 --> 01:28:22,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1840
01:28:23,938 --> 01:28:26,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had it for, well, see...

1841
01:28:27,959 --> 01:28:28,259
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 years.

1842
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,000
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 years.

1843
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1844
01:28:31,841 --> 01:28:32,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1845
01:28:32,701 --> 01:28:33,782
[SPEAKER_04]: She's beep.

1846
01:28:33,962 --> 01:28:35,783
[SPEAKER_04]: You never ask a lady her age.

1847
01:28:36,343 --> 01:28:38,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so don't ask Rob his age.

1848
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:46,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I can bleep it out if you want.

1849
01:28:46,268 --> 01:28:48,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to find a clever way to say how old I am.

1850
01:28:49,369 --> 01:28:49,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Old enough.

1851
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:52,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Old enough to know better than to tell you.

1852
01:28:53,206 --> 01:28:57,492
[SPEAKER_04]: The reflex is a... She's married, that's all you need to know.

1853
01:28:58,713 --> 01:29:00,295
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more than you needed to know.

1854
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:01,376
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like a reflex.

1855
01:29:01,477 --> 01:29:03,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God I did not want to ask you that.

1856
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,402
[SPEAKER_08]: The reflex is a...

1857
01:29:07,145 --> 01:29:13,811
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1858
01:29:29,213 --> 01:29:30,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, she's coming out of the office now.

1859
01:29:31,494 --> 01:29:32,374
[SPEAKER_04]: She's coming out.

1860
01:29:32,514 --> 01:29:33,574
[SPEAKER_04]: She's drenched in sweat.

1861
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:34,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the time at?

1862
01:29:34,514 --> 01:29:35,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are we at?

1863
01:29:35,415 --> 01:29:35,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what?

1864
01:29:36,035 --> 01:29:36,695
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for a break, Rob.

1865
01:29:36,715 --> 01:29:37,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for a break.

1866
01:29:37,355 --> 01:29:40,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to break, and when we come back from break... You're keeping us in suspense.

1867
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:44,737
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to find out what happened with Jamie in the office.

1868
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:55,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, semi-live here tonight at Roseville Golf Land, who is going to let us do the show here after all, as opposed to throwing our asses out on the street.

1869
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:55,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1870
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:56,440
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

1871
01:30:18,932 --> 01:30:20,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I got metal to the metal

1872
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:00,423
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna getcha!

1873
01:31:00,443 --> 01:31:00,983
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great, man!

1874
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:44,305
[SPEAKER_01]: This recording is Volume 2 in a series of unintended decisions made before microphone and camera.

DarkSakura.com

1876
01:38:09,299 --> 01:38:15,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1877
01:38:20,598 --> 01:38:23,879
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and we're back from that little break we took of music.

1878
01:38:23,919 --> 01:38:24,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you enjoyed it.

1879
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:27,300
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie is back.

1880
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie has a headache.

1881
01:38:28,241 --> 01:38:31,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, oh my gosh, what went on in there?

1882
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:35,143
[SPEAKER_22]: It was just being so enthusiastic.

1883
01:38:35,863 --> 01:38:37,024
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, we're a go.

1884
01:38:37,284 --> 01:38:38,264
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have a tourney here.

1885
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:42,926
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're speculating out here, probably setting up some kind of tournament for Roseville Golf Line.

1886
01:38:42,946 --> 01:38:43,786
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what we're working on.

1887
01:38:43,866 --> 01:38:46,687
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't go into too much detail right now, but it's official.

1888
01:38:47,167 --> 01:38:47,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

1889
01:38:48,087 --> 01:38:48,988
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to get this going.

1890
01:38:49,708 --> 01:38:51,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you didn't have to do anything naughty to make that happen, right?

1891
01:38:52,069 --> 01:38:52,349
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1892
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:53,830
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1893
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:54,850
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I had to ask.

1894
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:56,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, my fiance's downstairs.

1895
01:38:57,011 --> 01:38:57,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1896
01:38:57,712 --> 01:38:59,412
[SPEAKER_04]: He called you insane during the last break.

1897
01:38:59,812 --> 01:39:01,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you know it?

1898
01:39:02,193 --> 01:39:02,794
[SPEAKER_22]: He lives with me.

1899
01:39:02,814 --> 01:39:03,014
[SPEAKER_22]: He knows.

1900
01:39:03,034 --> 01:39:04,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any retorts?

1901
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:07,696
[SPEAKER_22]: If I'm insane, Dan's like freaking retarded.

1902
01:39:07,756 --> 01:39:08,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1903
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:12,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Brad and Irene are leaving now, so I'll use my little...

1904
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:16,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so as soon as they close, we're going to end the show.

1905
01:39:17,083 --> 01:39:19,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Golf Line's closing in a few minutes, so as soon as they close, we're going to end the show.

1906
01:39:20,325 --> 01:39:23,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys have anything you want to say?

1907
01:39:24,028 --> 01:39:25,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbyes or anything like that?

1908
01:39:28,072 --> 01:39:28,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Sayonara.

1909
01:39:30,854 --> 01:39:35,458
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been quite the interesting show tonight, fellas, ladies, gentlemen.

1910
01:39:37,136 --> 01:39:39,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we can, you're just going to go home and put this on?

1911
01:39:40,539 --> 01:39:42,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be on Sunday like every other show.

1912
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:42,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1913
01:39:43,002 --> 01:39:43,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1914
01:39:43,422 --> 01:39:43,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1915
01:39:44,143 --> 01:39:47,666
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have time to edit some funny little things in there, like a little dubbing over?

1916
01:39:47,726 --> 01:39:50,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really because I'm leaving, I'm skipping town tomorrow, so.

1917
01:39:50,608 --> 01:39:50,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1918
01:39:50,909 --> 01:39:51,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1919
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:52,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky you.

1920
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:53,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, lucky me.

1921
01:39:53,831 --> 01:39:54,211
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1922
01:39:54,692 --> 01:39:56,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun at work while I'm off, you know, in a bit.

1923
01:39:56,654 --> 01:39:57,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, fuck you.

1924
01:39:57,194 --> 01:39:58,255
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my fuck you.

1925
01:39:59,476 --> 01:40:02,158
[SPEAKER_04]: You go and have your fun five-day vacation.

1926
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:03,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Four.

1927
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:04,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Four days.

1928
01:40:05,071 --> 01:40:05,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday's off.

1929
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:06,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you count Thursday night.

1930
01:40:07,153 --> 01:40:07,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1931
01:40:07,373 --> 01:40:08,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only off Friday.

1932
01:40:08,134 --> 01:40:09,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't know you were not going to work.

1933
01:40:09,095 --> 01:40:10,496
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the listeners really want to know this crap.

1934
01:40:10,516 --> 01:40:13,458
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, the listeners, this is a little break from the Monotony Mountain.

1935
01:40:13,478 --> 01:40:13,798
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1936
01:40:13,838 --> 01:40:14,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an experimental show tonight.

1937
01:40:14,939 --> 01:40:18,722
[SPEAKER_04]: After what Jamie is going to tell us, they're not going to be able to contain themselves.

1938
01:40:19,843 --> 01:40:20,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm moist.

1939
01:40:21,044 --> 01:40:22,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I was moist.

1940
01:40:22,846 --> 01:40:23,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go clean up.

1941
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:25,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Jamie, here you go.

1942
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:28,991
[SPEAKER_22]: Irene's looking for me.

1943
01:40:29,091 --> 01:40:30,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you getting ready to go, Irene?

1944
01:40:30,472 --> 01:40:31,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to say any goodbyes?

1945
01:40:33,598 --> 01:40:34,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Bye!

1946
01:40:34,098 --> 01:40:35,719
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to miss everyone.

1947
01:40:36,419 --> 01:40:36,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, okay, bye.

1948
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:39,321
[SPEAKER_22]: You're going to miss everyone with everything you throw?

1949
01:40:39,381 --> 01:40:40,121
[SPEAKER_22]: Is your aim improving?

1950
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:42,843
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1951
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:45,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene's aim is improving.

1952
01:40:45,564 --> 01:40:46,624
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first.

1953
01:40:47,705 --> 01:40:48,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Anita, are you taking off too?

1954
01:40:49,586 --> 01:40:52,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last shoutouts you want to give or anything you want to say?

1955
01:40:53,008 --> 01:40:53,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, bye everybody.

1956
01:40:53,848 --> 01:40:55,289
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been really fun doing the show.

1957
01:40:55,709 --> 01:40:57,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, but Monty all the way.

1958
01:40:58,890 --> 01:40:59,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Loot.

1959
01:40:59,331 --> 01:40:59,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock on.

1960
01:41:01,087 --> 01:41:03,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you want to give a shout out to your friends?

1961
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:05,710
[SPEAKER_04]: This new shirt you're wearing here.

1962
01:41:06,030 --> 01:41:10,833
[SPEAKER_22]: In honor of my Step Squad family, I need to go ahead and let you guys know I am wearing my shirt tonight.

1963
01:41:10,853 --> 01:41:13,395
[SPEAKER_22]: Too bad it's not TV.

1964
01:41:13,915 --> 01:41:16,717
[SPEAKER_22]: Iguana Girl and I both had a Heineken in your honor on the plane.

1965
01:41:17,357 --> 01:41:20,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, we were too broke on the way back to have one other one.

1966
01:41:20,539 --> 01:41:23,641
[SPEAKER_22]: But we had one for our Step Squad homies.

1967
01:41:23,881 --> 01:41:24,481
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yo.

1968
01:41:25,242 --> 01:41:25,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.

1969
01:41:25,762 --> 01:41:26,102
[SPEAKER_22]: Holla.

1970
01:41:29,102 --> 01:41:34,285
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess in reference to the promo that Step Squad did at Mt.

1971
01:41:34,305 --> 01:41:34,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Mike's Journey.

1972
01:41:35,646 --> 01:41:37,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So how are you liking this Wednesday night taping?

1973
01:41:37,407 --> 01:41:38,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Ted loves it.

1974
01:41:38,248 --> 01:41:40,309
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants us to do this more regularly, more often.

1975
01:41:40,329 --> 01:41:42,310
[SPEAKER_22]: As long as we let him know in advance, I guess.

1976
01:41:43,351 --> 01:41:44,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do we have to let know now?

1977
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now that you have an in.

1978
01:41:47,093 --> 01:41:47,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You have an in.

1979
01:41:49,414 --> 01:41:51,015
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess we'll just let him know.

1980
01:41:51,035 --> 01:41:52,036
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a burning question.

1981
01:41:52,116 --> 01:41:54,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki says his name is Bob.

1982
01:41:54,637 --> 01:41:54,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Dwayne.

1983
01:41:55,258 --> 01:41:55,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Dwayne.

1984
01:41:56,318 --> 01:41:56,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's wrong.

1985
01:41:58,474 --> 01:42:00,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki was just being an ass.

1986
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:02,736
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm right.

1987
01:42:03,836 --> 01:42:04,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Moral of the story, you're right.

1988
01:42:05,136 --> 01:42:06,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly, as always.

1989
01:42:06,557 --> 01:42:07,017
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm hungry.

1990
01:42:07,337 --> 01:42:13,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I suppose this is an idea we can continue to do in the future if, you know, we want to take another week off or whatever, because that happens sometimes.

1991
01:42:14,039 --> 01:42:14,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Weeks off are nice.

1992
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:15,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, weeks off rule.

1993
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,961
[SPEAKER_22]: I get to, like, sleep, go to bed early one night, I guess, or something.

1994
01:42:18,981 --> 01:42:19,101
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

1995
01:42:20,518 --> 01:42:28,934
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe I can convince Dan to have a barbecue and I guess I can have, you know, barbecue tofu or something since I'm having, you know, barbecue up some shrimp for me or something.

1996
01:42:28,974 --> 01:42:29,896
[SPEAKER_22]: Bye, everybody.

1997
01:42:29,956 --> 01:42:30,437
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for coming.

1998
01:42:30,537 --> 01:42:30,938
[SPEAKER_22]: Bye.

1999
01:42:33,843 --> 01:42:40,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, when we're doing this here at Golfland and pre-taping, we can't really interact with our chatroom right now.

2000
01:42:41,031 --> 01:42:50,021
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't experience, like I'm sure SoCalKicks is in the chatroom right now and he's promoting USA and yelling at us when we're dissing Konami in any way.

2001
01:42:50,601 --> 01:42:54,786
[SPEAKER_04]: And Twen probably has some new Hell remix that he's distributing amongst the folks.

2002
01:42:55,106 --> 01:42:57,128
[SPEAKER_22]: And Slinky's probably just very bitter that he's not here.

2003
01:43:12,003 --> 01:43:13,244
[SPEAKER_22]: We miss you, Slinky!

2004
01:43:15,225 --> 01:43:15,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten more minutes.

2005
01:43:15,725 --> 01:43:17,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what else is there to say right now.

2006
01:43:17,466 --> 01:43:18,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other Bimani news going on?

2007
01:43:18,987 --> 01:43:28,612
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't eaten anything today except a cupcake and some chocolate-covered espresso beans and this, like, orange creamsicle Dutch ice drink thingy.

2008
01:43:29,212 --> 01:43:29,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Yum.

2009
01:43:30,313 --> 01:43:31,293
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm nutritious today.

2010
01:43:31,313 --> 01:43:32,494
[SPEAKER_22]: That's probably why I have a headache.

2011
01:43:32,514 --> 01:43:32,914
[SPEAKER_22]: My God.

2012
01:43:32,934 --> 01:43:36,856
[SPEAKER_22]: I have Evangelion Redeath, though.

2013
01:43:36,896 --> 01:43:37,396
[SPEAKER_22]: That's awesome.

2014
01:43:37,416 --> 01:43:38,737
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to watch the hell out of that tonight.

2015
01:43:39,858 --> 01:43:40,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.

2016
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:41,710
[SPEAKER_22]: and Steve.

2017
01:43:42,170 --> 01:43:52,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Apparently, though, I think that the lovely people at Gravity, who basically made Ragnarok Online, has blocked the servers.

2018
01:43:52,774 --> 01:43:53,775
[SPEAKER_22]: I could not get on.

2019
01:43:53,835 --> 01:43:54,895
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to try again.

2020
01:43:55,455 --> 01:44:01,518
[SPEAKER_22]: I can only read the kana where it says, server, word, not works.

2021
01:44:02,498 --> 01:44:06,022
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I need to, you know, figure out the rest of it out.

2022
01:44:06,102 --> 01:44:10,886
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I'll have an update on my addiction online RPG.

2023
01:44:11,006 --> 01:44:12,808
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yay.

2024
01:44:12,848 --> 01:44:13,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

2025
01:44:13,469 --> 01:44:15,050
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure everyone's so interested.

2026
01:44:16,314 --> 01:44:21,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, if people are online and they're not listening to our show and they're not listening to my music anymore, I don't know why they wouldn't be.

2027
01:44:22,415 --> 01:44:24,436
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, those are fun things to do.

2028
01:44:24,476 --> 01:44:26,296
[SPEAKER_22]: That's right.

2029
01:44:26,436 --> 01:44:31,817
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is one reason we are on a modem-friendly stream, even though we know a lot of people are on DSL these days.

2030
01:44:32,097 --> 01:44:38,439
[SPEAKER_04]: We reach out to the folks still on modem, and those on DSL can still do other stuff.

2031
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:40,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Their bandwidth's not being sucked down.

2032
01:44:40,339 --> 01:44:40,940
[SPEAKER_22]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

2033
01:44:58,456 --> 01:44:59,997
[SPEAKER_22]: As we get odd looks.

2034
01:45:00,057 --> 01:45:06,962
[SPEAKER_04]: We were trying to, during the last segment when you were in the office, we were trying to say things to our Japanese listeners because we noticed that there are people in Japan listening every week.

2035
01:45:07,262 --> 01:45:10,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to say something, like a hello or something, but none of us knew Japanese.

2036
01:45:10,684 --> 01:45:11,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have anything you want to say?

2037
01:45:14,545 --> 01:45:19,427
[SPEAKER_22]: Nihonjin no minasan, domo arigatou gozaimashita.

2038
01:45:20,428 --> 01:45:23,149
[SPEAKER_04]: She just told me to go to hell.

2039
01:45:23,769 --> 01:45:33,073
[SPEAKER_22]: I think if I said it as properly as I could, I said everyone of our Japanese listeners, we thank you very much for listening and please keep listening.

2040
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:34,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And not just Japan, but worldwide.

2041
01:45:35,154 --> 01:45:36,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada, we got a lot of listeners.

2042
01:45:36,434 --> 01:45:37,935
[SPEAKER_22]: Unfortunately, I forgot my French.

2043
01:45:38,735 --> 01:45:42,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, give a shout out to our Canadian moderators, yo, for DDR Freak.

2044
01:45:42,817 --> 01:45:45,778
[SPEAKER_04]: And Europe, all sorts.

2045
01:45:45,818 --> 01:45:46,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Chile, of course.

2046
01:45:46,398 --> 01:45:47,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't forget Chile.

2047
01:45:47,479 --> 01:45:50,700
[SPEAKER_22]: And to all of our moderators in Alabama and the Mideast.

2048
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:54,062
[SPEAKER_22]: And for all the people who didn't, you know, the moderators who didn't get to go, we missed you there.

2049
01:45:55,802 --> 01:46:00,044
[SPEAKER_22]: I just have to say right now, mad love to my fellow DDR Freak moderators.

2050
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:01,625
[SPEAKER_22]: I had a wonderful time with you guys.

2051
01:46:03,635 --> 01:46:08,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And Matt loved Melody for coming from out of town and entertaining me and being the guest on last week's show.

2052
01:46:08,802 --> 01:46:12,387
[SPEAKER_22]: That was good that Melody came and I got to talk to her on the phone.

2053
01:46:12,827 --> 01:46:13,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, that's right.

2054
01:46:13,728 --> 01:46:15,731
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in the mall and talked to Melody.

2055
01:46:15,771 --> 01:46:18,955
[SPEAKER_22]: We were at a strip mall, in the cab on the way to the strip mall.

2056
01:46:19,984 --> 01:46:38,112
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a support group because her boyfriend was out of town and one of my best friends was out of town in Vegas so we had to have a support group of we're pouting because we're not in Vegas time but I'm going to get to Vegas at some point in the next few months so just a warning to you Vegas folk, I will take the tape recorder.

2057
01:46:38,412 --> 01:46:38,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately...

2058
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:49,898
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't coordinate it, we just weren't thinking I guess and didn't get Jamie the tape recorder to take with her to Vegas so she could do some interviews down there like she did an awesome job on the Dollar Mini interviews a couple episodes back.

2059
01:46:51,727 --> 01:46:56,249
[SPEAKER_22]: I did make a mention to a couple of my fellow moderators that I'd love to have them on the show.

2060
01:46:56,509 --> 01:46:57,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Rad, good.

2061
01:46:57,429 --> 01:46:59,390
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, of course, I always want to have Mel back on.

2062
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:05,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a possibility in the future we'll have a few of the members from RTF on the show in the future.

2063
01:47:05,112 --> 01:47:06,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very cool.

2064
01:47:06,113 --> 01:47:06,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping so, too.

2065
01:47:07,033 --> 01:47:08,314
[SPEAKER_22]: I would love to get Rain on.

2066
01:47:08,534 --> 01:47:15,817
[SPEAKER_22]: I would love to get, you know, I would love to just have an RTF show, have the guys there, have, like, you know, my Step Squad people here.

2067
01:47:15,837 --> 01:47:16,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

2068
01:47:16,617 --> 01:47:19,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if we can't get you guys here, you know what?

2069
01:47:19,158 --> 01:47:19,939
[SPEAKER_04]: We travel too.

2070
01:47:20,259 --> 01:47:22,820
[SPEAKER_04]: As is shown from Jamie going out of town last week, going to Vegas.

2071
01:47:23,441 --> 01:47:24,701
[SPEAKER_04]: We might go out to SoCal.

2072
01:47:24,881 --> 01:47:26,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I might be going to SoCal in a few weeks.

2073
01:47:26,922 --> 01:47:28,603
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be doing some taping down there.

2074
01:47:28,663 --> 01:47:33,166
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be sneaking off in Rob's trunk a la, you know, Spritle from, you know...

2075
01:47:34,082 --> 01:47:35,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Speed Racer Anybody want to be Jim Jim?

2076
01:47:35,943 --> 01:47:39,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the number one guest there Excuse me, I have hiccups Semi-live radio, ladies and gentlemen Vanilla Ice

2077
01:48:02,014 --> 01:48:03,034
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm dying, I'm dying.

2078
01:48:07,555 --> 01:48:13,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself, Melody, and Mel B, and my boyfriend Glenn, we're all going to try and go down to the Price is Right.

2079
01:48:13,897 --> 01:48:15,917
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll see what happens.

2080
01:48:15,937 --> 01:48:17,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been there before and I had a blast.

2081
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:21,359
[SPEAKER_22]: The Price is Right factored into the trip to Vegas.

2082
01:48:22,259 --> 01:48:27,725
[SPEAKER_22]: It has to do with Monday morning with all of us piled up in J-Dog's room watching The Price is Right.

2083
01:48:28,405 --> 01:48:29,707
[SPEAKER_22]: Hollering at this one woman.

2084
01:48:29,727 --> 01:48:32,409
[SPEAKER_22]: We're like, lose, lose, you stupid bitch, lose, lose.

2085
01:48:32,549 --> 01:48:33,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me guess, she won the showcase.

2086
01:48:33,951 --> 01:48:34,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Two cars.

2087
01:48:35,653 --> 01:48:36,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, one car in her normal round.

2088
01:48:36,974 --> 01:48:39,536
[SPEAKER_22]: She got a dollar on the wheel.

2089
01:48:40,817 --> 01:48:42,137
[SPEAKER_22]: And then came in again.

2090
01:48:42,757 --> 01:48:47,599
[SPEAKER_22]: She won the showcase, which was another car, a motorcycle, and kitchen appliances.

2091
01:48:47,619 --> 01:48:48,899
[SPEAKER_22]: And this woman was just stupid.

2092
01:48:48,979 --> 01:48:50,319
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what you get for yelling at her.

2093
01:48:50,339 --> 01:48:50,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you get.

2094
01:48:50,859 --> 01:48:51,399
[SPEAKER_04]: That's karma.

2095
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,320
[SPEAKER_22]: We're laughing.

2096
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:53,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Karma.

2097
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:56,561
[SPEAKER_22]: Taxes, taxes, taxes, taxes.

2098
01:48:57,321 --> 01:49:01,162
[SPEAKER_22]: So, that was just the funniest thing hearing, you know, shouts from the bed.

2099
01:49:01,442 --> 01:49:02,802
[SPEAKER_22]: Lose you stupid bitch, I hope you die.

2100
01:49:03,662 --> 01:49:06,223
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny is that I can hear somebody playing Kakumei from here.

2101
01:49:07,219 --> 01:49:13,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard that song so damn many times I can hear it from here.

2102
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:15,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear how loud Power Power is here now?

2103
01:49:16,305 --> 01:49:17,065
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I love it.

2104
01:49:17,085 --> 01:49:18,386
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hear it like way up here.

2105
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:20,387
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 10 times as much as it used to be.

2106
01:49:20,587 --> 01:49:22,228
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just happy as long as I don't hear D2R.

2107
01:49:23,249 --> 01:49:24,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard Night of Fire earlier.

2108
01:49:25,911 --> 01:49:26,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, I hear Made of Fire.

2109
01:49:27,432 --> 01:49:29,632
[SPEAKER_22]: Made of Fire, I'm made of fire.

2110
01:49:29,732 --> 01:49:31,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to tell you a story about Pear Pear.

2111
01:49:31,853 --> 01:49:32,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2112
01:49:32,413 --> 01:49:37,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I was sitting down across from it, and normally the way they had it, they had it solo, you could barely hear it when you're playing.

2113
01:49:38,296 --> 01:49:41,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sitting there, and I'm singing along to Eurobeat, and I don't even notice this.

2114
01:49:41,877 --> 01:49:47,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end of the song, I go up there and I play it, and I'm like, I come back, and I sit down, and I'm like, you guys, it's really loud.

2115
01:49:47,799 --> 01:49:48,680
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

2116
01:50:05,376 --> 01:50:06,316
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't play Guitar Freak, so.

2117
01:50:07,577 --> 01:50:10,197
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing, that video right there, the Evangelion, it is an anime.

2118
01:50:10,217 --> 01:50:12,358
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminds me of something I just got about two weeks ago.

2119
01:50:12,978 --> 01:50:17,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you might want to check your local grocery outlet, as I do every now and then.

2120
01:50:17,499 --> 01:50:18,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Grocery outlet.

2121
01:50:18,339 --> 01:50:20,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I found the entire series of Bubblegum Crisis there for $2.

2122
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Dub or sub?

2123
01:50:24,241 --> 01:50:24,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Both.

2124
01:50:25,201 --> 01:50:25,521
[SPEAKER_22]: Awesome.

2125
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:25,941
[SPEAKER_22]: DVDs?

2126
01:50:26,142 --> 01:50:26,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2127
01:50:27,182 --> 01:50:27,822
[SPEAKER_22]: I will check.

2128
01:50:28,262 --> 01:50:31,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I already have, you know, two of the LaserDiscs.

2129
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:34,846
[SPEAKER_22]: and Bubblegum Crash and LaserDisc.

2130
01:50:34,906 --> 01:50:45,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying though, recently the one down in Rockland here on SunEyes has been getting all kinds of DVDs and books, good books, computer games even.

2131
01:50:46,131 --> 01:50:47,151
[SPEAKER_08]: All kinds of stuff, just $2.

2132
01:50:47,431 --> 01:50:49,332
[SPEAKER_22]: I will check it out.

2133
01:50:49,372 --> 01:50:50,852
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for the info.

2134
01:50:51,233 --> 01:50:54,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Any of you who live anywhere near here... You heard it on Orange Sounds Radio first, y'all.

2135
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,765
[SPEAKER_22]: So do we have any more things to say to our listeners?

2136
01:50:57,886 --> 01:50:59,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hand it back to Rob now.

2137
01:50:59,610 --> 01:50:59,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all.

2138
01:51:00,131 --> 01:51:00,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

2139
01:51:01,053 --> 01:51:03,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So did you hear the news about why Jamie was in the office for so long?

2140
01:51:04,232 --> 01:51:06,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I was eavesdropping, yes, so I did hear a little bit.

2141
01:51:06,854 --> 01:51:07,394
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you hear?

2142
01:51:07,934 --> 01:51:09,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard something about a tourney.

2143
01:51:09,495 --> 01:51:09,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2144
01:51:10,776 --> 01:51:17,161
[SPEAKER_22]: It is official, once again, aiming for the November-ish range, you know, not committing to a day E yet.

2145
01:51:17,381 --> 01:51:23,905
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't probably want to avoid Turkey weekend, or maybe not, because a lot of people will be off school Turkey weekend, so maybe that's something to look at.

2146
01:51:24,005 --> 01:51:24,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2147
01:51:24,345 --> 01:51:25,486
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.

2148
01:51:25,986 --> 01:51:30,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking from experience last year, went on vacation, a lot of vacation.

2149
01:51:30,309 --> 01:51:31,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

2150
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:32,931
[SPEAKER_09]: The tickets to Turkey are really expensive.

2151
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:35,959
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a dork.

2152
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:40,564
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm thinking, you know, either weekend before or weekend after Turkey.

2153
01:51:41,525 --> 01:51:47,030
[SPEAKER_22]: As in, like, not the ones immediately next to it, but, like, way after or right preceding, you know.

2154
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:48,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

2155
01:51:49,133 --> 01:51:49,493
[SPEAKER_22]: Hopefully.

2156
01:51:50,154 --> 01:51:51,014
[SPEAKER_22]: But it is official.

2157
01:51:51,055 --> 01:51:53,757
[SPEAKER_22]: We will be having tournament here at Roseville Golf Land.

2158
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:55,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So badass.

2159
01:51:55,919 --> 01:51:58,082
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can we talk about to close the show out here with?

2160
01:51:58,615 --> 01:52:00,196
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a really bad headache.

2161
01:52:00,416 --> 01:52:00,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2162
01:52:00,737 --> 01:52:01,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Why's that?

2163
01:52:01,457 --> 01:52:01,857
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

2164
01:52:01,877 --> 01:52:02,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Just everything.

2165
01:52:02,418 --> 01:52:04,559
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably because I haven't hardly eaten anything and haven't touched anything.

2166
01:52:04,579 --> 01:52:06,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we need to go eat before we go home.

2167
01:52:06,481 --> 01:52:06,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to eat.

2168
01:52:06,961 --> 01:52:08,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to go eat then.

2169
01:52:08,983 --> 01:52:12,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go like, you know, on a rampage and, you know, be cannibals or something.

2170
01:52:13,866 --> 01:52:37,273
[SPEAKER_04]: When you guys post something on Sack of Money Not just Sack of Money Because it's not just going to be a Sacramento thing It's going to be everywhere We'll post on Sack of Money We'll post on DDR Freak Hell, you email us at OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com We'll come spam your local board Even if you're in like Taiwan We're going to plug our tournament on your board Because it's going to be the biggest damn thing ever We'll have to use one of those online translator services To be able to post My horrible, horrible Babelfish

2171
01:52:38,231 --> 01:52:41,354
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I found a really nice Japanese one, but I'll be posting that on our forums.

2172
01:52:41,374 --> 01:52:43,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it big and shiny, you know, so I can find it.

2173
01:52:43,275 --> 01:52:43,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on.

2174
01:52:43,816 --> 01:52:47,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, now we got a... Because I'm retarded and I can't browse.

2175
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll know, trust us.

2176
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:51,582
[SPEAKER_04]: About that translator, yeah, I really like it.

2177
01:52:51,662 --> 01:52:52,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.

2178
01:52:52,723 --> 01:52:53,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the new one?

2179
01:52:53,344 --> 01:52:53,904
[SPEAKER_04]: The new one you found?

2180
01:52:53,924 --> 01:52:55,345
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell them about this.

2181
01:52:55,566 --> 01:52:59,809
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't remember the site off the top of my head, but it's actually a Japanese translation program.

2182
01:53:00,189 --> 01:53:05,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, translation website, I mean, as in a Japanese native site that will translate...

2183
01:53:06,154 --> 01:53:09,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Japanese text to English nearly flawlessly if you run a page through it.

2184
01:53:10,376 --> 01:53:14,998
[SPEAKER_22]: It will leave the kanji, katakana, hiragana up and put English text underneath it.

2185
01:53:15,078 --> 01:53:16,979
[SPEAKER_22]: And you can even read fan fiction with that thing.

2186
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:17,499
[SPEAKER_22]: It's so good.

2187
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:17,919
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, cool.

2188
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:24,562
[SPEAKER_22]: On top of that, it also translates English to Japanese in a fairly reasonable pattern so you can actually put something on there and look relatively literate.

2189
01:53:24,963 --> 01:53:25,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

2190
01:53:25,823 --> 01:53:28,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys heard the news about why Jamie was in the office for so long?

2191
01:53:29,905 --> 01:53:32,006
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I understand, she was talking with the tech, right?

2192
01:53:33,066 --> 01:53:34,407
[SPEAKER_22]: We are going to be having a tournament here.

2193
01:53:35,436 --> 01:53:39,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Winner, because I just spent a good 10 minutes talking with Mr. Tech Guy to fix every Bimani machine.

2194
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:44,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm like, I was talking to him and it's like, hey, you know the Soul Calibur is broken.

2195
01:53:44,923 --> 01:53:46,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And since I have you, would you mind coming with me?

2196
01:53:47,044 --> 01:53:49,126
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a nice tour of the arcade I'd like to take you on.

2197
01:53:50,027 --> 01:53:50,607
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that's sweet.

2198
01:53:51,548 --> 01:53:53,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, hang on, let me get my clipboard.

2199
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,291
[SPEAKER_07]: It was lots and lots of happy fun.

2200
01:53:56,731 --> 01:54:00,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I have to say, I want to give him a major kudo.

2201
01:54:01,175 --> 01:54:02,836
[SPEAKER_22]: Power to Dwayne.

2202
01:54:02,856 --> 01:54:04,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Dwayne, the greatest tech ever.

2203
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:07,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We give Roseville Golf Land a lot of crap on this show.

2204
01:54:08,484 --> 01:54:09,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe a little bit.

2205
01:54:10,125 --> 01:54:12,286
[SPEAKER_22]: Really, this is the best arcade in town.

2206
01:54:12,446 --> 01:54:13,847
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the best arcade in town.

2207
01:54:14,147 --> 01:54:15,587
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the great places to play.

2208
01:54:15,748 --> 01:54:22,230
[SPEAKER_07]: But someone should let Shiggle Boss know that the people at RVGL don't actually know what he's talking about in regards to 4th Plus.

2209
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:22,890
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true, yeah.

2210
01:54:22,991 --> 01:54:28,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I talked to Dwayne down there, and he's like, you know, I just found out about that today, which leads me to believe that Jamie told him.

2211
01:54:29,013 --> 01:54:29,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

2212
01:54:32,342 --> 01:54:33,843
[SPEAKER_22]: I mentioned it because I thought he might already know.

2213
01:54:33,863 --> 01:54:37,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I just thought I'd grab the mic here.

2214
01:54:37,927 --> 01:54:41,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about why Jamie was in the office for so long.

2215
01:54:41,189 --> 01:54:42,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

2216
01:54:43,811 --> 01:54:46,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I did my DWI.

2217
01:54:46,774 --> 01:54:47,914
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, I have no DWI.

2218
01:54:48,435 --> 01:54:51,277
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so we're going to have a happy, fun tournament.

2219
01:54:51,357 --> 01:54:52,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like SCAT 2?

2220
01:54:53,839 --> 01:54:55,981
[SPEAKER_22]: First and foremost, it will not be called SCAT 2.

2221
01:54:56,321 --> 01:54:56,862
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be RVGO 1.

2222
01:55:00,023 --> 01:55:01,424
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's so generic.

2223
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:02,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Tad?

2224
01:55:02,405 --> 01:55:05,068
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to plan a clever name.

2225
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:13,115
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to think of a better name than RBGL1 so we don't be like Swiggle1, Miggle1, and Kamiggle1 or whatever the hell.

2226
01:55:13,175 --> 01:55:18,080
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I love how we try so hard to make this a national show yet we keep talking Bay Area topics.

2227
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:21,583
[SPEAKER_22]: We will not have a tournament named after crap, okay?

2228
01:55:23,462 --> 01:55:24,843
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's what made us unique!

2229
01:55:25,083 --> 01:55:28,004
[SPEAKER_22]: We will not have a tournament named after crap.

2230
01:55:28,104 --> 01:55:29,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we could call it, like, SCAB.

2231
01:55:30,085 --> 01:55:31,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Sacramental Tournament in Bowling.

2232
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:33,286
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, SCAB.

2233
01:55:33,606 --> 01:55:37,608
[SPEAKER_22]: We are not having a tournament named after bodily functions.

2234
01:55:37,948 --> 01:55:39,789
[SPEAKER_22]: As in scab forming or feces.

2235
01:55:39,809 --> 01:55:42,690
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just call it SCT2.

2236
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:44,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the final word because Jamie said so.

2237
01:55:46,351 --> 01:55:49,312
[SPEAKER_04]: How about, like, Sacramental's...

2238
01:55:52,441 --> 01:55:56,724
[SPEAKER_04]: and Upstanding Citizens... I don't know.

2239
01:55:56,864 --> 01:56:07,272
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob, how about we call it SackMyMoney.com Prevents... Prevents... Prevents Crap.

2240
01:56:07,312 --> 01:56:08,012
[SPEAKER_22]: There we go.

2241
01:56:08,112 --> 01:56:09,834
[SPEAKER_07]: SackMyMoney Prevents Tournament.

2242
01:56:10,154 --> 01:56:12,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're not going to play the machine, damn it.

2243
01:56:12,556 --> 01:56:14,257
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the Orange Lounge Owns You Tourney?

2244
01:56:19,029 --> 01:56:22,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, this is going to be a long, fat discussion on the board.

2245
01:56:22,234 --> 01:56:22,715
[SPEAKER_07]: You know that.

2246
01:56:23,016 --> 01:56:27,302
[SPEAKER_22]: How about sakbemoney.com presents The Tournament.

2247
01:56:29,145 --> 01:56:30,708
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I need to know is The Tournament.

2248
01:56:31,508 --> 01:56:33,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you know we've got to do something cool, though.

2249
01:56:34,031 --> 01:56:41,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we made ourselves unique last year at the Folsom Game Room, FTR, by doing freaking SCAT.

2250
01:56:41,981 --> 01:56:43,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Sacramento's Cosplay and Turning.

2251
01:56:44,064 --> 01:56:48,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, everybody made fun of us for that, but it's still, everybody remembers SCAT.

2252
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:49,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Who the hell remembers Miggle 2.5?

2253
01:56:53,252 --> 01:56:53,732
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll see.

2254
01:56:53,872 --> 01:56:54,553
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll see what happens.

2255
01:56:54,853 --> 01:57:05,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, incidentally, for those of you out there, Miggle is Milpina Golf Lands, Figgle is Sunnyvale Golf Lands, Shiggle is Southern Hills Golf Lands, CVGL is Central Valley Golf Lands, etc., etc.

2256
01:57:07,313 --> 01:57:12,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it looks like they're shutting down Golfland right now, so it's just a matter of seconds before we get kicked out.

2257
01:57:13,517 --> 01:57:15,918
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll work on the tournament details, and we'll have that for you.

2258
01:57:15,958 --> 01:57:17,639
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll post on all the local boards about that.

2259
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:25,243
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, this is a national tournament, and if you have any tournaments in your area you want to talk about on this show, drop us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

2260
01:57:25,283 --> 01:57:29,706
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a tape player, a microphone-type kit that you can take to your local arcade and...

2261
01:57:30,126 --> 01:57:34,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Film the tournament, or, you know, I say film, but I mean, you know, tape the tournament and get interviews.

2262
01:57:34,208 --> 01:57:34,868
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to hear it.

2263
01:57:34,908 --> 01:57:38,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a five to ten minute package on your local tournament, and we'll air it here on the show.

2264
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:41,372
[SPEAKER_22]: Our listeners just missed the anguish screams as the mania was shut down.

2265
01:57:41,392 --> 01:57:42,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the anguish screams, the song's getting turned off.

2266
01:57:43,233 --> 01:57:46,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, it's time for us to end the show, so you got any final thoughts?

2267
01:57:46,714 --> 01:57:47,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final thoughts?

2268
01:57:47,195 --> 01:57:47,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, Ted.

2269
01:57:48,035 --> 01:57:50,016
[SPEAKER_22]: My final thought is feed me, Simo.

2270
01:57:50,216 --> 01:57:51,217
[SPEAKER_22]: Feed me all night long.

2271
01:57:52,737 --> 01:57:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is thanks to everybody for listening to this very experimental issue.

2272
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:56,199
[SPEAKER_22]: Shine get!

2273
01:57:56,219 --> 01:57:57,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Shine get!

2274
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:57,660
[SPEAKER_22]: Shine get!

2275
01:58:02,753 --> 01:58:05,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to everyone for listening to this very experimental show.

2276
01:58:06,055 --> 01:58:07,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a really ugly chick.

2277
01:58:07,175 --> 01:58:08,116
[SPEAKER_05]: She looked like a horse.

2278
01:58:08,476 --> 01:58:09,036
[SPEAKER_05]: She scared me.

2279
01:58:09,797 --> 01:58:11,578
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the scariest thing in the world.

2280
01:58:11,638 --> 01:58:13,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I lost my combo there, dude.

2281
01:58:14,499 --> 01:58:15,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last words from Punk Night?

2282
01:58:16,861 --> 01:58:17,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurts.

2283
01:58:18,221 --> 01:58:19,422
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to plug your CD real fast?

2284
01:58:22,009 --> 01:58:24,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I don't have any copies made of my CD.

2285
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:25,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

2286
01:58:25,371 --> 01:58:25,711
[SPEAKER_09]: You lose.

2287
01:58:28,132 --> 01:58:34,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of lost all the files that were for the cover and everything, but I will be making a revision.

2288
01:58:36,115 --> 01:58:37,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, fine, and I'll plug mine.

2289
01:58:37,876 --> 01:58:43,278
[SPEAKER_05]: You can listen to my music, Loki, which is also known as Nightmare Hunter on mp3.com.

2290
01:58:43,579 --> 01:58:48,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's www.mp3.com slash nightmare underscore hunter, and that's it.

2291
01:58:48,621 --> 01:58:49,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on.

2292
01:58:49,693 --> 01:58:51,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we gotta hurry up and end this show.

2293
01:58:51,595 --> 01:58:53,036
[SPEAKER_18]: The final word needs to be made from Dan.

2294
01:58:53,056 --> 01:58:53,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

2295
01:58:53,517 --> 01:58:54,578
[SPEAKER_04]: The final word from Dan.

2296
01:58:54,698 --> 01:58:56,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, we're gonna go over and get the final word from Dan.

2297
01:58:56,579 --> 01:58:57,180
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my sweetie fiance.

2298
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:58,181
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're ending this show.

2299
01:58:58,201 --> 01:58:59,082
[SPEAKER_22]: He called me insane.

2300
01:58:59,402 --> 01:58:59,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2301
01:58:59,842 --> 01:59:00,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Final word from Dan.

2302
01:59:01,884 --> 01:59:02,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to go.

2303
01:59:03,946 --> 01:59:04,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I suck my balls.

2304
01:59:05,708 --> 01:59:06,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, one more time.

2305
01:59:06,569 --> 01:59:08,170
[SPEAKER_04]: No one can handle my crotch, baby.

2306
01:59:09,131 --> 01:59:09,852
[SPEAKER_22]: He waved at the camera.

2307
01:59:09,872 --> 01:59:10,552
[SPEAKER_04]: He said suck his balls.

2308
01:59:10,873 --> 01:59:12,614
[SPEAKER_22]: And apparently no one can handle Ryan's crotch.

2309
01:59:12,634 --> 01:59:13,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, the end.

2310
