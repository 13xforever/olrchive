145010	145570	Yes.
147091	148252	No, no, no.
148272	149173	10.5 was the one at Golfland.
149333	149813	That wasn't really 11.
151814	157819	And then 11 was the week that Jamie came back and 12 was... Well, then we're not going to have an episode 13.
158419	159640	We're skipping it like hotels do.
160801	161601	You want to make this episode 14?

179105	182347	Please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
183288	185629	Hey, don't forget about Harvey.
185649	188871	He used to know... Your imaginary friend?
189471	191032	Didn't you see that movie with Harvey?
191352	191613	No.
192573	196135	Okay, I have to give a proper hi.
196215	198216	Hi, give me caffeine and money.
198997	199137	Now.
200094	204057	You are tuned into the Vamani Scene's most stupendous radio station of all things Vamani.
205118	208000	It's a small, intimate house tonight, but we're going to have fun with this anyway.
208380	211722	We are joined by a very large panel tonight.
211882	212763	A panel of one.
212903	213463	Say hello.
213564	214564	DarkSakura.
214664	215505	I hate nature!
215965	218027	Tonight's just a technical mess-up show.
218047	218507	I hate nature!
218927	219848	I wish the world would explode!
220088	221149	And then I could take over hell!
221929	224391	I'm really out of it going into tonight's show, by the way.
226092	227493	Say hello, everybody, to Loki.
228594	229335	Hello, everybody.
231673	232414	Say hi again.
232774	233274	Hello again.
234595	235396	Who's again?
235496	236457	Oh, we have a doorbell.
236537	237277	Somebody else is here.
237998	238898	I guess we'll see who that is.
240059	241000	We'll be talking to everybody.
241020	241860	They better have money.
242781	244462	We will take bribes to be on the show.
245623	246424	You know what?
246444	248105	Why don't we just say the hell with Orange Lounge?
248125	251688	We'll just be two hours of just us just kind of ranting about everything crappy.
253669	254349	Oh, it's Dave.
254450	258572	Say hello everybody to the hell victory of...
261525	263407	Yeah.
263427	266390	We'll be talking to everybody a little more a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
267131	268252	So that people can go pee.
269494	270955	Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?
272437	273158	What garbage deal.
273658	274079	All right.
274399	276121	We'll get to those FUs of the week.
276161	279264	If you want to send me your FUs of the week, just join our chat room.
279284	282468	You're just going to join any Other Side IRC chat.
283559	290442	server, like irc.egheads.org, and you're going to join panel, channel, panel?
291083	292944	God damn it, I can't do this tonight.
293244	293824	I'm faking it.
293864	297706	You will join channel, ddr, oh wait, wrong one.
298746	300627	See, you can't even do it either.
301568	304069	There's somebody else on the hostess show tonight, alright.

320380	321241	Hi, how are you doing?
321581	324764	I don't say much, though, because I'm too busy trying to fuck up this show.
325344	327666	So, any other thoughts from anybody else?
327946	328267	Hello?
328947	331189	Nobody here has a single solitary thought in their head.
331209	332110	Mike, big rules.
332770	333431	Bangles suck.
334292	334632	Football.
337116	339838	Let's start with some Sana, shall we?
340238	340419	Wee!
377133	382454	Casting by No one cares to start Can you see me fall apart?
382514	386315	Do you share my frozen memories?
386355	388435	Setting down Leaving me alone
422057	422942	Thanks for watching!
551929	553089	That was rather abstract.
553129	555190	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
555490	557070	I can't even remember if that was the promo.
557090	562171	Somebody requested a promo that they sent, and I wasn't sure if it was that one or the other one in the directory, so I just played that one.
565212	566852	It was kind of like an abstraction of your voice.
566912	567452	It was paint.
567572	568352	It was modern art.
568812	569473	I like that.
570173	570713	Anywho.
571313	572353	I sound cooler than that.
573293	573994	That was cool, though.
574014	577434	It was like you were swallowing a butterfly.
577634	578434	Orange Lounge.
584287	586729	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
597731	606813	The obvious news about the new mix, the Max USA, is that one of the new licensed songs has been confirmed.
607033	612474	So we do know that there will be a song, and I'm trying to pull up the full name of the song here.
612514	613834	I forgot it off the top of my head.
613894	614274	Thank you.
614994	615295	Thank you.
615335	618615	It's called Dark Black Forest Short Trip, and it's by Steve Reiner.
619195	621396	And this news was confirmed through his site.
621496	625437	He said on his official site, hey, I've got this song going on DDR Max soon.
625497	627397	Actually, it was like a Dutch site, though, so it was more like...
628035	635491	you know, oh, oh, it was German, so I was like, ah, we've got, DJ Ranma S, I know, for Winnership, no.
638712	641114	You know what, that's so, I think it's pretty cool.
641314	643916	I've heard a little bit of it and the song is really cool.
643976	646879	We're going to play a demo version of that song for you in a little bit.
646899	649521	We've got like a two minute demo mix of that song we're going to play for you.
649841	655485	This probably isn't the four minute real media file you've seen floating out the internet elsewhere.
655826	658248	This is another take on the song.
658288	661690	So we don't know which version exactly is going to be in DDR, but we'll see.
662091	664953	We do know that this song in one way or another is going to show up in DDR Max.
666795	671260	Sorry for asking, but when exactly does Max USA get released?
671340	684735	I don't know I believe the release date tentatively right now is November 5th I had been hearing that it was supposed to be right after Thanksgiving for the first day of the Christmas shopping season
685263	687664	So we've heard everything in November.
687724	689564	However, I actually pulled up an article here.
689604	693485	This comes from SoCalKicks' site, available at SoCalKicks.com.
693825	702207	And he actually had a chance to talk with Jason Enos, who is the, if you're online on any of the forums, I'm sure you know him as the Konami of America representative.
702767	706728	And they talked about a few couple things about DDR Max USA, including...
707308	709711	Foot Ratings will be in DDR Max USA.
710072	716959	If you remember one big bitch about DDR Max, the Japanese version when it first came out and hit arcades, that they replaced it with that Groove Radar.
717340	724308	And while that radar is cool, it doesn't really tell you how hard a song is on a scale, you know, of the katas and everything, so...
726894	740584	But, you know, the one good thing about the Groove Radar is that it does show you what type of song you're going to play, if you're stronger at doing lots of jumps or if you're stronger at doing running moves.
741325	742626	That is one good thing about the Groove Radar.
743006	749351	So you can still say, oh, these are the nine-footers, these are the katas I have to pass.
749371	751052	It's going to make you run all over the place.
751232	752753	Yes.
753414	756276	Next thing, it will append with DDRconomics.
757817	759257	Not sure how this is going to work.
759677	770219	I have a hard time fathoming this as being a disc change, just like the kind of disc change you would see when third mix, the Japanese third mix, you could put in second and first mix and play things on the new interface.
770239	771499	It actually is possible.
771599	785242	Maybe that is what they're going to do, but it seems kind of... If you think about it... Between a PlayStation 2 game and a PlayStation 1 game, it seems a little... Well, if you think about it this way, all they have to do is actually load the game engine itself into memory and then have it run songs off of the disc.
787569	788730	Maybe, maybe that's what they're going to do.
788750	789490	That would be very cool.
789690	790711	That was actually something I said.
790751	794672	I remember getting on a forum saying, hey, that would be awesome if they could do something like that at Append.
794712	800515	Especially, I would have liked to have seen it, not only that, but Konomics append the USA mix, but I guess we'll see.
800715	801435	It's a smart move.
801495	803156	It'll help them make more money for people who don't have it.
803376	809919	Unfortunately, they're still keeping some of the same songs on DDR Max USA that they had on Konomics and on DDR USA.
813769	815230	Will there be freezeros and edits?
815250	815650	I would think so.
815670	822514	Yeah, if it's based off the Max Japanese, you can do freezes and the Max Japanese editing, so I don't see why I wouldn't be able to do it in the U.S.,
841626	848503	And one more thing, it probably won't be like Konomics, but will the edits be able to be played on the machines in the arcade?
849272	851454	No, because they're region coded, so it ain't going to work.
851794	852234	Damn it.
853095	853936	There is one thing, though.
853956	856478	Couldn't you take Konomics edits and play them on a Forth Mix machine?
856538	857018	No, you couldn't.
857438	857859	I don't remember.
857879	858139	I never tried.
858159	865565	The only thing that I would think might even be possible, and this is what I'm wondering if anyone's tried with Konomics, there's a little program for people who have a Dex drive.
866465	870448	There's basically a Dex editor where you can change the region coding on your memory file.
870529	870969	Doesn't work.
871977	874278	Because here's why it doesn't work.
875039	880782	You can change, there's two things for edits that, you know, kind of set them out to work in a machine or not.
880842	886865	You have region coding, and then you also have, it keeps track of what mix the actual thing was on.
886905	895689	Like I took a economics edit and changed it to a Japanese, you know, so it would play, but it didn't work because it still detected that it was made from economics, so it's not going to work.
896490	897830	So, I'm getting close though.
897930	898931	I can almost fix it.
899671	903633	Wait, but if you make edits for 4th Mix, you can play them on Max 2 like that?
903853	910856	I don't see what's the... Because the Max 2 machine is set up to read files from other versions.
911736	918219	It's the same reason like on 5th Mix, when you put in your memory card for data, it'll read it as Max 2 data too.
920259	921620	It'll have the new version set up.
922503	923484	SoCalKicks wants to make it a point that
946578	949820	You don't know if a new USA mix is going to come out or not yet.
950120	952280	It's still a possibility.
952340	956682	There may be a new US mix still, and who knows what's going to happen with the arcade.
957742	958262	Way better.
958302	963464	I mean, freaking Europe is starting to get a lead on us, so we can't have the Europeans beating us.
963504	964004	Come on.
965705	968386	I understand a bunch of them aren't really that pleased with your mix, too.
970749	974730	Unfortunately, they are going to be releasing another mix for Euromix.
974790	980932	It's going to be kind of fixing everything that they don't like about... I wonder if that's going to be really going to happen or not.
981092	986714	Yeah, but it's like, okay, Euromix 2 versus DDR USA.
988575	988995	True, true.
989055	990095	Real contest there.
991536	995997	One more thing we should point out that arise from this interview between SoCalKicks and Jason Enos.
996761	1003991	It will have licensed tracks from already released Japanese DDR mixes, so there will be some Dance Mania licensed tracks.
1004752	1005433	Which ones?
1005993	1006354	Don't know.
1006935	1007636	And which games?
1007676	1007936	Don't know.
1008900	1012861	But I would imagine they would be kinds of things you would expect to see in the U.S.
1012981	1017043	Like one that comes to my mind would be Ordinary World.
1017483	1019883	I would not be surprised one bit if that's one of the songs that's going to be in there.
1019903	1022544	I would be perfectly happy if that song didn't make it in because that remix is a travesty.
1022684	1023004	I know.
1023044	1027386	I know it's a travesty of the original, but it is a kind of popular techno hit here in America.
1027426	1029506	I would not be surprised at all if it turned up.
1029766	1033468	That's kind of number one on my list for expected Dance Mania licensed songs.
1033528	1034168	I bet you that'll be one.
1034188	1037629	Twilight Zone and... Twilight Zone's probably... I bet you that'll happen too.
1037649	1037709	Yep.
1038356	1038656	DarkSakura.com
1057925	1058807	I'm sitting here.
1059407	1062031	Okay, let's play this little demo.
1062451	1065856	Loki, would you mind giving us a little background on where you found this little clip here?
1065916	1066557	It's only a minute 30.
1066717	1067899	I haven't heard this yet, even.
1067939	1069901	Yeah, well, here's what it is.
1070061	1074888	It's basically, I found it off of a site that was selling the vinyl version of Dark Black Forest.
1075408	1078790	And it's kind of, it really kind of splits it up a little bit.
1078870	1083513	It's kind of giving you an idea of what the whole song sounds like because it's like six or seven minutes long.
1083933	1084993	So it cuts it up a little bit.
1085013	1087895	So there are a little bit of spaces where it kind of comes off beat.
1087995	1091077	But, I mean, you kind of get the idea of what it's going to sound like.
1091337	1097340	I tried getting the original version of the MP3, but the stupid site, their shop was down.
1097640	1098661	And so it wouldn't let me buy it.
1099081	1101422	So I would have had it, but it's all their fault.
1101522	1102143	Stupid site.
1103572	1103892	We'll see.
1103932	1104774	Here's the demo here.
1104814	1108964	This is Dark Forest on Orange Lounge Radio.
1149707	1151448	That's a long way to go, honey.
1152348	1152728	I know.
1153709	1154489	But I'm afraid.
1155089	1155930	Where are we going?
1158311	1160712	Into the dark, black forest.
1200481	1201062	Okay, that was it.
1202163	1208388	Kind of chopped up there, definitely, but somebody in the chat room offered us to send us a longer one, so we'll see if we can get that by the end of the show.
1208448	1210290	Maybe we'll play the full five-minute version.
1210330	1213793	If we're desperate for things to do by the end of the show, we'll play that for you at the end.
1213833	1214314	How's that sound?
1214793	1215393	Thanks for watching!
1234897	1235957	Oh god, I hope not either.
1236057	1237238	That interface is ugly.
1239279	1242581	DDRPC's alright and all, I just kind of wish it had better songs.
1242621	1246384	I'd be much cooler with it if they'd license some stuff, but, you know, it happens.
1247164	1259732	Well, I think that, you know, it'll really be a good mix compared to most of the other stuff, because, well, first of all, it'll have all the modifiers, like Max and Max 2, and plus, I guess, .5 speed, which'll be fun, new challenging mode.
1260212	1263194	I just wish that they'd put challenge mode back on there, that was the coolest thing.
1263959	1264399	Oh, darn.
1264460	1265461	They should put 64 speed.
1287765	1288145	That would be cool.
1288165	1289086	Yeah, pointless shit like that.
1289606	1297509	No, but, um, I just, I think it'll be pretty good, because DDR KonamiX, as far as actual, that was just as good as Sport Mix, I think.
1297529	1301051	You know, besides not having challenge mode, which I really love.
1301411	1305793	You know, I have to ask KonamiUSA, I want my databank.
1306954	1307474	Databank?
1307854	1308014	Yeah.
1308354	1312736	That was cool, but, I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't use it at all.
1312916	1314357	For people like, you know, Loki...
1315003	1323910	Not Oki, Loki, who use lots of edits and stuff, and go to Golfland with their little laptop, Pentium One, and change it all around.
1324150	1327653	Yeah, that'd be cool, but I never look at the databank.
1327753	1331356	I mean, maybe once, if I need a little bit of a challenge or something, but no.
1332737	1335259	Yeah.
1335520	1340203	Oh, JB says, he wants to point out, My Summer Love is on Disney Mix, and Disney has .5 speed.
1341491	1342271	So something's different.
1342291	1344572	But you notice that Disney Mix looks a lot different also.
1344632	1356476	But Disney Mix already is running at 1.5 speed anyway, so... SoCalKick says he asked Enos about the databank in DDR Max USA, and because of technical difficulties, it ain't gonna happen.
1358396	1359076	Which is a bummer.
1359136	1361257	It would have made a fine addition to economics, for sure.
1361697	1362957	And I would have had my stuff on there.
1363618	1364018	Hell yeah.
1365225	1365986	Maybe the next time.
1366627	1369150	Maybe Max USA will sell really good and then they'll make another one.
1369350	1370151	Then they can ask me.
1371112	1373034	And then they'll come to you and get a bunch of edits.
1373054	1373395	Sweet.
1375032	1380417	I would honestly like them to put in a 2DX style expert course.
1380437	1382419	Not do like an Oni, but like an actual expert course.
1403556	1406538	You have a depreciating score bar.
1407299	1410522	Do you think they're going to have internet ranking for USA?
1410542	1412144	I don't see why they wouldn't.
1412184	1413485	It would be a good move on their part.
1413545	1415407	It would also be advertising for their site, too.
1415527	1415847	Yep, yep.
1417629	1419151	The Let Them Move Oni course.
1420972	1425177	If Let Them Move is in that game, then I will commit Strapagoo or something.
1425657	1426718	The Nearly 100 Oni course.
1428692	1429713	All the bad songs.
1430073	1433154	Well, you know, I mean, it could still be good.
1433194	1438956	I mean, if they actually, you know, surprise us with a good Let Them Move, which, you know, Instant Love would be awesome.
1439176	1442558	But, you know, I don't know if we'll ever, ever see that.
1442578	1444639	And I hope we don't see any Let Them Move mixes.
1445599	1447040	Hi, I'm DJ Konami.
1448280	1450181	We actually have DJ Konami in the chat room right now.
1451369	1452390	Ooh.
1452550	1453551	He'll teach you how to play.
1453811	1456713	You know, I think that we should play that song again sometime during the show.
1456733	1457214	Maybe we will.
1457254	1458995	Maybe before, right before the end of the show.
1460957	1461578	The instant love.
1463860	1466302	I agree with ElectroTal in the chat room.
1466602	1472848	Basically, I think the non-stops will make it before the Oni courses will, a la Euromix 2, kind of the way they do it.
1473308	1475871	And you can think of it like back to fourth mix type thing.
1476131	1477212	Non-stops were a great idea.
1477802	1482786	It all depends on what interface you're using, because if they're using a Max 2 interface, it's going to be easy to do on eCourses.
1482967	1487851	So, I mean, it'll be harder to program something like just non-stops, you know, into a Max 2 interface.
1489394	1495055	I don't know, it sounds like they're taking a little bit of liberties by changing some things around, especially with this whole foot ranking being in it for sure thing.
1495075	1497556	They're doing some changes to a max interface.
1497816	1499416	I guess we'll know more once we see screenshots.
1499676	1506498	Now, the rumor is that PlayStation Magazine is supposed to have a playable demo this October 8th, I believe, when their new issue comes out.
1506558	1510859	So, very soon now, we're going to be able to see what it looks like.
1511079	1512219	We'll be able to see the interface.
1512699	1513139	I'll buy it.
1513939	1514399	Yay!
1516320	1516480	So...
1518820	1524428	Well maybe I can make arrangements to get that magazine when that particular store gets a particular shipment of it.
1533863	1536144	Okay, let's get into the fun part of the show, shall we?
1536164	1539125	Let's talk about our FUs of the week.
1539465	1540766	Oh, do I have one or not?
1540786	1541406	Or what?
1541446	1553550	Because I've been getting a lot of them from the chat room here, so if you want to submit your FU of the week, just join Channel Pound Orange Lounge on any other site IRC server, like irc.egheads.org.
1554010	1555951	And in the meantime, we're going to start with...
1556511	1557632	Jamie's FU of the Week.
1557672	1558773	I just have to cue her music.
1558813	1559814	I'm kind of slow tonight.
1560495	1562597	It's been a long day.
1562737	1563538	I don't need a nap.
1563678	1564899	I just need a vacation.
1567321	1571105	Okay, my FU of the Week goes for tonight.
1571185	1572206	Halfway hate to say it.
1572796	1575377	Roseville, Gothland.
1575897	1577778	And this isn't because of the machines.
1577798	1579679	This has to do with unprofessionalism.
1580359	1581819	You want to know about unprofessionalism?
1581899	1583500	I will tell about unprofessionalism.
1584160	1589362	When you're sending, I've sent close to nine emails and have had replies.
1591203	1601287	When you try to set up a meeting with somebody to arrange, you're running a tournament that's going to be bringing in money for them and they don't even care enough about it to reply to you.
1602592	1611119	or, when you request a Saturday, in the interest of having a large crowd, and they go, no, we won't have a Saturday, good luck with Scandia.
1612100	1617124	Little do they know, we've already got approval with Scandia, so they can just go, you know, fall into the creek for all I care.
1617325	1618426	Did they actually say that to you?
1618566	1619366	Good luck with Scandia?
1619406	1620567	That was the email I got.
1620587	1621889	Wow, I didn't know that.
1621949	1625732	It said, I refuse to rent Saturday, good luck with Scandia.
1627404	1629445	So that's business we'll be taking from them that day.
1629745	1633346	Well, do you want to say anything about the new tournament?
1633366	1637248	I know the tournament's details haven't been finalized, but we'll say that for a future show.
1637488	1639008	Not for a future show, but I'll say something about it later.
1639028	1641069	That's not part of my fuck you of the week because it's a pleasant thing.
1641169	1641809	Oh, yeah, that's pleasant.
1641829	1642129	You're right.
1642589	1643890	Sorry, this is all about fuck you's right now.
1644710	1648791	In terms of size, Scandia's not as good, but Roseville Golf Land...
1651058	1657815	Like, last time I went there, both Drum Mania and Keyboard Mania were broken, and it's always crowded with tons of little kids, and it's dark.
1658519	1660000	and, you know, bad stuff.
1660020	1664244	Scandia, very nice people, good tech, and everything is cool.
1665045	1668387	We've got to try and keep this somewhat appealing to everybody out there, by the way.
1668407	1676814	We don't want to talk about Sacramento politics all day, but... Well, where Roosevelt often does have more machines, the better quality arcade is Scandia.
1677555	1683900	And I'm honestly even thinking about putting up the suggestion to everybody to change the Wednesday night location for the local meetings, too.
1684240	1685461	Interesting idea.
1685601	1685962	We'll see.
1688523	1689743	You have your own Fuck You of the Week.
1690524	1692924	Loki, hold on, I gotta load your song.
1693865	1694965	I'm so out of it this week.
1696225	1697666	Just go ahead and start with your Fuck You of the Week.
1697706	1698866	Your song will kick in pretty soon.
1698886	1701547	It's like I said, it's better to be out of it than to have your foot stuck in it.
1703807	1709589	Yeah, so my Fuck You of the Week goes to these really crappy winter movies that they're releasing right now.
1710609	1713210	What the hell are they thinking with, like, Fear.com.com?
1714898	1717599	and all these other stupid movies.
1717619	1719840	Like today I saw Ballistic, X vs. Sever.
1720100	1722861	That has to be one of the most pointless movies I've seen in a long time.
1723542	1731025	I mean, it had probably one of the slowest motorcycle chasings I've ever seen going a whopping 30 miles an hour through city streets.
1731745	1735286	It was just completely pointless and I lost interest about halfway through it.
1735326	1737447	But it was a free movie, so yay.
1737587	1738468	I've got to... Wait.
1746052	1748534	Just start with your FU, I'll give you a background song as soon as I can get through it.
1748554	1756240	My fuck you is towards the 49ers, because they suck, and they beat Shane Matthews and the Redskins, and they are the best.
1756660	1757481	Go Redskins!
1757821	1759862	Yay!
1760003	1760583	49ers suck.
1761203	1762504	Fuck you, Jeff Garcia.
1762805	1763585	I know you're listening.
1765146	1768089	Okay, that's my fuck you, football related.
1770740	1771541	I don't fuck you.
1771801	1772141	You do?
1772301	1772641	Yes.
1773342	1775963	You can leave Dave's music because it's happy.
1776223	1780005	My fuck you is not really directed toward anybody, it's toward the situation.
1780646	1786609	I feel sorry for everybody with long distance relationships because I was away from my Dan for a whole five days and it sucked.
1787470	1789451	It sucked, it sucked, it sucked, it sucked.
1789551	1791812	So fuck whatever he went to.
1792052	1793213	Except that I got free stuff on there.
1794192	1795154	Free Xbox out of it.
1796096	1797659	And free games.
1797800	1800024	Tons of t-shirts and a Capcom backpack.
1801788	1803812	Yeah, my FU's... I have an FU of the week.
1805069	1806750	F Microsoft, where's my free Xbox?
1807190	1807890	Thanks, I'm done.
1809611	1811611	I don't have an F you, but this is something else.
1811972	1815433	I'd like to congratulate the makers of Duck Tape.
1815693	1818754	They've saved my life on numerous occasions, and it rocks.
1818834	1824996	I mean, they fixed my car with Duck Tape, and they fixed my pads with Duck Tape, so hooray for Duck Tape.
1825737	1826317	That's it.
1826877	1827817	Hooray for Duck Tape.
1827837	1829258	Duck Tape has multiple uses.
1829918	1831779	Like, you know, taping small children in the fun.
1832899	1834161	and holding together computers.
1834241	1835723	Or taping two people's buns together.
1844803	1848665	How appropriate I'm playing Drop the Bomb.
1849305	1862090	On behalf of one of my friends who may or may not be listening, she would regale us with a tale of how at the Mississippi School of Math and Science they would hold together the school computer with duct tape and chicken wire.
1862770	1865111	And it worked until the duct tape fell off.
1865211	1868553	Actually, the duct tape didn't fall off, but I understand it was removed and the whole thing fell apart.
1870864	1871765	Okay, I have another bitch.
1872045	1877229	Now JB in the chatroom, he's bragging that he got a free Xbox as well through some other means.
1877489	1879750	Did anybody around here not get a free Xbox?
1880091	1887536	I mean, I realize they're going to have to give that system away to get people to play it, but, I mean, honestly, where's my free Xbox?
1887696	1889137	I know none of this free Xbox.
1890229	1893451	There's some secret I'm not being told about.
1893511	1894352	Some secret cult.
1895012	1896193	Some Xbox.
1896753	1900375	I found a game that kicks just about any other racing game's butt.
1901296	1904358	It's, um, oh god, it starts with an O. It's something Redshift.
1907207	1910088	No, it's not Orgasm Redshift, Dave.
1910208	1914110	It's done by Microsoft's programmers group.
1914550	1916991	That game is absolutely awesome.
1917071	1920673	It's like Wipeout meets Hydro Thunder.
1921293	1922233	It's kind of interesting.
1923314	1924274	And I got to do one of those, too.
1924314	1925955	Let's get to our chat rooms, bitches, shall we?
1926115	1929096	I need to get an Xbox.
1929176	1929997	I'd like to add it.
1930217	1930437	Okay.
1931790	1934312	23rd Magus says, a big fuck you to Skrull.
1934492	1936513	One Skrull in particular, Johnson Main.
1936533	1937074	What the fuck?
1937114	1938235	Welcome to Trainwreck High.
1938655	1940796	I asked for web author training, I get choir.
1942318	1947782	What the fuck is wrong with these fucking idiots?
1950024	1952806	You asked for web author training and you get choir?
1953726	1954767	What the hell is that?
1954787	1955248	That's retarded.
1958703	1961724	That's like making one of the Gauntlet Legends people get up and play DDR.
1963545	1966006	There's some scary people that play Gauntlet Legends.
1968247	1969187	What are you talking about?
1969207	1969928	They don't play it.
1969968	1971648	They are Gauntlet Legends.
1972869	1974469	B1 with the Gauntlet Legends.
1974649	1981452	Watch out for the girl with the big metal bra playing that game, you know.
1981512	1985074	It's pathetic when we have to sit here and make fun of addicts to other games.
1986874	1987395	Hi, Pod.
1987435	1988295	This is Kettle Calling.
1989417	1990138	Hi, Pot, you're black.
2023371	2030663	JB featuring Jenny Rom says, My FU is also to RVGL for not having the keys available to any games after the morning is over.
2031023	2033407	Not even the guys in the jean colored shirts have access to them.
2033808	2035471	Now Jamie can't rape the crane game.
2037196	2038136	Did the crane game break?
2038696	2042698	If the crane game broke before I got a chance to play it, don't hug our children.
2043118	2047159	Except for them leaving Drum Mania on free play for three weeks or something.
2047499	2048119	That was cool.
2051500	2052921	We are smart geniuses there.
2052941	2055141	It's like, it's getterific.
2055942	2061443	And JV featuring Jenny Rom would also like to say, F you if you hate Jenny Rom or The Zippers.
2062303	2063864	We're going to talk about Jenny Rom a little later.
2064991	2066392	We're going to talk about Jenny Rom after the next break.
2067493	2076098	Twen says, F you to sharing a phone line with every friggin' person in the house, making me stay online till 4am at least every night because I can't use it any time during the day.
2076719	2081121	And F you to me, Sky, for not putting up the new site or forum.
2081802	2084684	And he also says F you to individuals I'm not going to name.
2085384	2086785	Because they're not worth naming.
2086825	2088026	That's not cool.
2090948	2094370	Oh, 23rmagus would like to point out he is a fine baritone, but he hates choir.
2095567	2096368	But he is a mindbearer.
2096528	2099891	I was in band for a reason.
2102032	2104234	I'm in band because we're going to Hawaii.
2105015	2105976	How cool is that?
2106656	2109639	Is the only reason you joined band to go to Hawaii?
2109879	2111640	No, see, last year it was Disneyland.
2111881	2112601	That was crap.
2113122	2113922	I saw some tits.
2114303	2114703	That was it.
2115023	2115824	This year it's Hawaii.
2115844	2117485	Wait a minute.
2117525	2118926	You saw tits on a band trip?
2120328	2120648	Yeah.
2121565	2123207	One time at Bandcamp!
2123767	2125589	Oh, who didn't see that joke coming a mile away?
2125609	2130853	I'm going to be sending you money to buy me manga then when you're over there.
2130913	2132214	Can you go to Toys and Joys for me?
2134396	2134636	Okay.
2134937	2135437	Toys and Joys.
2138987	2140008	A couple more, two more.
2140548	2145751	SoCalKick says, fuck you to every gaming store for delaying Kingdom Hearts' release, but yay, Kingdom Hearts owns.
2146131	2149373	Um, actually, my fiance's store had Kingdom Hearts the day of release.
2149794	2151234	Uh, oh, oh.
2151655	2152415	So, ha ha.
2154957	2158699	And I'm getting mine tomorrow, so I'm very happy about that.
2159426	2160447	Oh, how did this happen?
2160547	2167092	TakeOutKid says, fuck you to his... And by the way, TakeOutKid is joining us from Berkeley.edu.
2167253	2175700	So, fuck you to his college writing teacher for thinking he was an ESL student when he's not even really ESL.
2177421	2180323	How can... How the hell... You've got to elaborate on that.
2180363	2181344	Please elaborate on that.
2181364	2183866	Send me more about how the hell that happens to somebody.
2183906	2184487	That sucks.
2187881	2189562	Yes, JB, please send me that file.
2189602	2193084	I'm not going to respond too lazy a type right now.
2193204	2201209	Thank you to Dan for getting me this really neat 007 watch that clips on my belt and is upside down so I can look at it and has a compass.
2201449	2203330	I've been playing with this thing all night.
2203710	2204591	It's the coolest thing ever.
2205991	2208813	And F you to this upcoming movie I heard about called The Core.
2209585	2211606	It's the dumbest idea I've ever heard of.
2212346	2219249	The Earth's core stops, and then these people have to go drill down to the core and detonate a nuke, and that'll fix everything.
2220370	2221510	It's the dumbest idea.
2222170	2225372	It's like Austin Powers, except that the goal is to let it work.
2226752	2230814	And here is us suspending our disbelief with one confession.
2231654	2232694	You know what?
2232814	2239176	Movies today are getting retarded as are most TV shows, which is why Jamie doesn't want TV anymore.
2239977	2242377	But, and Dave's head hurts.
2243578	2245518	But, The Transporter's gonna kick ass.
2245818	2246939	Go see The Transporter.
2247719	2248279	Awesome movie.
2248579	2249239	On Asian Girl.
2249279	2249719	Yeah.
2251020	2253560	Um, yeah.
2253680	2257682	A special hello, by the way, out there to the Rice Princess, who's joining us in the chat room.
2257942	2258082	Hi!
2258102	2258442	Hi!
2259250	2262774	And one more, one more FU, one more, this last one, no more, don't send me any more.
2264116	2268701	DarkTetsuya says, FU to his busted Knights controller.
2270122	2270963	Is that like Sonic Knights?
2271003	2272145	It's the Sega Analog Controller.
2272385	2272765	Oh, okay.
2273146	2276029	Which is the best controller ever invented.
2276890	2279433	And you cannot really get them anymore unless you know where to look.
2280422	2282924	Okay, TakeOutKid is elaborating on the ESL story.
2282964	2288928	He says, she read my subject and she thought my writing was so bad that she thought I was ESL.
2289669	2297014	And the readers of his subject had evidence of ESL attributes, so that's why she thought he was ESL.
2298436	2298816	Go figure.
2301098	2302759	Okay, why don't we take a quick break?
2302779	2303540	You guys want to take a quick break?
2303560	2306041	We're going to come back and we're going to talk about Jenny Rong.
2306442	2306982	How's that sound?
2307342	2307783	Whee!
2308043	2312326	I'm going to start this off with... Actually, I can't find that right now.
2312446	2315088	Maybe we'll hear something from Fantasia 3 in the next break.
2315108	2318130	I want to play you guys something from Fantasia 3, brand new, just came out.
2318150	2324234	But I'm going to start this set off with... How about something from... You want to hear Papaya?
2324254	2325855	You want to hear Supergirl?
2327189	2331692	We're going to have happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy papaya song.
2333093	2333554	Where was it?
2333834	2334254	Oh, there it is.
2334294	2334575	Hello.
2334875	2335215	Found it.
2335295	2336616	I can't even tell how I have my own songs.
2336656	2340839	Everyone be prepared to be overloaded with sugar and brush your teeth when the song's over.
2341119	2343281	Alright, and we'll get something from Fantasia 3 in here too.
2375137	2376739	Thank you for watching!
2642361	2643604	Tell it to my heart
2695123	2697577	Thank you for watching!
2764252	2768674	Mr. Random Person on the street, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music and more show?
2769655	2771976	Beautiful night, isn't it?
2772697	2784783	It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a bloodsucker.
2785804	2789026	Hey, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2790006	2790827	What the hell was that?
2791147	2792468	What was the look on her face when she...
2804084	2813609	I promised when we came back to the show we would talk about Jenny Rom and this is very interesting because JB in the chatroom, huge Jenny Rom fan, sent me some pictures of Jenny Rom.
2814429	2815210	Damn, she's ugly.
2815390	2817371	But this is the interesting thing.
2818411	2822835	Apparently, Jenny Rom is not a real person, from what I'm reading.
2823115	2823536	Gasp!
2823796	2824176	Gasp!
2824236	2834185	From what was posted on the... Well, you know, with cosmic surgery, one does become... Cosmetic surgery!
2834746	2838369	Yeah, well, shit, to make her look good, it's gonna take some cosmic surgery there.
2838810	2839750	Cosmic power's working.
2840031	2844675	But anyways, at a certain point, someone becomes, you know, not exactly human anymore.
2846215	2846936	Thanks for watching!
2865198	2867701	And he's a member of Jenny Rom's team.
2868101	2871645	He produced the first single, www.blondegirl.com for SyFam.
2872246	2875329	And he saw that somebody was looking for the lyrics of Do You Wanna Flirt?
2875409	2878232	And he posts them on this site.
2879693	2881595	Let's see.
2882036	2884798	Let's read some of these earth-shattering lyrics from Jenny Rom, shall we?
2885439	2885819	Let's see.
2888401	2896704	Boom Boom, Don't Stop, Love Me Babe, Boom Boom, Don't Stop, Kiss Me Babe, Boom Boom, Don't Stop, Love Me Babe, Tonight With Me So High.
2899585	2901426	What is up with the Japanese and Boom Boom?
2901606	2903106	They put Boom Boom in everything.
2904307	2908148	Yeah, but you know what?
2909208	2911009	Here's who Ginny Rum really is.
2912449	2914430	I know, I've heard this a long time ago.
2915336	2916096	It's politary.
2918297	2919758	You think Jenny Rum's really politary?
2919798	2920418	There's a difference.
2920798	2922059	Jenny Rum can hold a tune.
2925820	2927001	Jenny Rum's just Naoki.
2927941	2928601	That's all it is.
2928982	2929922	Naoki's everyone.
2930302	2931042	That's your drag.
2931163	2935164	So really what this is, is that Jenny Rum is actually an Italian singer.
2936645	2939366	The lady who does the voice, and also an Italian male singer.
2939386	2944208	And I'm guessing this picture that got sent to me was actually that Italian singer who poses as Jenny Rum.
2944628	2945529	Danny Ross is male?
2946309	2953272	No, no, but you know that guy who does the voice, like, you know, come on Barbie, let's go party, or, you know, I know, I know what you do.
2953432	2955093	That guy, he's an Italian guy.
2956124	2956824	God, you know what?
2956844	2958045	They all sound alike.
2958285	2963969	I swear to God, Aqua, you know, Captain... I seriously thought that guy was the guy from Aqua.
2964009	2965830	He sounds just like him.
2966050	2969272	The girl doesn't sound the same, but that guy sounds just like the guy from Aqua.
2969392	2971113	Aqua broke up a couple years ago from what I heard.
2971153	2974075	What's funny is they also have, what was it, I think King Kong and the Jungle Girls.
2975536	2976117	And the world is square.
2998883	3000524	All bands are aqua and the world is square.
3001104	3003505	Some more things that Alex says on this forum.
3004106	3006647	He's proud to see that so many people love his virtual daughter.
3007187	3010449	And he's got photos and a promotional video about Jenny Rom.
3011850	3015652	Jenny's not a real girl, but a virtual woman that lives in the fantasy and into the computer world.
3015672	3017172	That was the original concept about her.
3017913	3020714	And he says, Do You Want to Flirt is his favorite song.
3020734	3022815	It hasn't been released on Dance Media Compilation.
3023275	3027578	But I know somebody that's got a copy of that, and maybe they'll send it to me so we can play it by the end of the show.
3027618	3028298	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
3028878	3029679	I can't say any more.
3031220	3036185	And he says, we chose the name Jenny Rom because they were looking for a perfect name for a digital woman.
3036845	3038607	And when Joe said, what do you think of Jenny Rom?
3038647	3039548	He said, I love it.
3040229	3043131	Just kind of like when Jamie and I came up with Orange Lounge.
3043151	3044192	Let's call this show Orange Lounge.
3044212	3045053	Oh, I love it.
3045774	3046114	Same thing.
3046767	3047948	I'll buy that for a dollar.
3048168	3049569	Except I don't think we were that excited.
3049609	3051411	It was like, oh yay, finally, we thought of a title.
3051491	3053132	We're like, tired and on the Bart.
3054093	3054934	I remember that, I remember that.
3054974	3057035	We were on Bart when we decided to call it that.
3057095	3057696	I figured it out.
3058377	3061839	Politary is Naoki's evil second head.
3063961	3064922	That's what it is.
3066263	3067404	You mean they have a hard levitate?
3071867	3073028	Okay, uh, what else?
3073529	3074570	Naoki has many people.
3075310	3075430	Um...
3077566	3078827	But male is none of those.
3078847	3079187	A lovely story.
3101385	3107690	It should be noted the reason he's not with their production team anymore is because he made some explicit photos of Jenny Rom.
3110833	3112294	Yeah, anyway.
3112794	3114535	See if she was a natural blondie girl.
3115416	3119259	And we were all shocked to find out she wasn't a blonde girl all over.
3122222	3123482	They just forgot to render that part.
3129564	3136553	For all we know, it's www.shavedgirl.com Next in Bimani News.
3137474	3138435	Also in Bimani News.
3143281	3144602	Meanwhile, back at the ranch.
3148891	3150972	The curtains do not match the carpet.
3151773	3153033	We're so mature here.
3153714	3157196	They're talking about pussies.
3160017	3162078	I never thought I'd hear this on a Bomani show.
3162618	3163999	You think I'd get laid playing this game?
3165920	3168602	No, but certain people would be guaranteed not to.
3169702	3170343	Like Politary.
3173344	3173664	Anyway.
3174705	3176266	They want to know if Jenny Rom has three tits.
3177627	3178447	That can be programmed.
3180310	3188175	You know, it's like, um, I don't know how best to describe it.
3188495	3190276	She's like a vacuum cleaner.
3190476	3192157	She's got different attachments, you know.
3192417	3193878	For different functions.
3194918	3196539	She's gone from suck to blow!
3199421	3199861	Yeah.
3200582	3202343	And let's move on to something else, shall we?
3202363	3202863	Something else.
3203493	3205695	Did you know that they confirmed DDR Max 3?
3205795	3211158	Or I should say, not DDR Max 3 necessarily, but a new DDR is in production.
3212699	3215521	So there is definitely going to be a new DDR coming out.
3216021	3225988	And they're taking a poll over on the official website for this, which is over on Konami's Bomani portal.
3226008	3227028	You can find it, no problem.
3227308	3232512	They want to know what kind of Konami original songs you want to see in this new DDR that haven't been there yet, but from any...
3233212	3262685	the money game so like if there's a keyboard mania song you think should be in there now I was an idiot when I first submitted it and I said I want to see flotation in DDR except that's not a that's not a Konami original so I already fucked it up so they're looking for Konami originals speaking of the for home versions though this is this is somewhat unconfirmed although I'm not doubting the reliability of my source dude are those sirens picking up over the microphones it's just hella loud there's sirens going right by my house right now they found Loki anyway
3263616	3279260	Anyway, there's been information given to me, again, this has not been officially confirmed by me with any member of Konami, but that they were going to stop production of the peripherals, like the dance pads.
3279300	3280521	So we're talking Konami in the U.S.
3280561	3280801	again?
3280941	3282221	Konami USA.
3282501	3289563	And that though they did mention Red Octane by name, that they were supporting whatever product that they would release.
3290463	3296487	I'll try to get that confirmed, but in the meantime, this is what my sources told me.
3296847	3299088	Alright, so your... Inside sources.
3302370	3305172	Start buying those dance pads while you can get them.
3305672	3308454	Yeah, so they're not going to make any... Maybe...
3309355	3315179	They're not going to be making those official Konami pads anymore and Red Octane is going to be the official Konami DDR pad dealer, basically.
3315619	3315980	Maybe.
3316620	3318601	If these sources are correct, that's what's happening.
3319142	3319742	We'll see.
3320423	3320743	Who knows?
3320823	3322604	Red Octane seems to own everything DDR online.
3322864	3326427	It's not that they said it was going to be necessarily official.
3326467	3332731	It's just that they were going to, I guess, vouch for the production of the Red Octane pads.
3333312	3336634	And the Ignition pad was also mentioned by name.
3337927	3338771	Now this is interesting.
3339413	3342384	Over on BimaniStyle.com, a fine little site,
3343010	3352797	They are making suggestions for what kinds of things you should submit as songs to Konami for DDR Max 3 or whatever it is.
3353057	3355138	Whatever it is in whatever shape or form they're going to call it.
3355198	3356519	It's basically DDR 8th Mix.
3357019	3362243	And basically these are all the Konami original songs that would pretty much be impossible to dance to.
3362323	3365605	So I'm going to read off this list here of possible submissions.
3365645	3371469	If you can't think of anything you want to submit as a song that you think should be in 8th Mix, here's some suggestions.
3372011	3373906	From Beatmania, The DJ Battle
3375347	3377028	Can you imagine dancing to the DJ Battle?
3377129	3377949	Oh, I got one.
3377969	3379230	I have one up on that.
3379451	3379831	How about this?
3380111	3382053	DJ Battle, the Yoler Mix.
3383434	3387137	From Beatmania... I forget which one.
3387457	3388458	Yeah, Yoler Mix.
3389479	3391100	The Cat Song from Beatmania.
3391681	3393122	That's possible.
3393442	3397265	That would be so lame to dance to.
3397546	3398326	But it would be fun.
3398426	3400168	It would be, like, stupid fun.
3401049	3403291	From Keyboard Mania, Morning Music.
3404331	3425479	Which I think is about 15 BPM That would be so awful in DDR For memories, that one's really slow Threshold from Keyboard Mania is another suggestion Without You Around from Poppin' Music I'm not up on my Poppin' Music knowledge, so I don't know what that song is But from 2DX they suggest Flowers for Albion
3427093	3427714	God, no.
3428254	3434659	I wonder if the flowers would do the same thing that the notes do in the Seven Keeper Flowers.
3435840	3437662	Okay, that part is ass.
3439083	3440124	But it would be fun to do those.
3440924	3442286	Ah, I like Twin's suggestion.
3442306	3444527	He says, let's DDR to Orange Lounge episodes.
3445708	3447029	Talk about a long version.
3447089	3448190	These things are what?
3448350	3451713	I think the shortest episode of Orange Lounge is like 118 minutes.
3452554	3453995	That would be marathon mode right there.
3456602	3459723	From 2DX, also suggesting The Safari.
3461264	3462705	You know, The Safari would be fun.
3462745	3464666	I think that's a good idea, really.
3464686	3472030	Dude, The Safari would be... But you know what song I would not... I mean, I don't think it's an original, but Get On Beat Wildstyle, definitely not.
3472250	3473110	It is an original, actually.
3473951	3474531	Lion and Sushi.
3476172	3476872	Maybe, I don't know.
3477532	3479793	Get On Beat would actually be kind of fun.
3480874	3482435	It wouldn't be a fast one, but it would be a fun one.
3485058	3510445	Guitar Freaks, Across the Nightmare Drum Mania with Waza Mobile Moga being suggested in the chatroom I believe I saw that on a preliminary list but I don't know how trustworthy those lists are the ones that have been released to date I don't think it's quite solid
3513806	3517767	Twins suggest we can DDR to the sounds of the sirens outside my house looking for Loki.
3518387	3520108	Just loop, you know, the beginning of Fuqua.
3524449	3528370	Presto V... What else are people suggesting in here?
3528390	3529490	Okay, Presto would be a pain in the butt.
3530670	3532131	How about... Oh, I know.
3532151	3532131	1999.
3532851	3533131	No!
3533171	3535991	Fifth mix.
3537672	3538392	Saber Dance.
3539312	3540353	I think that would be fun.
3541813	3542113	Oh, yeah.
3542679	3543839	Well, here's what I voted for.
3543859	3547560	I voted for Outer Limits and my other computer.
3548801	3550161	I don't care, okay?
3550181	3551642	I voted for it anyways.
3551662	3552602	It's all in Japanese.
3552662	3554963	I can't read their freaking Japanese language.
3554983	3555483	Actually, wait a minute.
3555543	3557383	Outer Limits, I believe, is the LED, isn't it?
3557663	3558444	Wasn't that the bonus chart?
3559524	3560004	Whatever.
3560184	3560484	Whatever.
3560884	3563005	And then I also voted for Instant Love.
3563985	3565045	With DJ Konami.
3568046	3569747	You voted for Instant Love?
3571687	3573208	Great, the dance floor is waiting for us.
3573228	3573949	That's what we're doing.
3574189	3580555	I want everybody right now listening to this show to go vote for Instant Love for DDR with DJ Konami's voice intact.
3581095	3582457	I want that to be the new lesson mode.
3582737	3589423	I swear to God, if they release another DDR with Let Them Move as the lesson mode background, that old screeching woman, they need to do the new one for Beat Me In 3.
3589463	3590844	We have After the Game of Love on 3rd May.
3590864	3591505	Oh, that's true, we do.
3593186	3594007	Alright, I'm done with my rant.
3595285	3596466	So that's all about this.
3596666	3606115	Also, what they're going to start doing on this site, starting on the 25th, which is in three days, so next week we'll be able to talk about this, Naoki's diary.
3606855	3607436	Naoki.
3607536	3608637	Naoki's diary.
3609197	3610318	How feminine of him.
3611419	3616344	No, they said diary, not journal, not logbook, not hey what's going on.
3616484	3617665	It's his diary.
3617685	3618425	I'm about ready.
3618666	3621188	See, I put Naoki in the same category I put Gakuten.
3621954	3625097	Dear Diary, I had the members of B4U over today.
3625117	3632723	We went on my nice little Pirates of the Caribbean ride with my monkey.
3644692	3648535	And I did my nails and I made another song.
3648675	3651937	And I tried to think of another name for another band that I could become.
3653739	3656020	And damn that Jenny Rump for stealing my idea.
3657501	3658382	I will become her.
3658902	3660123	She will not live.
3660944	3661284	Anyways.
3662281	3663161	This is kind of odd.
3663201	3668324	I mean, when they said, like, everybody's getting a live journal these days, I didn't think now he was getting it on it, too.
3669004	3673567	I wonder if they'll have to have a separate journal for each of his alter egos, you know, revenge and desire.
3674107	3683392	You know, I'm thinking, if it's going to be a weekly update, I'm sure that I could probably, with, you know, the proper payments, try to get somebody to translate it to...
3684132	3684993	To put up or something.
3685033	3689576	Or I could give highlights from it using my favorite translation program, Nifty at Global Games.
3689616	3690376	I can just see it now.
3690657	3692278	Weekend Update with Naoki.
3694679	3696881	Maybe we'll take our own liberties with the translation.
3696941	3697561	Mwahaha.
3698622	3701724	Today I got the B for you girls together today.
3701904	3705286	And we got together at my house and had a naked spa party.
3705366	3706967	And then we wrote another crappy song.
3707027	3708108	Instead of dead hair.
3709649	3710310	No, I'm sorry.
3710330	3711330	That's polytery.
3711350	3711871	Okay.
3713220	3715562	I made Politary mount the B4U girls.
3717523	3719024	Today I dressed up like Emi.
3719465	3720085	I like her.
3720445	3721266	She's kinda cute.
3721606	3722927	Maybe I'll become her someday.
3723347	3724148	Yes, Emi!
3724548	3725869	Added to the personalities.
3729372	3729792	Next!
3730132	3733495	I asked the chatroom to submit me their funny Naoki diary entries.
3733655	3734095	Did you hear this?
3734155	3735817	Naoki's starting a diary on the 25th.
3736297	3737138	Naoki's diary.
3737398	3740260	Do you think... What kinds of things do you think Naoki's gonna tell us about in his diary?
3741818	3743761	Well, I don't know.
3744282	3747326	I don't know Naoki, but that's probably why he's making a diary.
3748147	3750190	Wait, is it a guy or a girl?
3750250	3751131	Yes, it's a guy.
3751592	3751893	Okay.
3752513	3753194	I wasn't sure.
3753815	3754496	Just checking.
3754757	3756199	It's all encompassing, okay?
3757850	3759392	Deep thoughts with Naoki.
3759792	3762936	Naoki isn't hidden, either.
3762956	3764238	Did you ever see It's Pat?
3764458	3765139	That's Naoki.
3765660	3768042	No, no, no, because Naoki actually looks very pretty.
3768183	3770065	I would love to interview Naoki on this show.
3770105	3772628	I don't know who I have to blow to get that to happen, but come on.
3772888	3773229	Maybe him.
3776275	3779436	Would I get a free trip to Japan out of it?
3779576	3779957	Stopping.
3780597	3785299	I asked the chat room to submit their funny Naoki diary entries.
3785339	3790861	So if you want to send me a PM with what you think Naoki might just write in his diary, I'm going to read those aloud right now for you.
3792321	3796583	But let's get some background music, shall we, for these lovely Naoki diary entries.
3797483	3798084	Dynamite Rave?
3798184	3798484	All right.
3799844	3800865	I've got to find Dynamite Rave.
3800885	3801145	Hold on.
3803893	3805774	Dynamite Rave is not the worst song ever!
3805854	3806474	Shut your mouth!
3806494	3809735	It's in the category of the worst songs ever folder, which encompasses DDR USA.
3809755	3811516	Dynamite Rave is a good song, it's just overplayed.
3831212	3832652	Naoki's Diary Chaos suggests...
3853482	3857866	Dear Diary, I made a remix to Breakdown Reggae R&B version.
3858186	3859107	It was really great.
3859408	3862350	It has the Jamaican dude singing instead of the B4U girls.
3863271	3865453	I like how it's referred to as the Jamaican dude.
3866114	3870038	It'll have Jamaican drums and the black people singing, because B4U sucks.
3871624	3873485	I don't know if Naoki would say his own band sucks.
3873525	3874145	That was beautiful.
3874185	3874745	Thank you, Chaos.
3876086	3881729	JB says, Dear Diary, I saw Politarian try to move my hand down her pants.
3882569	3882769	Nuts.
3884630	3885790	That's kind of the obvious entry.
3887211	3889312	DJ Konami submits us not one, but two.
3889392	3889792	Here we go.
3890392	3892874	Dear Diary, I remixed Die for the 558th time today.
3892894	3893074	Praise me.
3897631	3899873	The part that makes that funny is at the end, praise me.
3902454	3905977	Dear Diary, I paid Paula and Kosaka to do some hot action today.
3909179	3910180	Twence says this.
3910960	3914182	Dear Diary, I had Paula Dairy record Let Them Move.
3915984	3918686	And that's it, because Naoki died after hearing that.
3920127	3921688	SoCalKick, so this is a long one.
3922548	3923329	Dear Diary...
3924662	3941142	I stumbled on an orange site that plays songs from that one place I used to work for and I listened to him and this random white American asked who would he have to blow to interview me I am curious and I'm going to have to pose as a random American hipster and get this blow that was the way
3941567	3944249	SoCalKicks wins the Diary competition.
3944869	3945509	Oh, we're getting more.
3946790	3948571	23rd Magus submits this one.
3949312	3958557	Dear Diary, I realize after doing 50,000 remixes of the same song that I have issues, one of which is a major identity crisis.
3960198	3961119	No.
3962540	3963480	We didn't know that.
3964981	3970625	That's why I'll create Bob, or Bob 2.0, to deal with that type of trauma.
3971454	3973015	I am too busy for that type of trauma.
3973135	3974616	I need to make more songs.
3974976	3977318	Let's see, I can make a D for you.
3978258	3979819	Insert letter, number, letter.
3981521	3982141	Yeah.
3982541	3987745	A black lab in the chat room points out, you know, admitting a problem is the first step to recovery.
3989326	3991247	You'll be going through like the million step program.
3995659	3997220	Our chat room people are hilarious tonight.
3997240	3997920	They're funny.
3999281	4000222	How about another quick break?
4000242	4000682	What do you guys think?
4000702	4001722	Do you want to go on another subject?
4001742	4002303	Do you want to take a break?
4002323	4003063	What do you want to do?
4003323	4007385	I think that before we go to the break, I'll just go ahead and make a mention about Tourney.
4007685	4007906	Okay.
4008186	4012368	We're going to have an official site be up hopefully by mid-next week.
4012728	4019111	It will be linked from sakbemani.com, which is S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I dot com.
4019171	4019812	Sakbemani.
4020492	4021213	Just like it sounds.
4021273	4021793	Sakbemani.
4022153	4024374	If you don't know how to spell Vimani, then you suck.
4024394	4025775	Then you have no reason at all to do that.
4025795	4026375	Why are you here?
4027716	4030417	But we do have a date confirmed.
4030458	4034920	It is November 9th at Scandia on, is it Hillsdale Road?
4036327	4036667	I don't know.
4036827	4039088	Scandia, Madison, and I-80.
4039748	4040349	You can't miss it.
4040389	4041069	It's right by the freeway.
4041929	4043910	We will have maps to the site.
4044030	4050072	The tournament will be freestyle, and it will be perfect attack in the morning.
4050432	4051772	Sponsored by Orange Lounge Radio.
4051852	4052993	Yes, Orange Lounge Radio.
4054453	4055233	What about the A-Team?
4057461	4063984	There will also be a team mode freestyle to be going on during normal freestyle tabulation.
4064664	4071867	And there also may be another surprise there waiting for us in the form of another Bomani game.
4072428	4075289	Which is on the boat, on its way to come hang out with us.
4076296	4082501	We should point out, this is not the same Scandia tournament as the Scandia tournament in December.
4082521	4083942	I think they're having one in the Bay Area.
4084283	4085764	No, this is a different Scandia.
4085784	4087145	This is the Sacramento Scandia.
4087405	4089707	The tournament will not have Scandia in the name.
4089727	4092249	The tournament name is still kind of being ironed out.
4093269	4096852	But we think we know what it is, but we're going to say it next week.
4097253	4099054	We'll reveal the name next week.
4099194	4100295	All we can say is, shut your mouth.
4101539	4104640	We'll reveal the name next week, once we have our first meeting and get everything worked out.
4105301	4110383	But we'll be posting all that information to just about every single freaking forum out there.
4110963	4112244	You'd have to be blind to miss it.
4112624	4120528	And I'll say that an Orange Lounge website will be... An Orange Lounge new website will have forums in it coming very soon.
4120568	4121548	Hopefully in the next couple weeks.
4122889	4123689	Wow.
4124209	4125630	So much for that secret.
4127684	4129306	We didn't confirm it.
4129486	4130327	We're not going to confirm.
4130347	4131328	We're not going to deny those.
4131789	4132329	So there it goes.
4135573	4135954	Let's see.
4136594	4139418	Orange Lounge random meeting promoted in SoCal by SCK.
4139458	4140799	That's what the tournament's called, I guess.
4141180	4141360	No.
4142742	4143022	Thank you.
4143042	4143543	Drive-thru, please.
4145002	4152164	I'm looking forward to this because I'll be getting to get up there and MC this tournament with my good buddy Electro... God, I can never say it.
4152184	4152505	Tal!
4154165	4155105	His name's a tongue twister.
4155125	4157226	Tal will be up there too and we're going to MC this tournament.
4157246	4157666	It'll be fun.
4158286	4160107	And Jamie, you're going to do a little MCing too, aren't you?
4160307	4162328	You're going to be too busy.
4162648	4166389	I'll be hanging out in the little party room over there going, okay, you need to be doing this.
4166989	4168511	I asked for a Diet Coke.
4168811	4170113	You runners are shit.
4170313	4171514	This is regular Coke.
4171714	4172775	Where's my Diet Coke?
4172976	4173897	I'll be in my trailer.
4174377	4176679	I throw you out of this tournament, I'm going to my trailer.
4177640	4178201	No, not really.
4178401	4179482	Okay.
4179542	4187070	Trust me, I'm going to be in the middle of the thing, and if it goes like, you know, I was just, you know, running around for everybody last year at Folsom, and I didn't eat all day, so...
4188200	4196707	You know, then again, you know, I also, you know, I want to go ahead and thank, you know, the people who have been giving me advice on this too.
4196847	4198429	I want to thank Iguana Girl especially.
4198449	4206175	I want to thank Maple too for a lot of advice, you know, at 3 a.m.
4206235	4211660	in the morning with information and stuff on how a lot of the tournaments are run.
4213456	4219220	Okay, let's take a really quick break, and we'll come back with much more information on the tournament next week.
4221061	4222102	And that's all I have to say.
4222602	4223923	Any other thoughts to take us out?
4226004	4226364	Song.
4227125	4227425	Song.
4227485	4229967	How about... Okay, we'll do this.
4230107	4231588	This is a popular song here.
4232208	4234930	We're going to play Spooky for you here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4381687	4383228	You're a dance animal!
4383648	4384148	Awesome!
4384228	4384628	Awesome!
4384808	4385228	Wow!
4385248	4385608	Great!
4385668	4386289	I was moved!
4386449	4387489	I'm always continuing!
4387529	4388309	You are awesome!
4408206	4409987	The crowd loves you!
4410027	4410387	Yeah, do it!
4410407	4411388	You're a dancing machine!
4411408	4411728	Nice step!
4411748	4412568	You surprised us all!
4437840	4442505	Wow, you are too cool!
4442705	4447389	Combo is continuing great!
4448250	4448770	Hi!
4448991	4451633	Do you really follow me into the light?
4452133	4458679	Dream instructors on, dream instructors on my side Do you really make a man for dynamite?
4459160	4460861	Love and peace is our fight
4478001	4481245	I am your man, I will follow only you I am your man
4543174	4551696	Hi-ho, Kermit the E-Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
4551736	4557478	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
4557698	4561859	You can't say 69, because there's a song in DDR called .59.
4561939	4562279	Get it?
4562379	4564840	V-A-59, ha ha ha.
4564920	4569061	Everyone realizes that Little Miss Muffin's not a tough inch.
4569501	4570181	That was last week. .59.
4572962	4575384	If you weren't listening last week, that'll come out.
4575584	4576465	Oh, yeah.
4576505	4579287	Explain the .59 for those that may not know what .59 is all about.
4579347	4579687	Explain this.
4579707	4587712	To do a quick bit of Japanese translation, point translates to ten, five translates to go, nine translates to ku, ten go ku means heaven.
4588493	4588613	Ah.
4589393	4594917	Hence, why if you notice the video in 2DX, it says ten go ku up on it with an angel.
4595818	4597039	Yay.
4597179	4599080	Now, why Devil Zuken in the background, though, on 4th Mix?
4599100	4600201	I don't know.
4603941	4606544	chat room saying they need to come out with a DDR Sesame Street mix.
4607385	4608125	Oha's cool, though.
4608486	4611869	I mean, if you want... Oha, I think, would be cooler than anything Sesame Street could do.
4611949	4612509	Oha's does.
4612630	4614011	Very cool.
4615172	4615452	All right.
4617554	4620597	Let's talk about... Oh, I got some sad news to report on the show.
4620657	4624821	I thought, though, we need to talk about it, because it is Bomani-related, believe it or not.
4626661	4627021	No.
4629142	4633684	However, one of the singers from the group Roxette has a brain tumor.
4634645	4640827	Marie Fredrickson, a singer with a Swedish pop act, Roxette, best known in DDR for their contribution to Center of the Heart.
4641267	4645349	And also, the look was circulating on some early Max 2 lists.
4645709	4648991	However, it appears it got cut or it was just an outlier lie the whole time.
4649731	4651113	She looks like Lucy Lawless.
4651333	4651834	That's not her.
4651874	4652334	This isn't her.
4652374	4654577	That chick looks like Lucy Lawless.
4654677	4655457	I'll get to it here.
4655898	4656519	I'm going to cite here.
4657400	4661985	The 44-year-old singer fainted in her Stockholm home last week, and she's now in the hospital.
4662465	4668211	Her record label, EMI Sweden, if you ever wondered how they ended up on Dance Mania, they're just part of EMI Sweden.
4668992	4670234	Thank you for watching.
4690816	4691977	This is why I don't do real radio.
4692258	4704307	They had plans to do a Europe tour that was going to start in late October, and the duo is one of the most successful musical exports Sweden has ever produced, and the most successful ever in the US singles charts, which somewhat surprised me.
4704327	4706629	I always thought ABBA was the bigger of the two bands, but whatever.
4707450	4711753	Their first UK hit was The Look, and it hit number 7 on the UK singles charts in 1989.
4713471	4722198	and they've had four more top ten hits in the UK, including It Must Have Been Love, Joyride, which were both also big hits in the US, and Almost Unreal.
4723439	4734027	Fredrickson had also enjoyed successes under her own name, hitting the Swedish charts in 1999 with a duet, Wonderful World, with one of the singers from ABBA, and that picture, the one you say looks like Lucy Lawless, that's the singer from ABBA.
4734407	4737770	It should be noted that that small tumor is actually Paul Oteri.
4740352	4741012	No!
4741353	4742433	Paul Oteri put it there.
4745586	4749129	It's an alien implant from Naoki so that he can control her too.
4750930	4751190	Anyways.
4752271	4756574	Lastly, in November, the duo joined US singer and actress Jennifer Lopez.
4758736	4760757	That was caused by Jennifer Lopez's ass, I'm sure.
4761218	4767863	And Swedish royal dignitaries at the party for Lopez's European... I can't say a goddamn word tonight.
4769484	4770665	I'mma pee in this show away.
4771365	4772046	European tour.
4774486	4775988	So that's kind of some sad news.
4778010	4779792	We don't like it when DDR people are gonna die.
4780312	4780773	Damn!
4780933	4782394	It wasn't impolitary!
4782815	4783475	Why?
4786932	4789914	You're going to say this and then suddenly Politary is going to get hit by a bus.
4789934	4793136	Yeah, suddenly Politary is going to get hit by a bus and you're going to feel bad, aren't you?
4793156	4795578	It's not like anything I ever say ever comes true.
4796058	4796419	Oh, wait.
4797379	4798080	Yeah, it does.
4798520	4798880	Damn.
4799781	4802703	Speaking of... No, I cut naked cheeks and just crawl from the sky every day now.
4803904	4804224	Damn.
4805245	4806646	Asian porn stars.
4808347	4808587	No.
4809008	4809568	Next, please.
4810789	4811710	One quick little thing.
4811750	4813391	I thought this would be a funny thing to bring up.
4813751	4816393	For sale on Amazon.com through Toys R Us...
4817106	4820405	Barbie Dance Party and I'm going to post this link in the chat room here.
4821978	4822859	It's a dance pad.
4823039	4825020	It's Barbie's official dance pad.
4825080	4830163	So if you want to have the girls over for a night of dancing, you know, want to show off to Ken.
4830303	4834725	It's actually a separate game that I don't think is affiliated with us.
4835005	4836966	It looks like Pump It Up.
4837467	4838887	It does.
4838928	4839948	It does kind of look like Pump It Up.
4839968	4841349	There's no arrows on it.
4841789	4842369	I bought this.
4844751	4846972	Dear Diary, I struck a deal with Mattel.
4848485	4854247	with Mattel and Andamiro to release this game to start subverting small children into the DDR cult.
4855187	4859309	No, but instead of arrows, it's got little flowers all in different colors.
4859829	4864211	Each child that plays this game will get a swift dose of Naoki-ism.
4864831	4865131	Oh, yes.
4865211	4868632	And pretty soon Andamiro is going to be releasing the gem dance pad.
4869433	4874614	Actually, it should be noted that Pump It Up, that's just Naoki.
4874955	4875515	Still Naoki.
4876545	4880351	No, it's just like a cigarette trying to hook them while they're young, you know?
4880971	4885738	So instead of having the seven degrees of Kevin Bacon, we now have the seven degrees of Naoki?
4885798	4887501	Did you just compare DDR to smoking?
4888282	4888743	No!
4888883	4889223	Yes, I did.
4889383	4890525	Maybe smoking crack.
4895075	4896837	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4917702	4919263	I wonder if it's padded, though.
4920963	4921843	Better be for $50.
4922944	4924864	Jamie's loading up the computer here.
4924965	4926185	She's going to find something.
4927005	4930226	Anyways, well... She's looking over... Let's make fun of the Barbie pad some more.
4931347	4931967	Barbie pad.
4931987	4935488	Do you think there'll be a Ken... Do you think there'll be a Ken pad, too?
4935968	4936548	Like, blue?
4937149	4945632	So, now, the Barbie pad, does that go with the new Barbie with the wonderful... The Barbie pad gives protections in the front and back, and also on the sides.
4945672	4946432	It's got the wings.
4947432	4949074	That's the new Barbie pad right there.
4951515	4956319	Jamie found the link to the... Somebody just posted it in the chatroom.
4956339	4957239	They actually just beat you to it.
4957580	4959541	Looks like Slinky made that post in the chatroom here.
4960021	4962403	Oh, SoCalKicks suggested the G.I.
4962443	4963364	Joe Marchathon.
4964657	4964877	G.I.
4964897	4968058	Joe Marcheson SoCalKicks is witty tonight.
4968138	4969319	He's on the ball.
4969379	4969859	He's too funny.
4969899	4974280	But this machine, it's like, it would probably be as tall as me.
4974420	4974880	Oh, wow.
4974920	4977221	It is kind of more like a little kid's machine.
4977261	4978341	It has this cutesy pad.
4978382	4982483	It's like a solo, but it has like a flower shape with an up-down, left-right arrow.
4983203	4985624	And it's just absolutely adorable.
4985644	4986944	It's cute.
4986984	4991926	It looks like it's... I don't know if anybody knows Manders, but it looks about as tall as her.
4994347	4995388	Only $800.
4995508	4996649	What do you think, Jamie?
4997831	4999112	Want to pool our money together and buy it?
4999132	5000773	I think I have $10 on the couch.
5001574	5005558	I think I've got about $50 in my collection bottle.
5005838	5007280	We could sell Dave on the street.
5008081	5009122	I think he could get us about $3.
5009162	5015227	That thing is so cute.
5015508	5016168	It is very cute.
5016208	5016589	I like that.
5016689	5017369	It's cute with a K.
5018615	5019876	It would never deal with small children again.
5041258	5046222	Rob just said that the machine should put out.
5046442	5047443	Thank you for clarifying.
5047483	5047823	Thank you.
5048684	5050205	Oh, that whole Jenny Rom talk, you know.
5056810	5057871	What else am I being given?
5057951	5059152	I'm being given all these other links.
5059192	5059572	Let's see.
5059632	5064156	This one's... This is called Chatroom Sends Me Random Shit and I Look It Up.
5065837	5067599	Rave Station!
5067619	5068479	Rave Station!
5070643	5070883	No.
5071244	5072364	Have a rave in your house.
5074106	5074686	E not included.
5075627	5076628	Yeah, E not included.
5080250	5080531	What's this?
5080731	5082092	I think this is the Barbie dance pad again.
5082112	5084433	I think somebody just posted that again for somebody who missed it the first time.
5085514	5085855	Oh, no.
5085875	5088557	The Harry Potter vibrating broom palace.
5089858	5090578	Oh, my God.
5091038	5093240	That is the worst picture I've ever seen.
5093300	5094101	Look at this.
5094121	5098364	Supposedly, it's supposed to be the Nimbus 2000 toy broom, and the thing vibrates.
5100260	5101742	And it's about the width of it.
5101802	5107227	Look at how that little kid is holding his little broom.
5108728	5109769	And it vibrates.
5111311	5112492	Every little girl's dream.
5112632	5114334	And he has the smile on his face.
5118134	5120237	This has absolutely nothing to do with DDR, but it's fucking funny.
5120257	5120698	Fly the broom.
5121979	5123501	Hold the shaft of the broom.
5123902	5124803	Everybody say, up!
5127247	5135258	Dear Diary, today I sold my design for the Nimbus 2000 broom to Mattel, and they bought it.
5135954	5140015	So now my personal vibrating tool is going to be carried around by small children.
5140315	5142255	Yet another insidious Maoki plot.
5142375	5142776	I rule.
5143096	5149057	DJ Konami wants me to point out that it does have a warning label on it that says, Warning, this toy does not fly.
5150997	5151638	That is cool.
5153218	5155238	So don't go jumping off the roof.
5156779	5157959	Little kids have done that, you know.
5159585	5163306	sat on their Aladdin magic carpet and jumped off the roof and fallen to their deaths and wondered why.
5163487	5165327	But mommy, I was thinking happy thoughts.
5165687	5171590	No, see, what you do is you're supposed to stay on flat ground and it lifts off from the ground.
5171630	5173530	It's not like it just kind of glides.
5173550	5174411	It's not a glider.
5174971	5175571	It flies.
5175691	5176492	It doesn't glide.
5177072	5178492	It flies off the ground.
5178572	5180033	It doesn't glide from the top down.
5182082	5186364	Twin posts a nice little, you know how Amazon has the talkback, you can comment on these things.
5186744	5197868	So a mother writes, My son has enjoyed zooming around, pretending he's flying, and it's important to stress to younger kids that they're only pretending and that brooms can't really fly, playing kidditch, and so on.
5198188	5202409	The motion-sensitive sound effects are apparently fun for him, but they do get kind of old.
5203410	5207291	The fact that the broom looks just like the one in the movie doesn't hurt, as far as he's concerned, too.
5208809	5211170	Dear Diary, children are stupid.
5211190	5214011	They think that they can fly with a toy broom.
5214331	5215412	Ha ha ha ha.
5216732	5217753	Maybe I should do a diary.
5219213	5220914	Maybe we should make Naoki's diary.
5221454	5222655	Let's get Naoki a dead journal.
5222855	5225856	We should make the Orange Lounge dead journal.
5226456	5227617	Maybe we'll have to look into that.
5228237	5228717	I think so.
5229898	5231959	Dear Diary, we're taking over the world.
5232339	5234620	We've kidnapped Naoki and picked his brain.
5236954	5237454	Let's see.
5238535	5243397	Oh, we want to do your sim update?
5243917	5245097	Yes, let's do your sim update.
5245578	5245938	Okay.
5246418	5252060	And then I also promised we'd plug one of Loki's other creations here.
5252140	5255361	So we're going to play one of your songs tonight, Loki.
5255502	5257042	So give us your sim update first, please.
5257102	5258183	Okay, sim update.
5258423	5261364	Let's see, no new DWI versions.
5262004	5266886	I really don't care, I've abandoned all hope for DWI since StepMania has surpassed them.
5267186	5270848	I used to be a pro DWI guy, but I'm sorry.
5271749	5273869	I've found StepMania and I love it.
5274330	5276351	So, go StepMania!
5276791	5280653	Anyways, supposedly a new version coming out pretty soon, StepMania 6.
5280773	5282653	For some reason I already have StepMania 6.
5283394	5285875	I guess, you know, whatever, CVS build version.
5286435	5289898	No, didn't you say that Step Mania 6 was first comprised of some other copy?
5289938	5294162	It wasn't like the actual Step Mania thing, and now I guess they're doing an official one or something?
5294182	5294883	Yeah, whatever I said.
5294903	5295283	I don't know.
5295683	5301188	Anyways, and then there's also a nice little Max 2 skin that's going to be released that's pretty funny.
5302550	5305432	So that'll be coming out pretty soon, probably next week or so.
5306513	5308335	No new DDR PC characters...
5309055	5309576	Tourney Mix 2.
5310096	5313919	It's wrapping up as of tonight, so we'll have the results next week for you guys.
5314359	5317161	See who won that, and that'll be fun.
5317701	5318922	I didn't enter, don't care.
5319883	5322184	And let's see, other news.
5323005	5329229	It may be possible that I might be starting a file serve on the DDR Maniacs chatroom.
5329669	5334953	So all 1,300 of my DWIs out there... You're going to give them away? !
5335706	5342888	Maybe, I don't know, I have to see, because I'm going to be doing this at work, so I have a T1 line constantly running for people to steal it.
5342908	5347109	I have to see how much hard drive space I have at my computer at work, and if the firewall will allow it.
5348030	5349770	So, maybe, maybe not.
5350230	5356452	It might not happen, but... Oh, somebody's suggesting you should do that file serve in Orange Lounge to get more people to come to the channel.
5357172	5357552	I could.
5357572	5358093	Okay.
5359273	5359473	Okay.
5360069	5361871	Just a thought.
5361891	5364534	See, other than that, there was a pretty cool thing I found about Step Mania.
5364635	5366276	It has a super shuffle mode.
5366417	5367358	That's also very fun.
5367638	5368339	Super shuffle?
5368459	5368679	Yeah.
5369040	5369801	Super duper shuffle?
5369821	5374266	Is that like all notes are completely randomized, not just all notes from up go to left or whatever?
5374747	5376489	Does that make us even more of a super duper power?
5378590	5380551	I have an addition for your sim update.
5380571	5390116	I know this is one you haven't really been following, but remember when we talked a couple weeks ago about the Dreamcast one that's coming out, the Feet of Fury?
5399546	5405289	I still play both of my Dreamcasts I played DDR the other day on my Dreamcast
5419080	5421022	Cryptic Illusions Games Dreamcast Emulator
5439497	5441819	They released an update on September 20th.
5441939	5445221	They're saying the release size is only going to be about 28 megs.
5445581	5448543	There's going to be seven songs in the beta they're going to release very soon.
5449404	5451145	There's going to be eight characters in it.
5452004	5459170	They're going to have a step editor, which is going to be... They've used it to create the steps they've got so far.
5460811	5470518	And they're going to have a swap CD capability, where you can use the swap CD menu, open up CDs and play your own songs with the music in Og Vorbis format, whatever that is.
5471078	5472399	Yes, Loki?
5473180	5474001	It's a new version.
5474221	5477343	It's like MP3s, except they're better quality and smaller size.
5477483	5477763	Thank you.
5478324	5481046	And the steps in the standard Dance with Intensity format.
5481953	5488477	Most of the basic stuff is supported, but nothing fourth mixer above, like BPM changes, pauses, freeze arrows, triplets, etc.
5489998	5491679	It's going to be very basic sorts of edits.
5492739	5493840	They'll post more about that.
5494680	5497662	Tentatively, they're going to have step files on the VMU.
5498302	5501724	It'll let you edit your steps for your own songs without having to burn a bunch of CDs.
5502505	5503105	That'll be pretty cool.
5504165	5506205	So we'll see about that.
5506866	5509746	Rumor is that's going to be released on October 1st, I guess.
5510206	5512267	So keep an eye on CAgames.com.
5512767	5518408	And as soon as we get our little hands on it, we'll give you a full review right here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5518888	5519648	What's the date today?
5520028	5520448	The 22nd.
5520988	5522689	So you've got about... Oh, actually, no, it won't be next week.
5522709	5523369	It'll be in a couple weeks.
5528210	5528890	We'll have it soon.
5529050	5530110	We'll have it soon.
5530150	5533111	When we get it, we'll tell you about it, as we always do here on Orange Lounge.
5534518	5537520	We're going to take one more quick break and then come back and wrap up the show.
5537560	5540742	But actually for this break, we've got a very special song.
5541122	5542222	Loki, you want to tell us about this song?
5542242	5544003	This is Night by Loki.
5544023	5545264	You want us to play this song for you?
5545284	5546305	Oh, this is one of my old songs.
5546325	5547305	I thought you wanted me to play this one.
5547325	5548366	You want to play one of the other ones instead?
5548925	5549385	Can we play two?
5549846	5550326	Can we play what?
5550506	5552267	Oh, they're kind of long, actually.
5552447	5556190	Yeah, they're all kind of long, so I just want to do one, if that's cool.
5556230	5557171	Let's play a newer one.
5557571	5559472	I mean, Nightmare's pretty good.
5560793	5563695	How about... Sorry, let me bring up your list.
5564736	5565416	Let's see.
5566097	5567217	Let's start with...
5570672	5571132	Dark Forest, Jenny Rom,
5600576	5601918	I'm going to try and get to those.
5602218	5606022	If we don't get to them during the show, we'll do them during the afterbirth, okay?
5606102	5606422	For sure.
5606882	5607423	So here we go.
5607463	5611407	This is Loki with Metropolis here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5649543	5650669	Thanks for watching!
5731048	5731591	Thanks for watching!
5861957	5862718	Thank you for watching!
5888255	5889235	Thank you for watching!
5913342	5919047	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
5924445	5926006	Hi, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5926026	5927887	You want to give a plug for people that like that song?
5927907	5929468	You got some good feedback in the chat room there, Loki.
5929488	5933990	You want to give a link for people that want to get more of your stuff?
5934370	5936972	Yeah, well, I've got some stuff on mp3.com right now.
5936992	5941754	I went under the name of Nightmare Hunter, so that was my old thing I used to go under.
5941794	5946437	Anyways, it's mp3.com slash nightmare underscore hunter.
5946857	5950379	So just look for that, and you'll find a bunch of my old stuff on there.
5951739	5952280	Pretty good one.
5952640	5952860	Well...
5953928	5954208	Sucks.
5954328	5955768	My one song on there, I have two.
5955868	5958309	I have one called Dark Side and My Nightmare.
5958629	5963970	Unfortunately, stupidmp3.com copied over My Nightmare with Dark Side, so I have two copies of that song on there.
5964470	5965991	And My Nightmare was really awesome.
5966351	5969371	I love that song, so if we can get to play that maybe by the end of the show, maybe.
5969391	5969852	Okay.
5969892	5970392	That'd be cool.
5970452	5971532	We'll get that worked in there somehow.
5971692	5974052	If not, we'll do it in the super secret after birth.
5974292	5975073	Yeah.
5976293	5977413	Now not so super secret.
5979154	5981034	Twins putting a link in the chat room for everybody.
5982452	5984734	Okay, one more topic I want to talk about before the end of the show.
5985194	5985494	I'm sorry?
5986255	5986495	Oh, okay.
5987275	5990418	I want to talk about fair pricing for DDR.
5990618	5996702	Because there's been some local arcades in the area that have kind of been wondering, you know, what's a fair price for us to be charging for DDR?
5996742	5998343	So I thought I'd take your guys' suggestions.
5998783	6002866	A lot of people bitch and bitch and bitch about the Metreon being on the high end of places.
6003046	6006809	I believe it's either $1.50 or $2 a game for three songs.
6007009	6009231	I think that's a little bit overpriced, even though it is downtown...
6010638	6014059	But you could get on TV on that show Extended Play.
6016299	6017740	It's worth the $2, man.
6019220	6019580	Or not.
6020920	6025221	Well, I think that places like Matreon, that's way too much.
6026001	6036224	I mean, I can see for newer mixes like Max 2 and maybe Max or Fifth Mix being four for three songs or something along that lines.
6036684	6038264	Like, I know the...
6039808	6042610	One Riptide Arcade, is that the one at Pier 39?
6043990	6050234	Yeah, that place has joint premium for Max 2, but it's like 8 quarters or something like that.
6050774	6054236	But it's expensive, but it's joint premium, so it's basically worth it.
6055297	6058618	So what you're saying is it costs $2 to play singles or doubles?
6059519	6060319	Ha ha ha.
6060599	6067023	Well, you just find someone to split it with, because I never go to an arcade alone, like if I know that I'm not going to meet anyone there.
6067603	6068444	So, that kind of stuff.
6069284	6070605	I've gone to arcades alone.
6071686	6072586	Nobody loves me.
6073287	6075228	I read the best to go to an arcade by myself.
6075568	6079591	No, but seriously, if I go to an arcade in Sacramento, I've never not seen anyone there.
6079711	6082873	Except that when they first got Max, I went there at 11 o'clock in the morning.
6083193	6083894	And I didn't see anyone there.
6083914	6085575	That's because they were asleep.
6085635	6087236	I was like, okay, I must play Max.
6087356	6093560	And then I played Fantasy on Reverse, and I've never played a Reverse in my life.
6093720	6096202	You had an interesting comment, Jamie, about Joint Premium.
6096322	6097283	Your thoughts on Joint Premium?
6097757	6099678	Well, it makes sense to have older machines.
6099718	6102920	If you've got multiple machines, have the older ones on joint premium.
6103641	6111085	That way you will encourage people to make use of those older machines too while you've got people that are on the more expensive machines.
6111425	6113727	That way all your machines will stay in use.
6114634	6116396	Good example is Scandia.
6116416	6118638	Over at Scandia, they've got the fourth mix.
6119179	6120981	Two tokens for three songs.
6121061	6122362	Joint premium is on.
6122843	6126687	So if two people want to play, it's one token for three songs apiece.
6127207	6127928	So that's really nice.
6128068	6129330	And what's worked for me...
6130536	6135460	I've gotten back into playing doubles thanks to that, because doubles are always expensive, and I always bitch about how expensive double are.
6135760	6140144	But for two tokens and joint premium being on, I can play three songs of doubles for two tokens.
6140184	6140904	That's really nice.
6141385	6142085	So, I like that.
6142906	6148851	And SoCalKicks is suggesting that, you know what, DarkSakura, you ought to just win the lottery and run an arcade the right way.
6149771	6152033	Hey, if I could, you know I would.
6152513	6154435	And Scandia rules because they have bumper boats.
6156016	6159419	Scandia does indeed have bumper boats, and they have a batting cage.
6161164	6162447	So joint premium is really cool.
6165559	6170563	So you think a fair price, if four tokens for three songs, let's say a dollar for three songs, too much?
6170583	6172805	I think 75 cents, a little more fair.
6173125	6175507	I mean, what's the most you will pay for DDR?
6175547	6179310	Have any of you ever paid to play DDR at the Metreon?
6179390	6179650	I have.
6179911	6184614	I paid $2 for three songs at Anime Expo my first year, but it was the first DDR machine I'd ever seen.
6185015	6185795	It was the third mix.
6186035	6191600	I played at the Metreon just because, like, yeah, it's the Metreon, and I didn't know about Gear 39, because that was stupid.
6192120	6214611	and so I paid way too much but yeah it's cool like I'm willing to pay a dollar for three songs I've gotten used to it because I remember when at first Roseville Golfland had gotten Guitar Freaks and there was all this people everyone was bitching including me going well it should be uh 75 cents for three songs or 50 cents for three songs because you know it's not DDR and DDR was
6215211	6217452	I paid $3 to play doubles at Phantomicon on a 4th bus machine.
6217472	6218653	If I made two years ago?
6218673	6219213	Was it two years ago?
6234720	6235020	This year.
6235161	6235781	Oh, they had it this year.
6235821	6238003	I didn't realize.
6238103	6243328	The year before, I paid $1.50 to play each game of DDR because it was a fourth plus.
6245150	6250575	Like I said, my first Anime Expo, I paid $2 a game to play on my very first ever DDR machine.
6252196	6254118	I mean, now we can afford to be picky.
6256715	6262558	I paid the full price over at the Metron a couple times just because I wanted to say I played DDR at the Metron.
6262598	6263198	That's all it was.
6263218	6265679	I just wanted to say, okay, you know, this is kind of like... I was there that time.
6265699	6266480	I played one game.
6267040	6269882	That was it for me because, you know, yay 5th Mix.
6269942	6271403	I could have played that anywhere at the time.
6273284	6273784	Not now.
6273804	6276586	5th Mix is becoming a relic along with... I know.
6276646	6278206	It's like Max 2s are everywhere.
6278246	6279767	You can't find the old stuff anymore.
6279787	6282729	I mean, Max 2's cool and all, but sometimes you just want to be old school.
6282749	6284390	You still need to get to Auburn to play the 2nd Mix.
6286229	6290272	That would be one of the definitive moments of my life, is playing a real second base.
6308274	6313698	It's just one game, you know, and plus I got to play the old school 1.5 mix, and how often do you get to play that anymore?
6314258	6318801	It was expensive, yes I was ripped off, but you know, it was fun, that's what it's all about, it was worth it.
6318881	6327887	Well the thing about that particular machine, the one that was out in the hall outside the movie theater, is you get the glare from those big windows outside, and half of the machine was faded in color.
6328047	6328287	Oh, yeah.
6328527	6333290	I mean, if I were a regular gamer living in San Francisco, I would not go to the Metreon on a regular basis.
6333370	6334710	In fact, I know someone who does.
6335070	6337251	And I'm like, why don't you go over to Riptide Arcade?
6337271	6339472	They got more money and they got a better deal on their games.
6339512	6340233	Why don't you go over there?
6340593	6343254	And it's just kind of like, oh, I don't feel like walking over there.
6343314	6344715	I don't feel like taking bar to the bus.
6344795	6347956	So it's just kind of like, well, if you really want to pay it, then go for it.
6348036	6351338	So, uh...
6354978	6357400	I guess that does it for DDR at the Metron.
6357440	6362843	And what about, so we think fair prices, typical standard is about what, 25 cents each song?
6363344	6363704	Pretty fair?
6363764	6366266	I'd probably say for a max two, fair is a dollar for three.
6368247	6373791	For, even for fifth mix, for fifth mix I'd say a dollar for four, anything under.
6374351	6384498	For third mix, for actually fourth mix and under, I would say three for four, or two for three, and leave it at that.
6385258	6387900	You know, for 1.5, you know, one for one.
6388980	6390942	SoCalKicks suggests... Or maybe one for three, I don't know.
6391522	6394304	SoCalKicks suggests 30 cents for five songs on a max too.
6394324	6396845	Okay, it has to be something realistic where the arcade owners are going to make their money back.
6397105	6399286	If it's a nickel arcade, that's a whole different story.
6401238	6405600	Okay, we're going to take one more quick break and then come back and wrap up the show.
6405740	6408501	The reason why we're taking this break, there's some songs I really want to play for you guys.
6408861	6414124	We've got Jenny Rom with a song called Do You Want to Flirt, which is one of the producers' favorite songs.
6414484	6420507	And then we're going to hear the full five-minute version of Steve Reiner with Dark Black Forest, Long Trip.
6420907	6424748	So we're going to play those and we're going to come back, wrap things up, and that'll be a show.
6424768	6426029	See you in a little bit.
6454927	6456068	Thanks for watching!
6538925	6539428	Thank you.
6624111	6625391	Thank you for watching!
6731385	6733047	It's a long way to go, honey.
6734229	6736212	I know, but I'm afraid.
6736232	6737814	Where are we going?
6739176	6741119	Into the dark, black forest.
6823887	6826444	into the dark black forest.
6953843	6957984	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
6958244	6959945	Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?
6959965	6960325	No!
6960445	6964086	Do we care what people think of us?
6964726	6966566	No!
6966586	6968027	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
6968507	6971327	Yes!
6972588	6974408	Extreme Bomani Radio.
6974648	6977329	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
6977867	6981710	Well, we're coming up on the end of the show here, Orange Lounge Radio episode number 13.
6982371	6984252	We had a big debate about that in the beginning of the show, by the way.
6984272	6987535	So I'm just going around the room collecting closing thoughts.
6988215	6989396	Loki, any closing thoughts?
6992399	6994160	No, duct tape is cool.
6995161	6996002	Duct tape is cool.
6996022	6996802	Duct tape is cool.
6996902	6998664	In fact, Naoki owns duct tape.
6998784	7000325	He will become one with duct tape.
7000465	7003487	Dear Diary, I've found many uses for duct tape.
7003848	7006390	Sometimes I'll strip down Politary and... Anyway...
7006940	7012044	I used it to attach my male member for when I wanted to change sexes.
7012284	7014686	You know, switching between Paul Terry and Naoki.
7014887	7017629	Did you ever see that one scene in Silence of the Lambs where it... Never mind.
7018429	7019250	No, I haven't.
7020571	7021032	Never mind.
7021052	7022092	And Dave, any thoughts from you?
7022132	7023313	And Dave, any final thoughts from you?
7024534	7026896	Um... Football is cool.
7027617	7029879	I hope DDR USA is.
7030980	7033021	I need to get a Japanese PS2.
7035217	7037102	Yeah, 2DX rule.
7038465	7039688	Any final thoughts from you, Jamie?
7040450	7041012	I like fire.
7042122	7044363	I like fire too, and that's my final thought.
7044944	7046825	So, thanks.
7047786	7049247	We light my fire.
