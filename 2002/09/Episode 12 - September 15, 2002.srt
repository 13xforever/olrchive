1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a video tape! Put it in, put it in!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Boring!

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This D.D.R. SUCKS!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
D.D.R.S.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The last Metroid is in captivity.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The galaxy is at peace.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
One, warmer, he's good.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Missed it by that much.

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,600
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,480
How can you tell?

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,840
I never forget a pussy.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,800
Cat.

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,520
Thirty-seven.

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,680
My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,320
In a row?

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,880
Shuh!

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,720
And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,560
You are the weakest thing to bite.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,880
So you get nothing!

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,600
You lose!

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
Good day, sir!

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,560
Dear diary,

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,720
my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,600
I would like, if I may,

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,280
to take you on a straight journey.

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Dark Sakura

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
I hate nature!

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,440
I just wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell.

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Sky

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Do I look like the weather girl?

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Everything alright?

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,120
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,680
Orange Lounge Radio

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,920
This is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 12.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Unfortunately the original intro to this show was lost in an archiving failure, so we're

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,680
We're going to simply kick off this rebroadcast of this episode by giving a big thanks to

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,460
our special in-studio guests Mel B and Sharks Girl.

44
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:30,460
We will now rejoin this encore presentation during the opening musical break.

45
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:19,200
That last that ever she saw him Carried away by a moonlight shining, shining

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Dressed unwarried and mourning

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Carried away by a moonlight stretch

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Far away on the other side

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,200
And she couldn't find how to push through

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
The trees that whisper in the evening

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Carried away by a moonlight stretch

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,600
Shown a song of sorrow and grieving

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,300
Carried away by a moonlight, check, check

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,700
All she saw was the feeling further gone

57
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Far away on the other side

58
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,200
He was shot six times by a man on the run

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
And she couldn't run, had to push through

60
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I stay, I pray to you in heaven far away

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:24,200
I say, I pray to you in heaven, one day, 4 a.m. in the morning

62
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Carried away by a moonlight church, I watch the vision falling

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Carried away by a moonlight church, the sun goes slurring every night

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,920
Far away on the other side

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,520
Will you come to talk to me this night?

66
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,520
But you couldn't find how to push through

67
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,400
I stay, I praise you in heaven far away

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,940
I say, I praise Thee, You in heaven one day

69
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Caught in the middle of a hundred fights The night was heavy and the air was the last

70
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:19,400
But she couldn't find her first move Carried away by a moonlight charge

71
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Carry away, like a moonlight shadow

72
00:07:49,400 --> 00:08:09,380
Guns and drugs are the key.

73
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,060
I've come to check on you

74
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,540
and I'll be back here.

75
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

76
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,540
Orange Lounge Radio, we are live here.

77
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,540
Oh, shut up, baby. The world's not that bad.

78
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,540
How would you like it if I shoved you back in?

79
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
So, hello to everybody. We've got a pretty full room here tonight.

80
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,540
It's gonna get hot in here very fast. This is why we have the lights out.

81
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,540
If you're viewing our webcam, which is at a top-secret location, which you can only get in our chat room,

82
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,540
then it's gonna be very dark in here. All the images are dark because we don't want to start sweating in here.

83
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,540
It's gonna turn into a sauna, and then we'll all have to take our clothes off, and that'll be the nudity.

84
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,540
That'll be the nudity.

85
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Wah wah wah. Dork.

86
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:16,720
I would like to apologize for anyone listening to this on the archives because I didn't start

87
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,200
the archive recording until that break, so you missed the intro of the show, but all

88
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,940
we were basically saying in the intro was that Mel B and Melody are here tonight, Sharks

89
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Last weekend I went to a gathering of a bunch of people, mostly a step squad, a few RTF.

90
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,460
I'll talk about those, just a bunch of people, we went bowling.

91
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,460
Bowling school.

92
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,740
I sucked so bad.

93
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,020
And then I got to see the crappiest machine in the universe.

94
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
What's that?

95
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,980
Stepping Sage.

96
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
I've never heard of Stepping Sage.

97
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,540
The most ghetto fabulous machine ever.

98
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,780
I have never even heard of step aces.

99
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,660
It ain't even ghetto fabulous, it's just ghetto.

100
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,560
It's like ghetto ass.

101
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,740
Okay.

102
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,860
Imagine

103
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,040
you have

104
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,060
a machine consisting of one large monitor in the center and two smaller

105
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,980
monitors on either side.

106
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,960
You have

107
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,960
a panel, like any normal dancing

108
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,640
stage except you have

109
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,940
two circles in the front,

110
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,020
two on the side,

111
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,540
and two in the back going making a sort of circle.

112
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,500
And then you have two dots on the screen.

113
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,460
And then whatever color goes up, you have to step on the corresponding color.

114
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,820
You know, I think it's like red at the top, yellow in the middle,

115
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,100
and blue in the back, or something like that.

116
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,740
Weird, OK.

117
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,900
And then you have the crappiest videos playing in the middle one.

118
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,580
All it is is like, OK, you know at Great America, the karaoke,

119
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,220
well, not the one that you actually sing with the make-your-own-video thing?

120
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,020
Right, OK, yeah.

121
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,900
Where you dance around in front of a blue screen or a green screen.

122
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,900
with those like it's just really lame if I know what you're talking about, yep.

123
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,860
Imagine this with like real people except the people think that they can dress

124
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,820
cool and know how to dance.

125
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,780
And they're the type of people who

126
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,620
think that they're doing so well that you really don't have the heart to tell them that they suck.

127
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,700
What kind of music is in this game? I never even played it.

128
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,740
We have Saturday Night, we have The Hustle,

129
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,560
we have Santa Maria, which I

130
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,560
who nearly threw up. By Samantha Fox? Yes, but it's not Samantha Fox.

131
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Yeah, they have I should be so lucky by kind of the word.

132
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,560
I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky. I know that one.

133
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,560
That's awesome. And they had Macho Man.

134
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Which was the worst. Like Williams? And they had

135
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,560
oh shoot, it was another something

136
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,560
I don't remember off the top of my head, but this machine just sucked.

137
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,560
it was sort of thrown away in the corner by the door, you know, like we really don't have

138
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,560
this here, they just make us. And then, you know, we played with, you know, balls all

139
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:33,040
day and then went back over for 2DX and I got to see my friend Liz, who I hadn't seen

140
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:41,640
in two years. I knew her before I actually met her at Automate Expo 2000, which was also

141
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,760
where I played my first EDR machine.

142
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,060
You interviewed Kim in these interviews, right, that you did?

143
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
I interviewed Liz.

144
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,060
I interviewed a bunch of people.

145
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
Oh, Liz did?

146
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,060
Okay, cool.

147
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,200
Liz is also, she's a San Toki on Steps Squad 4.

148
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,600
Ah, right on.

149
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Cool.

150
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,880
I want to talk to Mel and Mel for a minute here.

151
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,720
They went to the big Disney's Rave tournament on Friday, which none of us were able to go

152
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,080
to because we all have to work and then, you know, by the time, well at least I do.

153
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
What's that?

154
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Oh, you went for that week? That's right. Oh, well you guys...

155
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
I mock us unemployed people, why don't you?

156
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:22,080
I'm sorry. Well, if I worked in Milpitas, then I could get to the tournament in time, but I work here in Sacramento in it.

157
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Hey, I'm unemployed, don't you know?

158
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,080
But... Okay, I'll just shut up now then.

159
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Watch out before the unemployed rise up.

160
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
I know, I think the unemployed are going to rise up and kill me.

161
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Smoke power!

162
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,160
So tell us about the Disney's Rave Tournament. How did it go?

163
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,280
What were some things that... You have to explain

164
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,100
how a Disney's Rave Tournament worked for everybody out there who doesn't have a

165
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,960
Disney's Rave machine near them.

166
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,440
Okay, well, yeah,

167
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,080
quick rundown. The tourney was on a

168
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
dancing stage, Disney's Rave.

169
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,800
It was at Milpitas, and it was hosted in one of the party rooms.

170
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,400
And for the Perfect Attack tourney, it was all on doubles.

171
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,520
And because

172
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,840
Disney's Rave is a rather easy

173
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,000
machine to perfect attack anything on, like SSSs are very commonplace, they had set the

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,240
difficulty to eight. So it was like, you know, the good old third mix SSR days were four

175
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,840
goods and you were out. And people did fail during the tourney.

176
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,720
Oh, to fail a song on Disney's Rave, that's got to be the biggest heartbreaker.

177
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,840
Not necessarily. Some of the songs are in PowerPoint, some of them were ten footers,

178
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,760
like Twilight Zone and Ducking Hardcore, I mean.

179
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,440
I can just imagine Mr. Bassman.

180
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,440
The basement is actually relatively easy compared to some of the others.

181
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Wow. So, now, you came out of hiding, basically your freestyle retirement, and you did a freestyle at this tournament, correct?

182
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Yes, I did. I finally decided, hey, this is going to be a fun tourney, there's not that much pressure, what the heck.

183
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
So, yeah, I did the bump.

184
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Right on.

185
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,440
It's the most ghetto song out there, and I pretty much milked it for its ghetto factor.

186
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,160
Now, the last time Mel B was here on Orange Lounge about six or seven weeks ago now, the

187
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,840
last time he was here, we made an agreement that the next time he enters in the tournament,

188
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,920
he needs to do a knee drop and a hand slap.

189
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Did those two things get done?

190
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Yes, they did.

191
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Oh, my God.

192
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,360
And from what I understand, you got criticized by one of the judges for it, right?

193
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,800
Yes, one of the judges was, I wasn't so sure about that hand slap knee drop somewhere in

194
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
the game.

195
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I mean, I chained up pretty nicely.

196
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I kind of disguised it well.

197
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,560
I thought I did it with class and style and all those good things freestyle you should

198
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,920
be doing it with, but damn.

199
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,280
So if anybody wants to blame the low points of Mel B's routine, that would be our fault

200
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
here at Orange Lounge.

201
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
So you're welcome.

202
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,280
It was all in fun.

203
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,360
For the turnout I had on a Friday night, there was probably about maybe 20 routines or so

204
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
thereabouts.

205
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Not too bad.

206
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
18, 19.

207
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Yeah, it's cool.

208
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,360
And everyone was just having a good time more than anything.

209
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,360
There was maybe a few dance-y routines, but for the most part everyone was just goofed around.

210
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,360
It's Disney rave, you know? How seriously can you take it?

211
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Now, how many Macarena routines were there?

212
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
One.

213
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Just one, really? Did they actually do the Macarena?

214
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Not really, not. In fact, the audience did, although the funny thing was

215
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
it was Tigger, actually, of all people who did Macarena.

216
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,360
And at the end, he pretty much turned it into love to Macarena, complete with hand slaps and all that good schmazz.

217
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Right on.

218
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
That's awesome.

219
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
So, good tournament?

220
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,360
You think they need to do another Disney's Rave tournament in the future?

221
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Or was it just kind of a one-time, haha, that was funny, let's move on now?

222
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Maybe once in a blue moon, like once a year probably.

223
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:53,360
I doubt you'd see anything twice because a lot of people were having trouble enough trying to memorize steps, trying to get it up really for maternity, who knows.

224
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Good times, good times. Any other tournaments coming up that you want to tell us all about? Any more appearances you'll be making that you want to plug?

225
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:09,360
As far as I know, you'll probably catch me at a local 7-Eleven or something like that, you know, just catch me Thursday, I'm getting a vanilla coke Slurpee, yeah.

226
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,360
I'll be at the one on Branham and Monterey, yeah, in San Jose. Bingo.

227
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,960
But past that, as far as I know, I'm not too sure about any of the tourneys coming up.

228
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,240
I know Scandids, who's probably one of the bigger ones coming up in December, as soon

229
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,600
as I know more details about that, hey, I'll pass it on.

230
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,440
There's going to be a Sacramento tournament in November.

231
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Shh.

232
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Yeah.

233
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
To be determined.

234
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
To be determined.

235
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
In the works.

236
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,560
Let's talk to Melody for a minute.

237
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
How are you?

238
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm okay.

239
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,280
Now, you were just here a couple weeks ago, weren't you?

240
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Yeah, because I needed donuts and Mongolian.

241
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
And you got both those things today.

242
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
And now I have pants and a jacket.

243
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Now I have clothes to go with the Mongolian.

244
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Explain why you had to come up to Sacramento this time.

245
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
This time?

246
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Last time was for donuts.

247
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Last time was for donuts.

248
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,280
This time, I was on a quest to get a pair of pants at Express that I absolutely adore.

249
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,280
I called every single Express in Northern California.

250
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Only one had them in the right size, and it was here in Sacramento.

251
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,600
well hey i have a really good excuse to come up here

252
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
we're kicking around the idea anyway

253
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,240
middle-term just happened

254
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,480
we had to inform everyone that yes

255
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,200
and finally dropping it and i don't know what you're going to come up here

256
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,360
now waiting to see the video that's why can't wait for

257
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,680
there

258
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,400
three-minute video i think it's not just a three minutes

259
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,320
uh...

260
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,040
here comes rosie in jamaal

261
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
but on it

262
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,280
it's a wrestling video

263
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:48,280
But if you go on DDR Freak and the Miggle Attorney thread, there is a link to a three-minute video on there that has some highlights from the Miggle Attorney until the actual videos come up.

264
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,280
But I haven't been able to finish downloading it myself, considering my computer crashed IE in the middle of it, so...

265
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,280
They're giving a link in the chat room. If you want to get that three-minute video, it's at evil.fukuk.org.

266
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,280
And fukuk is spelled, by the way, F-C-U-K. I don't think that has anything to do with French Connection.

267
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,920
an independent side of that. I think frenchconnections is fcuk.com. I have a fkuk shirt, fkuk games.

268
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,640
I wear that to all the tournaments. I've seen that. Yeah. I didn't even. Oh yes. And anyone

269
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,580
who downloaded the video, I make a brief one half second appearance in it. Nice. What are

270
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:28,240
you doing? Are you talking? No, no, I'm like watching Cory play Drummania. Right on, right

271
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:36,320
And then there's also, you can download it from oralseh.cx, oralseh.cx is another site

272
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,760
you can get it.

273
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,320
And everybody's sharing when they appear in the video.

274
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,280
See, I have to get my computer to actually cooperate and download it without crashing

275
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,440
my browser in the middle of it.

276
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,960
Black Lab is in the chat room saying, I appear in it twice, I'm in it twice.

277
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,520
I guess it must just be a really fast clip kind of thing where it just got everybody

278
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
in there.

279
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
It's kind of cool, actually.

280
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
I only saw half of it.

281
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,920
Were you? Did you spot yourself?

282
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,960
I have not seen myself yet. Well, maybe you're in the second half.

283
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,480
It could be, but... One day we'll bring a video camera in here and we'll do a

284
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,360
quick promo or something.

285
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,640
But probably the greatest cameo we saw in the video that we did see from the tourney

286
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,080
was a

287
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,440
kneeling pad, of all things.

288
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,300
It was a cow kneeling pad. True story. I mean, quick rundown for everyone out there. Sure, sure.

289
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,360
Me and Melody, we were over at Target one night

290
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:35,360
And then we was just checking out some stuff and then we see, I come by the gardening section, I see these things, they're butterfly knee pads, literally, knee pads with butterflies on them.

291
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:44,360
And you know, I thought, dude, that must be like the greatest gift we could give at a tourney, like, we should give the worst freestyler, you know, a set of butterfly knee pads and just send them on their way.

292
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,360
But right next to it, we saw a cow kneeling pad, and since one of our friends is big on cows, you know, we thought that'd be cool.

293
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,280
and see that was a kneeling pad, we were already thinking the wrong things with that. So, we

294
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,080
gave the gift to our friend over at the tourney and next thing you know everyone was abusing

295
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,080
it and all sorts of... I think the cow saw more action than anyone else that night. Jamie

296
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,960
just pissed her pants at something here, it just happened. She just read that the local

297
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,960
off land here in Roselle, got a crane game! Explain your obsession with the crane game

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,240
for a minute, I'm sorry to change the subject on your melody. First off, Jamie, I'm hiding

299
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,200
my keys from you right now. Yeah, you are not, Jamie has to be rationed on how much

300
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,200
money she can spend on the crane game. I rape the crane games. Now, it's not one of those,

301
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,700
I need to talk to JB for a minute who's telling us about this, it's not one of those shitty

302
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,120
cranes for candy type thing, is it? Cause that, that don't count. Yeah, that doesn't

303
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Give us a quarter so we can give you two cents worth of candy game.

304
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
It needs to have the claw.

305
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Who will stay and who will go?

306
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,120
What's the best thing you ever won on a crane game, Jamie?

307
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Well, there was Vegas in January when I won three Clifford dogs, three stuffed robo dogs, and seven bears.

308
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,120
JB says it's shitty stuffed animals.

309
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,120
I am all over shitty stuffed animals.

310
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,120
There's not a crane game unless the animals are shitty. It just doesn't happen that way.

311
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,120
It's always choose the worst looking ugliest piece of crap you see in there and you will get it first try.

312
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Don't make fun of my shitty animals! Damn Mongolians!

313
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,120
The best thing I ever won, and of all places this was at Sviggle, I got Tyrone.

314
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Oh yeah, Tyrone. Tyrone was the best. Where is Tyrone?

315
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Tyrone is currently in lockup with his pussies and bitches.

316
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,580
Tyrone, by the way, and maybe I'll find during the next week I'll find a link to a

317
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,200
picture of Tyrone and put it in the chat room because I know I have one up.

318
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,740
If anybody knows of my secret picture page, it's in there with Sunnyvale

319
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,280
Tournament pictures.

320
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,940
Tyrone is a little stuffed bear that wears like a little

321
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,940
beanie bear.

322
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
He's a real beanie bear.

323
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:03,260
He's a brown bear wearing a deep maroon smoking jacket.

324
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:10,780
his name literally is Tyrone. He is the coolest bear in the world. He has, he has bitches

325
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:18,700
thanks to Melody. And he has pussies. You know how hard it is to find little tiny dogs

326
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,020
and just to be wandering around Target saying, wow, I need to get some bitches around here

327
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,940
somewhere and how, especially when you're in the toy section and all the kids are wandering

328
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,940
I was just like, hmm, I need some bitches here.

329
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Um, yeah, could I get a price check on bitches in aisle three?

330
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,940

342
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,780
New Songs Collection. Dude, Bimania. That's what the parents are doing to you while you're

343
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,500
playing the game, you know, and like all their little kids are up there and you're trying

344
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,340
to tell the little kids to get away and the parents come up to you and go, what do you

345
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,980
think you're doing? Why is it not your game? You don't want to hear it? It's not their

346
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,980
game either. Bitchmania, I know it's not their game either. Jamie is excellent at playing

347
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,520
Bitchmania with the parents. It's like, what am I doing? I'm trying to keep your kid from

348
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,920
getting killed that's what I'm doing did I had a chance to do it on Wednesday

349
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,040
night I didn't tell you about that just another stupid stupid you know mom

350
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,080
letting her child run rampant on the thing and I was like you need to control

351
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,720
your little you know spawn there you actually referred to the child as spawn

352
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,800
no I said their child but I was think well there was also the incident with

353
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,560
the giggling idiots oh yeah if you ever seen the clerks cartoon yeah and the two

354
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,360
giggling girls

355
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,360
that's like what these chicks are like you know

356
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
sitting over

357
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,680
over uh... at the little tables and i was watching uh...

358
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,200
i think

359
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,240
who was this playing para para i think it was uh...

360
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,480
sydney that was playing

361
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,200
playing um...

362
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,960
para para

363
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,040
but they were like

364
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,240
i was wearing okay i don't know if anyone watches digi kart but i had a black

365
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,680
gamagemadon hat

366
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
with the little pointy horns on it

367
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:53,640
one of them came over and says, I like how you go, thank you, until she walks off. And

368
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,720
then they like pointed to the African that was on my purse and goes, and one of them

369
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,640
came over and I was like, she's like, would you eat your dog? Go away. No, no, no, tell

370
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:12,140
me, would you eat your dog? Go away. Why won't you tell me? Do I have to have you removed?

371
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,140
And she left.

372
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,500
No, I wanted them all dead.

373
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
You wanted to kill them all.

374
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,860
You know what this is kind of turning into here, I think?

375
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,100
I think we need to get into this.

376
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,900
I think we need to get into the FU of the week.

377
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,180
The fuck yous of the week.

378
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,500
Let's have at it, shall we?

379
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,100
Do you have another one you want to start us off with, Jamie?

380
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
I'm sure I can think of one.

381
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,660
Because I've been getting a lot in the chat room that I can talk about.

382
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,340
I don't really have one myself, but let's hear it, Jamie.

383
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,740
Let's hear your FU of the week.

384
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,540
My first one of course goes towards those, you know, crappy, giggling, stupid, moron,

385
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,780
stupid fucks that Rizzo got there.

386
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,420
My other fuck you of the week goes towards idiots in general because I hate them.

387
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,420
Especially idiots...

388
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,420
What?

389
00:26:52,420 --> 00:27:00,060
That's rather vague in general, but I kind of like it.

390
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:07,340
Well, no, there's the people who will fall for just about anything that you put in front

391
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,340
of them.

392
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:15,740
narrow down this level of idiocy to cheat, to the people who will blindly follow one

393
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,980
voice and think that they are who all end all. There's nothing wrong with fanboys and

394
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,540
fangirls. There's a thing with people who are fanboys and fangirls to the exception

395
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,940
of all else, who will take anything that they hear on TV, anything on the radio, by the

396
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:38,940
they do everything I say, anything that they read and acts like it is, you know, the absolute

397
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,820
scripture that they need to live their lives by. Oh my God, I must buy this thing for the

398
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:51,820
sake of my American pride. Oh my God, orange is the new red. Exactly. You ever saw Josie

399
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,820
and the Pussycats, one of the rudest ever? But that is exactly the thing that I, and

400
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
I think there's some people who think,

401
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,820
oh well, you know, my life isn't very important,

402
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,820
so I'm gonna make up something really stupid so I can get on CNN.

403
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,820
But no, I'm not talking about, you know, about...

404
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Oh my god, I'm gonna tell a waitress at Shoney's that my van has a bomb in it

405
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
and I'm gonna go blow something up.

406
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Oh my god!

407
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,820
Boy, that killed the conversation, didn't it?

408
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Anybody else in here? Oh, are you done with your...?

409
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
No, I just don't like stupid people.

410
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Okay, any other rants you have?

411
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,820
Alright, then we've got, we've got Loki's got his rant, let's hear it, Loki.

412
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:37,820
Alright, my first FU of the Week goes to, uh, the new version of DWI, which I'll go over that later.

413
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes.

414
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,820
But that thing didn't work again.

415
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,820
Not much of a surprise, they just can't program it right for some reason.

416
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,820
I guess it's just incompatible with my computer.

417
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,820
Uh, my second FU of the Week would have to go to...

418
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,820
By the way, Loki, happy birthday.

419
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,820
Yes, actually.

420
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,940
little your little party you had last night was quite quite nice thank you for

421
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,140
reminding me that's my second nephew of the week is to 9-11 god damn it I had

422
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:06,460
that birthday 21 years before that it's not fair everyone's like everyone's like

423
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:14,900
oh your birthday's on 9-11 I'm sorry I'm not fuck you

424
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,340
yeah so pretty much every year from now on everyone at my work and all that stuff

425
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:26,340
They actually forget my birthday because of 9-11 and the new version of D.W.I.

426
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,340
moment of political uncorrectness.

427
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Speaking of political uncorrectness.

428
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Or correctness or whatever.

429
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
My music please.

430
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,340
I have a request for my song since you know

431
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,340
if that Drop the Bomb doesn't really work with

432
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,340
9-11, maybe you can change it to

433
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
Crash. Anyway,

434
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,340
you have to save me a few of the weeks.

435
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
My other one

436
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,340
is also directed in

437
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,340
a similar fashion toward

438
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,340
the whole 9-11 thing.

439
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,180
and for people who saw my big rent my life journal

440
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,100
it's actually directed toward consumerism in general

441
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,220
right in the consumer or and how

442
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,060
this goes toward all those people who are trying to make as you know quick

443
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,380
bucks off a tragedy

444
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,660
like you

445
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,760
thank you thank you thank you go to hell and die there

446
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,820
and um... you know just after that

447
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,260
they needed a holiday

448
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,940
it's now patriots day

449
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,180
no longer will it be called nine eleven that's not like the greatest sale at

450
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,100
JCPenney's

451
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,360
Patriot's Day sale! Yay!

452
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:58,360
But that's awesome, because I get that day off every year, hopefully.

453
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,340
Any other FUs on anything in general?

454
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,100
Aw, Melby's got one.

455
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,780
I don't have Mel music, but I'll find Mel music really fast. Let's see, Mel music, Mel music.

456
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,740
What would work for Mel music? Let's try...

457
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,840
uh...

458
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,300
i will

459
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,180
excellent choice my man, anyway i got one big f you actually

460
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,440
not just one person, not even out there, it's a whole damn city

461
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,060
it's the city of milpitas

462
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,680
i don't know most of you who have been out there in a while but

463
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,400
apparently there was a problem about a month ago

464
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,760
yeah a month and a half, two months ago

465
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,760
or apparently a pipe that was a pump to pull from the site.

466
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Here, since I know the story, there's a saltwater pond apparently on the edge of Lopeda in San Jose.

467
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,760
And it has lots of, it's like 650 acres, it's huge.

468
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,760
And it's got lots of nice little organisms and crap in it, and the pump broke.

469
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,760
And it's been very warm in the area, and lots of nice little organisms and stuff in there.

470
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Ha ha! Smells like poopy!

471
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Um, try, like, bad sushi. Constantly.

472
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,760
Really horrible. It just smells all day long.

473
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
That feels so bad for people who work at-

474
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Like, worse than the sushi place at the Metreon?

475
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
I'm just kidding. I'd never heard that before.

476
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Yeah, seriously, I mean-

477
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
I'm trying to think of an easy place to knock.

478
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:43,760
I feel so bad for people who work at Dave & Buster's. They gotta sit out there all day long and inhale this and they just get headaches.

479
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,760
You gotta wonder though, because I've been to Illuminations, the candle store, and I've asked the chicks that work there,

480
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,760
doesn't it get annoying after a while smelling like candle, and they say they get used to it.

481
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,760
So you gotta wonder if Dave & Buster's people get used to the raw sushi smell.

482
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,760
I actually, since I'm the nice person that I am, I actually talk to the doormat when I go in at Dave & Buster's.

483
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,560
how the hell do you live with this smell you know we get headaches all the time

484
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,640
we can't stand it they actually still smell it believe me i will run from my

485
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,280
car to the door and get in as fast as i can

486
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,480
mel and i wear milk is getting gas he opened the window to my car i started

487
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,480
screaming at him shut the damn window it's gonna smell like fucking fish in

488
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,720
here

489
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,640
but yeah so in general fucking milk pitas

490
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,200
uh...

491
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,240
i can't even continue

492
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,200
uh...

493
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,200

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,160
whatever will be pulled up to you

496
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,020
it's that the people's choice the people's at the old

497
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,520
uh... let's uh... go to be a piece of the chat

498
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,040

499
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,120
uh... if you to windows exp because it's crashed on again and it's making the

500
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,560
format is drive again this week

501
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,280
and ten society

502
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,480
so-called kick says his nephew the week is child proof safety caps

503
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,160
it took them seven tries to open the new bottle of pills that he got today in a

504
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,960
new bottle

505
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,760
out

506
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,680
the telephone

507
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,060
yep

508
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,840
that's a crack put it back

509
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,580
Uh, DCB has a Fuck You of the Week, and he says it's to his parents.

510
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,380
Typical T-Necks there,

511
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,760
for not letting him buy 2DX because it's too expensive.

512
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,840
So now he's stuck with a 2DX controller and nothing to play except for five key games,

513
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,400
which get boring fast.

514
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,400
I recommend Sixth and Core, because it's almost just like 2DX.

515
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,460
When I was your age, we didn't have this media stuff.

516
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,280
We had to play on the power pad.

517
00:34:51,280 --> 00:35:00,280
It was Power Club, and all we had was Excitebike and Gyromite.

518
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,040
attorney, thusly getting him in deep shit with the parents.

519
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Fuck Denny's.

520
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Oh.

521
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Eda Karras.

522
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,360
Loki's got a, Loki's got an F.U. the week right behind him.

523
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,400
Well, speaking of Denny's, uh, I don't know what it is about Denny's, but every time I

524
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,480
go in there, they have to do one of two things, either A, forget something I ordered, or B,

525
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,360
make fun of my shirt, because normally I have, normally I have a shirt on there, and it'll

526
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,400
have like a phrase.

527
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
One time I had one that said, I hear voices and they don't like it.

528
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Do you really hear voices?

529
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Why don't you like me?

530
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,200
I hear one really annoying voice right now. Cram it!

531
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,200
So, F you to Denny's, because they suck.

532
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Alright, fair enough. Carole's better anyway.

533
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,200
If you ever go to the Carole's in Roseville, ask for Mary Lou, she's sweetie.

534
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Yes she is, and tip her well.

535
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Three more, three more F you's.

536
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,200
23rd Magus says, oh, he wants two.

537
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,320
he says a continued fuck you to boom PlayStation, oh PlayStation 2 USB

538
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,720
converters, those controller converters, and also a good sized FU to the player

539
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,400
one keys on RVGL's hip-hop mania. You know what I would have to second that

540
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,200
except the way that I play I really don't have an issue with it.

541
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,720
Joe mama says FU from school for being morons they gave him three detentions

542
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,620
for nothing

543
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:47,640
i somehow wonder if he really did nothing

544
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,360
well i was only late a couple times that's not that

545
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,040
i don't know what we got to know what do you really do it

546
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,680
i really didn't think that i was bad

547
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,000
yeah i really didn't anybody

548
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
jay-b says f you to carol's for being slow

549
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,160
f you jay-b

550
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,160
No, we have to add IHOP to that list because we had some slow-ass service there after making it all the other day.

551
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Joe Mama got detention because he quote-unquote missed a class.

552
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Oh yeah, and furthermore, from all I know, that's just stupid.

553
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Did he miss a class because he was out back smoking pot or what?

554
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:29,160
I don't know, but to continue that IHOP thought, I'm just thinking that's just four reasons why we've got to have a rockfish and waffles up in NorCal.

555
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Please.

556
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
A chicken and waffle!

557
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,640
into that you know what yes and that's it just one day come to my house I will

558
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:48,360
make you French toast because I will like that it's just not the same they

559
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,320
add crack to their chicken and waffles I'm talking about I hopping caros and

560
00:37:52,320 --> 00:38:00,720
Denny's in those crappy places sorry we are we have to take this show down to

561
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,600
SoCal sometime. We're going to tape a show in SoCal at some point, somehow.

562
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,480
A.I. Chip, anyone?

563
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Do you guys want to take our recorder? If you guys live close by, I'd let you take the recorder and tape fun stuff.

564
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,020
Well, we're going to A.I. for a while, but I don't know if we're going to see anyone entertaining. We could take it on rides at Disneyland and start screaming randomly or something.

565
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,720
You know, cause

566
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,920
now I'm thinking of how I could make this work. I might be able to let you guys borrow the

567
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,800
remote unit for a while if you guys want to tape your adventures. Unfortunately, they won't let

568
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
quarters or anything if the price is right.

569
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Well, I mean the rest of your vendors, you could go to AI or whatever.

570
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
Oh, we're going to AI.

571
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
A live review of Marshall B.

572
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
A live review of Marshall B. complete with punching and sweating and all that good schman.

573
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
And everybody was kung fu fighting.

574
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
And everybody was kung fu fighting.

575
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
And the moment in my head was kick punch.

576
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Well actually we should do a review for punch mania, they have it at Florin now.

577
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,800
That's what I hear is that Florin Mall here in Sacramento got punch mania.

578
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
That's the fist of the north star one.

579
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
The fist of the north star one, yep.

580
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:00,120
ass fucking mall got punch mania so the gang members can train I drove by there

581
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,220
that place was scary it is very scary and desolate looking but they have pump

582
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:10,680
it up you have pump it up ooh pump it up with me bounce with me bounce with me

583
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:16,640
down yeah yes oh speaking of what a lot oh I see you're telling me to do a

584
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,160
segue okay yes let's do this segue this is something we've actually talked about

585
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,000
about on the show before, but this is interesting.

586
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,920
I find this interesting only because this is a story

587
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,380
that is actually posted on Konami's site in the UK.

588
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,680
This is Konami Amusement of Europe.

589
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,080
This is their stance on the Konami versus Anamiro,

590
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,760
which is the company that makes Pump It Up.

591
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,160
This is their words on that whole lawsuit,

592
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,240
and this is why it's interesting.

593
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,800
This is the first, I think this is the first real comment

594
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,500
I've seen from Konami on this whole thing,

595
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,800
so let's read this, shall we?

596
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,000
This is from Konami's site.

597
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,400
It says, Konami's legal eagles

598
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,520
have always had their hands full defending Dance Dance Revolution's genre, spawning style

599
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,560
from being copied all over the world, but this latest attempt by company Andamaro, they

600
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,560
call it Andamaro, has evened them slightly taken aback.

601
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,160
This time it appears the Korean company's strategy was to claim they actually invented

602
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,960
DDR in the first place, despite the fact it took them almost two years to make their complaint.

603
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,160
It's kind of interesting because they're kind of taking jabs then to Miro, which you don't

604
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,580
usually see in company press releases, but of course in Europe everything's tabloid.

605
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,440
It's all about, you know, at least from what I've seen.

606
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,420
The parties have been involved in legal disputes since then in front of the Korean and the

607
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,420
U.S. courts.

608
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,100
Now that's interesting because I don't think we've ever heard before that this thing's

609
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,880
been in the U.S. courts, but this says it has.

610
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,800
Onomiro started manufacturing and distributing Pump It Up Dance Simulation Game, which was

611
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,180
very similar to Konami's Dance Dance Revolution during September 1999.

612
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,400
Konami filed a complaint with the Seoul District Court seeking an injunction against the production

613
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,120
of Pump It Up as it integrated Konami's design, right, and violated unfair competition law.

614
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,620
The court favored Konami's claim in June of 2001, but Andamuro appealed to the Seoul High

615
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,240
Court, that would be in Korea.

616
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,160
Then in August of 2000, Andamuro filed a complaint against Konami seeking an injunction to the

617
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,080
distribution of Dance Dance Revolution in the United States.

618
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,720
The reason was that Konami infringed the patent and Amuro had been assigned from a third party

619
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,960
in the U.S.

620
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,320
The case was scheduled for jury trial this month.

621
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,400
So interesting.

622
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,540
And Amuro filed a complaint against Konami seeking an injunction against the distribution

623
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,120
of Dance's Revolution in the United States.

624
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,120
No U.S. mixes lately.

625
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
Hmm.

626
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,920
However, at the last minute, and Amuro made a snap proposal to settle the dispute via

627
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,600
negotiations and it has been confirmed that and Amuro would respect Konami's intellectual

628
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,200
property rights and pay a settlement fee for their use. As a result, both parties agreed

629
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,600
to withdraw the lawsuits in Korea and the U.S.

630
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,400
So that opens the door.

631
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,340
Yep. So that's that. That's an official word from Konami of the U.K. And it says some very

632
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,980
interesting things in there that we might not have known before. Anybody want to comment

633
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,300
on this story? Have anything to say about it? Yes, Loki.

634
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,280
Does that mean we're going to see some U.S. pump-it-up machines?

635
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,040
I think Pump It Up's already kind of been distributed in the U.S.

636
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,760
I mean, I'm going to say, you seem to know about this, Mal, you know, if Animuro's kind of localized in the U.S.

637
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,320
I know they've kind of been hawking the machines to U.S. arcades,

638
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:27,560
but of course there's companies out there that hawk the Macs too, like, to U.S. arcades too, so I don't know if Animuro's necessarily

639
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,840
launched in the U.S., but...

640
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,320
Well, it has been targeted in the U.S. for a while. I mean, like, if you went to...

641
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,400
I forget what the major arcade, uh,

642
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,200
arcade game convention is in Vegas.

643
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Not E3, definitely.

644
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
I think the arcade, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

645
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Yeah, well yeah, Pump It Up was being demonstrated out there.

646
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,200
So I think it was starting with the Premiere mix, the international one.

647
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,200
The one that had like Britney songs and you know, Bye Bye Bye and all that stuff.

648
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:01,200
That was targeted for the U.S. and that's why you started seeing it streaming in places like D&B or other types of arcades.

649
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,200
And that's pretty much, and then they had Premiere 2 recently and that's been a big U.S. distribution type thing.

650
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Pretty much, I remember talking to Jason Nenos about a year ago when I did a big interview for DDR Spot.

651
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
Right, I remember reading that.

652
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:20,200
And kind of off the record, we were talking about, well, how come you would never see economics or anything in arcade yet?

653
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:27,200
He had told us, basically, it would have been a really bad move to put out, like during this whole lawsuit, to put out a new US mix.

654
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,200
So, Andy Merrill would be saying, you know, what kind of strategy is that?

655
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,200
you're being sued for something and you're already putting out a new arcade mix, that's

656
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
not right. It wouldn't look good.

657
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Right. But now this kind of opens the door here, it looks like, sounds like, so who knows

658
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
what might happen.

659
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Yeah, I'm guessing probably someone else is going to distribute the Konami game since,

660
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,200
yeah, I guess Konami shut down its coin-oppa division.

661
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Oh yeah, I think it's a given somebody's going to step in and fill in that void and we'll

662
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,200
see something coming from Konami in the near future.

663
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
Possibly.

664
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Well see, maybe in the future we can get Jason on this show. We've got to work on that. We've got to try and smooth him to get him on this program at some point.

665
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:14,200
Well, I've got pretty good, you know, friends with him that are going to talk to us on the spot right now while we're going through our new workouts and launches.

666
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:25,200
I was about to ask, what's going on? Do you want to update us on DDR Spot? I keep forgetting you're a major part of the DDR Spot group, so do you want to say any plugs for DDR Spot? What's going on there?

667
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Yeah, our site is down for more maybe because we're going for a new launch right now

668
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:36,000
We're basically tweaking a few things on the back end. We're targeting something to probably late this week

669
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,840
We're about to launch everything. It's going to have a new look new feel

670
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,440
Oh

671
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,520
It's gonna have quite a few new goodies and a lot of things that haven't been there before and haven't been on really on any

672
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,560
Other GDR sites one thing I have to ask you can say no comment if you want forums

673
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,400
And try that again. Uh, we're looking at something alternate to forums actually, okay, I

674
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:05,400
I don't know if I'm necessarily at liberty to say it right now, but I will say there will be a way you can interact with all members without having forums.

675
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,400
There's a way to interact one-on-one with either the members, the lurkers, or with the staff itself.

676
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Alright, don't want to get you in trouble, so we'll just say tune in to win. Wow.

677
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Alright, so ddrspot.com coming back very soon, keep an eye on it. I'm sure they'll announce that everywhere.

678
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,400
We'll mention it on this show for sure once we see this back up.

679
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Yeah, wonderful, and maybe we'll have the staff here sometime as well, too.

680
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:00,300
Instant Love. It was basically a training stage in Beatmania 3. Now, you're gonna hear

681
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,020
a lot of the talking from DJ Konami telling you how to play Beatmania, but concentrate

682
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,540
on the background. You'll actually hear the lyrics for Let the Move being sung by a guy,

683
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,860
and it's actually good. Alright, we'll see. And there's no, Let the Move, that's not in

684
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:19,820
this at all. So what I'm gonna try to do is actually find, I believe it's DJ, oh shit,

685
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:33,820
I'm going to try to find his CD. I think he actually put out a CD because I was visiting his website, and we're trying to find that, import it, and maybe there will be a clean version of Instant Love we can listen to, but I have no guarantees on that.

686
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,820
But just listen to the background.

687
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,820
Okay, so this is the one time we're going to make an exception and actually play Let Them Move, because this is a good version.

688
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:46,820
Yeah, just try not to be annoyed by DJ Konami telling you how to play Beatmania, but just listen to the background and...

689
00:46:46,820 --> 00:47:00,680
For any of the old-school hip-hop heads, I think DJ Kanami looks straight up like a broke-ass

690
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,320
that five freddy

691
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,280
yeah

692
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,160
after that uh... jamie has a special request for song you wanna give a little

693
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,400
background about the fast well for anyone who's ever played in the of the

694
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,400
ddr club mixes uh... you might remember i think the flow jack

695
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,280
by inflow

696
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,100
this is the mister drunk remix

697
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,980
who i like anything with or drunk in it

698
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,140
my favorite version of the phone ever

699
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,120
all right so we're gonna hear those right now here on the orange lounge

700
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,240
radio

701
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,240
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!

702
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,240
I know you all know beatmania, but I wanna go back and teach you the basics.

703
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,240
Listen carefully and try to follow.

704
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
The object will come down from the top.

705
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,240
When it hits the red line, push the button.

706
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,240
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

707
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,240
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

708
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,240
First, hit the white keys.

709
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,240
Now, hit the black keys.

710
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:23,240
Okay! Now a combination of both white and black keys!

711
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:34,240
Easy, huh?

712
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,240
Alright, let's go on to the Scratch Game!

713
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,240
When the objects reach the red line, Scratch!

714
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,240
With a fact note, the technique is to Scratch fast!

715
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,240
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

716
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,240
It's hard, but you can do it!

717
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Okay, effector time!

718
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,240
And here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

719
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Look, way below, do you see the foot switch?

720
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,240
That's the effect on and on switch.

721
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,240
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

722
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,240
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

723
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,240
Hey, did you hear the variety of effects?

724
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:56,240
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

725
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,240
This powerful sound system's whooping, everybody!

726
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Ha!

727
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
All right, gotta go!

728
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:16,240
Knock me out with your fabulous sounds on this very little version of the speed mania!

729
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,240
Ladies and Gentlemen.

730
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,240
LADIES AND JUTTURES

731
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,240
I GOTTA GO FLIGHT FINGERS

732
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,240
Tell me that tomorrow won't go so soon

733
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,240
I gotta get through to you

734
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,240
Show me that tomorrow won't go so soon

735
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,240
I gotta make that move

736
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,240
Ain't nothin' more, won't go so slow

737
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,240
It's nothin' I gotta do

738
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,240
Ain't nothin' more, won't go so slow

739
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,240
I gotta get through you

740
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,240
Many midnight runs, sometimes I feel so blue

741
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,240
I passed 100 like I never knew

742
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,240
I close my eyes, pretend that you are here

743
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:23,080
Oh, yeah. Let me feel the workflow till you disappear.

744
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:23,980
Ohh yeah.

745
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,920
I established order in this sector, guardian angel reflect the light, lyrically I own the mic.

746
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,080
You slept the devil take the put, you established order in this sector, guardian angel reflect the light, lyrically I own the mic.

747
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:38,320
You established order in this sector, guardian angel reflect the light, lyrically I own the mic.

748
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,240
You established order in this sector, guardian angel reflect the light, lyrically I own the mic.

749
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,240
I left the devil tape that I threw at your order in this sector

750
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,240
Guardian angel reflect the light lyrically I own the mic

751
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,240
You slept the devil tape that you ejected

752
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,240
Want you, return you want to

753
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Hang with the one you dissed before and slam the presently

754
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,240
And conjure up some hallucination

755
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Identify them stations where my vocals heard

756
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,240
Count the total verbs, be flippin' at the local words

757
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,240
My destiny, separate a to leave

758
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,240
Forget Maybelline, I got no babies

759
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,240
One of my shows, then your nose without antihistamine

760
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,240
I'm in the future, emcees who misdemean as left to be

761
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,240
History's a hoocha, think you spittin' at

762
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,600
Think you spittin' at, I represent a different map

763
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,140
Hip-hop diplomat, I've already seen a tip of that

764
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,340
D.R.I.D., yeah, I'm original flowjack

765
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,140
God glorify it, for the spiritual elitist crack

766
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,840
Remain anonymous, my lyrics sound pitch astronomer

767
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,040
Ear-tied apparel, third commandment before I die

768
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,740
When you know tomorrow won't come so soon

769
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,040
I gotta get through to you, fool

770
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,740
When you know tomorrow won't come so soon

771
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,040
I gotta make that move

772
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,040
When you know tomorrow won't come so soon

773
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,040
It's not that I've got to do

774
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,040
You know tomorrow won't come so soon

775
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,040
I gotta get through you

776
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,040
I've been wondering what's gotten into me

777
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,040
Those sweet words are hard to believe

778
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,040
Stop playing games and let me let you know

779
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,040
It ain't just what you show by why you show this

780
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,040
This world will flow like there's no tomorrow

781
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,640
I pastelate any track or verbiage I extract

782
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,340
Expect a less for maxi, mums and cats be done with this illness

783
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,240
I contract, I commit to act of subtraction

784
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,940
A whack run, even snatch crumbs are financially bad munch

785
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,840
You be messing with the rare specimen

786
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,240
Whose vision is a danger?

787
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,940
Just get your action and tangent off the track while I be ever changing

788
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,140
You wonder where all these thoughts come from

789
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,640
Verbal, the mind-toucher, fallin' for you like point on

790
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,640
As I mime it, like it was vomit profusely

791
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,240
Fart on the language, not excuse me

792
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,440
As I enter my archives, I choose these methods

793
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,640
But wish to carry out, whether by land or aerial

794
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,640
Cause this kid cannot be stereo, talk out with brothers that marry him

795
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,640
Right for harvest, new jack, but not a novice

796
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,640
Caught as a hip-hop fan, blowin' away emcees like artists

797
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,640
I promise, I ain't your average artist

798
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,640
My thought is, look into God's redirection

799
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,640
And not the goddesses

800
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,640
When you are not lazy, use this reality

801
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,640
Believe and care will set you free, yeah

802
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,640
One can be sold on my own

803
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,240
Two problems, three divides

804
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,840
Two endless issues, every so often

805
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
How'd you know?

806
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,640
Tomorrow won't go so soon

807
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,640
I gotta get through to you

808
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,640
Tomorrow won't go so soon

809
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,840
I gotta make that move

810
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,840
Tomorrow won't go so soon

811
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,040
It's something I've gotta do

812
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,840
Tomorrow won't go so soon

813
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,040
I gotta get through you

814
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,320
And yo, you know how we do, it's C that either on the B-A-L

815
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,320
So don't represent the meteorite, no proof, you know what I'm sayin'?

816
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Yo, right around now, DJ Hoori's in the mix, keeping you in constant suspense

817
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,320
Yo, you said Junin in the sound of SAKURES, you know what I'm sayin'?

818
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,320
Yo, and it goes a little somethin' like this, yo

819
00:54:51,320 --> 00:55:00,560
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

820
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,600
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

821
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:11,000
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

822
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,440
Just go up the street and take a left.

823
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,320
No, anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

824
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,000
Will you be my neighbor?

825
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,840
Won't you be my neighbor?

826
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,240
Didn't that guy retire finally?

827
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,880
meow meow what? at least he didn't die but

828
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,240
I'd say he didn't die that's not an o thing that's an oh good thing

829
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,640
but eventually he is and you just brought up that thought in my head

830
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,240
we're all gonna... Melanie I'm sorry but we're all gonna die

831
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,800
everyone's still traumatized captain kangaroo is gone so

832
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,920
I mean we're mister green jeans I mean

833
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,920
I know people still coming up to me asking where the heck he is

834
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,440
no mister rogers did not die he's not dead yet someone on sesame street really recently

835
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,440
I think the guy who played Gordon, I think he just died very recently.

836
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,440
Not Linda the Death Lady, I hope. She was my favorite.

837
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,440
Gordon died? Why is it always the brother that always got to get killed first?

838
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,440
Another instance of a man keeping you down.

839
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,440
You can address those cards and letters to Mel B.

840
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,440
Remember, if you want the proof, go to BurtIsEvil.com

841
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,440
Yes, it exists.

842
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,440
Oh, they're reminding us about the HIV-positive Muffet.

843
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,440
Little Miss Muffet! Dad on a tuffet!

844
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
Little Miss Muffet!

845
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,440
It actually has HIV!

846
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was very bad of me.

847
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,440
Well, Little Miss Muffet should be choosy on which tuffet she's sitting on now, shouldn't she?

848
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,520
She can't just sit on any tuffet just walks down the street and treats her to a nice dinner

849
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,800
And who knows how many seats have been on that tuffet?

850
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,920
She should have had that tuffet tested. She's learned how to squat on that tuffet.

851
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,480
I'm sorry

852
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:16,800
Oh, shit, we all need to breathe. I think I've actually attempted to play a song.

853
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,120
Well, now that the show has grown to a complete double halt.

854
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,560
DJ Konami, which is actually DCB under a new name, wants to warn you all that goat say

855
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,560
sat on that tuffet.

856
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:37,120
For those who don't know goat say all I have to say, that's goat say. That was me bending

857
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,120
over and pretending.

858
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:44,120
I don't want to... keep your ass on the chair. You just sit on your tuffet there.

859
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:48,120
Keep your tuffets to yourself, bitch.

860
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,120
Yeah, yes. Where were we?

861
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Tuffets.

862
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,120
AIDS. Something about... no, anyway.

863
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,120
The Muppet with HIV.

864
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Oh yeah, the Muppet with HIV.

865
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,120
I actually have a healing vision AIDS mix. HIV mix.

866
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,120
What? That sounds very politically incorrect.

867
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:13,620
Oh yeah, it says this DWI will give you AIDS, and it's just a really crappy remix of Healing Vision and Max 300.

868
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:20,120
They purposely made it bad and made the SEV file impossible just because they're frustrated with all the remixes, so...

869
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,620
Oh, they just, they don't like the Healing Vision remixes, so they just want...

870
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:28,120
They just don't like any of the remixes, so they just got pissed off and made, you know, HIV mix.

871
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,120
Okay.

872
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,620
Riiiiight.

873
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,120
Riiiiight.

874
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,740
We've got to give our cams taking too long to adjust, so I'm going to restart that cam.

875
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,620
But what I'm actually going to do now, I think now's a good time in the show, let's play

876
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,580
those interviews that Jamie got from last week.

877
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,580
How's that sound?

878
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,580
Yay.

879
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:47,620
Now, I haven't even listened to these at all myself yet, so we're going to be hearing these

880
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,620
live.

881
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,660
If anyone wants to comment, just raise your hand and I'll pause it and we can make a comment.

882
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,180
Okay, well first of all- Yeah, you've got to demo the-

883
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:59,740
I've recorded over old interviews, so I'm really not sure exactly, and I think I had

884
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,740
the pause button off.

885
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:01,740
I trimmed it up.

886
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,740
I trimmed it up, so everything should be okay.

887
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,740
You have to explain why you sound really stone in the thing.

888
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,140
I think I was like going on four hours of sleep,

889
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,700
and I was really tired, and then I

890
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,620
was traumatized by Stepping State.

891
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,380
OK, so Stepping State did this to you.

892
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,500
So if you have any questions, OK, there.

893
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,140
The cam should be better now, so.

894
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,780
I sound really retarded.

895
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,800
Oops, wait.

896
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,640
Actually, you're going to see an old picture

897
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,640
on the camera real fast.

898
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,980
It'll probably update soon, so just sit tight.

899
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,460
Cam's working.

900
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:30,140
OK, let's play these interviews, all right?

901
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:43,140
This is the Orange Challenge Interviews for Sunday, September 7th, 8th, 8th, 8th, 8th.

902
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,140
Just remember, stepping stage. It's all about stepping stage.

903
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,140
I was so tired.

904
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:57,140
This is the first of the interviews for Orange Challenge Radio, which, you know, we had the battery case off of the recorder, so it's kind of messed up.

905
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:02,380
so we're gonna go ahead and try this again so go ahead and do over you know

906
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:07,420
once again we have someone who's no stranger to orange lounge interviews so

907
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:14,140
go ahead and state your info kon kiyoki see you step squad family second

908
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:18,940
interview for orange lounge and completely sober this time yes that's

909
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:24,340
necessarily a good thing is it no not really I actually have Jenny here who

910
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:29,820
gave me my email gave me her he's sober but the question is were you yes okay

911
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:34,060
just checking on my arm when I was drunk she claimed she didn't draw me but my

912
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:41,060
hand was a little hazy you had a comment on that I was in the one who drew the

913
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,260
squid on the back of your forehead I mean I drew the eyes on the back of your

914
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:51,060
neck I remember that people are still wondering what the hell that was who

915
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,060
Who was it that beat you over the head with my bat, anyway?

916
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,060
I was wrong, Kitty. She did not make it today, but she's here in spirit.

917
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,060
Ah, yes.

918
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:07,060
So, um, go ahead and, uh, you know, give your daily recap for our, uh, fun event today with our first step squad and et cetera.

919
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,060
Hmm. Well, let me see.

920
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:18,060
Considering I was probably the first one up at six in the morning, lack of sleep, next thing to being high, uh, we, me and Jay actually had to clean up the house a little bit.

921
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:25,060
But then after that, 12 o'clock rolls around, Step Squad, RTF, and Otaku Outpost rolled out to the Holiday Bowl.

922
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:32,060
From there, good times. We actually rigged the machine, so the last round, everyone got a strike.

923
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,060
That was cool, but it's something they shut everything off on?

924
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,060
Yes.

925
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:42,060
Yeah, they ran out of pins. So everyone who bowled rolled a strike.

926
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:46,060
On the last one.

927
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,060
Is that like the most ghetto bowling alley around that they actually ran out of pins?

928
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,060
It's super ghetto.

929
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:58,060
Scott's stepping stage, I think there's nothing that can go lower than that.

930
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:03,060
They want a clarification as to what exactly this event is that you were at.

931
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:15,060
Basically we had Cece down visiting from SoCal and we had Liz visit, well she lives in California but she was going to school

932
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:21,620
in Washington State. So they were both in town and we had a big gathering. I think it

933
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:29,300
started off as just step squad, but it grew. Okay. Guys. I wasn't bowling so I really wouldn't

934
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,960
care about that, but that sucked. I would have loved to see the picture of everyone

935
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,400
last frame, triple strike each. They should have done that for ours because mine were

936
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:42,220
just like, oh, we're bowling and I sucked. My score sucked. Well, maybe. Well, the thing

937
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,220
They ran out of time, so, yeah.

938
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,220
Oh, well, I can't score anyway.

939
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,220
Sniff.

940
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:55,220
Anyway, we have another couple people with us, so, yes, you.

941
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:02,220
So go ahead and state your name, everything, for our lovely, brilliant listeners.

942
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:07,220
Hi, I'm Hattori Hanzo, and I'm...

943
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,220
Yes, Mel, very fast.

944
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:13,220
There's just nothing like buttoning up your listeners to brighten your day.

945
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:16,220
Those lovely, wonderful people out there that we adore.

946
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,220
Well, we do love our listeners.

947
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,220
It's one thing to love your listeners. It's another thing to love your listeners.

948
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,220
They're brilliant to you.

949
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,220
Mel B just sent sloppy, wet kisses to you all.

950
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,220
Soda right now, and I'm feeling all right.

951
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,220
And I see that as a Valencia orange soda.

952
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,220
It is, and it's very good. You should try one.

953
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,220
Is it your tasty beverage?

954
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:49,220
Well, since, you know, there aren't no other beverages to choose from, I think I'll just stick with the orange soda.

955
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:56,220
That was the sound of a whap on the head.

956
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:03,220
So, um, go ahead and then if you'll state your name and everything for both of us.

957
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,220
Jamie, quick, there's a whap on your head.

958
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:13,220
By the way, I need to explain. We were sitting outside in the backyard in lawn chairs, just lounging, going, I'm tired.

959
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,220
With a 40?

960
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,220
I'm tired too.

961
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,220
With a 40?

962
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,220
I didn't have 40.

963
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,220
Oh.

964
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,220
But, you know, Hanzo had orange soda.

965
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,220
Was it 40?

966
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,220
I had milk tea.

967
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:27,220
No, it was more like a 16 ounce.

968
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,220
If you want to.

969
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,220
Hello, my name is Jin.

970
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,220
Ever, I'm not male. I'm a female.

971
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,220
That was weird. The tape did a funny thing there.

972
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,220
The guy with the watch.

973
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:43,220
Yes, don't you know Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game?

974
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,220
I don't know.

975
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,220
Is it?

976
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,220
I'm a fighter reference. Thank you.

977
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,220
What happened there?

978
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,220
Hey, excuse me. This is coming from the person who had the screen.

979
01:04:53,220 --> 01:05:00,220
I made a reference that said, don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game.

980
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:05,780
one game, and people got the reference. Who plays Puzzle Fighter? Me. Who plays Devilot?

981
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:13,420
Me. Devilot Super 8. Yes, that was one of my old AOL names. I smell the D9, like, 3rd

982
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:22,420
mix Korean gates, you know? You got the failed screen, like, what Mel B has on his signature.

983
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:27,540
Uh oh! Care to comment? Care to comment? Oh, run that by me again. Here we go, let's hear

984
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:35,540
I smell a de-night like 3rd Mix Korean Gates, you know?

985
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:40,540
You got the failed screen like what Mel B has on his signature.

986
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,540
He doesn't have that anymore.

987
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:42,540
Any comment?

988
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,540
Hey man, what can I say? The world revolves around me.

989
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:50,540
You can take anything in the world, you can take six steps and it comes back to you.

990
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,540
Oh, like Kevin Bacon?

991
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,540
Yeah, but kosher.

992
01:05:54,540 --> 01:06:10,100
I think after Disney tourney everyone thinks the B stands for bling.

993
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:15,740
The gate was the best thing ever, I'm not kidding, it's a clank and you know your

994
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:18,260
thread is locked.

995
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:23,100
So does anyone have any comments for listeners, anything?

996
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,100
Yeah.

997
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,700
Conzo, keep talking your shit.

998
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:30,100
I'm going to jack you like I jacked that ice cream truck earlier with Jay Kinetic.

999
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,100
I missed that.

1000
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,060
I don't want to know how you're going to jack Conzo.

1001
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,060
There's pictures.

1002
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,860
Gary from RTF has them.

1003
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,980
Yes.

1004
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:42,840
I just have to say that half of everybody who was in that house did go and hump the

1005
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,060
ice cream man.

1006
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:47,060
Explain now.

1007
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:51,060
I didn't even go out there. I was like, oh, I have milk tea and 2DX, I'm happy.

1008
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:53,060
So I didn't even go out there.

1009
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,060
You didn't hump the ice cream in?

1010
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,060
No! I had 2DX.

1011
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:04,060
I fear. I fear. Greatly.

1012
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,060
I don't know what the hell this idiot's talking about.

1013
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,060
You were doing the solar run when we did it.

1014
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:18,060
Yeah, you weren't here. Everybody ran outside and decided to rape the ice cream man.

1015
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,060
Then what does that have to do with me?

1016
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,060
You missed it. You didn't get to join in on the fun.

1017
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,060
I was, you got here.

1018
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:29,060
The black sheep. He was the one that was left out.

1019
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:34,060
You're just saying that because I'm black.

1020
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:39,060
Why make me cornhole your hair, damn it.

1021
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:44,620
And this is the love of Step Squad here, and he loves it.

1022
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:52,020
This is a comment from the chat room right now, mmm, raping and ice cream.

1023
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:55,340
I hope not.

1024
01:07:55,340 --> 01:08:01,660
We have this on tape.

1025
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,700
This is the real world, Step Squad edition.

1026
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:09,020
On a closing note, Jamie, I'm waiting for Jay's birthday so we can roll up to Sacramento

1027
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,020
We're having rum jello.

1028
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:43,020
It's a nice little room. It's a breeze.

1029
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:47,020
How? He doesn't have...

1030
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:51,020
Look at it!

1031
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,020
What was that?

1032
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:59,020
Run away!

1033
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:03,020
We have another absentee. Well, you heard it here first on Orange Odd Radio.

1034
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:07,020
That was weird.

1035
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:17,500
What did you get when you get sleep deprived people?

1036
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,060
I should have deleted out the silence, but I didn't.

1037
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:25,060
This is the second interview for Orange Lounge Radio, and go ahead and state your name, no

1038
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,060
nickname.

1039
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,380
I had someone come about to fall asleep.

1040
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,560
I had actually taken a nap outside.

1041
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,320
This is Jamie doing NPR Orange Lounge, that's what this is, this is the NPR edition of Orange

1042
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,320
I had already taken like a ten minute nap outside in one of the lawn chairs.

1043
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,320
A ten whole minutes?

1044
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,320
A little idea for our listeners.

1045
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:49,320
Oh Liz, I usually go by San Toki on message boards and such.

1046
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,320
And you're visiting from where?

1047
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:57,320
Oh actually I live in California but I'm on summer vacation from school in Seattle.

1048
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,320
And you've been with Step Squad for how long?

1049
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,320
Since March of 2001.

1050
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:12,320
Before there was DDR, well before it was all over the place anyway, I guess.

1051
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,480
That's been like four years at least.

1052
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:21,720
It has to be more than that because I was living in Alabama when I first knew you online.

1053
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,680
Oh my God, memories.

1054
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,800
So do you have any words to say for listeners?

1055
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,080
What's your DDR experience?

1056
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:39,260
My DDR experience isn't really that much. I used to just play for fun, but I haven't

1057
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:48,700
actually been on a machine in a year or so. I usually play for fun when friends are around.

1058
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:53,500
I haven't competed in tournaments or anything. Do you have any other favorite games?

1059
01:10:53,500 --> 01:11:01,900
No, not really. Usually puzzle games, actually. Do you have any final words for the listeners?

1060
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,900
No, not really. Sorry.

1061
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:07,900
Go to college. All of you. You're illiterate.

1062
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:10,900
Get an education because it's very important.

1063
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,900
You can't spend your whole life playing games.

1064
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,900
I can.

1065
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,900
That was the last interview.

1066
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,900
What's all this stuff?

1067
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,900
Just leftovers.

1068
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,900
Is there anything in here?

1069
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,900
Yeah, no, this is everyone trying to say goodbye.

1070
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:33,900
Goodbye, ladies.

1071
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:34,900
It was nice meeting you.

1072
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,900
Yeah, this is the goodbye, so yeah.

1073
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,900
That was absolutely cool.

1074
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,900
Hi, Orange Lounge.

1075
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:45,900
Uh, yeah, Sapporo was good, and Orange Lounge kicks ass and you should listen to it.

1076
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:51,900
Uh, SSF, RTF, uh, uh, Mountain Mics, A.S.S., and fucking Ozzy.

1077
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,900
Dude, don't stop.

1078
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:58,900
All I have to say is, if Orange Lounge starts playing Fosse, I'd have to hurt someone.

1079
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,900
That will not happen.

1080
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,900
Thank the gods.

1081
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,900
There is a god.

1082
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,900
Hello Orange Lounge Radio! Play more Orange Lounge songs, like every day, all the time.

1083
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,900
Yeah, we do.

1084
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,900
Yes!

1085
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,900
Oh, and that brings an end to Jamie's interviews.

1086
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:18,900
Very random, but very cool. Thank you for getting that for us, Jamie.

1087
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,900
You're welcome.

1088
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,900
We appreciate it.

1089
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,900
I took a nice long nap, but I got home.

1090
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:31,900
She's okay now. If you're worried about Jamie, she's eating a couple donuts, she's got the sugar back in her, she's okay now.

1091
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:37,900
It's too bad I didn't record Jessica and I singing absolute on the way home.

1092
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:42,900
We were in full katimu style.

1093
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:47,900
I was singing a little bit of Summer Vacation there when somebody on one of the tapes there mentioned Summer Vacation.

1094
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:22,900
I've got a great career in radio ahead of me, don't I?

1095
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,900
Rob is very edumacated.

1096
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:29,900
I dropped out of college, look at me now, I'm a star!

1097
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,900
So smart, SMRT.

1098
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:37,900
Team smart, SMRT for life, yo!

1099
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,900
Hooked on phonics, worked for Rob.

1100
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:50,020
Hey, SMRT, let me think, Sacramento Metro Office Radio Talent, there we go, Sacramento

1101
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,940
Metro Office Radio Talent, smart.

1102
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:53,940
SMRT.

1103
01:13:53,940 --> 01:14:02,700
He's a real fart-spiller, I mean, fart-filler.

1104
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,860
Oh boy.

1105
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,860
We've got an...

1106
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:06,860
Dad!

1107
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,180
Yes, I mean...

1108
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,580
Happy birthday, Brad.

1109
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:16,820
Brad, come here. Come here. Hold on, we're going to get to that in a minute. Who wants

1110
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:21,940
to give Brad his birthday spankings? Irene, let's administer those birthday spankings,

1111
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:37,580
you're on air. Bend over baby. And close your eyes, it might hurt a little bit. Beep, beep,

1112
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:52,580
Why are we doing this again?

1113
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,580
Because it's great radio, alright.

1114
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,580
Ready?

1115
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,580
Here we go.

1116
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,580
And number?

1117
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:59,580
Yes, he's 21.

1118
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:00,580
Is that all please?

1119
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,580
Okay, here we go.

1120
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,580
One.

1121
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,580
Two.

1122
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,580
One.

1123
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:05,580
One.

1124
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:11,580
Oh, why? Why me? Oh, God, no.

1125
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,580
What?

1126
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,580
You like it at home.

1127
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,580
Yeah, I don't get it. You like it at home.

1128
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,580
We had a group in there.

1129
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,580
I thought we were at 21 by now.

1130
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,580
No, there are 40 left.

1131
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:23,580
Okay, okay.

1132
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:24,580
There's like a bunch to grow on.

1133
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,580
And one million to grow on.

1134
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,580
All right, all right, all right.

1135
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,580
I think Brad's starting to like this.

1136
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,580
I was so close. I was.

1137
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,580
You can stop grabbing me yet.

1138
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,580
She'll spank the monkey later.

1139
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:10,420
Papadopoulos magazine, weren't those the neighbors on Three's Company?

1140
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:15,420
No, it was Webster.

1141
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,540
The Papadopoulos lie.

1142
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,480
This show's never going to get on track, I'm sorry.

1143
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,300
I'm trying to find an actual Polteri song to play in the background.

1144
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,580
Oh, I found one, yay.

1145
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:31,540
We have an interview with Polteri, yes, and this is about life in Japan.

1146
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:37,820
Yes, for those who don't know, Paula Terry, she's the singer that likes to torture us

1147
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:38,820
all in her DDR music.

1148
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,460
She can't hold a key!

1149
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:46,820
Let's hear, uh, where are you from, Paula Terry?

1150
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:47,820
Sydney, Australia.

1151
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,420
You want to be, do you want to be Paula's voice?

1152
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,300
Oh, you're going to do, oh, okay.

1153
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,980
Loki's going to do Paula's voice, and we're going to have, like, a simulated interview

1154
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:55,980
here.

1155
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,980
Okay, here we go.

1156
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,980
Okay, wait, wait, what am I reading?

1157
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:58,980
We're going to be right here.

1158
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,980
You're going to be reading the non-bold stuff.

1159
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:00,980
I'll do the bold stuff.

1160
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,900
So Paula, where are you from?

1161
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,660
Sydney, Australia.

1162
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:05,780
And what brought you to Japan?

1163
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:12,820
When I was in Sydney, I had friends who lived here, and at the time I had to travel each.

1164
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:17,220
When I was a child, I lived in France for four years, so at that stage of my life back

1165
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:20,300
in Sydney, I felt I wanted to travel again.

1166
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,940
Also, I wanted to know anything about Japan.

1167
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:28,300
I met these girls who had worked holidays in Japan.

1168
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:35,300
worked in clubs, and you come up to them and say, well, you're a singer, they have foreign

1169
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:40,300
singers in these clubs, you can get me a visa and make money, why not work in Japan? So

1170
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,300
I went out and took the risk, and I've been here ever since.

1171
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,140
Wow, that's really nice, Paula. Okay, now doing Paula's voice, the next question will

1172
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:53,340
be Jamie. Everybody can do Paula's voice on one question, I'll do this. Okay, Jamie, I'm

1173
01:17:53,340 --> 01:18:02,540
sorry Paula. How long have you been singing? Well, my mother is an opera singer and my brother

1174
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:09,020
is like a classical guitarist, so I've been in the musical family. I love singing for

1175
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:14,660
being a little girl but I really only started out to learn it when I was 16 and I skipped

1176
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:19,580
a line. No, you got it. And my mother sent me an opera singing teacher. I love opera

1177
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,580
Uh, but it wasn't for me. Ew.

1178
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,580
When I was twenty, I decided to study jazz singing.

1179
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,580
I really love funky jazz music.

1180
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,580
Aw, play that funky jazz music, white girl.

1181
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,580
I like other funky things, too.

1182
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,580
Okay, without doing the voice of Paula, we'll be Mel B.

1183
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:38,580
So, um, how long have you been boinking Naoki?

1184
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,580
I'm just kidding. Anyway...

1185
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,580
Wherever, baby.

1186
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:46,580
Where do you sing, Paula?

1187
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,580
I've got the permanent booking at the Intercontinental Hotel on Tokyo Bay

1188
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:54,580
on Thursdays and Fridays from 7.30 PM to 11 PM.

1189
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,580
I sing accompanied by a penis.

1190
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:00,580
They're talking about the toucan.

1191
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:02,580
It's great. We play everything.

1192
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:06,580
Then on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I play a ginsa at a piano ball,

1193
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,580
which is a totally different style, a slightly older audience.

1194
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:11,580
Who's doing Paula's voice next?

1195
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,580
I don't know.

1196
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:14,580
Oh, Melody, you pooper.

1197
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:18,580
Okay, we're back to Matt. Okay. What sort of things do you sing, Paula?

1198
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:22,580
My repertoire goes from 30s to the 90s.

1199
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,580
I see you've been smoking, Paula.

1200
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:37,580
I have to keep up with the times. Recently everywhere I worked, people were requesting some songs from Titanic.

1201
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:42,580
So I had to buy the CD and learn it. I also sing to carpenters.

1202
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:48,580
But I don't try to imitate the originals. I try to sing them in a different style.

1203
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,580
That would be key?

1204
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:55,580
To keep myself interested. I also really sing the standard jazz tunes like Summertime.

1205
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:58,580
You can do that in any number of styles.

1206
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:02,580
Okay. Next, Jamie doing Paula's voice again.

1207
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,580
Paula, are you planning to stay in Japan?

1208
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,580
Uh...

1209
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,580
Right here, yes.

1210
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,580
Uh, yeah, uh, I guess.

1211
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,580
No.

1212
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,580
Yes, I am.

1213
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:21,580
I just finished recording of my first CD!

1214
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:25,580
Which comes out September 2-3.

1215
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:28,580
It's called, uh...

1216
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,580
Just Breakaway.

1217
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,580
Uh, what's that mean?

1218
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:39,580
So, I'm going to wait around and see how well that does.

1219
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:44,580
I'm very pleased with the difficult smell.

1220
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:47,580
Stay longer and do what I say.

1221
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,580
Paula, what do you like about Japan most?

1222
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,580
Anything is possible in Japan.

1223
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,580
It's an incredible place.

1224
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,580
I'll do the next one.

1225
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,580
What do you dislike about Japan most?

1226
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:03,580
Waking up with a bit of a hangover, having a bad hair day,

1227
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:06,580
and not being able to blend into the background.

1228
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:13,580
I just can't seem to be inconspicuous. It may be half paranoia, but I often feel that

1229
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,580
people are staring at me.

1230
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:22,580
Oh my God, you sounded like Vera, like from In Living Color.

1231
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,580
Hi.

1232
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:26,580
I'm so embarrassed.

1233
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:31,580
Paula, do you organize your CDs alphabetically?

1234
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:37,060
Definitely not. I favor the total disorder. They're all in piles on the floor. I have

1235
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:42,220
a drawback full of CDs. I don't play them often, but the ones that I like best are the

1236
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:43,220
ones in the piles.

1237
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:46,220
Are we actually going to do this whole interview here? Let's see if we can find some interesting

1238
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:53,740
questions here. Let's do this one. Okay, it's like a game show. You have to spend the rest

1239
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:58,460
of your life trapped on the Yamanote line. You're allowed to take one book, one CD, and

1240
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:02,860
and one luxury item, what would they be?

1241
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,940
First I need tampons!

1242
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:10,940
I need Naoki's hat!

1243
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:20,940
I'd like to record a CD of my favorite songs from Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, right

1244
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:37,380
What's the weirdest thing you've ever seen or experienced in Japan, Polteri?

1245
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:41,300
A lot of weird things have happened to me here, but one thing in particular comes to

1246
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,300
mind.

1247
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,260
I was told this story by a friend who worked in a hostess club where I was singing.

1248
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:51,060
The hostesses were all blonde-gauging, and they said that there was one man...

1249
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,060
WHATEVER!

1250
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:53,060
GO FUCK YOURSELF!

1251
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:58,500
Anyways, so they were saying that there was this one man who used to come in and beg them

1252
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:04,300
to sell a piece of their pubic hair for, well, 10,000 yen per piece, so these girls would

1253
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:09,540
go in and use the toilets and pluck hair out of the heads and rub it until they were curly

1254
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:12,820
and look authentic, and then they would come back and sell it.

1255
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,300
Paula, you're so clever!

1256
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:51,300
trying to find its life again.

1257
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,000
And another little fun song and we'll be right back

1258
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:47,700
Say, you know you gotta try a little harder

1259
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:51,200
So you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

1260
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,000
Smile, a little smile, let's enjoy the moment now

1261
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,500
And just have a good time

1262
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,500
A good time

1263
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,000
Try it, baby, good

1264
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,800
A little bit of love and gonna feel so fine

1265
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,300
Is it really true to feel the same way too?

1266
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:10,000
And hope we'll be together

1267
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,600
Now, you know that I love you

1268
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,080
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

1269
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,880
When I'm skating, sinking up

1270
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,000
Honey, what we call love

1271
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,960
I still won't think of you at first

1272
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,240
My family still comes above

1273
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,280
If you wanna capture me

1274
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,360
It's as simple as can be

1275
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,440
Mr. Lemon said it, all you needed

1276
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,400
Mr. Line said it, all you needed

1277
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,420
Mr. Line said it, all you needed

1278
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:49,880
Love, my love, my love, my love, my love

1279
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,900
My love, my love, my love, my love, my love

1280
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,260
This is my baby daddy

1281

That's just my baby daddy, he burnin' through my baby's head

1295
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:46,020
She said, your baby daddy was locked up, but why?

1296
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,020
The first day y'all was at the mall

1297
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:48,020
You a liar

1298
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,020
You a liar? Okay then what is named?

1299
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,020
L'O-V-I

1300
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,020
Yesterday you said it's named with James and it's the same

1301
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,020
It must be your new boyfriend

1302
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:55,020
How come your best friends told me the dude's name was T?

1303
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,020
You better get it together cause when you're locked

1304
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,020
I'm like Mary, I'm knocked on fire

1305
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,020
What you get up and get this dope?

1306
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:03,020
Yo, who that is?

1307
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,020
I don't know, hey?

1308
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:05,020
I bet that's just your baby dad

1309
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,020
Who that is?

1310
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,020
This is my baby daddy

1311
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,020
Who that is?

1312
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:09,020
This is my baby dad

1313
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,060
Who that is?

1314
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,060
Who that is?

1315
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,060
Who that is?

1316
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,060
Who that is?

1317
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,060
Who that is?

1318
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,540
Who that is?

1319
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:22,060
What's up, man? You ready to go?

1320
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,060
We know we gotta go to the store.

1321
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,060
Let's see that's a perfect exactly.

1322
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:28,060
You know you ain't gonna get no pepper.

1323
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,060
Well, while you there, get some milk.

1324
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,060
If you don't hurry back, I'ma bid a deal.

1325
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,060
Oh, baby, you can save the drama.

1326
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,060
Let's all finna go and see my baby mama.

1327
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,060
Who that is?

1328
01:30:38,060 --> 01:31:05,860
In the description below, if you had any view on this...

1329
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,000
leave a like and subscribe...

1330
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Hello.

1331
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,060
There is a regular alphabet soup there at the end, just all these random letters getting

1332
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:14,060
shouted out.

1333
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,980
I have no idea what any of them stand for, but I guess that's the beauty of DDR.

1334
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:17,980
That was Megumi.

1335
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:18,980
Ah, okay.

1336
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:19,980
I won't leave.

1337
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:23,380
The DDR community, just one big alphabet soup.

1338
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:29,960
Okay, we were looking at the, somebody wanted to see the statistics for the station during

1339
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:30,960
the break.

1340
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,740
We were taking a look, a lot more listeners in Japan recently, so a big hello to our friends

1341
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:38,900
overseas in Japan who started the addiction, and it looks like we're just finishing it

1342
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:44,140
if there's any truth to those rumors that DDR is dying in Japan, but somebody must still

1343
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:48,260
love it over there. I guess 2DX is a very big game over there, still, as well as Guitar

1344
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:51,980
Freaks and Drummania, very big, still, from what we hear. Of course, I guess we don't

1345
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:57,980
really know. But if anybody over there wants to email us, if you can write in English,

1346
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,980
because I don't know much Japanese, but if you do send in Japanese...

1347
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,020
Many people in Japan know English very well. It's acquired learning, first of all.

1348
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:08,680
if they're going to understand me giving the email address, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

1349
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:12,000
Give us a holler about what DDR and the Balmani scene is like over there. We'd love to hear

1350
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,600
about it. I'm being brought food. Isn't that lovely?

1351
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,400
It is beautiful and stunning. Is that all for me or are we sharing it? Oh

1352
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:25,400
my gosh, thank you. Where's for the rest of us? We deserve food

1353
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:33,280
too. Yeah, Ho's got to eat too, like me. So anyways, since you're eating and you're

1354
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,100
you're eating. I guess I could do the sim scene update.

1355
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,100
Sim update.

1356
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:43,860
Okay. All right. Well, actually, we actually have some new versions of stuff out there.

1357
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:50,760
As you probably remember from my FU message of the week, DWI 203. It's brand new. There

1358
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:55,080
is one feature, though, I absolutely love in it. It's the fact that every time you rebuild

1359
01:32:55,080 --> 01:33:00,460
your song list, it exports a HTML file with your entire song list. So now I can actually

1360
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:04,800
update my song list and post it so people can see how many damn songs I actually have,

1361
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:10,520
which is one thousand two hundred and eighteen right now.

1362
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:14,640
The chat room is saying Slinky in the chat room says StepMania Max 3 is coming out tomorrow.

1363
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,800
I don't know if that's BS or what, but...

1364
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,840
I don't... Why would Slinky lie to us? He loves us. I don't know, but I play... Actually,

1365
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:27,360
though, I have to give props to StepMania because it saved my party last night, because

1366
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:37,360
Since, for some reason, I don't know what it is, but some versions of DWI, they don't work my pads, and they don't work with my visualizations in the background.

1367
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:48,360
So, I had to find something to work with my pads, and luckily I had a beta 6 of StepMania 5, I believe, or 3, or whatever, and it worked, and it worked well. I was very pleased.

1368
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:52,360
So, we played on StepMania all last night, and it was awesome.

1369
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,360
Other than that, DDRPC, two new characters have been released.

1370
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,360
Our fourth set of new characters, it was Riko...

1371
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,360
No Pantsless Rage?

1372
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,360
No Pantsless Rage.

1373
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:03,360
No!

1374
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,360
No Three Tented Emmys.

1375
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,360
It was Riko and...

1376
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,360
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Duck.

1377
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,360
Ah, some chick, I don't know.

1378
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,360
Riko and some chick.

1379
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,360
Riko and his hoe, okay.

1380
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:20,360
So, that was that.

1381
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:25,100
and they have like white hair and look stupid whatever so that's some new stuff

1382
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:36,340
there other than that other than that let's see yeah whatever Sylvia is ho

1383
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:46,180
that's the same thing but um see last night party that was very fun we got

1384
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:50,000
tell us about your little party while I shove chicken strips in my mouth okay

1385
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
A little party last night for my birthday. I had a little bimani party there. I got to play on the sim.

1386
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Some of the popular songs there were Break Your Neck from Busta Rhymes.

1387
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Peanut Butter Jelly in a baseball band.

1388
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Yeah, Peanut Butter Jelly. They loved that remix from Turn Remix 2.

1389
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
That was pretty good. No, wait. No, that's not Turn Remix 2. That was something else.

1390
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Anyways, it's out there. There was also...let's see, what other ones?

1391
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,860
for some reason they're playing secret rendez-vous all the time

1392
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:21,840
i don't know why that

1393
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,680
um... another one heaven

1394
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,480
they liked heaven that was fun

1395
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,000
the steps to heaven were ass

1396
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,500
because i didn't play the hard one but i played the other one

1397
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,280
and they didn't sing over the music at all

1398
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,760
they were ass

1399
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,280
that's all but i like the song that was in tourney mix 2 so

1400
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,400
i voted up

1401
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,040
a poop

1402
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,240
i'll be on that

1403
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:45,480
big pile of feces so i assume that since tourney mix 2 has been judging for about

1404
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,640
uh... close to couple weeks now

1405
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:51,920
pretty soon will have results of who won that i don't

1406
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,920
no i guess look for that uh...

1407
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:58,720
jimmy won

1408
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,680
you can't do it

1409
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,660
i have that i have that they from the other room

1410
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,680
okay

1411
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:08,760
i don't everybody in second

1412
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,420
uh... we'll see what else though

1413
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:13,100
now there's a pretty cool routine that someone did

1414
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,080
for uh...

1415
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,380
macho duck

1416
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:20,220
because me being retarded put the long version song with the short version steps

1417
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:22,260
and so there's a nice two minutes of no

1418
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:25,740
no steps at all so there's this guy running around the room and jumping off

1419
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,300
stuff

1420
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,280
it was kind of funny to watch big cans part two

1421
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,220
yeah something like that yeah big cans part two

1422
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,840
uh... see other than that some news

1423
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,340
just some reminders

1424
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:41,020
looks like a team guilo their site's coming up october first so look for that

1425
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:42,900
i think

1426
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:48,900
I'm not sure what their actual address is going to be, because Team Gwylo got bought up by some guy, I don't know.

1427
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:52,900
There's nothing there, but they bought the domain name, so who knows for that.

1428
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:53,900
DWI Insan-

1429
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:57,900
Okay, that's my FU of the week. Fuck you to cyber squatters, I hate that shit.

1430
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:03,900
Unless they've got a valid use for the name Team Gwylo, they shouldn't be allowed to buy that domain name.

1431
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:08,900
Julia Roberts needs to take them to court, because she got her domain name and she knows how to do it. That's all.

1432
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:09,900
That's all.

1433
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,900
Okay.

1434
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:15,900
Anyways, um, DWI Insanity is gonna be coming back up probably later this week, they said

1435
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:21,720
one or two weeks about a week ago, so I guess we can look for that, and that's pretty much

1436
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,720
it for now.

1437
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:23,720
Whee!

1438
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,720
Alright, cool.

1439
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,720
Thank you.

1440
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:32,720
Um, do you have something else to add, Chad?

1441
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:38,120
I was gonna say, this kinda brings out an idea, let's talk about, like, various ideas

1442
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:41,420
forget togethers kind of things like to get people together and when do stuff

1443
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:44,300
what are some fun like ideas about that because there's this new thing they're

1444
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:48,920
doing in Sacramento called the freestyle Fridays and I don't I don't freestyle

1445
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,780
very well at all so I've been paying too much attention to this but I said I'd go

1446
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:55,100
watch sometime but I guess a bunch of the good freestylers in town trying to

1447
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,560
get together and just have some fun little challenges and things like that

1448
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:01,580
what are some some fun ways to get people together or is it does it have to

1449
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:04,820
be scheduled things could just be everybody just kind of convening at one

1450
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:08,340
place like the bar cheers. We used to have our big gathering when we were

1451
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,220
trying to unlock stuff on max 2 before they put in the code. Uh-huh true. You

1452
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:16,060
know which pissed me and a bunch of people off but you know that was

1453
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:19,300
something that got the community together was that common goal you know

1454
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:22,540
there's other max 2 machines where people don't know how the machines work

1455
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:28,820
well enough to put in the code I guess if you're retarded. There's all kinds of

1456
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:33,540
there's mini tourneys there's our you know every so often bidmani party that

1457
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:07,540
As far as get-togethers, I guess, I'm for people like RTF Steps.

1458
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:10,540
We've gone to a point where we like doing stuff, not just in the money.

1459
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:19,540
We like doing sports stuff, like we either have to take a game of basketball or we'll have a big football game, which we are actually coming up, which is coming up soon, I think in early October.

1460
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:24,540
No, it's a fun thing to just throw people around instead of stepping on arrows, you know?

1461
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:29,540
I liked the whole bowling thing from last Sunday.

1462
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:33,700
Cool any other fun get-togethers you guys have been doing that have been Bimani related

1463
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:39,260
Well, not last trip, but a couple trips ago doing the whole Cuzar thing

1464
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,860
That was back in the day where we used to go down to

1465
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:46,900
You know to Milpitas and Sunnyvale to go play the other Bimani that we didn't have up here in Sallis

1466
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:50,420
Now we kind of have them all. Now it's like whatever and even though they're not the best ones

1467
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:55,900
They're still you know, we got them. So yeah, so it's pretty much all the same stuff now except Disney Radio

1468
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,900
We don't have Disney Radio. Who cares?

1469
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:08,080
We definitely need to get people together, but we need to have another team sack attack

1470
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,300
on a various Cuzar.

1471
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:12,300
This is a national show.

1472
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,120
We've got people listening from all over.

1473
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:19,220
It's really cool to get people together and just make sure there's no drama.

1474
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:21,900
Anybody that's going to cause drama in your group, get them out.

1475
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:27,020
You know, why don't they just do like, that'd be pretty cool, is you know they have like

1476
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,420
hacker conventions and conventions for everything?

1477
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:31,420
What about BimaniCon?

1478
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:34,060
Okay, this is a good topic.

1479
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:37,740
Why hasn't there been a big national Bimani convention yet, do you think?

1480
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:41,260
You think it's because the tournaments kind of take care of that on a smaller scale, so

1481
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:42,980
there's no need or desire for something national?

1482
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:47,540
Do you think it's just because the Bimani audience is mostly, now I know just about

1483
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:51,420
all of us, in fact, yes, all of us in this room are exception, but the Bimani community

1484
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:55,140
is largely a high school base, which can't really afford to take the time to travel out

1485
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:58,220
of town for a weekend. What do you think the reasons are behind that?

1486
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:02,780
First and foremost, I've been going to conventions for seven years now. Longer than that, though,

1487
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:08,100
if you count some of the other stuff I've done. When you go to a convention, there are

1488
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:13,540
major, especially like the ones I've been going to, sci-fi, fantasy, anime conventions,

1489
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:18,140
you have your costumers, you have your gamers, you have your dealer's room, and I don't think

1490
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:20,640
there's enough, you know, Beymani-related merchandise.

1491
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:21,640
Red Octane!

1492
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:27,280
It would be, yeah, basically video game stores in there and you couldn't do, I think, a convention

1493
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:34,240
on just Beymani alone without, you know, without having it Beymani Plus, you know, as far as

1494
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,800
a convention setting goes.

1495
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,840
I mean, it's not like you can sit there and watch, you know, go to a room and watch, you

1496
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:43,040
know, movies of people playing DDR or, you know, like you have movie rooms at anime sci-fi

1497
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,040
conventions or...

1498
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:52,080
You'd have a room that's like, oh my God, it's me, Jason, you know us, and Mel B.

1499
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:59,640
I think my importance level has just shot down 60 notches.

1500
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:08,040
I don't think for Baymani alone, as far as a convention setting, that it would be enough.

1501
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:12,320
You could maybe have your little, small get together.

1502
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:18,320
If it was something associated with, say, the release of a new game, you know, something

1503
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:23,480
press-related, that might draw a crowd, I think, but you couldn't have, like, Bimani

1504
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:24,480
Con every year.

1505
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,240
I don't think that it would be big enough.

1506
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:30,960
Okay, well then maybe they could, instead of just Bimani, have, like, a music gaming

1507
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,960
convention or something like that, because then you have Bimani stuff, you've got, you

1508
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:37,240
know, the Pump It Up, the Parappa frequency.

1509
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:41,120
Yeah, all the music games, you know, Parappa and all that.

1510
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:47,120
Well, there is Classic Gaming Con that happens in Las Vegas.

1511
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,120
That's cool.

1512
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,120
That's cool.

1513
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,960
I guess if Classic Gaming Con can get pulled off.

1514
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:55,740
They also have the betas, the prototypes, you know, old games that were supposed to

1515
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:59,420
come out that never did come out, and I think that basically anything that was coming out

1516
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:07,120
for Beimani has come out except for, you know, S.M.A.M.I.X., the S.M.A.P. one.

1517
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,980
There's a group called S.M.A.P.

1518
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:15,300
In Japan, there's basically like the Japanese version of Minuto, actually, and they had,

1519
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:21,180
I know very little about this, but there was supposed to be a DDR version or something

1520
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:22,180
featuring them.

1521
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:26,300
You know, like there's Dreams Come True and that, but it never goes away.

1522
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:31,900
Which, by the way, the, not Dreams Come True, what's the other, True His Destination, that

1523
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:34,100
has to be the worst bimonium I've ever played.

1524
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:37,060
I mean, I like some of the music, don't get me wrong, but just the interface and everything,

1525
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:38,060
I didn't care for it.

1526
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:39,060
I just want to share.

1527
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:44,620
Since I do have all the Dreams Come True stuff and True Kiss Destination, I have to say,

1528
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:46,840
all of those suck.

1529
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,840
They both suck.

1530
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,340
They're just awful.

1531
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:51,540
All their music is just very awful.

1532
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:58,700
I mean, aside from Sexy Planet and, like, Self-rated Night, they all suck.

1533
01:43:58,700 --> 01:43:59,700
I liked Africa.

1534
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,140
That's the one song I liked on True Kiss Destination.

1535
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:02,140
That was a cool song.

1536
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:04,420
Okay, but they've got one song called The Monster Song.

1537
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:12,140
The monster is coming. It's just like so awful, but like, yeah, OHA is pretty fun. I mean,

1538
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:18,100
but other than that, it's just crap. However, the meaning of Future Dreams Come True is

1539
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:23,600
pretty cool. You know, I don't know. I guess maybe you could, but I'm thinking in terms

1540
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,820
of the broad spectrum of different conventions I've been to, you know, I don't think you'd

1541
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:34,060
have enough to make anything larger than, you know, a one day convention. I don't think

1542
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:35,060
it would be anything.

1543
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:37,660
So tournaments are pretty much as big as it's gonna get.

1544
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:39,780
I think so.

1545
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:42,500
And then we could go back to that national tournament talk, but I think we even talked

1546
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,500
about that.

1547
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:47,180
Actually, I think that was the talk last time Elby was here, we talked about that.

1548
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:50,180
Just probably wouldn't be big enough, unfortunately.

1549
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:54,620
You'd have to have huge prizes to entice people to want to fly all the way out to, you know,

1550
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:58,140
Las Vegas, Bay Area, wherever you would choose to hold the tournament.

1551
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:59,780
Just I don't know if it's possible.

1552
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:04,400
It's not so much about incentive and prizes, but it's also I mean thing a lot of people

1553
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:09,580
Overlook is that you need a lot of manpower everywhere people who are all on the same stage

1554
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:13,260
You know on the same level knowing about how to run attorney how to you know

1555
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:18,420
Clean up with rules that are fair to you know, this region that region whatever and right now. I just don't think

1556
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:24,760
We're quite at the level of networking where we can have a bunch of arcades all in sync all on the same page

1557
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:25,780
Getting it all together

1558
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:30,780
I'm not saying it can't happen, but there's just a lot more things people overlooked at

1559
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:34,780
have to be taken into account for such a thing to happen.

1560
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:38,780
It would definitely take a lot of work, and I don't know that many people would be willing to do it.

1561
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:42,780
Twin's got a good idea for incentive. Have it a strip DDR competition.

1562
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:44,780
I'll judge.

1563
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:47,780
I'll judge, guys. I'll judge.

1564
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:54,780
Also, another suggestion to make the convention more popular is to be a Bomani slash hentai convention.

1565
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:59,660
that would that would definitely well then again isn't that what that would be

1566
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:05,180
SSR strip strip revolution well you know I'm a Expo basically they had an arcade

1567
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:09,780
that was totally Bemani dominated you know in one of the little convention

1568
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:13,460
rooms at the Hyatt you know the the I'm a conventions are almost turning into

1569
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:17,060
pseudo Bemani convention suit because there's you know all these people in the

1570
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:23,460
dealer's room selling like I bought at least two of my I have at least three

1571
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:28,540
Bimani related products that I've purchased at Anime Expo, one of them being my second

1572
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:36,540
mixed stepbook and a dance pad and like one of my versions of DDR I think.

1573
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:40,380
I think it was one of them or the other, I don't know.

1574
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:43,380
I have like a ton now, so.

1575
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:47,260
Okay, well I think we're going to take a really quick break and then we're going to come back

1576
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:49,300
and we're going to wrap up the show.

1577
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,300
So...

1578
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:51,300
Wrap it up and what?

1579
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:56,300
We're going to wrap it up and we'll be right back.

1580
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:58,300
What are we going to play in the break?

1581
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,300
Let's play one of your mixes.

1582
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:01,300
You want to tell me a mix you want to play?

1583
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:03,300
Or not one of your mixes, but one of the mixes you brought.

1584
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:06,300
Tell me which one you want to have the listeners hear.

1585
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:09,300
Yeah, actually what I was going to do is introduce this one.

1586
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,300
Back in Fifth Mix they had a competition, I guess.

1587
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,300
I haven't really heard much about it, for a Paranoia remix.

1588
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:18,300
And this guy who goes by the name STM won that competition.

1589
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:23,300
Well, I happened to find his website, and he has a piano ambient version of Max Unlimited.

1590
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:28,300
Now, you have to listen to the background there to fully get all of it, but you will catch some of what it is.

1591
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:33,300
But just listen to it, it doesn't sound anything like you've heard before for Max Unlimited.

1592
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:40,300
All right. Enjoy. Here we go.

1593
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,300
You

1594
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:10,300
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Bongo demands it!

1595
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:34,300
Polis Radio.

1596
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:35,300
I'm the co-host!

1597
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:36,300
I can't shut up!

1598
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,300
Smirt.

1599
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:46,980
Um, a lot of mixed reaction in the chatroom, um, kinda, mostly positive, kinda depressing

1600
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:47,980
though, don't you think?

1601
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:50,340
That's almost kinda, I don't know, the way it was, it just kinda...

1602
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:51,340
I just feel like throwing myself off course.

1603
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:54,860
I mean, Max Unlimited is depressing enough as it is, because I can't pass it, but you

1604
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:55,860
know...

1605
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:56,860
I just couldn't stare at it.

1606
01:52:56,860 --> 01:53:01,420
Well, I can on base if it hurts, but, even in the chatroom, they said, Orange Lounge

1607
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:07,120
made me sad today. We're sorry. We love you! Just remember Little Miss Muffet sat on the

1608
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:14,120
tuffet. Where's my red? I was just commenting in the middle of the song. It was funny because

1609
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:20,000
Mel B was sitting here reading scripture during that little passage. Would you like to share

1610
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,600
a little bit of that with us here, Mel? Would you like to share some of your voiceover talent

1611
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:30,600
with uh... the max

1612
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:37,920
she'll see

1613
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,360
they'll be

1614
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:43,720
nine o'clock i guess

1615
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,920
very pretty thank you

1616
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:47,080
uh...

1617
01:53:47,080 --> 01:54:00,240
That's kind of like the 5'9 piano version we have in Rotation on the Bahmani Music and

1618
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:04,600
More program, which is always playing on the stage when we're not here.

1619
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,360
Pretty sad remix of that, too.

1620
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,400
So is Bahmani getting all depressed?

1621
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,800
Is it the angsty phase?

1622
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,520
Is it the suicidal goth phase of Bahmani?

1623
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:18,520
It will stay angsty as long as Polteri keeps singing.

1624
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:22,420
Everybody will want to just slit their wrists after listening to her.

1625
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:25,520
At least we have Silhouette of My Mind, and that makes me happy in a sad,

1626
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,400
MacGothy way.

1627
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,520
Yeah, Silhouette of My Mind is another little slit-your-wrist song there from

1628
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:34,080
Imani. That is a happy song if you listen to the lyrics. Yeah, it's a happy song, but it sounds really...

1629
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:39,620
I'm happy being up by myself. I'm happy being sad.

1630
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:46,620
I am quite enthusiastically upset.

1631
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:50,700
I guess we're going to wrap up the show now.

1632
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:55,260
So, any final thoughts from everybody here in the room?

1633
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:56,360
I have donuts.

1634
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,620
You have donuts, right on.

1635
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:59,260
Matt, Logie?

1636
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:02,180
I don't like Paula Terry.

1637
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:04,420
Neither do I, it's okay. She scares me.

1638
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:09,500
Bradley, do you have anything to say?

1639
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:13,340
Special guest Mel B, anything you want to say?

1640
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:16,380
I had no idea DJ Konami sounded like Dick Vitale.

1641
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:19,300
Either way, I think he's dope.

1642
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:19,900
Right on.

1643
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:23,140
And Sharks Girl, Mel D, anything you want to say to our listeners?

1644
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:23,980
Yawn.

1645
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:24,940
Yawn.

1646
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:29,060
I've driven like 280, 300 miles today so far.

1647
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:30,180
I just have to drive home.

1648
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:33,020
You've got two more hours to go.

1649
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,460
And I've got to drive tomorrow.

1650
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:37,140
I get to drive to Frisco tomorrow, so that'll be fun.

1651
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:38,940
Whee!

1652
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:41,100
okay uh...

1653
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:43,560
uh... what else out of those one other quick thing i want to say for the show

1654
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:45,860
is over and now it's on my mind

1655
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:48,460
it's let your mind

1656
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:51,840
actually had a quick comment chara someone who wrote something about a

1657
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,820
glow sticks and goes being in a

1658
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:56,940
freestyle routine yes funny enough i don't know if i mentioned this before

1659
01:55:56,940 --> 01:56:00,940
but when i was an Omaha freestyle tourney uh... back in uh... april

1660
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:02,380
point of earlier this year

1661
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:05,460
someone did do a holistic routine with uh... goes in

1662
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,960
funny enough to build within fifteen seconds

1663
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:11,720
Somewhere I believe justice was served.

1664
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:15,560
That's kind of sad in a way. I'm still not sure that anything involving lights

1665
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:19,040
and DDR is going to top Fuzzy Hat with candles on, uh,

1666
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,320
Healing Vision.

1667
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:25,320
And the number 420 either.

1668
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:29,080
Oops, I gotta switch CDs here real fast. Somebody fill.

1669
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:35,080
Fill, fill, fill-er, fill-er, fill-er, fill-er. Who's Phil?

1670
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:40,360
Bimani is cool, keep playing, right?

1671
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,000
This DDR sucks!

1672
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,200
That really bugs me, I can't think of a better one to say. We are in joy, why aren't you?

1673
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:49,360
We expect you and I to play again.

1674
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:52,120
And now, new from Konami,

1675
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:55,160
the Polteri sings the classics!

1676
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:56,600
Oh yes!

1677
01:56:56,600 --> 01:57:00,040
Such wonderful...

1678
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:06,040
Such wonderful songs.

1679
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:07,520
Move!

1680
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:12,480
Move!

1681
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:13,540
Oh yes, that's

1682
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:16,460
Shine Get!

1683
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:19,980
I think that's an appropriate note to end the show on. Shine Get!

1684
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:24,460
