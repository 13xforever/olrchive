1
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:10,192
[SPEAKER_23]: Put it in!

2
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:10,652
[SPEAKER_23]: Put it in!

3
00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:19,237
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:23,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Our live talk program begins now.

5
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:24,879
Boring.

6
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:31,083
[SPEAKER_15]: This video sucks!

7
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:37,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:41,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

9
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:45,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

10
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:48,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Hide Orange Lounge radio from the fucking children.

11
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,342
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Metroid is in captivity.

12
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:55,565
[SPEAKER_01]: The galaxy is at peace.

13
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,882
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

14
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:15,226
[SPEAKER_00]: My kind of people and assholes.

15
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:16,288
[SPEAKER_00]: One.

16
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,010
[SPEAKER_00]: One.

17
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:23,446
[SPEAKER_23]: Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count I would like

18
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:56,568
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio,

19
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio Episode 12

20
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,531
Thank you for watching!

21
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:32,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio, we are live here.

22
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shut up, baby.

23
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:36,091
[SPEAKER_07]: The world's not that bad.

24
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:39,373
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you like it if I shoved you back in?

25
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:45,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hello to everybody.

26
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:46,856
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a pretty full room here tonight.

27
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to get hot in here very fast.

28
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,297
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why we have the lights out.

29
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:57,303
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're viewing our webcam, which is at a top secret location, which you can only get in our chat room, then it's going to be very dark in here.

30
00:08:57,443 --> 00:09:00,065
[SPEAKER_07]: All the images are dark because we don't want to start sweating in here.

31
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:02,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to turn into a sauna.

32
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:05,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll all have to take our clothes off and that'll be the nudity.

33
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,811
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be the nudity.

34
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:08,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Dork!

35
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:20,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to apologize for anyone listening to this on the archives because I didn't start the archive recording until that break, so you missed the intro of the show.

36
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:29,334
[SPEAKER_07]: But all we were basically saying in the intro was that Mel B and Melody are here tonight, Shark Skrull, Mel B, and all our usual crowd is here tonight.

37
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:30,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you didn't get to say hi yet, Brad.

38
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:31,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you want to say?

39
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:34,059
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just slurping.

40
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, Molly.

41
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:50,329
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do want to join our chatroom, figure out where that secret webcam is, all you've got to do is go to any other side IRC server like irc.eggheads.org and join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

42
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:51,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Wee.

43
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:54,173
[SPEAKER_07]: So how was your week off, Jamie?

44
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:55,333
[SPEAKER_07]: You were gone for a little while.

45
00:09:56,134 --> 00:10:09,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, last week, weekend thingy, I went to a big gathering of a bunch of people, mostly a step squad, a few RTF, a taco outpost, just a bunch of people.

46
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:10,441
[SPEAKER_22]: We went bowling.

47
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:12,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Bowling's cool.

48
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:14,023
[SPEAKER_22]: I sucked so bad.

49
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:17,444
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I got to see the crappiest machine in the universe.

50
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:18,265
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

51
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:19,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Stepping Sage.

52
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:20,046
Woo!

53
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,562
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never heard of... The most ghetto fabulous machine ever.

54
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:27,996
[SPEAKER_29]: I have never even heard of 76... It ain't even ghetto fabulous, it's just ghetto.

55
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:30,133
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like ghetto ass.

56
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,014
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

57
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:41,179
[SPEAKER_22]: Imagine you have a machine consisting of one large monitor in the center and two smaller monitors on either side.

58
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:52,666
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a panel, like any normal dancing stage, except you have two circles in the front, two on the side, and two in the back, making a sort of circle.

59
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:53,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

60
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:56,788
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you have two dots on the screen.

61
00:10:57,588 --> 00:11:00,370
[SPEAKER_22]: and then whatever color goes up, you have to step on the corresponding color.

62
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,132
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I think it's like red at the top, yellow in the middle, and blue in the back or something like that.

63
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:04,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird, okay.

64
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:08,615
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you have the crappiest videos playing in the middle one.

65
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:15,098
[SPEAKER_22]: All it is, is like, okay, you know at Great America, the karaoke, well, not the one that you actually sing with, the make your own video thing?

66
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:15,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, okay, yeah.

67
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you, you know, dance around in front of a blue screen or a green screen and you have... With those like, just really lame, I know what you're talking about, yep.

68
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:26,765
[SPEAKER_22]: Imagine this with like real people, except the people think that they can dress cool and know how to dance.

69
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:35,578
[SPEAKER_22]: and they're the type of people who think that they're doing so well that you really don't have the heart to tell them that they suck.

70
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:37,039
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of music is in this game?

71
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:37,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I never even played it.

72
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:48,763
[SPEAKER_22]: We have Saturday Night, we have The Hustle, we have Santa Maria, which I nearly threw up.

73
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:49,683
[SPEAKER_07]: By Samantha Fox?

74
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:51,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, but it's not Samantha Fox.

75
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:55,371
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, they have I Should Be So Lucky by Kylo Ren.

76
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:58,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

77
00:11:58,614 --> 00:11:59,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that one.

78
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:01,337
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

79
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:02,959
[SPEAKER_22]: And they had Macho Man.

80
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, God.

81
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,121
[SPEAKER_22]: Which was the worst.

82
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:06,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Like limes?

83
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,586
[SPEAKER_22]: And they had, oh, shoot.

84
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:13,690
[SPEAKER_22]: It was another something I don't remember off the top of my head, but this machine just sucked.

85
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:21,615
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was sort of thrown away in the corner by the door, you know, like, we really don't have this here, they just make us.

86
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:34,523
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, you know, we played with balls all day, and then went back over for 2DX, and I got to see my friend Liz, who I hadn't seen in two years.

87
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:43,028
[SPEAKER_22]: I knew her before I... I actually met her at Anime Expo 2000, which was also where I played my first DDR machine.

88
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:48,273
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll hear the... Well, you know, you interviewed Kim in these interviews, right?

89
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:49,014
[SPEAKER_07]: That you did?

90
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:49,934
[SPEAKER_22]: I interviewed Liz.

91
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:50,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I interviewed a bunch of people.

92
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:51,496
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, cool.

93
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:54,739
[SPEAKER_22]: And Liz is also... She's a Santoki on Step Squad 4.

94
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:55,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, right on.

95
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

96
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:59,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk to Mel and Mel for a minute here.

97
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:09,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, because they went to the big Disney's Rave Tournament on Friday, which none of us were able to go to, because we all have to work, and then, you know, by the time, at least I do.

98
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:10,825
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

99
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:11,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you went for that week?

100
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:12,486
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

101
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, you guys... I'm like us unemployed people, why don't you?

102
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:16,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

103
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:21,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if I worked in Milpitas, then I could get to the tournament in time, but I work here in Sacramento.

104
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,796
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I'm unemployed.

105
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:24,536
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't... But...

106
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:31,005
[SPEAKER_24]: Watch out before the unemployed rise up and kill you!

107
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:31,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke power!

108
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,164
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, well, yeah, quick rundown.

109
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:52,485
[SPEAKER_29]: The tourney was on a dancing stage, Disney's Rave.

110
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:56,447
[SPEAKER_29]: It was at Milpitas, and it was hosted in one of the party rooms.

111
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:59,928
[SPEAKER_29]: And for the Perfect Attack tourney, it was all on doubles.

112
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:10,053
[SPEAKER_29]: And because Disney Rave is a rather easy machine to Perfect Attack anything on, like Triple S's are very commonplace, they had set the difficulty to eight.

113
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:15,255
[SPEAKER_29]: So it was like, you know, the good old third mix SSR days where four goods and you were out.

114
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:18,778
[SPEAKER_29]: and people did fail during the tourney.

115
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:22,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, to fail a song on Disney's Rave, that's got to be the biggest heartbreaker.

116
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:24,063
[SPEAKER_29]: Not necessarily.

117
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,644
[SPEAKER_29]: Some of the songs are impossible.

118
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,268
[SPEAKER_29]: Some of them were ten-footers like Twilight Zone and Ducking Hardcore.

119
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:31,290
[SPEAKER_22]: I could just imagine Mr. Bassman.

120
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:35,914
[SPEAKER_29]: Bassman is actually relatively easy compared to some of the others.

121
00:14:37,122 --> 00:14:44,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, so now you came out of hiding, basically your freestyle retirement, and you did a freestyle at this tournament, correct?

122
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:45,804
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I did.

123
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:51,206
[SPEAKER_29]: I finally decided, hey, this is going to be a fun tourney, there's not that much pressure, what the heck.

124
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:53,026
[SPEAKER_29]: So yeah, I did the bump.

125
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:54,707
[SPEAKER_29]: Right on.

126
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:59,928
[SPEAKER_29]: The most ghetto song out there, and I pretty much milked it for its ghetto factor.

127
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:12,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the last time Mel B was here on Orange Lounge, about six or seven weeks ago now, the last time he was here, we made an agreement that the next time he enters in a tournament, he needs to do a knee drop and a hand slap.

128
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Did those two things get done?

129
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:15,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they were.

130
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

131
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:22,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I understand, you got criticized by one of the judges for it, right?

132
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:27,107
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, one of the judges was, I wasn't so sure about that hand slap knee drop somewhere in the game.

133
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:28,928
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I chained it pretty nicely.

134
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,170
[SPEAKER_29]: I kind of disguised it well.

135
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,692
[SPEAKER_29]: It wasn't the, like, love to ball hand slap.

136
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:37,977
[SPEAKER_29]: I thought I did it with class and style and all those good things freestylers should be doing it with, but no.

137
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:44,995
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anybody wants to blame the low points of Mel B's routine, that would be our fault here at Orange Lounge.

138
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:45,576
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're welcome.

139
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:48,597
[SPEAKER_29]: It was all in fun.

140
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:54,120
[SPEAKER_29]: For the turnout I had on a Friday night, there was probably about maybe 20 routines or so thereabouts.

141
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,920
[SPEAKER_29]: Not too bad.

142
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,160
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, 18, 19.

143
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,901
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, it's cool.

144
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:01,143
[SPEAKER_29]: And everyone was just having a good time more than anything.

145
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:05,864
[SPEAKER_29]: There was maybe a few dancey routines, but for the most part, everyone was just goofed around.

146
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:06,965
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a Disney rave, you know.

147
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,365
[SPEAKER_29]: How seriously can you make it?

148
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:10,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, how many Macarena routines were there?

149
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:12,066
[SPEAKER_29]: One.

150
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:13,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one, really?

151
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:15,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they actually do the Macarena?

152
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:17,268
[SPEAKER_29]: Not really.

153
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:19,329
[SPEAKER_29]: In fact, the audience did.

154
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:29,812
[SPEAKER_29]: Although, the funny thing was, it was Tigger, actually, of all people who did Macarena, and at the end, he pretty much turned it into Love 2 Macarena, complete with hand slaps and all that good schmazz.

155
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:30,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.

156
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:32,286
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.

157
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So, good tournament?

158
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:37,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think they need to do another Disney's Rave tournament in the future?

159
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it just kind of a one-time, ha-ha, that was funny, let's move on now?

160
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,574
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe once in a blue moon, like once a year probably.

161
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:51,858
[SPEAKER_29]: I doubt you'd see anything twice because a lot of people were having trouble enough trying to memorize steps, trying to get it up really for the tourney.

162
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:52,339
[SPEAKER_29]: Who knows?

163
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.

164
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times, good times.

165
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other tournaments coming up that you want to tell us all about?

166
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:00,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more appearances you'll be making that you want to plug?

167
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:06,531
[SPEAKER_29]: As far as I know, you'll probably catch me at a local 7-Eleven or something like that.

168
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:07,453
[SPEAKER_29]: Just catch me Thursday.

169
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:09,176
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm getting a Vanilla Coke Slurpee.

170
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:12,702
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll be at the one on Branham in Monterey in San Jose.

171
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:13,504
[SPEAKER_29]: Bingo.

172
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:14,966
[SPEAKER_29]: Woo!

173
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:19,957
[SPEAKER_29]: But past that, as far as I know, I'm not too sure about any of the tourneys coming up.

174
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:23,979
[SPEAKER_29]: I know Scandia 2 is probably one of the bigger ones coming up in December.

175
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,100
[SPEAKER_29]: As soon as I know more details about that, hey, I'll pass it on.

176
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,221
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a Sacramento tournament in November.

177
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

178
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:33,882
[SPEAKER_07]: To be determined.

179
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:35,843
[SPEAKER_07]: To be determined in the works.

180
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:38,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk to Melody for a minute.

181
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:38,904
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

182
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:43,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you were just here a couple weeks ago, weren't you?

183
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,833
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, because I needed donuts and Mongolian.

184
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:48,574
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I have pants and a jacket.

185
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,576
[SPEAKER_24]: Now I have clothes to go with the Mongolian.

186
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:54,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Explain why you had to come up to Sacramento this time.

187
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:55,818
[SPEAKER_24]: This time?

188
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:58,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time was for donuts, this time it was for... Last time was for donuts, this time...

189
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:03,141
[SPEAKER_24]: I was on a quest to get a pair of pants at Express that I absolutely adore.

190
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:07,383
[SPEAKER_24]: I called every single Express in Northern California.

191
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:11,104
[SPEAKER_24]: Only one had them in the right size, and it was here in Sacramento.

192
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,205
[SPEAKER_24]: And I thought, well, hey, now I have a really good excuse to come up here.

193
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:20,768
[SPEAKER_24]: So we were kicking around the idea anyway, because since the Miggle tourney just happened, we had to inform everyone that, yes, the can't-slot-knee-drop thing had been done.

194
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, well, hey, now we have a really good excuse to come up here.

195
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm waiting to see the video.

196
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:24,990
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I can't wait for.

197
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:25,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

198
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,931
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a three-minute video update.

199
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:28,931
[SPEAKER_24]: Did I just say three minutes?

200
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,233
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, here goes Rosie and Jamal.

201
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,994
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's a wrestling thing.

202
00:18:37,054 --> 00:18:37,754
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay, okay, okay.

203
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:47,598
[SPEAKER_24]: But if you go on DDRFreak and the MiggleTurney thread, there is a link to a three-minute video on there that has some highlights from the MiggleTurney until the actual videos come up.

204
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:48,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, okay.

205
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:53,420
[SPEAKER_24]: But I haven't been able to finish downloading it myself considering my computer crashed IE in the middle of it, so...

206
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,061
[SPEAKER_07]: They're giving a link in the chatroom.

207
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:59,606
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to get that three-minute video, it's at evil.facuck.org.

208
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:02,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And Facuck is spelled, by the way, F-C-U-K.

209
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:04,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that has anything to do with French Connection.

210
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:06,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's an independent side of that.

211
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I think French Connection is F-C-U-K.com.

212
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:10,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Facuck shirt.

213
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:11,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Facuck Games.

214
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:12,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I wear that to all the tournaments.

215
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:13,539
[SPEAKER_24]: I've seen that.

216
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:14,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

217
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even... Man, anyone who downloaded the video, I make a brief one-half-second appearance in it.

218
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:20,924
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

219
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:21,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you talking?

220
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,608
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I'm, like, watching Corey play Dumb Mania.

221
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on, right on.

222
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:36,796
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's also, uh, you can download it from Oralsay.cx Oralsay.cx is another site you can get it.

223
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody's sharing when they appear in the video.

224
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,501
[SPEAKER_24]: See, I have to get my computer to actually cooperate and download it without crashing my browser in the middle of it.

225
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:50,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Lab is in the chat room saying, I appear in it twice, I'm in it twice.

226
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it must just be a really fast clip kind of thing where you just got everybody in there at least once.

227
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:55,981
[SPEAKER_24]: It's kind of cool, actually.

228
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,822
[SPEAKER_24]: I only saw half of it.

229
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:58,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you spot yourself?

230
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:00,664
[SPEAKER_24]: I have not seen myself yet.

231
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:01,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe you're in the second half.

232
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:07,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be, but... One day we'll bring a video camera in here and we'll do a quick promo or something.

233
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:08,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Eep.

234
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:16,712
[SPEAKER_29]: But probably the greatest cameo we saw in the video that we did see from the tourney was a kneeling pad, of all things.

235
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:18,322
[SPEAKER_29]: It was a cow kneeling pad.

236
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:18,963
[SPEAKER_29]: True story.

237
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:21,747
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, quick rundown for everyone out there.

238
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:25,051
[SPEAKER_29]: Me and Melody, we were over at Target one night.

239
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:27,894
[SPEAKER_29]: We was just checking out some stuff.

240
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,456
[SPEAKER_29]: I come by the gardening section.

241
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:30,438
[SPEAKER_29]: I see these things.

242
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,940
[SPEAKER_29]: They're butterfly knee pads.

243
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,660
[SPEAKER_29]: Literally.

244
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:33,682
[SPEAKER_29]: Knee pads with...

245
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:39,076
[SPEAKER_29]: And I thought, dude, that must be like the greatest gift we could give at a tourney.

246
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:44,019
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, we should give the worst freestyler, you know, a set of butterfly knee pads and just send them on their way.

247
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,242
[SPEAKER_29]: But right next to it, we saw a cow kneeling pad.

248
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:50,444
[SPEAKER_29]: And since one of our friends is big on cows, you know, we thought that would be cool.

249
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,585
[SPEAKER_29]: And see, that was a kneeling pad.

250
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,387
[SPEAKER_29]: We were already thinking the wrong things with that.

251
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:59,091
[SPEAKER_29]: So we gave the gift to our friend over at the tourney.

252
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:02,954
[SPEAKER_29]: And next thing you know, everyone was abusing it and all sorts of.

253
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:07,179
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the cows saw more action than anyone else that night.

254
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:11,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie just pissed her pants at something here.

255
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It just happened.

256
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:16,452
[SPEAKER_07]: She just read that the local golf land here in Roseville got a crane game.

257
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:17,413
[SPEAKER_15]: They got a crane game!

258
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:21,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Explain your obsession with the crane game for a minute.

259
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:22,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to change the subject on your melody.

260
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,778
[SPEAKER_24]: First off, Jamie, I'm hiding my keys from you right now.

261
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:29,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you are not... Jamie has to be rationed on how much money she can spend on the crane game.

262
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:31,122
[SPEAKER_22]: I rape the crane games.

263
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:34,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, it's not one of those... I need to talk to JB for a minute who's telling us about this.

264
00:21:34,805 --> 00:21:37,547
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not one of those shitty cranes for candy type thing, is it?

265
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that don't count.

266
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:40,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that doesn't count.

267
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:43,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us a quarter so we can give you two cents worth of candy game.

268
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:45,572
[SPEAKER_18]: The claw.

269
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,253
[SPEAKER_18]: We're talking...

270
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,406
[SPEAKER_24]: I am all over shitty stuffed animals.

271
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,541
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a crane game unless the animals are shitty.

272
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,841
[SPEAKER_24]: It just doesn't happen that way.

273
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:18,322
[SPEAKER_24]: It's always choose the worst looking, ugliest piece of crap you see in there and you will get it first try.

274
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:20,703
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't make fun of my shitty animals!

275
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:27,965
[SPEAKER_22]: The best thing I ever won, and of all places this was at Spiegel, I got Tyrone.

276
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, Tyrone.

277
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Tyrone was the best.

278
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:32,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is Tyrone?

279
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:35,727
[SPEAKER_22]: Tyrone is currently in lockup with his pussies and bitches.

280
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:44,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Tyrone, by the way, and maybe I'll find during the next break, I'll find a link to a picture of Tyrone and put it in the chat room because I know I have one up.

281
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,422
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody knows of my secret picture page, it's in there with Sunnyvale Tournament pictures.

282
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:54,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Tyrone is a little stuffed bear that wears like a little... He's a real beanie bear.

283
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,787
[SPEAKER_22]: ...little Hugh Hefner pimp coat.

284
00:22:57,128 --> 00:23:02,351
[SPEAKER_22]: He's a brown bear wearing a deep maroon smoking jacket.

285
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:05,414
[SPEAKER_22]: And his name literally is Tyrone.

286
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:08,736
[SPEAKER_22]: He is the coolest bear in the world.

287
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:11,817
[SPEAKER_22]: He has bitches, thanks to Melody.

288
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:14,338
[SPEAKER_24]: And he has pussies.

289
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:18,079
[SPEAKER_24]: You know how hard it is to find little tiny dogs?

290
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,541
[SPEAKER_24]: And just to be wandering around Target saying, wow, I need to get some bitches around here somewhere.

291
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,082
[SPEAKER_24]: Especially when you're in the toy section and all the kids are wandering around.

292
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:28,763
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just like, hmm, I need some bitches here.

293
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:36,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, can I get a price check on bitches on aisle three?

294
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:40,923
[SPEAKER_22]: Attention Kmart shoppers, we have a sale in the bitches department.

295
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:46,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Attention all Kmart shoppers, tampons and bitches half off.

296
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:52,688
[SPEAKER_24]: Excuse me, do we have any bitches here?

297
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:54,989
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a bitch in the house?

298
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,991
[SPEAKER_24]: Remind me to never ever drink water at this show again.

299
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:03,333
[SPEAKER_24]: I nearly choked down my vanilla coke.

300
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:10,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we had some... Some bitches made a mess on aisle three.

301
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:14,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we get the little pink powder?

302
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:16,538
[SPEAKER_22]: We got a bitch in the line.

303
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:18,019
[SPEAKER_22]: We need a price check on bitches.

304
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,941
[SPEAKER_07]: We're so easily amused here today.

305
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,322
[SPEAKER_07]: What's for money?

306
00:24:24,382 --> 00:24:25,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care about money anymore.

307
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to talk about... I just want to say bitch as many times as I can on the show tonight.

308
00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:30,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Bitch mania 2DX.

309
00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:32,395
[SPEAKER_11]: News Science Collection

310
00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:56,164
[SPEAKER_22]: I had a chance to do it Wednesday night.

311
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:57,265
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't tell you about that.

312
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:01,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Just another stupid mom letting her child run rampant on the thing.

313
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,911
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was like, you need to control your little spawn there.

314
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:08,874
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually referred to the child as spawn.

315
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,595
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I said their child.

316
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:13,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there was also the incident with the giggling idiots.

317
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:21,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, if you've ever seen the Clerks cartoon, yeah, and the two giggling girls, that's like what these chicks were like, you know.

318
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:30,674
[SPEAKER_22]: They were sitting over at the little tables, and I was watching, I think, who was it that was playing Parapara?

319
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:32,655
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it was Sunil that was playing...

320
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:45,061
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if anyone watches DigiCart, but I had a black Gamma Gamma Dawn hat with the little pointy horns on it.

321
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:47,623
[SPEAKER_22]: And I went, I like your hat!

322
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,086
[SPEAKER_22]: Calling for another, and finally one of them came over and said, I like your hat.

323
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:51,826
[SPEAKER_22]: I go, thank you.

324
00:25:52,587 --> 00:25:53,208
[SPEAKER_22]: And so she walked off.

325
00:25:53,528 --> 00:26:00,854
[SPEAKER_22]: And then they pointed to the African that was on my purse and I go, and one of them came over and I was like, she's like, would you eat your dog?

326
00:26:01,714 --> 00:26:02,155
[SPEAKER_22]: Go away.

327
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:05,238
[SPEAKER_22]: You wanted to kill them all.

328
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:09,622
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what this is kinda turning into here, I think?

329
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to get into this.

330
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:25,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to get into the FU of the week.

331
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have at it, shall we?

332
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:31,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have another one you want to start us off with, Jamie?

333
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've been getting a lot in the chat room that I can talk about.

334
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have one myself.

335
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it, Jamie.

336
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear your FU of the week.

337
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:46,089
[SPEAKER_22]: My first one, of course, goes toward those, you know, crappy, giggling, stupid, moron, stupid fucks at Rizvalgatan.

338
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:49,791
[SPEAKER_22]: My other fuck you of the week goes toward idiots in general, because I hate them.

339
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:53,053
[SPEAKER_22]: Especially idiots... What?

340
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,397
[SPEAKER_24]: That's rather vague in general, but I kinda like it.

341
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,739
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, no.

342
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:07,743
[SPEAKER_22]: There's the people who will fall for just about anything that you put in front of them.

343
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:11,649
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I will narrow down this level of idiocy to sheep.

344
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:18,119
[SPEAKER_22]: To the people who will blindly follow one voice and think that they are the end all.

345
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:23,571
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, the little... You know, there's nothing wrong with, you know, fanboys and fangirls.

346
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:34,157
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a thing with people who are fanboys and fangirls to the exception of all else, who will take anything that they hear on TV, anything on the radio, by the way, do everything I say, anything that they...

347
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:42,124
[SPEAKER_22]: They read and act like it is, you know, the absolute scripture that they need to live their lives by.

348
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:46,488
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, I must buy this thing for the sake of my American pride.

349
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:49,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, orange is the new red.

350
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:50,833
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly!

351
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,915
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever saw Josie and the Pussycats, one of those ever.

352
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:58,440
[SPEAKER_22]: But that is exactly the thing that I... And there's the people...

353
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:06,001
[SPEAKER_22]: who think, oh, well, you know, my life isn't very important, so I'm going to make up something really stupid so I can get on CNN.

354
00:28:07,142 --> 00:28:11,045
[SPEAKER_22]: But no, I'm not talking about, you know, about... Oh, my God.

355
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:15,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to tell a waitress at Shoney's that my van has a bomb in it, and I'm going to go blow something up.

356
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:16,790
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, my God!

357
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:20,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Boy, that killed the conversation, didn't it?

358
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:21,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else in here?

359
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,736
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, are you done with your... No, I just don't like stupid people.

360
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:25,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

361
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:26,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other rants you have?

362
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:31,003
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, then we've got Loki's got his round.

363
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:31,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it, Loki.

364
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:37,745
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, my first FU of the week goes to the new version of DWI, which I'll go over that later.

365
00:28:38,145 --> 00:28:38,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

366
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:40,246
[SPEAKER_10]: But damn thing didn't work again.

367
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much of a surprise.

368
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,007
[SPEAKER_10]: They just can't program it right for some reason.

369
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:45,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's just incompatible with my computer.

370
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:51,590
[SPEAKER_10]: My second FU of the week would have to go to... By the way, Loki, happy birthday.

371
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:51,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

372
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:52,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

373
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:55,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Your little party you had last night was quite nice.

374
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for reminding me.

375
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,029
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my second FU of the week.

376
00:28:58,109 --> 00:28:58,969
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to 9-11.

377
00:28:59,249 --> 00:28:59,790
[SPEAKER_10]: God damn it.

378
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I had that birthday 21 years before that.

379
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:04,572
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fair.

380
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:08,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's like, oh, your birthday's on 9-11.

381
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:08,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

382
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,795
[SPEAKER_10]: That must suck.

383
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:12,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not.

384
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:12,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you.

385
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:21,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so pretty much every year from now on, everyone at my work and all that stuff, they actually forget my birthday because of 9-11.

386
00:29:21,784 --> 00:29:22,605
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

387
00:29:23,406 --> 00:29:26,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So that feeds to 9-11 and the new version of DWI.

388
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:29,331
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm going to do just for you, Loki?

389
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:37,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you have to go through that every year on your birthday, I'm going to change your song that you have to hear all the time.

390
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:39,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh...

391
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:45,910
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have this be your FU song in the week for the future.

392
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:46,610
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

393
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:50,611
[SPEAKER_07]: This moment of political incorrectness.

394
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:55,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Speaking of political incorrectness, or correctness or whatever, my music, please.

395
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:56,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, sorry.

396
00:29:56,734 --> 00:30:04,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I have requests for my song since, you know, that Drop the Bomb doesn't really work with 9-11.

397
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:05,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you can change it to Crash.

398
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, yes, Jamie, you have FU of the week.

399
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:17,654
[SPEAKER_22]: My other one, it's also directed in a similar fashion toward the whole 9-11 thing.

400
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:20,094
[SPEAKER_22]: For people who saw my big rant in my live journal.

401
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:23,775
[SPEAKER_22]: It's actually directed toward consumerism in general.

402
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:26,035
[SPEAKER_22]: I am a consumer whore!

403
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:26,996
[SPEAKER_22]: And how!

404
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:33,137
[SPEAKER_22]: This goes toward all those people who are trying to make a quick buck off a tragedy.

405
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:33,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you!

406
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:36,037
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

407
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:37,498
[SPEAKER_22]: Go to hell and die there.

408
00:30:37,978 --> 00:30:38,318
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

409
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:41,913
[SPEAKER_10]: and just to add to that, they named it a holiday.

410
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,653
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now Patriot's Day.

411
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:45,213
[SPEAKER_07]: No longer will it be called 9-11.

412
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:47,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't that sound like the greatest sale at JCPenney's?

413
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Patriot's Day sale, yay!

414
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,235
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's awesome because I get that day off every year, hopefully.

415
00:30:58,376 --> 00:30:58,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

416
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:03,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other FUs on anything in general?

417
00:31:04,678 --> 00:31:05,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Mel B's got one.

418
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have male music, but I'll find male music really fast.

419
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:10,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

420
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:11,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Male music, male music.

421
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:12,958
[SPEAKER_07]: What would work for male music?

422
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:16,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try... I will.

423
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:17,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Word.

424
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:25,244
[SPEAKER_29]: Excellent choice, my man.

425
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:27,725
[SPEAKER_29]: Anyway, I got one big F for you, actually.

426
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:32,026
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is not just one person, not even one day, it's a whole damn city.

427
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:33,707
[SPEAKER_29]: It's the city of Milpitas.

428
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:38,508
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know most of you who've been out there in a while, but apparently there was a problem about a month ago.

429
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:41,469
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, a month and a half, two months ago.

430
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:45,391
[SPEAKER_29]: Apparently a pipe that was a pump to...

431
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:53,606
[SPEAKER_24]: Here, since I know the story, there's a saltwater pond apparently on the edge of Milpitas in San Jose.

432
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:56,547
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's like 650 acres.

433
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:57,108
[SPEAKER_24]: It's huge.

434
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:01,490
[SPEAKER_24]: And it has lots of nice little organisms and crap in it.

435
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,271
[SPEAKER_24]: And the pump broke.

436
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:10,788
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's been very warm in the area, and lots of nice little organisms and stuff in there.

437
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha, smells like poopy.

438
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,171
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, try like bad sushi.

439
00:32:16,152 --> 00:32:16,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Constantly.

440
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:22,538
[SPEAKER_29]: Really horrible, and it just smells all day long.

441
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:29,124
[SPEAKER_29]: I, that feels so bad for people like who work at- Like worse than the sushi place at the Metreon?

442
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:32,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding, I've never had that before.

443
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:35,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, seriously, I mean... Trying to think of an easy place to knock.

444
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,600
[SPEAKER_29]: I feel so bad for people who work at, like, Dave & Buster's.

445
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,862
[SPEAKER_29]: They gotta sit out there all day long and, like, inhale this in.

446
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:51,489
[SPEAKER_07]: They just get headaches and, man, I just couldn't... You gotta wonder, though, because I've actually, I've been to Illuminations, the candle store, you know, and I've asked the chicks that work there, you know, doesn't it get annoying after a while smelling like candle?

447
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:55,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say they get used to it, so you gotta wonder if Dave & Buster's people get used to the raw sushi smell.

448
00:32:56,025 --> 00:33:00,546
[SPEAKER_24]: I actually, since I'm like the nice person that I am, I actually talk to the doormen when I go in at Dave Buster's.

449
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:02,586
[SPEAKER_24]: I say, how the hell do you live with this smell?

450
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,687
[SPEAKER_24]: He says, you know, we get headaches all the time.

451
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:06,427
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't stand it.

452
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:07,987
[SPEAKER_24]: They actually still smell it.

453
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:12,128
[SPEAKER_24]: Believe me, I will run from my car to the door and get in as fast as I can.

454
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:14,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Mel and I were in Milpitas getting gas.

455
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:15,269
[SPEAKER_24]: He opened the window to my car.

456
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:17,589
[SPEAKER_24]: I started screaming at him, shut the damn window!

457
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:19,809
[SPEAKER_24]: It's gonna smell like fucking fish in here!

458
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,131
[SPEAKER_29]: But yeah, so in general, fuck you Milpitas.

459
00:33:27,232 --> 00:33:28,252
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't even continue.

460
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:34,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, now we've got to get to the FUs of the week from the chatroom.

461
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:36,596
[SPEAKER_07]: This is turning into an awfully long segment every week, but okay.

462
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:37,676
[SPEAKER_06]: We're negative.

463
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:38,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

464
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:39,617
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the people's FU.

465
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:42,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the people's choice, the people's FU.

466
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:45,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the FUs from the chatroom, shall we?

467
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:48,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Twin says...

468
00:33:51,632 --> 00:33:56,715
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to Windows XP because it's crashed on him again and it's making me format his drive again this week.

469
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:58,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tim says hi to Jamie.

470
00:33:58,976 --> 00:33:59,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi!

471
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:04,119
[SPEAKER_07]: SoCalKick says his FU of the week is childproof safety caps.

472
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It took him seven tries to open the new bottle of pills that he got today in a new bottle.

473
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:14,165
[SPEAKER_24]: And yet, the childproof bottle will keep the adults out, but kids can get it at first try.

474
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:18,729
[SPEAKER_24]: Mommy, what's this blue candy?

475
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:33,443
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the crack, put it back DCB has a fuck you of the week and he says it's to his parents Typical T-Gangs there For not letting him buy 2DX because it's too expensive

476
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:39,942
[SPEAKER_07]: So now he's stuck with a 2DX controller and nothing to play except for five key games, which get boring fast.

477
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:43,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I recommend Sixth and Core, because it's almost just like 2DX.

478
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:47,068
[SPEAKER_21]: When I was your age, we didn't have this beat mania stuff.

479
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:49,790
[SPEAKER_21]: We had to play on the Power Pad.

480
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:52,872
[SPEAKER_21]: It was Power Glove.

481
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:53,853
[SPEAKER_07]: The Power Glove.

482
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:55,895
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so bad.

483
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:59,838
[SPEAKER_21]: All we had was Excitebike and Gyromite.

484
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, Rob the Robot was the shit.

485
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:06,295
[SPEAKER_21]: I just like it because it's named Rob.

486
00:35:07,495 --> 00:35:07,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

487
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:13,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk to Black Lab.

488
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:13,719
[SPEAKER_07]: His F.U.

489
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:24,685
[SPEAKER_07]: of the week is Denny's for their slow-ass service that caused him to be two hours late in getting home from the Disney rave tourney, thusly getting him in deep shit with the parents.

490
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:25,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Denny's.

491
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:26,946
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't care.

492
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:28,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's got an F.U.

493
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:29,448
[SPEAKER_07]: of the week right behind him.

494
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:37,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, speaking of Denny's, I don't know what it is about Denny's, but every time I go in there, they have to do one of two things.

495
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:42,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Either A, forget something I ordered, or B, make fun of my shirt.

496
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:46,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Normally I have a shirt on there, and it'll have like a phrase.

497
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:49,078
[SPEAKER_10]: One time I had one that said, I hear voices and they don't like it.

498
00:35:49,378 --> 00:35:50,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really hear voices?

499
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:51,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they like me?

500
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,999
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, go away.

501
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:56,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear one really annoying voice right now.

502
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:56,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Cram it.

503
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So F you to Denny's, because they suck.

504
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,260
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, fair enough.

505
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Carols is better anyway.

506
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:05,122
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever go to the Carols in Roseville, ask for Mary Lou.

507
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:05,842
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a sweetie.

508
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:06,962
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, she is, and tip her well.

509
00:36:07,062 --> 00:36:07,542
[SPEAKER_22]: Tip her well.

510
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:10,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Three more.

511
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:11,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Three more FUs.

512
00:36:11,684 --> 00:36:13,684
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus says... Oh, he wants two.

513
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:20,926
[SPEAKER_07]: He says a continued fuck you to Boom PlayStation... Oh, PlayStation 2 USB converters.

514
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:22,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Controller converters.

515
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:26,728
[SPEAKER_07]: And also a good-sized FU to the Player One keys on RVGL's Hip Hop Mania.

516
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:28,300
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

517
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,782
[SPEAKER_22]: I would have to second that, except the way that I play, I really don't have an issue with it.

518
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:37,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe Mama says, F you from school for being morons.

519
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:39,469
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave him three detentions for nothing.

520
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:40,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, fuck them.

521
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:42,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

522
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:45,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I somehow wonder if he really did nothing.

523
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:49,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was only late a couple times.

524
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:50,097
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not that bad.

525
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:51,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what he did.

526
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:52,740
[SPEAKER_07]: We gotta know, what did he really do?

527
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,501
[SPEAKER_07]: He did something bad.

528
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:56,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I really didn't hit anybody.

529
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:00,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, JB says F you to Karos for being slow.

530
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,840
[SPEAKER_07]: F you, JB.

531
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my F you.

532
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:10,722
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we have to add IHOP to that list because we had some slow ass service there after me the other day.

533
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe Mama got detention because he quote unquote missed a class.

534
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:18,243
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh yeah, and furthermore from all IHOP.

535
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he miss a class because he was out back smoking pot or what?

536
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:28,891
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know, but to continue that IHOP thought, I'm just thinking, that's the four reasons why we gotta have a raw chicken and waffles up in NorCal.

537
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:29,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

538
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:31,452
[SPEAKER_07]: A chicken and waffle!

539
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:32,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Amen to that.

540
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:33,853
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

541
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:34,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

542
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:38,555
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it, just one day, come to my house, I will make you French toast.

543
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:40,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Cause I rule like that.

544
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:43,679
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not the same.

545
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,100
[SPEAKER_22]: My French toast owns.

546
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,660
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never had my French toast.

547
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,221
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just not the same.

548
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:50,041
[SPEAKER_24]: They add crack to their chicken and waffles.

549
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:51,722
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm talking about IHOPing.

550
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:53,583
[SPEAKER_22]: Kero's and Denny's and those crappy places.

551
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:55,303
[SPEAKER_24]: I've moved on to Roscoe's.

552
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:55,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

553
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:01,670
[SPEAKER_07]: We gotta take this show down to SoCal sometime.

554
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,451
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna tape a show in SoCal at some point.

555
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:04,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Somehow.

556
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:05,472
[SPEAKER_07]: AI chip anyone?

557
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:08,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys want to take our recorder?

558
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:10,495
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys live closer by, I'd let you take the recorder and tape fun stuff.

559
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:13,256
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to AI for a while, but I don't know if we're gonna see anyone entertaining.

560
00:38:13,537 --> 00:38:16,778
[SPEAKER_24]: We could take it on rides at Disneyland and start screaming randomly or something.

561
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:17,459
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, cause...

562
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:20,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm thinking of how I could make this work.

563
00:38:20,473 --> 00:38:24,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be able to let you guys borrow the remote unit for a while if you guys want to tape your adventures.

564
00:38:24,614 --> 00:38:27,596
[SPEAKER_24]: Unfortunately, they won't let recorders or anything into the prices right.

565
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:29,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean the rest of your adventures if you go to AI or whatever.

566
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:30,757
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, we're going to AI.

567
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:32,597
[SPEAKER_07]: A live review of Martial Beat.

568
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:36,359
[SPEAKER_29]: A live review of Martial Beat, complete with punching and sweating and all that good schmack.

569
00:38:36,499 --> 00:38:38,560
[SPEAKER_24]: And everybody was kung fu fighting.

570
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,461
[SPEAKER_24]: And the woman in my head was kick punch.

571
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:44,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, we should do a review for Punch Mania.

572
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:45,922
[SPEAKER_07]: They have it at Florin now.

573
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:49,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I hear is that Florin Mall here in Sacramento got Punch Mania.

574
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:50,905
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the Fist of the North Star one.

575
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:52,125
[SPEAKER_07]: The Fist of the North Star one, yep.

576
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:56,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the ghetto-ass fucking mall got Punch Mania.

577
00:38:56,787 --> 00:38:58,248
[SPEAKER_07]: So the gang members can train.

578
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:00,148
[SPEAKER_24]: I drove by there.

579
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:01,329
[SPEAKER_24]: That place was scary.

580
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:05,531
[SPEAKER_22]: It is very scary and desolate looking, but they have Pump It Up.

581
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:06,971
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have Pump It Up.

582
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:08,612
[SPEAKER_22]: Ooh, Pump It Up.

583
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:09,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Bounce with me, bounce with me.

584
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:11,093
[SPEAKER_22]: Bounce with me, bounce.

585
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:11,433
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, okay.

586
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:13,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yes.

587
00:39:14,175 --> 00:39:17,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, speaking of... Oh, I see you're telling me to do a segue.

588
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:17,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yes.

589
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:19,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this segue.

590
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:22,331
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something we've actually talked about on the show before.

591
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:23,911
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is interesting.

592
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:30,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I find this interesting only because this is a story that is actually posted on Konami's site in the UK.

593
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:32,338
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Konami Amusement of Europe.

594
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:37,443
[SPEAKER_07]: This is their stance on the Konami versus Andamiro, which is the company that makes Pump It Up.

595
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:40,085
[SPEAKER_07]: This is their words on that whole lawsuit.

596
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:40,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why it's interesting.

597
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:45,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is the first real comment I've seen from Konami on this whole thing.

598
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's read this, shall we?

599
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:48,928
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from Konami's site.

600
00:39:48,948 --> 00:40:02,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Konami's legal eagles have always had their hands full defending Dance Dance Revolution's genre, spawning style from being copied all over the world, but this latest attempt by company Andamaro, they call it Andamaro, has evened them slightly taken aback.

601
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:11,175
[SPEAKER_07]: This time it appears the Korean company's strategy was to claim they actually invented DDR in the first place, despite the fact it took them almost two years to make their complaint.

602
00:40:11,835 --> 00:40:12,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

603
00:40:12,862 --> 00:40:18,744
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of interesting because they're kind of taking jabs at Andamiro, which you don't usually see in company press releases.

604
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,485
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, in Europe, everything's tabloid.

605
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:23,126
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about, you know, at least from what I've seen.

606
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:29,728
[SPEAKER_07]: The parties have been involved in legal disputes since then in front of the Korean and the U.S.

607
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:30,168
[SPEAKER_07]: courts.

608
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:34,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that's interesting because I don't think we've ever heard before that this thing's been in the U.S.

609
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,011
[SPEAKER_07]: courts, but this says it has.

610
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:44,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Namiro started manufacturing and distributing Pump It Up Dance Simulation Game, which was very similar to Konami's Dance Dance Revolution during September 1999.

611
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:51,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami filed a complaint with the Seoul District Court seeking an injunction against the production of Pump It Up.

612
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:53,674
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

613
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:19,403
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason was that Konami infringed the patent and Amiro had been assigned from a third party in the U.S.

614
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:22,186
[SPEAKER_07]: The case was scheduled for jury trial this month.

615
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:22,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So, interesting.

616
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:30,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And Amiro filed a complaint against Konami seeking an injunction against the distribution of Dance's Revolution in the United States.

617
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: No U.S.

618
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:32,238
[SPEAKER_07]: mixes lately.

619
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

620
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:35,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So that opens the door.

621
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:56,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, so that's that.

622
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:00,159
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an official word from Konami of the UK.

623
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:03,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And says some very interesting things in there we might not have known before.

624
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody want to comment on this story?

625
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:05,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Have anything to say about it?

626
00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:06,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Loki.

627
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:09,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean we're going to see some U.S.

628
00:42:09,523 --> 00:42:10,363
[SPEAKER_10]: pump-it-up machines?

629
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:14,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I think pump-it-ups have already kind of been distributed in the U.S.

630
00:42:14,505 --> 00:42:17,546
[SPEAKER_07]: You seem to know about this, Mel?

631
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they've kind of been hawking the machines to U.S.

632
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:20,707
[SPEAKER_07]: arcades.

633
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:37,282
[SPEAKER_29]: But of course, there's companies out there that hawk the mechs too, like US arcades too, so I don't know if Animero's necessarily launched in the US, but... Well, it has been targeted in the US for a while, I mean, like, if you went to... I forget what the major arcade game convention is in Vegas...

634
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:40,594
[SPEAKER_29]: DarkSakura,

635
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,376
[SPEAKER_29]: about a year ago when I did a big interview for DDR Spotlight.

636
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:14,778
[SPEAKER_29]: Right, I remember reading that.

637
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:20,041
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, like, kind of off the record, we were talking about, well, how come you would never see, like, Konomics or anything in Arcade yet?

638
00:43:20,382 --> 00:43:27,267
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, it told us, basically, it would have been a really bad move to put out, like, during this whole lawsuit, to put out a new US mix.

639
00:43:27,627 --> 00:43:31,810
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, so Adamir would be saying, you know, what kind of, you know, strategy is that?

640
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,873
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, you're being sued for something, and you're already putting out a new Arcade mix?

641
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:36,794
[SPEAKER_29]: That's, you know, not right.

642
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:37,795
[SPEAKER_29]: It wouldn't look good.

643
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:38,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

644
00:43:38,694 --> 00:43:43,057
[SPEAKER_07]: But now this kind of opens the door here, it looks like, sounds like, so who knows what might happen.

645
00:43:43,097 --> 00:43:48,961
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm guessing probably someone else is going to distribute the Konami game since, yeah, I guess Konami shut down its coin off.

646
00:43:49,081 --> 00:43:56,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I think it's a given somebody's going to step in and fill in that void and we'll see something coming from Konami in the near future.

647
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:57,786
[SPEAKER_29]: Possibly.

648
00:43:58,026 --> 00:43:58,506
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

649
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:01,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe in the future we can get Jason on this show.

650
00:44:01,448 --> 00:44:02,569
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to work on that.

651
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:05,871
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to try and smooth him to get him on this program at some point.

652
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:07,532
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I've got pretty good, you know,

653
00:44:11,576 --> 00:44:15,359
[SPEAKER_29]: I was about to ask, what's going on?

654
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:16,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to update us on DDR Spot?

655
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:24,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting you're a major part of the DDR Spot group, so you want to say any plugs for DDR Spot, what's going on there?

656
00:44:24,488 --> 00:44:30,252
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, right now, yeah, our site is down for more maiming because we're going for a new launch right now.

657
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,793
[SPEAKER_29]: We're basically tweaking a few things on the back end.

658
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:36,015
[SPEAKER_29]: We're targeting something to probably late this week.

659
00:44:36,035 --> 00:44:37,536
[SPEAKER_29]: We're about to launch everything.

660
00:44:37,576 --> 00:44:39,077
[SPEAKER_29]: It's going to have a new look, new feel.

661
00:44:39,257 --> 00:44:39,517
[SPEAKER_26]: Cool.

662
00:44:39,858 --> 00:44:45,461
[SPEAKER_29]: It's going to have quite a few new goodies and a lot of things that haven't been there before and haven't been really on any other DDR sites.

663
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,623
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I have to ask, you can say no comment if you want, forums.com.

664
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:50,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And try that again?

665
00:44:51,046 --> 00:44:54,227
[SPEAKER_29]: We're looking at something alternate to forums, actually.

666
00:44:54,767 --> 00:45:05,671
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know if I'm necessarily at liberty to say it right now, but I will say there will be a way you can interact with all members without having forums.

667
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:11,974
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a way to interact one-on-one with either the members, the lurkers, or with the staff itself.

668
00:45:12,154 --> 00:45:14,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't want to get you in trouble, so we'll just say tune in to win.

669
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:14,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

670
00:45:15,948 --> 00:45:18,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so DDRspot.com coming back very soon.

671
00:45:18,992 --> 00:45:19,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep an eye on it.

672
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:21,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure they'll announce that everywhere.

673
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:23,697
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll mention it on this show for sure once we see this back up.

674
00:45:23,977 --> 00:45:24,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, wonderful.

675
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:26,520
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe we'll have the staff here sometime as well too.

676
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to that.

677
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:28,483
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to get that to work sometime.

678
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:29,123
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be awesome.

679
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:31,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, how about a quick break everybody?

680
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:32,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a really quick break.

681
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:32,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll come back.

682
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:34,636
[SPEAKER_17]: What do I get to break?

683
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:35,437
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

684
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:36,558
[SPEAKER_17]: What do I get to break?

685
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,440
[SPEAKER_07]: That dish, no.

686
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:43,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to start, actually there's something I wanted to play.

687
00:45:43,302 --> 00:45:44,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to start this break off with something.

688
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, explain the background on this.

689
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:51,548
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the good version of the song you were talking to me about earlier.

690
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:54,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, this song that's going to be played is Instant Love.

691
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,712
[SPEAKER_10]: It was basically a training stage in Beatmania 3.

692
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:57,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Now...

693
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:00,193
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

694
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:21,215
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy did 20 November.

695
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:23,096
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Nagarero.

696
00:46:23,236 --> 00:46:23,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

697
00:46:23,796 --> 00:46:25,417
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyways, I'm going to try to find his CD.

698
00:46:25,477 --> 00:46:28,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he actually put out a CD because I was visiting his website.

699
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:32,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're trying to find that, import it, and maybe there'll be a clean version of Instant Love we can listen to.

700
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,521
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have no guarantees on that.

701
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,822
[SPEAKER_10]: But just listen to the backgrounds.

702
00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:40,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the one time we're going to make an exception and actually play Let Them Move, because this is a good version.

703
00:46:40,706 --> 00:46:52,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just try not to be annoyed by DJ Konami telling you how to play Beatmania, but just listen to the background and... Okay, so just, you know, preface, there's going to be instructions on how to play Beatmania, in case you didn't know.

704
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:56,098
[SPEAKER_07]: After that... I'm sorry?

705
00:46:56,659 --> 00:47:01,723
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, for any of the old school hip-hop heads, I think DJ Konami looks straight up like a broke-ass Fab Five Freddy.

706
00:47:02,395 --> 00:47:04,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!

707
00:47:31,238 --> 00:47:35,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

708
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen carefully and try to follow.

709
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:42,085
[SPEAKER_13]: The object will come down from the top.

710
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:46,268
[SPEAKER_13]: When it hits the red line, push the button.

711
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:50,350
[SPEAKER_13]: When it hits the red line, turn the table.

712
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:51,711
[SPEAKER_13]: You get it?

713
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:53,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's practice.

714
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:25,333
Easy, huh?

715
00:48:25,473 --> 00:48:28,294
Alright, let's go on to the scratch game.

716
00:48:28,314 --> 00:48:30,854
When the objects reach the red line, scratch!

717
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:34,435
With the fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.

718
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:01,335
[SPEAKER_13]: and the turntable.

719
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:03,417
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard, but you can do it!

720
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:05,218
Okay!

721
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:06,378
Effector time!

722
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:07,799
Here's the spec of the new Beatmania!

723
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:01,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Ladies and Gents

724
00:50:29,711 --> 00:50:31,253
Thank you for watching!

725
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:33,481
[SPEAKER_12]: The Guardian, Angel, Reflector, Light, Lyrically, I own the mic, you slept a deputy, but you established order, Inspector The Guardian, Angel, Reflector, Light, Lyrically, I own the mic, yeah

726
00:51:35,455 --> 00:51:36,055
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

727
00:52:06,275 --> 00:52:26,142
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in the future, MCs who misdemean is left to be, history's a hoochah, think you spittin' at, I represent a different map, hip-hop diplomat, I've already seen a tip of that, see right through ya, I'm original flow jack, God glorify it, poor spiritual, I wish the crack remained anonymous, my lyrics out fit astronomers, ear tied to peril, third commandment for idolaters,

Thank you for watching!

729
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:04,842
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

730
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:54,358
[SPEAKER_15]: The language, now excuse me, as I answer more archives than choosing Methods, my wish to carry out, whether by land or aerial Cause this gig cannot be stereo, type out my brothers at burial Right for harvest, bluejack, but not in office Call us a hip-hop band, blowin' away MCs like Thartis I promise, I ain't your average artist, my thought is Look into God's direction and not the God of sin Believe in what you're facing, use this reality Believe and God will set you free

00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:38,541
[SPEAKER_12]: You know how we do, it's B-A-R-B-A-L, represent the media right, no proof, you know what I'm sayin'?

733
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:48,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Yo, right around now, DJ Hori's in the mix, keepin' you in constant suspense Yo, 2012's sound is sakura, you know what I'm sayin'?

[SPEAKER_12]: Yo, and it goes a little somethin' like this, yo

735
00:54:55,393 --> 00:55:03,921
[SPEAKER_28]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

736
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:09,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

737
00:55:10,827 --> 00:55:12,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go up the street and take a left.

738
00:55:12,528 --> 00:55:15,491
[SPEAKER_07]: No, anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

739
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:16,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Will you be my neighbor?

740
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:18,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Won't you be my neighbor?

741
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:20,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't that guy retire finally?

742
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:21,785
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

743
00:55:22,045 --> 00:55:22,966
[SPEAKER_07]: At least he didn't die.

744
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I say he didn't die.

745
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:26,989
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not an oh thing.

746
00:55:27,009 --> 00:55:28,130
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an oh good thing.

747
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,613
[SPEAKER_24]: But eventually he is, and you just brought up that thought in my head.

748
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:35,076
[SPEAKER_29]: We're all going to... Melody, I'm sorry, but we're all going to die.

749
00:55:36,117 --> 00:55:38,639
[SPEAKER_29]: Everyone's still traumatized Captain Kangaroo is gone, so...

750
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:41,032
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, we're Mr. Green Jeans.

751
00:55:41,152 --> 00:55:44,475
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I know people still coming up to me asking where the heck he is.

752
00:55:44,495 --> 00:55:45,236
[SPEAKER_29]: What am I supposed to say?

753
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:46,276
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Mr. Rogers did not die.

754
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:47,317
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not dead yet.

755
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,819
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone on Sesame Street really recently just died.

756
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,542
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the guy who played Gordon, I think he just died very recently.

757
00:55:53,582 --> 00:55:55,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope not Linda the Deaf Lady, I hope.

758
00:55:55,283 --> 00:55:55,864
[SPEAKER_07]: She was my favorite.

759
00:55:55,904 --> 00:55:57,545
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think so, but like within the past couple weeks.

760
00:55:57,825 --> 00:55:58,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Gordon died?

761
00:55:58,326 --> 00:56:00,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it always the brother that always got to get killed first?

762
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:01,909
[SPEAKER_24]: Man.

763
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:05,151
[SPEAKER_24]: Another instance of a man keeping you down.

764
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:16,420
[SPEAKER_07]: You can address those cards and letters to Mel B. Remember, if you want the proof, go to BurtIsEvil.com

765
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,101
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, it exists.

766
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:21,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they're reminding us about the HIV positive Muffet.

767
00:56:21,783 --> 00:56:22,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Muffet.

768
00:56:24,165 --> 00:56:25,186
[SPEAKER_21]: Little Miss Muffet.

769
00:56:25,206 --> 00:56:26,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Little Miss Muffet.

770
00:56:26,627 --> 00:56:35,214
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

771
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:35,694
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

772
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:36,835
[SPEAKER_19]: That was very bad of you.

773
00:56:41,919 --> 00:56:45,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Little Miss Muffet should be choosy on which tuffet she's sitting on now, shouldn't she?

774
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:50,648
[SPEAKER_10]: She can't just sit on any tuffet, just walks down the street and treats her to a nice dinner.

775
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:54,870
[SPEAKER_29]: And who knows how many seats have been on that tuffet.

776
00:56:56,991 --> 00:56:58,651
[SPEAKER_11]: She should have had that tuffet tested.

777
00:56:59,832 --> 00:57:02,113
[SPEAKER_11]: She's learned how to squat on that tuffet.

778
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:08,596
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

779
00:57:11,537 --> 00:57:11,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways...

780
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:14,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit, we all need to breathe.

781
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm actually tempted to play a song.

782
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:20,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, now that the show has grown to a complete and total halt.

783
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:26,559
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Konami, which is actually DCB under a new name, wants to warn you all that Goat Say sat on that tuffet.

784
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:33,105
[SPEAKER_07]: For those who don't know Goat Say, all I have to say...

785
00:57:34,455 --> 00:57:35,556
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's go say.

786
00:57:36,497 --> 00:57:38,139
[SPEAKER_07]: That was me bending over and pretending, yeah.

787
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:38,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

788
00:57:38,939 --> 00:57:42,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to keep your ass on the chair.

789
00:57:42,823 --> 00:57:44,084
[SPEAKER_22]: You just sit on your tuffet there.

790
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:48,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep your tuffets to yourself, bitch.

791
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:51,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yes, where were we?

792
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:53,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuffets.

793
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:55,214
[SPEAKER_07]: AIDS, something about, no, anyway.

794
00:57:57,036 --> 00:57:57,596
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing with HIV.

795
00:57:58,579 --> 00:57:59,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, the Muppet with HIV.

796
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:02,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have a Healing Vision AIDS mix.

797
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,560
[SPEAKER_10]: HIV mix.

798
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,220
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

799
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,900
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds very politically incorrect.

800
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, it says this DWI will give you AIDS.

801
00:58:09,901 --> 00:58:13,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just a really crappy remix of Healing Vision and Max 300.

802
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:18,342
[SPEAKER_10]: They purposely made it bad and made the set file impossible just because they were frustrated with all the remixes.

803
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:26,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they don't like the Healing Vision remixes so they just went... They just don't like any of the remixes so they just got pissed off and made a HIV mix.

804
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,424
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

805
00:58:31,624 --> 00:58:32,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

806
00:58:51,773 --> 00:58:58,938
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, well, first of all, I recorded over old interviews, so I'm really not sure exactly.

807
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:02,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I trimmed it up, so everything should be okay.

808
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:05,142
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to explain why you sound really stoned in the thing.

809
00:59:05,722 --> 00:59:11,846
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I was going on four hours of sleep, and I was really tired, and then I was traumatized by stepping state.

810
00:59:12,647 --> 00:59:13,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so stepping state.

811
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:16,509
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have any questions, okay, there, the cam should be better now.

812
00:59:17,149 --> 00:59:18,290
[SPEAKER_22]: I sound really retarded.

813
00:59:18,771 --> 00:59:19,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops, wait.

814
00:59:20,248 --> 00:59:22,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, you're going to see an old picture on the cam real fast.

815
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll probably update soon, so just sit tight.

816
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:25,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Cam's working.

817
00:59:26,713 --> 00:59:29,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's play these interviews, alright?

818
00:59:30,095 --> 00:59:38,021
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the Orange Lounge interviews for Sunday, September 7th.

819
00:59:39,402 --> 00:59:39,482
[SPEAKER_20]: 8th.

820
00:59:40,222 --> 00:59:40,303
[SPEAKER_20]: 8th.

821
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:43,125
[SPEAKER_20]: The 8th.

822
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:44,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Just remember, stepping stage.

823
00:59:44,405 --> 00:59:45,106
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about stepping stage.

824
00:59:45,286 --> 00:59:46,267
[SPEAKER_22]: I was so tired.

825
00:59:49,488 --> 00:59:57,313
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the first of the interviews for Orange Lounge Radio, which, you know, we had the battery case off of the recorder, so it's kind of messed up.

826
00:59:57,373 --> 00:59:59,935
[SPEAKER_22]: So, we're going to go ahead and try this again.

827
01:00:00,395 --> 01:00:06,479
[SPEAKER_22]: So, go ahead and, you know, once again, we have someone who's no stranger to Orange Lounge interviews.

828
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,862
[SPEAKER_22]: So, go ahead and state your info.

829
01:00:11,843 --> 01:00:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Con, Kiyoki, Su, Step Squad Family.

830
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:15,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Second interview for Orange Lounge.

831
01:00:15,906 --> 01:00:16,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely sober this time.

832
01:00:17,307 --> 01:00:17,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

833
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:17,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

834
01:00:18,752 --> 01:00:20,873
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not necessarily a good thing, is it?

835
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:22,573
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really.

836
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:27,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have Jenny here who gave me her... He's sober, but the question is, were you?

837
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:28,955
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes!

838
01:00:29,595 --> 01:00:30,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, just checking.

839
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:31,996
[SPEAKER_04]: ...on my arm when I was drunk.

840
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:34,857
[SPEAKER_04]: She claimed she didn't draw on me, but my humor's a little hazy.

841
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:35,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I drew on him.

842
01:00:36,217 --> 01:00:36,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you comment on that?

843
01:00:38,618 --> 01:00:39,798
[SPEAKER_20]: All I wrote was my email.

844
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,159
[SPEAKER_20]: I was the one who drew the squid on the back of your forehead.

845
01:00:42,399 --> 01:00:42,999
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, head.

846
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,540
[SPEAKER_19]: I drew the eyes on the back of your neck.

847
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember that.

848
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:50,431
[SPEAKER_04]: People are still wondering what the hell that was.

849
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:52,652
[SPEAKER_22]: Who was it that beat you over the head with my bat anyway?

850
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:53,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Ron Kitty.

851
01:00:53,893 --> 01:00:55,833
[SPEAKER_04]: She did not make it today, but she's here in spirit.

852
01:00:57,034 --> 01:00:57,654
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah, yes.

853
01:00:58,914 --> 01:01:06,657
[SPEAKER_22]: So, um, go ahead and, uh, you know, give your daily recap for our, uh, fun event today with the First Step Squad and etc.

854
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:09,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, well, let me see.

855
01:01:09,577 --> 01:01:14,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering I was probably the first one up at six in the morning, lack of sleep, next thing to being high...

856
01:01:15,862 --> 01:01:24,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and Jay actually had to clean up the house a little bit, but then after that 12 o'clock rolls around, Step Squad, RTF, and Otaku Outpost rolled out to the Holiday Bowl.

857
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:27,026
[SPEAKER_04]: From there, good times.

858
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:31,387
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually rigged the machine, so the last round, everyone got a strike.

859
01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:34,268
[SPEAKER_22]: That was cool, but it's sad that they shut everything off.

860
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:34,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

861
01:01:35,248 --> 01:01:41,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, they ran out of pins, so everyone who bowled rolled a strike.

862
01:01:45,272 --> 01:01:51,014
[SPEAKER_24]: On the last one, is that like the most ghetto bowling alley around that they actually ran out of pins?

863
01:01:52,115 --> 01:01:53,275
[SPEAKER_24]: It's super ghetto.

864
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,336
[SPEAKER_29]: Scott's stepping stage.

865
01:01:55,596 --> 01:01:57,917
[SPEAKER_29]: I think there's nothing that can go lower than that.

866
01:01:59,564 --> 01:02:02,707
[SPEAKER_07]: They want a clarification as to what exactly this event is that you were at.

867
01:02:02,907 --> 01:02:12,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, we had Cece down visiting from SoCal, and we had Liz visit.

868
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:16,499
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, she lives in California, but she was going to school in Washington State.

869
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,403
[SPEAKER_22]: So they were both in town, and we had a big gathering.

870
01:02:21,324 --> 01:02:23,385
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it started off as just Step Squad, but it grew.

871
01:02:24,426 --> 01:02:24,667
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

872
01:02:25,728 --> 01:02:25,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Guys.

873
01:02:26,813 --> 01:02:31,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't bowling, so I really wouldn't care about that, but that sucked.

874
01:02:31,154 --> 01:02:34,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have loved to see the picture of everyone, last frame, triple strike each.

875
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:40,036
[SPEAKER_22]: They should have done that for ours, because mine were just like, oh, we're bowling, and I sucked, my score sucked.

876
01:02:40,897 --> 01:02:43,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe, well, the thing was, they ran out of 10, so, yeah.

877
01:02:44,738 --> 01:02:46,698
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well, I can't score anyway.

878
01:02:47,238 --> 01:02:47,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Sniff.

879
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:54,160
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, we have another couple people with us, so, yes, you.

880
01:02:55,131 --> 01:03:01,513
[SPEAKER_22]: So go ahead and state your, you know, name, everything for our lovely, brilliant listeners.

881
01:03:03,354 --> 01:03:08,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Hattori Hanzo, and I'm doing... Yes, Mel, very fast.

882
01:03:08,676 --> 01:03:13,057
[SPEAKER_24]: There's just nothing like butter enough for your listeners to brighten your day.

883
01:03:13,638 --> 01:03:16,439
[SPEAKER_24]: Those lovely, wonderful people out there that we adore.

884
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we do love our listeners.

885
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing to love your listeners, another thing to love your listeners.

886
01:03:21,861 --> 01:03:22,681
[SPEAKER_17]: They're brilliant to you.

887
01:03:26,209 --> 01:03:29,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Mel Bellby just sends sloppy wet kisses to you all.

888
01:03:29,592 --> 01:03:31,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Soda right now, and I'm feeling alright.

889
01:03:34,996 --> 01:03:37,198
[SPEAKER_19]: And I see that is a Valencia orange soda.

890
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:39,380
[SPEAKER_19]: It is, and it's very good.

891
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,281
[SPEAKER_19]: You should try one.

892
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:41,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it your tasty beverage?

893
01:03:43,303 --> 01:03:48,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since, you know, there aren't no other beverages to choose from, I think I'll just stick with the orange soda.

894
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,730
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

895
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,053
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the sound of a laugh on the head.

896
01:03:56,128 --> 01:04:03,071
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so, um, go ahead and then if you'll state your name and everything for the list.

897
01:04:03,111 --> 01:04:04,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, quick, there's a wap on your head.

898
01:04:06,652 --> 01:04:07,893
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, I need to explain.

899
01:04:08,313 --> 01:04:13,475
[SPEAKER_22]: We were sitting outside in the backyard in lawn chairs, just lounging, going, I'm tired.

900
01:04:13,795 --> 01:04:13,975
[SPEAKER_15]: With a 40?

901
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:14,755
[SPEAKER_15]: With a 40?

902
01:04:15,195 --> 01:04:15,515
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd have 40.

903
01:04:17,496 --> 01:04:19,957
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, Hanzo had orange soda.

904
01:04:20,937 --> 01:04:21,638
[SPEAKER_22]: I had milk tea.

905
01:04:22,878 --> 01:04:24,159
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it was more like a 16 ounce.

906
01:04:27,586 --> 01:04:28,026
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want to.

907
01:04:29,227 --> 01:04:29,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

908
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:31,728
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Jin.

909
01:04:32,348 --> 01:04:33,348
[SPEAKER_22]: However, I'm not male.

910
01:04:33,488 --> 01:04:34,068
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a female.

911
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:36,549
[SPEAKER_07]: That was weird.

912
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:37,810
[SPEAKER_07]: The tape did a funny thing there.

913
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:43,572
[SPEAKER_22]: The guy with the... Yes, don't you know Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game?

914
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:47,213
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

915
01:04:47,774 --> 01:04:48,494
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened there?

916
01:04:48,674 --> 01:04:49,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, excuse me.

917
01:04:49,414 --> 01:04:51,435
[SPEAKER_22]: This is coming from the person who had the screen...

918
01:04:54,442 --> 01:05:00,744
[SPEAKER_22]: I made a reference that said, don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game.

919
01:05:01,004 --> 01:05:02,445
[SPEAKER_22]: And people got the reference.

920
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:03,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Who plays Puzzle Fighter?

921
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:04,185
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

922
01:05:05,046 --> 01:05:05,826
[SPEAKER_22]: Who plays Devilot?

923
01:05:05,846 --> 01:05:05,966
[SPEAKER_22]: Me.

924
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Devilot Super 8.

925
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:10,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, that was one of my old AOL names.

926
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell the D9, like, third mix Korean gates, you know?

927
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:23,164
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the failed scream like what Melfi has on his signature.

928
01:05:23,284 --> 01:05:23,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-oh.

929
01:05:23,885 --> 01:05:24,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Care to comment?

930
01:05:24,605 --> 01:05:25,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Care to comment?

931
01:05:25,906 --> 01:05:26,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, run that by you again.

932
01:05:26,686 --> 01:05:27,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

933
01:05:27,046 --> 01:05:27,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's listen to it again.

934
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:30,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Run back a little.

935
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:34,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell the denied, like, third mix Korean gates, you know?

936
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:39,489
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the failed screen like what Mel B has on his signature.

937
01:05:39,509 --> 01:05:41,569
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't have that anymore.

938
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:42,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Any comment?

939
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,330
[SPEAKER_29]: Hey man, what can I say?

940
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:45,530
[SPEAKER_29]: The world revolves around me.

941
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:50,511
[SPEAKER_29]: You can take anything in the world, you can take six steps, and it comes back to me.

942
01:05:50,851 --> 01:05:51,771
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, like Kevin Bacon?

943
01:05:51,811 --> 01:05:54,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but kosher.

944
01:05:58,812 --> 01:06:00,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Mel B, the B don't stand for bacon.

945
01:06:04,615 --> 01:06:07,376
[SPEAKER_29]: I think after Disney tourney everyone thinks the B stands for bling.

946
01:06:10,077 --> 01:06:11,438
[SPEAKER_03]: The gate was the best thing ever.

947
01:06:11,938 --> 01:06:12,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not kidding.

948
01:06:13,398 --> 01:06:16,580
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a clank and you know your... And you know your thread is locked.

949
01:06:18,195 --> 01:06:21,237
[SPEAKER_22]: So, anyone have any comments for listeners?

950
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:22,858
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything?

951
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:23,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

952
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:25,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanzo, keep talking your shit.

953
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:28,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to jack you like I jacked that ice cream truck earlier with Jay Kinetic.

954
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:30,802
[SPEAKER_22]: I missed that.

955
01:06:31,703 --> 01:06:34,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to know how you're going to jack Hanzo.

956
01:06:34,885 --> 01:06:35,725
[SPEAKER_04]: There's pictures.

957
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary from RTF has them.

958
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:38,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes?

959
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:43,529
[SPEAKER_22]: I just have to say that half of everybody who was in that house did go and hump the ice cream van.

960
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:44,150
What?

961
01:06:45,504 --> 01:06:46,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Explain now.

962
01:06:46,765 --> 01:06:48,325
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't even go out there.

963
01:06:48,345 --> 01:06:50,506
[SPEAKER_22]: I was like, oh, I have milk tea and 2DX, I'm happy.

964
01:06:51,226 --> 01:06:53,767
[SPEAKER_22]: So I didn't even go out there.

965
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:54,968
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't hump the ice cream man?

966
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:55,548
[SPEAKER_22]: No!

967
01:06:56,608 --> 01:06:57,749
[SPEAKER_22]: I had 2DX to hump.

968
01:06:57,829 --> 01:07:01,791
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I'm... I fear.

969
01:07:02,091 --> 01:07:02,551
[SPEAKER_19]: I fear.

970
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:03,411
[SPEAKER_19]: Greatly.

971
01:07:04,472 --> 01:07:07,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

972
01:07:07,473 --> 01:07:11,354
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what the hell this idiot's talking about.

973
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:12,775
[SPEAKER_04]: You were doing the solo run when we did it.

974
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:15,529
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you weren't here.

975
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:17,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody ran outside and decided to rape the ice cream man.

976
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Then what does that have to do with me?

977
01:07:21,232 --> 01:07:21,732
[SPEAKER_19]: You missed it.

978
01:07:22,313 --> 01:07:24,034
[SPEAKER_19]: You didn't get to join in on the fun.

979
01:07:24,634 --> 01:07:25,875
[SPEAKER_19]: I was... You got here.

980
01:07:26,295 --> 01:07:27,155
[SPEAKER_24]: The black sheep.

981
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:28,636
[SPEAKER_24]: He was the one that was left out.

982
01:07:28,976 --> 01:07:30,617
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just saying that because I'm black.

983
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:36,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't make me cornroll your hair, dammit.

984
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:41,183
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is the love of Step Squad here.

985
01:07:43,365 --> 01:07:43,805
[SPEAKER_20]: And he left.

986
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,221
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a comment from the chat room right now.

987
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:47,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Mmm, raping and ice cream.

988
01:07:52,142 --> 01:07:55,223
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope not.

989
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:56,324
[SPEAKER_19]: We have this on tape.

990
01:08:01,545 --> 01:08:03,846
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the real world, Step Squad edition.

991
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:08,887
[SPEAKER_04]: On a closing note, Jamie, I'm waiting for Jay's birthday so we can roll up to Sacramento.

992
01:08:09,107 --> 01:08:10,128
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having rum jello.

993
01:08:12,628 --> 01:08:13,949
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this innocent look you're giving?

994
01:08:15,013 --> 01:08:18,054
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to make some jello shots.

995
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:19,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

996
01:08:19,754 --> 01:08:20,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, where's Brad?

997
01:08:20,915 --> 01:08:22,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's his 21st birthday today, by the way.

998
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:27,316
[SPEAKER_19]: Brad's out playing 2DX, I guess, but... Happy birthday, Brad!

999
01:08:27,456 --> 01:08:28,776
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to make jello shots for him, too.

1000
01:08:28,956 --> 01:08:29,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, oh yes, back to the interviews.

1001
01:08:29,937 --> 01:08:31,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I'll go.

1002
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:32,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1003
01:08:32,577 --> 01:08:37,259
[SPEAKER_24]: If everybody pitches him a dollar, I will cornroll Khan's leg.

1004
01:08:38,559 --> 01:08:38,839
[SPEAKER_24]: Here.

1005
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:41,260
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a nice little rose.

1006
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,080
[SPEAKER_24]: It's pretty.

1007
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:42,920
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh.

1008
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,930
[SPEAKER_19]: How?

1009
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:54,678
[SPEAKER_15]: He doesn't have... What was that?

1010
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:55,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Run away!

1011
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,561
[SPEAKER_22]: We have another absentee.

1012
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:02,523
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you heard it here first on Orange Lodge Radio.

1013
01:09:03,023 --> 01:09:03,284
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay.

1014
01:09:04,985 --> 01:09:05,805
[SPEAKER_22]: That was weird.

1015
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:08,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Our thoughts exactly.

1016
01:09:11,735 --> 01:09:13,337
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what you get when you get sleep deprived people.

1017
01:09:17,492 --> 01:09:19,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I should delete it out of the silence, but I didn't want to.

1018
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:21,715
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the second interview for Orange Lounge Radio.

1019
01:09:22,355 --> 01:09:25,718
[SPEAKER_20]: And go ahead and, you know, state your name, no nickname.

1020
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:27,739
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel like I'm about to fall asleep.

1021
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I had actually taken a nap outside.

1022
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:34,143
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Jamie doing NPR Orange Lounge.

1023
01:09:34,183 --> 01:09:34,824
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what this is.

1024
01:09:34,864 --> 01:09:36,685
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the NPR edition of Orange Lounge.

1025
01:09:36,785 --> 01:09:40,188
[SPEAKER_22]: I had already taken, like, a ten minute nap outside in one of the lounge chairs.

1026
01:09:40,288 --> 01:09:41,308
[SPEAKER_07]: A ten whole minutes?

1027
01:09:41,488 --> 01:09:41,909
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

1028
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:44,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Idea for our listeners?

1029
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:49,243
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, Liz, I usually go by Santoki on message boards and such.

1030
01:09:50,284 --> 01:09:51,304
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're visiting from where?

1031
01:09:51,964 --> 01:09:56,766
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, actually, I live in California, but I'm on summer vacation from school in Seattle.

1032
01:09:58,647 --> 01:10:00,707
[SPEAKER_25]: And you've been with Step Squad for how long?

1033
01:10:01,688 --> 01:10:04,349
[SPEAKER_25]: Since March of 2001.

1034
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:07,450
[SPEAKER_25]: Before there was DDR.

1035
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:11,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, before it was all over the place anyway, I guess.

1036
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:15,407
[SPEAKER_25]: That's been like four years at least.

1037
01:10:15,887 --> 01:10:20,890
[SPEAKER_22]: It has to be more than that because I was living in Alabama when I first knew you online.

1038
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:23,191
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh my god, memories.

1039
01:10:26,413 --> 01:10:28,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have any words to say for listeners?

1040
01:10:29,715 --> 01:10:30,856
[SPEAKER_22]: What's your DDR experience?

1041
01:10:32,034 --> 01:10:35,195
[SPEAKER_25]: My DDR experience isn't really that much.

1042
01:10:36,355 --> 01:10:42,617
[SPEAKER_25]: I used to just play for fun, but I haven't actually been on a machine in a year or so.

1043
01:10:43,218 --> 01:10:50,780
[SPEAKER_25]: But I usually play for fun when friends are around, but I haven't competed in tournaments or anything.

1044
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,761
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have any other favorite games?

1045
01:10:54,181 --> 01:10:55,161
[SPEAKER_25]: No, not really.

1046
01:10:55,421 --> 01:10:57,322
[SPEAKER_25]: Usually puzzle games, actually.

1047
01:10:58,562 --> 01:11:00,283
[SPEAKER_22]: So do you have any final words for the listeners?

1048
01:11:02,406 --> 01:11:03,367
[SPEAKER_25]: No, not really.

1049
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:04,187
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

1050
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:05,748
[SPEAKER_22]: Go to college.

1051
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:06,289
[SPEAKER_22]: All of you.

1052
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:07,770
[SPEAKER_22]: You're illiterate.

1053
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:11,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Get an education because it's very important.

1054
01:11:11,273 --> 01:11:13,194
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't spend your whole life playing games.

1055
01:11:14,115 --> 01:11:14,515
[SPEAKER_20]: I can.

1056
01:11:15,056 --> 01:11:19,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow!

1057
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:20,840
Whoa.

1058
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,041
[SPEAKER_15]: The end.

1059
01:11:22,481 --> 01:11:23,722
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the last interview.

1060
01:11:24,223 --> 01:11:25,083
[SPEAKER_07]: What's all this then?

1061
01:11:25,264 --> 01:11:26,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Just leftovers.

1062
01:11:26,124 --> 01:11:26,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

1063
01:11:28,721 --> 01:11:30,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything in here?

1064
01:11:30,022 --> 01:11:31,823
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, this is everyone trying to say goodbye.

1065
01:11:31,843 --> 01:11:36,425
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, this is the goodbye.

1066
01:11:39,367 --> 01:11:40,508
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, Orange Lounge.

1067
01:11:41,028 --> 01:11:45,290
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Sapporo was good, and Orange Lounge kicks ass, and you should listen to it.

1068
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:51,374
[SPEAKER_27]: SSF, RTF, Mountain Mike's, ASS, and fucking Nazi.

1069
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:54,936
[SPEAKER_03]: All I have to say is,

1070
01:11:55,865 --> 01:11:58,966
[SPEAKER_03]: If Orange Lounge starts playing Fozzy, I'd have to hurt someone.

1071
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:00,506
[SPEAKER_03]: That will not happen.

1072
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:02,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank the gods.

1073
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:06,328
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

1074
01:12:06,468 --> 01:12:09,248
[SPEAKER_25]: Play more Orange Lounge songs, like every day, all the time.

1075
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:10,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we do.

1076
01:12:10,969 --> 01:12:11,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes!

1077
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:15,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and that brings an end to Jamie's interviews.

1078
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Very random, but very cool.

1079
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for getting that for us, Jamie.

1080
01:12:19,691 --> 01:12:20,631
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

1081
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,012
[SPEAKER_22]: I took a nice long nap when I got home.

1082
01:12:26,033 --> 01:12:26,873
[SPEAKER_07]: She's okay now.

1083
01:12:26,913 --> 01:12:31,016
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're worried about Jamie, she's eating a couple donuts and she's got the sugar back in her.

1084
01:12:31,076 --> 01:12:31,776
[SPEAKER_07]: She's okay now.

1085
01:12:31,836 --> 01:12:37,880
[SPEAKER_22]: It's too bad I didn't record Jessica and I singing Absolute on the way home.

1086
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:42,223
[SPEAKER_22]: We were in full Katimu style.

1087
01:12:43,294 --> 01:12:47,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I was singing a little bit of Summer Vacation there when somebody on one of the tapes there mentioned Summer Vacation.

1088
01:12:49,918 --> 01:12:53,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, yeah, my horrible impression of Summer Vacation.

1089
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to get those vocals, that guy doing the vocal version of Dropout and all that stuff.

1090
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to get that sometime, play it on the show.

1091
01:12:58,864 --> 01:12:59,204
[SPEAKER_07]: We got them?

1092
01:12:59,604 --> 01:13:00,565
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, get them for us.

1093
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember they were on some website, but they're probably archived by now.

1094
01:13:03,527 --> 01:13:04,087
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, cool.

1095
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:06,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1096
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:08,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about this.

1097
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:13,582
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be an interesting interview I thought you all would be interested in hearing about.

1098
01:13:14,163 --> 01:13:17,023
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from Metropolis Magazine.

1099
01:13:17,123 --> 01:13:18,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Metropolis, I'm sorry.

1100
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:22,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a great career in radio ahead of me, don't I?

1101
01:13:23,805 --> 01:13:25,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob is very edumacated.

1102
01:13:26,606 --> 01:13:28,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I dropped out of college.

1103
01:13:28,286 --> 01:13:29,166
[SPEAKER_29]: Look at me now.

1104
01:13:29,246 --> 01:13:30,026
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a star.

1105
01:13:30,526 --> 01:13:32,267
[SPEAKER_29]: So smart, SMRT.

1106
01:13:34,195 --> 01:13:37,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Team Smart, SMRT for live, yo!

1107
01:13:37,977 --> 01:13:39,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooked on phonics, worked for Rob.

1108
01:13:40,059 --> 01:13:41,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, SMRT, let me think.

1109
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:47,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Sacramento, Metro Office, Radio Talent.

1110
01:13:48,103 --> 01:13:48,544
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

1111
01:13:49,504 --> 01:13:51,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Sacramento, Metro Office, Radio Talent.

1112
01:13:51,746 --> 01:13:52,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Smart.

1113
01:13:53,727 --> 01:13:54,507
[SPEAKER_11]: SMRT.

1114
01:13:54,567 --> 01:13:55,768
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a real fart spiller.

1115
01:13:56,248 --> 01:13:56,408
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1116
01:13:56,468 --> 01:13:57,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, fart filler.

1117
01:14:03,192 --> 01:14:03,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, boy.

1118
01:14:04,793 --> 01:14:07,614
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got an... Brad!

1119
01:14:08,114 --> 01:14:09,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday, Brad.

1120
01:14:09,514 --> 01:14:10,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad, come here.

1121
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:11,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Come here.

1122
01:14:14,015 --> 01:14:15,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, we're going to get to that in a minute.

1123
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to give Brad his birthday spankings?

1124
01:14:19,976 --> 01:14:21,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Irene, let's administer those birthday spankings.

1125
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:22,216
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on air.

1126
01:14:22,737 --> 01:14:23,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1127
01:14:24,597 --> 01:14:25,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Bend over, baby.

1128
01:14:27,638 --> 01:14:28,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And close your eyes.

1129
01:14:28,478 --> 01:14:29,438
[SPEAKER_07]: It might hurt a little bit.

1130
01:14:32,664 --> 01:14:33,605
[SPEAKER_28]: Back up to the camera.

1131
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:34,345
[SPEAKER_28]: Beep, beep, beep.

1132
01:14:34,366 --> 01:14:35,446
[SPEAKER_28]: Can everybody see?

1133
01:14:35,506 --> 01:14:39,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have... Okay, spanking, spanking.

1134
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:44,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's great radio, alright.

1135
01:14:44,273 --> 01:14:44,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Ready?

1136
01:14:44,633 --> 01:14:45,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

1137
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:45,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, he's 21.

1138
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:46,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here we go.

1139
01:15:01,425 --> 01:15:06,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, ah, ooh, hey, hey, ow, ow, why?

1140
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Why me?

1141
01:15:09,112 --> 01:15:10,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God, no.

1142
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:16,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't get it.

1143
01:15:16,339 --> 01:15:17,059
[SPEAKER_07]: You like it at home.

1144
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we were at 21 by now.

1145
01:15:23,743 --> 01:15:25,523
[SPEAKER_07]: and 1 million to grow on.

1146
01:15:25,543 --> 01:15:27,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, alright, alright.

1147
01:15:27,704 --> 01:15:29,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Brad's starting to like this.

1148
01:15:29,644 --> 01:15:31,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I was so close, I was.

1149
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:31,985
[SPEAKER_10]: You can stop.

1150
01:15:32,685 --> 01:15:33,886
[SPEAKER_10]: You can stop grabbing me yet.

1151
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,467
[SPEAKER_11]: She'll spank the monkey later.

1152
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:38,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa!

1153
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:39,968
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that comment?

1154
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:41,568
[SPEAKER_07]: She'll spank the monkey later.

1155
01:15:42,268 --> 01:15:42,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys leaving?

1156
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:45,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, have fun at food.

1157
01:15:45,489 --> 01:15:46,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you guys are coming back?

1158
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:46,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1159
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:48,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys going to Dairy Queen?

1160
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:51,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the chicken strip thing.

1161
01:15:52,262 --> 01:15:53,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll share yours.

1162
01:15:53,662 --> 01:15:55,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, yeah, great radio, huh?

1163
01:15:55,303 --> 01:15:56,023
[SPEAKER_22]: Totally derailed.

1164
01:15:56,443 --> 01:15:57,843
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yes, interview.

1165
01:15:58,143 --> 01:15:58,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

1166
01:15:59,724 --> 01:16:01,764
[SPEAKER_07]: From Metrolopis Magazine.

1167
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Metrolopis.

1168
01:16:05,305 --> 01:16:06,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Papadopolis Magazine.

1169
01:16:07,705 --> 01:16:10,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't those the neighbors on Three's Company?

1170
01:16:10,506 --> 01:16:11,446
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was Webster.

1171
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:12,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Webster.

1172
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:17,227
[SPEAKER_21]: The Papadopoli.

1173
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:20,528
[SPEAKER_07]: This show's never going to get on track, I'm sorry.

1174
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:24,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to find an actual Paula Terry song to play in the background.

1175
01:16:24,273 --> 01:16:25,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I found one, yay.

1176
01:16:25,574 --> 01:16:27,515
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an interview with Paula Terry.

1177
01:16:28,015 --> 01:16:30,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and this is about life in Japan.

1178
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:38,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, for those who don't know Paula Terry, she's the singer that likes to torture us all in her DDR music.

1179
01:16:38,942 --> 01:16:40,383
[SPEAKER_22]: She can't hold a key.

1180
01:16:43,305 --> 01:16:45,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear, uh, where are you from, Paula Terry?

1181
01:16:46,753 --> 01:16:48,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Sydney, Australia Sydney, Australia

1182
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And what brought you to Japan?

1183
01:17:06,441 --> 01:17:08,663
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was in Sydney, I had friends who lived here.

1184
01:17:08,903 --> 01:17:12,266
[SPEAKER_06]: At the time, I had the travel age.

1185
01:17:12,726 --> 01:17:14,988
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was a child, I lived in France for four years.

1186
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:19,991
[SPEAKER_06]: So at that stage of my life, back in Sydney, I felt I wanted to travel again.

1187
01:17:20,392 --> 01:17:23,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I wanted to know anything about Japan.

1188
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I met these girls who had worked holidays in Japan.

1189
01:17:28,237 --> 01:17:28,798
[SPEAKER_06]: They worked in...

1190
01:17:29,602 --> 01:17:34,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Clubs and you come up to them and say, well, you're a singer.

1191
01:17:34,486 --> 01:17:36,207
[SPEAKER_06]: They have foreign singers in these clubs.

1192
01:17:36,728 --> 01:17:38,529
[SPEAKER_06]: You can give me a visa and make money.

1193
01:17:38,669 --> 01:17:39,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not work in Japan?

1194
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:44,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went out and took the risk and I've been here ever since.

1195
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:45,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's really nice, Paula.

1196
01:17:45,955 --> 01:17:47,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now doing Paula's voice.

1197
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:48,677
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question will be Jamie.

1198
01:17:49,558 --> 01:17:51,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody can do Paula's voice on one question.

1199
01:17:51,259 --> 01:17:51,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do this.

1200
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:52,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Jamie.

1201
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:53,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Paula.

1202
01:17:56,523 --> 01:17:57,704
[SPEAKER_07]: How long have you been singing?

1203
01:17:58,896 --> 01:18:04,051
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, my brother's an opera singer, and my brother's, like, a classical guitarist.

1204
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:05,856
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm from the musical family!

1205
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:12,186
[SPEAKER_22]: I love singing from being a little girl, but I really only started out to learn it when I was 16.

1206
01:18:13,888 --> 01:18:15,509
[SPEAKER_22]: And I skipped a line.

1207
01:18:15,549 --> 01:18:15,969
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you got it.

1208
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:18,591
[SPEAKER_22]: And my mother sent me an opera singing teacher.

1209
01:18:18,932 --> 01:18:21,554
[SPEAKER_22]: I love opera, but it wasn't for me.

1210
01:18:22,454 --> 01:18:24,696
[SPEAKER_22]: When I was 20, I decided to study jazz singing.

1211
01:18:24,956 --> 01:18:26,237
[SPEAKER_22]: I really love funky jazz music.

1212
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:28,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, play that funky jazz music, white girl.

1213
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:29,620
[SPEAKER_22]: I love other funky things, too.

1214
01:18:31,502 --> 01:18:35,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now doing the voice of Paula will be Mel B. So, um...

1215
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:38,201
[SPEAKER_07]: How long have you been boinking Naoki?

1216
01:18:38,983 --> 01:18:41,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

1217
01:18:44,593 --> 01:18:45,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do you sing, Paula?

1218
01:18:47,063 --> 01:18:53,125
[SPEAKER_26]: permanent booking at the Intercontinental Hotel on Tokyo Bay on Thursdays and Fridays from 7.30 p.m.

1219
01:18:53,205 --> 01:18:54,145
[SPEAKER_26]: to 11 p.m.

1220
01:18:54,685 --> 01:18:56,286
[SPEAKER_26]: I sing accompanied by a penis.

1221
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:01,587
[SPEAKER_26]: It's great.

1222
01:19:01,647 --> 01:19:02,488
[SPEAKER_26]: We play everything.

1223
01:19:02,648 --> 01:19:09,109
[SPEAKER_26]: Then on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I play in a Ginza at a piano ball, which is a totally different style, a slightly older audience.

1224
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:11,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's doing Paula's voice next?

1225
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Melody, you pooper.

1226
01:19:15,023 --> 01:19:15,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're back to Matt.

1227
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:16,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1228
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:18,365
[SPEAKER_07]: What sort of things do you sing, Paula?

1229
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:22,688
[SPEAKER_07]: My repertoire goes from 30s to the 90s.

1230
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:24,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you've been smoking, Paula.

1231
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:33,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to keep up with the times.

1232
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:38,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently, everywhere I worked, people were requesting some songs from Titanic.

1233
01:19:38,318 --> 01:19:40,340
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to buy the CD and learn it.

1234
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I also sing to carpenters.

1235
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:44,671
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't try to imitate the originals.

1236
01:19:45,272 --> 01:19:48,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I try to sing them in a different style.

1237
01:19:48,834 --> 01:19:49,475
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be key.

1238
01:19:50,856 --> 01:19:52,457
[SPEAKER_09]: To keep myself interested.

1239
01:19:52,757 --> 01:19:55,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I also really sing the standard jazz tunes like Summertime.

1240
01:19:56,019 --> 01:19:58,721
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do that in any number of styles.

1241
01:19:59,322 --> 01:19:59,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1242
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:02,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Next, Jamie doing Paula's voice again.

1243
01:20:02,704 --> 01:20:04,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Paula, are you planning to stay in Japan?

1244
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:09,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here, yes.

1245
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:13,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, yeah, uh, I guess.

1246
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,060
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I am.

1247
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:24,902
[SPEAKER_21]: I just finished recording of my first CD, which comes out September 2-3.

1248
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:29,403
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called, uh... Just Break Away.

1249
01:20:30,703 --> 01:20:31,883
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, what's that mean?

1250
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:39,225
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I'm going to wait around and see how well that does.

1251
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,424
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm very pleased with it.

1252
01:20:43,165 --> 01:20:49,790
[SPEAKER_21]: If it goes well, I'll stay longer in the United States.

1253
01:20:51,152 --> 01:20:52,773
[SPEAKER_29]: Anything is possible in Japan.

1254
01:20:52,793 --> 01:20:54,635
[SPEAKER_29]: It's an incredible place.

1255
01:21:00,396 --> 01:21:06,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Waking up with a bit of a hangover, having a bad hair day, and not being able to blend into the background.

1256
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:09,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I just can't seem to be inconspicuous.

1257
01:21:09,859 --> 01:21:16,461
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be half paranoia, but I often feel that people are staring at me.

1258
01:21:16,901 --> 01:21:18,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god, you sounded like Vera.

1259
01:21:19,902 --> 01:21:22,063
[SPEAKER_22]: Like from In Living Color.

1260
01:21:23,283 --> 01:21:24,103
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

1261
01:21:24,183 --> 01:21:25,324
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so embarrassed.

1262
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:31,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Paula, do you organize your CDs alphabetically?

1263
01:21:32,127 --> 01:21:33,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely not.

1264
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:34,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I favor total disorder.

1265
01:21:35,171 --> 01:21:36,752
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all in piles on the floor.

1266
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:38,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a drawback full of CDs.

1267
01:21:38,735 --> 01:21:43,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't play them often, but the ones that I like best are the ones in the piles.

1268
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we actually going to do this whole interview here?

1269
01:21:45,182 --> 01:21:47,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if we can find some interesting questions here.

1270
01:21:49,907 --> 01:21:50,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this one.

1271
01:21:51,269 --> 01:21:52,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's like a game show.

1272
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:55,872
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to spend the rest of your life trapped on the Yamanote line.

1273
01:21:56,332 --> 01:21:59,634
[SPEAKER_07]: You're allowed to take one book, one CD, and one luxury item.

1274
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:00,414
[SPEAKER_07]: What would they be?

1275
01:22:02,655 --> 01:22:03,956
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I need tampons.

1276
01:22:06,037 --> 01:22:07,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I need Naoki's hat.

1277
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:17,904
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to record a CD of my favorite songs.

1278
01:22:19,031 --> 01:22:23,616
[SPEAKER_22]: from Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, right up to the 90s, the brand new heavies.

1279
01:22:23,736 --> 01:22:24,517
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, that's a good group.

1280
01:22:24,537 --> 01:22:24,958
[SPEAKER_22]: She has taste.

1281
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, uh... Let's do this one here.

1282
01:22:31,884 --> 01:22:32,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Last question, last question.

1283
01:22:33,226 --> 01:22:37,050
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the weirdest thing you've ever seen or experienced in Japan, Politary?

1284
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:41,595
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of weird things have happened to me here, but one thing in particular comes to mind.

1285
01:22:41,996 --> 01:22:45,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I was told this story by a friend who worked in a hostess club where I was singing.

1286
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:49,004
[SPEAKER_06]: The hostesses were all blonde, gaging, and they said...

1287
01:22:49,584 --> 01:22:51,545
[SPEAKER_06]: That there was one man... Whatever!

1288
01:22:51,986 --> 01:22:52,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Go fuck yourself!

1289
01:22:53,747 --> 01:23:02,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so they were saying that there was this one man who used to come in and beg them to sell a piece of their pubic hair for 10,000 yen per piece.

1290
01:23:03,053 --> 01:23:10,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So these girls would go in and use the toilets and pluck hair out of the heads and rub it until they were curly and looked authentic.

1291
01:23:10,677 --> 01:23:12,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they would come back and sell it.

1292
01:23:13,019 --> 01:23:14,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Paula, you're so clever!

1293
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:22,903
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I don't want to really go into this thing with me and, uh, Naoki, but, uh, let's just say I'm sitting on his tuffet there.

1294
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, actually, he, well, yeah, my tuffet and, uh, yeah, there's some definite tuff, uh, touchy in there and stuff, and... Okay, I'm gonna go now.

1295
01:23:35,332 --> 01:23:36,273
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you!

1296
01:23:36,493 --> 01:23:39,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, look over here.

1297
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:45,471
[SPEAKER_07]: And on that note, I think we need to take a break and let this show try to find its life again.

1298
01:23:45,591 --> 01:23:49,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we'll be back.

1299
01:23:50,232 --> 01:23:50,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

1300
01:23:51,372 --> 01:23:54,652
[SPEAKER_07]: The chat room is just kind of, I can feel that blink from the chat room.

1301
01:23:54,672 --> 01:23:55,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Just blink, blink, blink, blink.

1302
01:23:56,273 --> 01:23:58,113
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck are these people doing?

1303
01:23:58,773 --> 01:24:01,514
[SPEAKER_07]: My speakers are crying right now.

1304
01:24:02,814 --> 01:24:04,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go Kmart and get me some bitches.

1305
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:05,234
[SPEAKER_06]: You are my destiny!

1306
01:24:05,255 --> 01:24:07,675
[SPEAKER_06]: You are my destiny!

1307
01:24:10,615 --> 01:24:17,172
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take a quick break, do a request that I saw in the chat room last break, and another little fun song, and we'll be right back.

1308
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:49,168
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can be my my my my

1309
01:25:22,307 --> 01:25:51,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Honey, what we call love I still don't think of you at first My family still comes above If you wanna capture me It's as simple as can be Mr. Lennon said it, all you need is Mr. Lennon said it, all you need is Mr. Lennon said it, all you need is Love, my love, my love, my love, my love My love, my love, my love, my love

1310
01:27:02,386 --> 01:27:03,471
[SPEAKER_14]: and all that is.

1311
01:29:31,174 --> 01:29:32,196
Thanks for watching!

1312
01:30:03,354 --> 01:30:05,196
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1313
01:30:55,475 --> 01:31:00,299
[SPEAKER_15]: From Step Squad to Orange Labs, this DDR sucks!

1314
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:03,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!

1315
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:30,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we were looking at the, somebody wanted to see the statistics for the station during the break.

1316
01:31:30,225 --> 01:31:30,905
[SPEAKER_07]: We were taking a look.

1317
01:31:31,626 --> 01:31:38,931
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot more listeners in Japan recently, so a big hello to our friends overseas in Japan who started the addiction and it looks like we're just finishing it.

1318
01:31:39,852 --> 01:31:44,756
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's any truth to those rumors that DDR is dying in Japan, but somebody must still love it over there.

1319
01:31:44,876 --> 01:31:49,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess 2DX is a very big game over there still, as well as Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, very big.

1320
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Still, from what we hear.

1321
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, I guess we don't really know.

1322
01:31:52,941 --> 01:32:01,865
[SPEAKER_07]: But if anybody over there wants to email us, if you can write in English, because I don't know much Japanese, but if you do send Japanese... Many people in Japan know English very well.

1323
01:32:02,145 --> 01:32:03,465
[SPEAKER_07]: It's required learning for school.

1324
01:32:03,705 --> 01:32:11,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, if they're going to understand me giving the email address, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, give us a holler about what DDR and the Belmonte scene is like over there.

1325
01:32:11,608 --> 01:32:12,309
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd love to hear about it.

1326
01:32:12,749 --> 01:32:13,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm being brought food.

1327
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:14,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that lovely?

1328
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:15,730
[SPEAKER_22]: It is great.

1329
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:20,834
[SPEAKER_24]: So anyways, since you're eating and you're eating, I guess I could do the sim scene update.

1330
01:32:37,622 --> 01:32:38,202
[SPEAKER_20]: Some update.

1331
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:38,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1332
01:32:39,663 --> 01:32:39,963
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1333
01:32:40,043 --> 01:32:43,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, we actually have some new versions of stuff out there.

1334
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:48,987
[SPEAKER_10]: As you probably remember from my FU message of the week, DWI 203.

1335
01:32:49,627 --> 01:32:50,307
[SPEAKER_10]: It's brand new.

1336
01:32:50,668 --> 01:32:53,349
[SPEAKER_10]: There is one feature, though, I absolutely love in it.

1337
01:32:53,709 --> 01:32:59,071
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the fact that every time you rebuild your song list, it exports a HTML file with your entire song list.

1338
01:32:59,591 --> 01:33:05,194
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I can actually update my song list and post it so people can see how many damn songs I actually have, which is...

1339
01:33:06,014 --> 01:33:08,276
[SPEAKER_10]: 1,218 right now.

1340
01:33:10,478 --> 01:33:14,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Chatroom is saying, Slinky in the chatroom says, Stepmania Max 3 is coming out tomorrow.

1341
01:33:14,661 --> 01:33:18,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's BS or what, but... Why would Slinky lie to us?

1342
01:33:18,604 --> 01:33:19,185
[SPEAKER_07]: He loves us.

1343
01:33:19,265 --> 01:33:25,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but I play... Actually, though, I have to give props to Stepmania because it saved my party last night.

1344
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:33,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Because since... For some reason, I don't know what it is, but some versions of DWI, they don't work my pads, and they don't work with...

1345
01:33:35,157 --> 01:33:36,959
[SPEAKER_10]: with my visualizations in the background.

1346
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:47,172
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had to find something to work with my pads, and luckily I had a beta 6 of Step Mania 5, I believe, or 3 or whatever, and it worked, and it worked well.

1347
01:33:47,553 --> 01:33:48,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I was very pleased.

1348
01:33:48,955 --> 01:33:51,478
[SPEAKER_10]: So we played on Step Mania all last night, and it was awesome.

1349
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:56,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, DDRPC, two new characters have been released.

1350
01:33:56,479 --> 01:33:58,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Our fourth set of new characters.

1351
01:33:59,021 --> 01:34:00,002
[SPEAKER_10]: No pantsless rage?

1352
01:34:00,742 --> 01:34:01,803
[SPEAKER_10]: No pantsless rage.

1353
01:34:03,265 --> 01:34:04,385
[SPEAKER_21]: No three-titted at me.

1354
01:34:04,966 --> 01:34:09,750
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Rico and... Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

1355
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:12,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, some chick, I don't know.

1356
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:13,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Rico and some chick.

1357
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:16,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Rico and his hoe, okay.

1358
01:34:16,896 --> 01:34:17,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1359
01:34:18,801 --> 01:34:23,203
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that was that, and they have like white hair and look stupid, whatever.

1360
01:34:23,643 --> 01:34:25,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's some new stuff there.

1361
01:34:25,483 --> 01:34:26,404
[SPEAKER_08]: We go not so sloppy.

1362
01:34:27,304 --> 01:34:30,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, um... We go ugly.

1363
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, let's see, uh... Sylvia.

1364
01:34:34,926 --> 01:34:36,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, Sylvia is ho.

1365
01:34:36,747 --> 01:34:37,687
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same thing.

1366
01:34:38,808 --> 01:34:40,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, Sylvia, yes.

1367
01:34:41,088 --> 01:34:43,889
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um... See, last night, party.

1368
01:34:44,289 --> 01:34:45,350
[SPEAKER_10]: That was very fun.

1369
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:45,690
[SPEAKER_07]: We got...

1370
01:34:47,096 --> 01:34:49,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about your little party while I shove chicken strips in my mouth.

1371
01:34:49,797 --> 01:34:50,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1372
01:34:50,437 --> 01:34:52,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I had a party last night for my birthday.

1373
01:34:52,037 --> 01:34:53,978
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I had a little Beemani party there.

1374
01:34:54,018 --> 01:34:54,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Got to play on the Sim.

1375
01:34:55,698 --> 01:35:00,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the popular songs there were Break Your Neck from Busta Rhymes.

1376
01:35:01,139 --> 01:35:02,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Peanut Butter Jelly, the baseball band.

1377
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Peanut Butter Jelly.

1378
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,580
[SPEAKER_10]: They loved that remix from Tourney Mix 2.

1379
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:07,741
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty good.

1380
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:08,061
[SPEAKER_10]: No, wait.

1381
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:08,901
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's not Tourney Mix 2.

1382
01:35:08,941 --> 01:35:10,641
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something else.

1383
01:35:10,661 --> 01:35:11,581
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, it's out there.

1384
01:35:12,642 --> 01:35:13,442
[SPEAKER_10]: There was also...

1385
01:35:14,682 --> 01:35:15,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I voted a poop.

1386
01:35:40,323 --> 01:35:40,903
[SPEAKER_22]: Whoopie on that!

1387
01:35:41,223 --> 01:35:41,864
[SPEAKER_22]: Big pile of the PCs.

1388
01:35:41,944 --> 01:35:50,707
[SPEAKER_10]: So I assume that since Tourney Mix 2 has been judging for about, well, close to a couple weeks now, that pretty soon we'll have results of who won that.

1389
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:53,147
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't... No, I guess look for that.

1390
01:35:54,908 --> 01:35:55,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie won.

1391
01:35:57,009 --> 01:35:57,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

1392
01:35:58,849 --> 01:36:01,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways... I have the update from the other room.

1393
01:36:02,831 --> 01:36:03,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1394
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:05,731
[SPEAKER_22]: I owned everybody in Tekken 4, thank you.

1395
01:36:05,852 --> 01:36:07,072
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I just owned Dave.

1396
01:36:08,752 --> 01:36:09,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Big Cans Part 2

1397
01:36:30,545 --> 01:36:31,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, something like that.

1398
01:36:31,826 --> 01:36:32,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Big hands part two.

1399
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,810
[SPEAKER_10]: See, other than that, some news, well, just some reminders.

1400
01:36:37,351 --> 01:36:41,234
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like Team Guilo, their site's coming up October 1st, so look for that.

1401
01:36:41,314 --> 01:36:48,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, I'm not sure what their actual address is going to be, because Team Guilo got bought up by some guy.

1402
01:36:48,559 --> 01:36:49,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1403
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,703
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing there, but they bought the domain name, so who knows for that.

1404
01:36:53,023 --> 01:36:55,485
[SPEAKER_10]: DWI, Insane... Okay, that's my FU of the week.

1405
01:36:55,845 --> 01:36:57,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to Cyber Squatters.

1406
01:36:57,286 --> 01:36:58,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that shit.

1407
01:36:59,861 --> 01:37:03,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they've got a valid use for the name Team Guilo, they shouldn't be allowed to buy that domain name.

1408
01:37:04,382 --> 01:37:08,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Julia Roberts needs to take them to court because she got her domain name and she knows how to do it.

1409
01:37:08,903 --> 01:37:09,163
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

1410
01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:09,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1411
01:37:10,384 --> 01:37:15,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, DWI Insanity is going to be coming back up probably later this week.

1412
01:37:15,245 --> 01:37:19,646
[SPEAKER_10]: They said one or two weeks about a week ago, so I guess we can look for that.

1413
01:37:20,066 --> 01:37:22,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty much it for now.

1414
01:37:25,327 --> 01:37:25,627
[SPEAKER_20]: Whee!

1415
01:37:26,608 --> 01:37:27,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have gold.

1416
01:37:27,228 --> 01:37:27,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1417
01:37:29,841 --> 01:37:31,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Freestyle Fridays

1418
01:37:47,762 --> 01:37:52,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't freestyle very well at all, so I haven't been paying too much attention to this, but I said I'd go watch sometime.

1419
01:37:52,764 --> 01:37:57,747
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess a bunch of the good freestylers in town trying to get together and just have some fun little challenges and things like that.

1420
01:37:58,047 --> 01:38:00,268
[SPEAKER_07]: What are some fun ways to get people together?

1421
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:02,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it have to be scheduled things?

1422
01:38:02,769 --> 01:38:05,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Could it just be everybody just kind of convening at one place?

1423
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:06,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the bar cheers?

1424
01:38:06,610 --> 01:38:11,112
[SPEAKER_22]: We used to have our big gathering when we were trying to unlock stuff on Max 2 before they put in the code.

1425
01:38:11,253 --> 01:38:11,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh, true.

1426
01:38:12,113 --> 01:38:14,214
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, which pissed me and a bunch of people off.

1427
01:38:15,171 --> 01:38:19,074
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, that was something that got the community together, was that common goal.

1428
01:38:19,114 --> 01:38:25,279
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, there's other Max 2 machines where people don't know how the machines work well enough to put in the code, I guess, if you're, you know, retarded.

1429
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:35,408
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, there's all kinds of, you know, there's mini tourneys, there's our, you know, every so often bit money party that people randomly throw at random houses.

1430
01:38:37,249 --> 01:38:39,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you guys going to any fun parties in the Bay Area?

1431
01:38:39,431 --> 01:38:40,572
[SPEAKER_07]: What do they do in the Bay Area?

1432
01:38:40,652 --> 01:38:42,193
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of get-togethers do you guys do over there?

1433
01:38:42,554 --> 01:38:44,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we know we do it here in SAC, but...

1434
01:38:45,485 --> 01:38:49,473
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, you know, at Scandia over by Susan Valley or wherever it is.

1435
01:38:49,873 --> 01:38:51,837
[SPEAKER_29]: They have their Friday Night Fever and, I mean...

1436
01:38:52,538 --> 01:39:00,883
[SPEAKER_29]: Even people like RTF from the Bay Area, a lot of them, Friday nights, they make the roadie up there because the freestyle pod over there is so intense out there.

1437
01:39:00,903 --> 01:39:03,264
[SPEAKER_29]: It's such, things are really picking up over there.

1438
01:39:03,645 --> 01:39:18,754
[SPEAKER_29]: As far as get-togethers, I guess, for people like RTF Steps, well, we've gotten to a point where we like doing stuff, not just in B-Mind, we like doing sports stuff, like we either have to take a game of basketball or we'll have a big football game, which we are actually coming up, which is coming up soon, I think in early October.

1439
01:39:19,634 --> 01:39:24,117
[SPEAKER_29]: No, it's a fun thing to just throw people around instead of stepping on arrows, you know.

1440
01:39:25,678 --> 01:39:28,680
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked the whole bowling thing from last Sunday.

1441
01:39:29,841 --> 01:39:30,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1442
01:39:30,741 --> 01:39:33,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other fun get-togethers you guys have been to that have been Bomani-related?

1443
01:39:35,287 --> 01:39:36,628
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1444
01:39:58,738 --> 01:39:59,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

1445
01:40:16,613 --> 01:40:18,296
[SPEAKER_07]: and just make sure there's no drama.

1446
01:40:19,177 --> 01:40:21,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody that's going to cause drama in your group, get them out.

1447
01:40:21,821 --> 01:40:29,292
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, why don't they just do like, that'd be pretty cool, is, you know, they have like hacker conventions and conventions for everything.

1448
01:40:29,472 --> 01:40:30,494
[SPEAKER_10]: What about BimaniCon?

1449
01:40:32,589 --> 01:40:33,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this is a good topic.

1450
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:37,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Why hasn't there been a big national Bomani convention yet, do you think?

1451
01:40:37,592 --> 01:40:42,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's because the tournaments kind of take care of that on a smaller scale, so there's no need or desire for something national?

1452
01:40:43,214 --> 01:40:56,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's just because the Bomani audience is mostly, now I know just about all of us, in fact, yes, all of us in this room are an exception, but the Bomani community is largely a high school base, which can't really afford to take the time to travel out of town for a weekend.

1453
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,021
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think the reasons are behind that?

1454
01:40:58,061 --> 01:41:00,763
[SPEAKER_22]: First and foremost, I've been going to conventions for seven years now.

1455
01:41:00,783 --> 01:41:01,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-huh.

1456
01:41:02,003 --> 01:41:02,443
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.com

1457
01:41:25,269 --> 01:41:32,835
[SPEAKER_22]: You couldn't do, I think, a convention on just Beimani alone without, you know, without having it Beimani Plus.

1458
01:41:33,596 --> 01:41:47,547
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, as far as a convention setting goes, I mean, it's not like you can sit there and watch, you know, go to a room and watch, you know, movies of people playing DDR or, you know, like you have movie rooms at anime sci-fi conventions or... You'd have a room that's like, oh my gods, meet Jason Enos and Mel B. Yeah.

1459
01:41:52,109 --> 01:41:54,680
[SPEAKER_29]: I think my importance level has just shot down 60 notches.

1460
01:41:57,573 --> 01:42:07,719
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think for Baymani alone, as far as a convention setting, that it would be enough.

1461
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:11,421
[SPEAKER_22]: You could maybe have your little small get-together.

1462
01:42:12,302 --> 01:42:21,146
[SPEAKER_22]: If it was something associated with, say, the release of a new game, something press-related, that might draw a crowd, I think.

1463
01:42:21,727 --> 01:42:24,168
[SPEAKER_22]: But you couldn't have BaymaniCon every year.

1464
01:42:24,208 --> 01:42:25,369
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that it would be big enough.

1465
01:42:26,286 --> 01:42:31,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well then maybe they can, instead of just Bomani, have like an amusing music gaming convention or something like that.

1466
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:40,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Because then you have Bomani stuff, you've got, you know, the Pump It Up, Parappa, all the music games, you know, Parappa and all that.

1467
01:42:41,929 --> 01:42:46,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, a music gaming... I can see where a music gaming... Well, there is Classic Gaming Con that happens in Las Vegas.

1468
01:42:47,252 --> 01:42:47,973
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1469
01:42:48,173 --> 01:42:48,653
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1470
01:42:49,073 --> 01:42:51,795
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess if Classic Gaming Con can pull it off.

1471
01:42:51,815 --> 01:42:57,198
[SPEAKER_22]: But they also have the betas, the prototypes, you know, old games that were supposed to come out that never did come out.

1472
01:42:57,398 --> 01:43:02,181
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that basically anything that was coming out for Beimani has come out except for, you know, Smomics.

1473
01:43:03,542 --> 01:43:09,326
[SPEAKER_22]: The Smop one that was supposed... There was supposed to... There's a group called Smop in Japan.

1474
01:43:09,366 --> 01:43:11,247
[SPEAKER_22]: There's basically like the Japanese version of...

1475
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:15,828
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1476
01:43:31,772 --> 01:43:34,073
[SPEAKER_07]: That has to be the worst Beaumontium I've ever played.

1477
01:43:34,133 --> 01:43:37,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I like some of the music, don't get me wrong, but just the interface and everything, I didn't care for it.

1478
01:43:37,714 --> 01:43:37,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1479
01:43:38,334 --> 01:43:39,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Just want to share.

1480
01:43:39,155 --> 01:43:45,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing, since I do have all the Dreams Come True stuff and the True Kiss Destination, I have to say, all of those suck.

1481
01:43:46,817 --> 01:43:47,678
[SPEAKER_10]: They both suck.

1482
01:43:48,018 --> 01:43:49,018
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just awful.

1483
01:43:49,298 --> 01:43:51,539
[SPEAKER_10]: All their music just is very awful.

1484
01:43:51,879 --> 01:43:57,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, aside from Sexy Planet and, like, Celebrate Night, they just, they all suck.

1485
01:43:58,782 --> 01:43:59,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked Africa.

1486
01:43:59,662 --> 01:44:01,343
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one song I liked on True Kiss Destination.

1487
01:44:01,363 --> 01:44:01,843
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a cool song.

1488
01:44:01,863 --> 01:44:03,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but they've got one song called The Monster.

1489
01:44:04,364 --> 01:44:06,445
[SPEAKER_10]: The monster is coming.

1490
01:44:06,525 --> 01:44:07,785
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, like, so awful.

1491
01:44:08,746 --> 01:44:11,387
[SPEAKER_10]: But, like, yeah, OHA is pretty fun.

1492
01:44:11,647 --> 01:44:14,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but other than that, it's just crap.

1493
01:44:16,288 --> 01:44:18,349
[SPEAKER_22]: However, the beat meaning of Future Dreams Come True is pretty cool.

1494
01:44:20,205 --> 01:44:21,425
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I don't know.

1495
01:44:21,585 --> 01:44:26,506
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess maybe you could, but I'm thinking in terms of the broad spectrum of different conventions I've been to.

1496
01:44:27,367 --> 01:44:32,548
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I don't think you'd have enough to make anything larger than, you know, a one-day convention.

1497
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:35,048
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think it would be anything.

1498
01:44:35,209 --> 01:44:37,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So tournaments are pretty much as big as it's going to get.

1499
01:44:37,709 --> 01:44:38,169
[SPEAKER_17]: I think so.

1500
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:42,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we could go back to that national tournament talk, but I think we even talked about that.

1501
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:45,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think that was a talk last time Mel B was here.

1502
01:44:45,051 --> 01:44:45,591
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about that.

1503
01:44:46,983 --> 01:44:50,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, uh, probably wouldn't be big enough, unfortunately.

1504
01:44:50,085 --> 01:44:57,909
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd have to have huge prizes to entice people who want to fly all the way out to, you know, Las Vegas, uh, Bay Area, wherever you would choose to hold the tournament.

1505
01:44:57,949 --> 01:44:59,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, I don't know if it's possible.

1506
01:45:00,030 --> 01:45:04,413
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, it's not so much about incentive and prizes, but it's also, I mean, the thing a lot of people...

1507
01:45:05,453 --> 01:45:05,914
[SPEAKER_29]: and many more.

1508
01:45:19,669 --> 01:45:26,011
[SPEAKER_29]: We're quite at the level of networking where we can have a bunch of arcades all in sync, all on the same page, getting it all together.

1509
01:45:26,051 --> 01:45:34,194
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not saying it can't happen, but there's just a lot more things people overlooked that have to be taken into account for such a thing to happen.

1510
01:45:35,134 --> 01:45:39,055
[SPEAKER_22]: It would definitely take a lot of work, and I don't know that many people would be willing to do it.

1511
01:45:39,115 --> 01:45:40,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Twins got a good idea for incentive.

1512
01:45:40,576 --> 01:45:43,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Have it a strip DDR competition.

1513
01:45:43,477 --> 01:45:43,897
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll judge.

1514
01:45:44,677 --> 01:45:44,937
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll judge.

1515
01:45:48,754 --> 01:45:54,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, another suggestion to make the convention more popular was to be a Bomani slash Hentai convention.

1516
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,935
[SPEAKER_22]: That would definitely...

1517
01:45:57,614 --> 01:45:57,734
[SPEAKER_22]: S.S.R.

1518
01:45:57,754 --> 01:45:58,355
[SPEAKER_22]: Strip Strip Revolution

1519
01:46:19,487 --> 01:46:35,596
[SPEAKER_22]: I bought at least two of my, I have at least three Bin Money related products that I've purchased at Anime Expo, one of them being my second mixed step book, and a dance pad, and one of my versions of DDR, I think.

1520
01:46:35,616 --> 01:46:39,598
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it was, one of them or the other, I don't know.

1521
01:46:40,658 --> 01:46:41,919
[SPEAKER_22]: I have like a ton now, so.

1522
01:46:44,065 --> 01:46:48,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, I think we're going to take a really quick break, and then we're going to come back, and we're going to wrap up the show.

1523
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,160
[SPEAKER_22]: So... Wrap it up and what?

1524
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:55,369
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to wrap it up, and we'll be right back.

1525
01:46:56,918 --> 01:46:57,999
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we going to play in the break?

1526
01:46:58,059 --> 01:46:59,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, let's play one of your mixes.

1527
01:46:59,299 --> 01:47:00,820
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to tell me a mix you want to play?

1528
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Or not one of your mixes, but one of the mixes you brought.

1529
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:03,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1530
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,942
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to tell me which one you want to have the listeners hear?

1531
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:06,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1532
01:47:06,402 --> 01:47:08,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, what I was going to do is introduce this one.

1533
01:47:09,063 --> 01:47:11,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in Fifth Mix, they had a competition, I guess.

1534
01:47:11,444 --> 01:47:14,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't really heard much about it, for a Paranoia remix.

1535
01:47:14,645 --> 01:47:18,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And this guy who goes by the name STM won that competition.

1536
01:47:18,306 --> 01:47:23,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I happened to find his website, and he has a Piano Ambient version of Max Unlimited.

1537
01:47:23,548 --> 01:47:28,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you have to listen to the background there to fully get all of it, but you will catch some of what it is.

1538
01:47:28,571 --> 01:47:29,311
[SPEAKER_10]: But just listen to it.

1539
01:47:29,391 --> 01:47:33,113
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't sound anything like you've heard before for Maximum Limited.

1540
01:47:34,233 --> 01:47:35,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here we go.

1541
01:47:36,634 --> 01:47:36,954
Music

1542
01:48:15,586 --> 01:48:16,268
Thanks for watching!

1543
01:49:05,962 --> 01:49:07,243
Thanks for watching!

1544
01:49:51,966 --> 01:49:53,447
Thank you for watching!

1545
01:50:44,063 --> 01:50:45,785
Thank you for watching!

1546
01:52:05,618 --> 01:52:09,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo Demends It

1547
01:52:11,048 --> 01:52:12,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 12.

1548
01:52:12,929 --> 01:52:14,669
[SPEAKER_07]: When are we going to have Bongo back on this show?

1549
01:52:14,909 --> 01:52:16,650
[SPEAKER_22]: Whenever Bongo's not working on a Sunday.

1550
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:18,550
[SPEAKER_22]: I better talk to my man.

1551
01:52:19,471 --> 01:52:20,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Let Bongo have the day off.

1552
01:52:20,711 --> 01:52:22,432
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of got a lot of reaction in the showroom.

1553
01:52:22,452 --> 01:52:23,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of some mixed reaction.

1554
01:52:24,092 --> 01:52:27,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Majorly positive for the Max Unlimited.

1555
01:52:27,914 --> 01:52:28,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, a career in radio.

1556
01:52:29,034 --> 01:52:29,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Far ahead for me.

1557
01:52:30,995 --> 01:52:31,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1558
01:52:32,235 --> 01:52:34,276
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sacramento Metropolis Radio.

1559
01:52:34,296 --> 01:52:35,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the co-host.

1560
01:52:35,156 --> 01:52:35,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't shut up.

1561
01:52:36,996 --> 01:52:37,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Smirked.

1562
01:52:39,763 --> 01:52:41,244
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of mixed reactions in the chatroom.

1563
01:52:42,904 --> 01:52:44,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of mostly positive.

1564
01:52:45,645 --> 01:52:47,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of depressing though, don't you think?

1565
01:52:47,606 --> 01:52:49,827
[SPEAKER_07]: That song was kind of, I don't know, the way it was.

1566
01:52:49,907 --> 01:52:51,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I just feel like throwing myself off.

1567
01:52:51,428 --> 01:52:54,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Max Unlimited is depressing enough as it is because I can't pass it.

1568
01:52:54,629 --> 01:52:56,830
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, well, I can't on basic.

1569
01:52:59,902 --> 01:53:02,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Even in the chatroom, they said, Orange Lounge made me sad today.

1570
01:53:03,043 --> 01:53:03,863
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sorry.

1571
01:53:04,303 --> 01:53:04,883
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.

1572
01:53:05,203 --> 01:53:07,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Just remember, little Miss Muffet sat on the tuffet.

1573
01:53:07,604 --> 01:53:09,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Now she has HIV.

1574
01:53:11,185 --> 01:53:11,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's my red?

1575
01:53:13,325 --> 01:53:14,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just commenting in the middle of that.

1576
01:53:14,505 --> 01:53:18,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny because Mel B was sitting here reading scripture during that little passage.

1577
01:53:18,766 --> 01:53:21,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to share a little bit of that with us here, Mel?

1578
01:53:21,407 --> 01:53:25,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to share some of your voiceover talent with the Max song?

1579
01:53:30,899 --> 01:53:32,961
[SPEAKER_29]: Follow the light at the end of the tunnel.

1580
01:53:32,981 --> 01:53:33,861
[SPEAKER_29]: Do not resist.

1581
01:53:34,502 --> 01:53:35,463
[SPEAKER_29]: You shall be saved.

1582
01:53:35,643 --> 01:53:36,523
[SPEAKER_29]: Not.

1583
01:53:37,984 --> 01:53:41,507
[SPEAKER_29]: They'll be... 9 o'clock, I guess.

1584
01:53:43,769 --> 01:53:45,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Very pretty, thank you.

1585
01:53:47,151 --> 01:53:49,353
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of like the 5-9 piano version.

1586
01:53:49,453 --> 01:53:50,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have an amen!

1587
01:53:50,394 --> 01:53:50,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Woot!

1588
01:53:52,936 --> 01:53:54,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you play it this way, please?

1589
01:53:57,093 --> 01:54:04,395
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of like the 5ix9ine piano version we have in rotation on the Bomani Music and More program, which is always playing on the station when we're not here.

1590
01:54:04,455 --> 01:54:06,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty sad remix of that, too.

1591
01:54:06,316 --> 01:54:08,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So is Bomani getting all depressed?

1592
01:54:08,397 --> 01:54:10,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the angsty phase?

1593
01:54:10,717 --> 01:54:13,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the suicidal goth phase of Bomani?

1594
01:54:13,538 --> 01:54:15,939
[SPEAKER_22]: It will stay angsty as long as Politary keeps singing.

1595
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:21,001
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody will want it to slit their wrists after listening to her.

1596
01:54:22,458 --> 01:54:26,101
[SPEAKER_22]: At least we have Silhouette of My Mind, and that makes me happy in a sad and a gothy way.

1597
01:54:26,362 --> 01:54:29,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Silhouette of My Mind, another little slit your wrist song there from Imani.

1598
01:54:30,045 --> 01:54:32,347
[SPEAKER_22]: That is a happy song if you listen to the lyrics.

1599
01:54:32,387 --> 01:54:36,110
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's a happy song, but it sounds really... But I'm happy being all by myself.

1600
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:37,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy being sad.

1601
01:54:39,673 --> 01:54:41,615
[SPEAKER_22]: I am quite enthusiastically upset.

1602
01:54:44,597 --> 01:54:45,338
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway...

1603
01:54:46,095 --> 01:54:48,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I guess that's it.

1604
01:54:48,216 --> 01:54:49,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we're going to wrap up the show now.

1605
01:54:50,756 --> 01:54:52,917
[SPEAKER_07]: So, any final thoughts from everybody here in the room?

1606
01:54:55,278 --> 01:54:55,938
[SPEAKER_22]: I have donuts.

1607
01:54:56,278 --> 01:54:56,818
[SPEAKER_07]: You have donuts.

1608
01:54:56,878 --> 01:54:57,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.

1609
01:54:57,599 --> 01:54:58,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt, Loki.

1610
01:55:00,219 --> 01:55:01,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like Politary.

1611
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:03,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither do I. It's okay.

1612
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:04,061
[SPEAKER_07]: She scares me.

1613
01:55:04,361 --> 01:55:05,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley, you have anything to say?

1614
01:55:05,381 --> 01:55:07,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1615
01:55:08,082 --> 01:55:08,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1616
01:55:10,327 --> 01:55:12,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Special guest Mel B, anything you want to say?

1617
01:55:13,349 --> 01:55:16,150
[SPEAKER_29]: I had no idea DJ Konami sounded like Dick Vitale.

1618
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:17,851
[SPEAKER_29]: Either way, I think he's dope.

1619
01:55:19,312 --> 01:55:19,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.

1620
01:55:20,012 --> 01:55:22,774
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sharks Girl, Mel D, anything you want to say to our listeners?

1621
01:55:23,134 --> 01:55:23,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Yawn.

1622
01:55:24,055 --> 01:55:24,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Yawn.

1623
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:28,957
[SPEAKER_24]: I've driven like 280, 300 miles today so far.

1624
01:55:28,977 --> 01:55:30,158
[SPEAKER_24]: I still have to drive home.

1625
01:55:30,178 --> 01:55:31,559
[SPEAKER_07]: You got two more hours to go.

1626
01:55:33,059 --> 01:55:34,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to drive tomorrow.

1627
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to drive to Frisco tomorrow, so that'll be fun.

1628
01:55:37,142 --> 01:55:37,362
[SPEAKER_20]: Wee!

1629
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:41,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, um, what else?

1630
01:55:41,921 --> 01:55:44,884
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one other quick thing I wanted to say before the show was over, and now it's slipped my mind.

1631
01:55:45,364 --> 01:55:45,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.

1632
01:55:45,944 --> 01:55:46,965
[SPEAKER_22]: It's slit your mind?

1633
01:55:46,985 --> 01:55:54,671
[SPEAKER_29]: I actually had a quick comment on someone who wrote something about glow sticks and ghosts being in a freestyle routine.

1634
01:55:54,711 --> 01:55:54,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1635
01:55:55,211 --> 01:56:06,780
[SPEAKER_29]: Funny enough, I don't know if I mentioned this before, but when I was at an Omaha freestyle tourney back in April 20th of earlier this year, someone did do a glow stick routine with ghosts, and funny enough, he failed within 15 seconds.

1636
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:09,802
[SPEAKER_29]: Somewhere, I believe, justice was served.

1637
01:56:11,723 --> 01:56:12,863
[SPEAKER_29]: That's kind of sad in a way.

1638
01:56:13,204 --> 01:56:19,607
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm still not sure that anything involving lights and DDR is going to top Fuzzy Hat with candles on Healing Vision.

1639
01:56:20,387 --> 01:56:22,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And the number 420, either.

1640
01:56:25,329 --> 01:56:27,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops, I gotta switch CDs here real fast.

1641
01:56:27,290 --> 01:56:27,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody fill.

1642
01:56:29,051 --> 01:56:31,132
[SPEAKER_22]: Fill, fill, filler, fiddler, fiddler, fiddler.

1643
01:56:31,152 --> 01:56:31,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's Phil?

1644
01:56:35,074 --> 01:56:35,995
[SPEAKER_22]: Bimani is cool.

1645
01:56:36,035 --> 01:56:36,495
[SPEAKER_22]: Keep playing.

1646
01:56:38,419 --> 01:56:38,639
[SPEAKER_22]: Right?

1647
01:56:40,361 --> 01:56:41,922
[SPEAKER_24]: This DDR sucks!

1648
01:56:41,962 --> 01:56:43,203
[SPEAKER_07]: That really bugs me.

1649
01:56:43,403 --> 01:56:44,264
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in joy.

1650
01:56:44,464 --> 01:56:45,084
[SPEAKER_29]: Why aren't you?

1651
01:56:46,165 --> 01:56:47,767
[SPEAKER_22]: We expect you a nice play again.

1652
01:56:49,528 --> 01:56:54,332
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, new from Konami, the Politary sings the classics.

1653
01:56:55,453 --> 01:56:55,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yes.

1654
01:56:56,754 --> 01:57:01,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Such wonderful... Such wonderful songs.

1655
01:57:06,301 --> 01:57:07,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Move!

1656
01:57:07,543 --> 01:57:08,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Move!

1657
01:57:09,185 --> 01:57:10,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them move!

1658
01:57:12,569 --> 01:57:14,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, that's... Shine Get!

1659
01:57:16,495 --> 01:57:18,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's an appropriate note to end the show on.

1660
01:57:18,417 --> 01:57:19,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Shine Get!

1661
01:57:19,398 --> 01:57:19,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Shine Get!

1662
01:57:19,999 --> 01:57:21,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for listening, everybody.

1663
01:57:21,681 --> 01:57:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.

1664
01:57:24,082 --> 01:57:27,064
[SPEAKER_30]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1665
01:57:27,604 --> 01:57:30,766
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1666
01:57:31,406 --> 01:57:38,951
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

1667
01:57:39,451 --> 01:57:43,073
[SPEAKER_30]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1668
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:57,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
